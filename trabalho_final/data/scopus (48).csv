Security in WSN is becoming critical with the emergence of applications that require mechanisms for authenticity, integrity and confidentiality. Due to resource constraints in WSN, matching public key cryptosystems (PKC) for these networks is an open research problem. Recently a new PKC based on quasigroups multivariate quadratic. Experiments performed show that MQQ performed in less time than existing major PKC, so that some articles claim that has MQQ speed of a typical symmetric block cipher. Considering features promising to take a new path in the difficult task of providing wireless sensor networks in public key cryptosystems. This paper implements in nesC a new class of public key algorithm called Multivariate Quadratic Quasigroup. This implementation focuses on modules for encryption and decryption of 160-bit MQQ, the modules have been implemented on platforms TelosB and MICAz. We measured execution time and space occupied in the ROM and RAM of the sensors. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Implementation of Modules Encryption and Decryption; Multivariate Quadratic Quasigroup; Wireless Sensor Network","Encryption and decryption; Execution time; Multivariate quadratics; Public key algorithms; Public key cryptosystems; Quasigroup; Research problems; Resource Constraint; Symmetric block ciphers; Wireless sensor; Public key cryptography; Random access storage; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650614168

The vacuum discharger and the vacuum interrupter differ significantly in the rate of electric strength recovery, size of electrode erosion and etc. This is due to the difference in the type of the discharge. In the report considered we suggested that to align these values the current I should be closed through the spark gap prior to moving the electrodes of the vacuum interrupter; at this its value is above the initial by ΔI (ΔI-current, ΔI/I0 ∼5÷10•10 -2). The excess ΔI-current flows through the vacuum interrupter, but in the reverse direction. In the course of moving the electrodes apart, the ΔI-current falls to zero with a time constant t=L/R, where L and R are the inductance of the contour (vacuum interrupter- spark gap) and resistance of the discharge of the discharge gap, respectively. This makes it possible to quickly recover the electric strength of the gap between the contacts, substantially reduce the electrode erosion and significantly decrease the breaking voltage of the ΔI-current. At the final stage the discharge of the countercurrent battery recovers the vacuum strength of the discharge gap. Such method of current breaking allows for the effective interruption of direct currents of high power. The method was developed in terms of the combination current breaker (vacuum interrupter and plasma opening switch). Spark gap is replaced to mobile plasma gap in design of combination opening switch.

Recently, some authentication schemes with user anonymity for the GLOMONET have been proposed. This paper shows some weaknesses in those schemes. As the main contribution of this paper, a secure and lightweight user authentication scheme with anonymity is presented. It mainly uses low-cost functions such as one-way hash functions and exclusive- OR operations to achieve security. Having these features, it is more suitable for the energy-limited mobile devices. In addition, the home agent only needs to receive one message and send one message to authenticate the mobile user. Therefore, this protocol enjoys both computation and communication efficiency as compared to the well-known authentication schemes. Besides, it is demonstrated that the proposed scheme enjoys important security attributes such as preventing the various kinds of attacks, single registration, user anonymity, user friendly, no password/verifier table, no synchronized time mechanisms, high efficiency in password authentication, use of one-time session key between mobile user and foreign agent, etc. Furthermore, one of the new features in our proposal is: it is secure in the case that the information stored in the smart card is disclosed but the user password of the smart card owner is unknown to the adversary. © 2010 IEEE.",,"Authentication scheme; Communication efficiency; Exclusive-OR; Foreign agents; Global mobility network; High efficiency; Home agents; Mobile users; One way hash functions; Password authentication; Security attributes; Session key; Storage resources; User anonymity; User authentication protocols; User authentication scheme; User friendly; Cost functions; Global system for mobile communications; Hash functions; Information systems; Mobile devices; Network protocols; Security of data; Smart cards; Authentication",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650493958

The purpose of the BESS is to support the frequency in autonomous microgrids (MG) based on renewable energy sources. Moreover, many times it has to share the reactive and nonlinear loads, thus controlling the voltage shape and value. Furthermore, it has to be able to provide the short circuit current needed for a classical protection system. Two main topologies are of interest and one of them is found optimal. An active power decoupling circuit (APDC) is added to it in order to attenuate the current ripple of twice the grid frequency, which inevitable appears in single-phase systems and it circulates through the battery, which worsens its performances in time. A new control structure for the APDC is developed, including a current harmonic compensation in the case of nonlinear load sharing of the BESS.

This paper proposes a new multilevel topology based on current source power cells. The resulting topology has similar and improved features compared to their counterparts voltage sources, among which is the possibility of using conventional low-voltage semiconductors, null dv/dt, and more importantly, small DC-link inductors. Also, it includes the ability to regenerate without any additional control scheme. © 2010 IEEE.",,"Additional control; Conventional topologies; Dc-link; Electrical motors; High quality; High-voltage operation; Low-voltage semiconductors; Medium voltage; Multi-level; On currents; Power cells; Power rates; Storage component; Supply currents; Voltage source; Industrial applications; Industrial electronics; Industry; Magnetic couplings; Magnetic storage; Topology; DC power transmission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650333633

For manufacturing and reliability issues, solid electrolytes are preferred instead of liquid electrolytes. Here, a solid-state, polyanionic proton conducting electrolyte, poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PSS:H), is demonstrated for the first time as an effective ion conducting electrolyte medium in SCs with electrodes based on carbon nanotube (CNT) networks. The effect of the ionic conductivity in the PSS:H film of those SCs is studied at different levels of relative humidity (RH) with impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. High capacitance values (85 F g-1 at 80% RH) are obtained for these SCs due to the extremely high effective electrode area of the CNTs and the enhanced ionic conductivity of the PSS:H film at increasing RH level. The charging dynamics are primarily limited by the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte rather than a poor contact between the electrolyte and the CNT electrodes. The use of polyelectrolytes in SCs provides high mechanical strength and flexibility, while maintaining a high capacitance value, enabling a new generation of printable solid-state charge storage devices. A solid-state, polyanionic proton conducting electrolyte, poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PSS:H), is demonstrated as an effective ion conducting electrolyte medium in carbon nanotube-based supercapacitors. High capacitance values are achieved for these supercapacitors, due to the high effective electrode area of the carbon nanotubes. As a result of the enhanced ionic conductivity of the PSS:H film with increasing humidity level, the capacitance increases with the humidity level (85 F g-1 at 80% RH).

Adding new features or error fixes requires reprogramming nodes. Manually reprogramming hundreds or thousands of nodes is impractical as it takes significant effort and time. Therefore, WSNs require a mechanism for updating the nodes program image, which contains the applications and protocols running on each node. Current protocols for updating program images rely on a large external memory that is used to temporary store program images. In this paper we present the design, implementation and experimental measurements of a lightweight and reliable Program Image Dissemination Protocol (PIDP) for autonomous adhoc multihop WSNs. PIDP requires no external memory storage, is independent of the WSN stack, offers a low overhead protocol for transferring program images, and can reprogram the whole WSN stack. An update procedure with PIDP in one part of the network does not interfere with the WSN elsewhere. PIDP was implemented on a node platform with an 8-bit 2 MIPS Microchip PIC18LF8722 microcontroller and a 2.4 GHz Nordic Semiconductors nRF24L01 radio. PIDP requires less than 7 kilobytes of program memory and from 22 to 815 bytes of data memory. In experiments PIDP reprogrammed a campus WSN, which is a running deployment of 178 nodes, in 5 hours. ©2010 IEEE.","Dissemination protocol; Reprogramming; Wireless sensor networks","Data memory; Dissemination protocols; Experimental measurements; External memory; Low energies; Low overhead; Multihop; Multihop wireless; Program memory; Reprogramming; Resource constrained nodes; Wireless sensor; Application specific integrated circuits; Network protocols; Plasma waves; Programmable logic controllers; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650220767

The need for additional converters can be eliminated if the grid side inverter can itself be effectively used as the interface for energy storage. This paper therefore proposes a technique whereby the grid side inverter can also be used as an interface to connect a supercapacitor energy storage for wind energy conversion systems. The proposed grid side inverter is formed by cascading a 3-level inverter and a 2-level inverter through a coupling transformer. The three-level inverter is the main inverter and it is powered by the rectified output of the wind turbine coupled AC generator while the 2- level auxiliary inverter is connected to the super capacitor bank that is used to compensate short term power fluctuations. Novel modulation and control techniques are proposed to address the problems associated with non-integer and dynamically-changing dc-link voltage ratio, which is caused by the random nature of wind.

This paper describes the phenomenon of Ca(OH)2 superheating, also referred to as superheated dehydration (SD). The potential of an attrition-free lime reactivation process using this phenomenon is also investigated. Attrition rates of the sorbent are measured when a reactivation step using steam hydration is implemented every three carbonation/calcination cycles. It has been shown that the presence of CO2 during the dehydration step reduces attrition during subsequent cycles. Experiments performed in a small fluid bed reactor show that the presence of 40-100% CO 2 during the dehydration step increases the initiation temperature of the decomposition of Ca(OH)2 from 445 to 618 °C. The thermodynamic equilibrium water vapor pressure for the dehydration reaction at 618 °C is 516 kPa, whereas no water vapor was detected in the reactor during the dehydration step before the temperature reached 618 °C. Under these circumstances it is proposed that the Ca(OH)2 is in a nonequilibrium ""superheated state"". A CO2 capture cycling experiment, with a reactivation step every three carbonation/calcination cycles, maintained an average activity of 60%, creating only 3.25% of fines &lt; 150 μm after 28 carbonations. The reactivation step consisted of hydrating the sorbent at a temperature of 270 °C and dehydrating it in 100% CO2 with a 23 min hold at 520 °C. It is proposed that the SD phenomenon may be a key step in the development of an industrially feasible method of lime reactivation for use in CO2 capture and in thermal energy storage applications. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Attrition rate; Carbonation/calcination cycle; Dehydration reactions; Fluid-beds; Free lime; Initiation temperature; Non equilibrium; Reactivation process; Steam hydration; Superheated state; Thermodynamic equilibria; Calcium; Dewatering; Fluidization; Heat storage; Hydration; Lime; Sorption; Steam; Temperature; Water vapor; Dehydration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650140663

A wide metabolic plasticity can be found among CAM species regarding the type of storage carbohydrate, organic acid accumulated at night and decarboxylating system. Consequently, many aspects of the CAM pathway control are still elusive while the impact of this photosynthetic adaptation on nitrogen metabolism has remained largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated a possible link between the CAM cycle and the nitrogen assimilation in the atmospheric bromeliad Tillandsia pohliana by simultaneously characterizing the diel changes in key enzyme activities and metabolite levels of both organic acid and nitrate metabolisms. The results revealed that T. pohliana performed a typical CAM cycle in which phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase phosphorylation seemed to play a crucial role to avoid futile cycles of carboxylation and decarboxylation. Unlike all other bromeliads previously investigated, almost equimolar concentrations of malate and citrate were accumulated at night. Moreover, a marked nocturnal depletion in the starch reservoirs and an atypical pattern of nitrate reduction restricted to the nighttime were also observed. Since reduction and assimilation of nitrate requires a massive supply of reducing power and energy and considering that T. pohliana lives overexposed to the sunlight, we hypothesize that citrate decarboxylation might be an accessory mechanism to increase internal CO2 concentration during the day while its biosynthesis could provide NADH and ATP for nocturnal assimilation of nitrate. Therefore, besides delivering photoprotection during the day, citrate might represent a key component connecting both CAM pathway and nitrogen metabolism in T. pohliana; a scenario that certainly deserves further study not only in this species but also in other CAM plants that nocturnally accumulate citrate. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.","Citric acid; Crassulacean acid metabolism; Epiphyte; Nitrate reductase","citric acid; nitrate reductase; article; metabolism; Tillandsia; Citric Acid; Nitrate Reductase; Tillandsia; Crassulaceae; Tillandsia; Tillandsia pohliana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149409633

They can modify the thermal properties of buildings to bring cooling energy conservation and improve human comfort. This study evaluates the thermodynamic transmission in the green roof ecosystem under different vegetation treatments. Our model simulation is based on the traditional Bowen ratio energy balance model (BREBM) and a proposed solar radiation shield effectiveness model (SEM). The BREBM investigates energy absorption of different components of radiation, and the SEM evaluates the radiation shield effects. The proposed model is tested and validated to be efficient to simulate solar energy transmission in green roofs, with some major findings. Firstly, the solar radiation transmission processes might be considered as free vibration motion. Daytime positive heat storage of the green roof is 350-520W·m-2 on an hourly basis. Nighttime or afternoon negative value registers a rather constant magnitude of -60W·m-2. Daily net average is positive around 155-210W·m-2. Secondly, solar radiation vibration is highly correlated with plant structure. The canopy reflectance and transmittance are strongly correlated (R2=0.87). The multi-layer shrub treatment has the highest shield effectiveness (0.34), followed by two-layer groundcover (0.27), and single-layer grass (0.16). Green roof vegetation absorbs and stores large amounts of heat to form an effective thermal buffer against daily temperature fluctuation. Vegetated roofs drastically depress air temperature in comparison with bare ground (control treatment). Finally, the thermodynamic model is relatively simple and efficient for investigating thermodynamic transmission in green roof ecosystem, and it could be developed into a broad solar radiant land cover model. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Cooling effect; Green roof ecosystem; Multi-layer shield; Radiation shield effectiveness model; Solar radiation; Thermodynamic transmission","Air temperature; Artificial structures; Bare grounds; Bowen ratio energy balances; Canopy reflectance; Constant magnitude; Cooling effects; Cooling energy; Daily temperatures; Energy transmission; Free vibration; Green roof; Groundcover; Highly-correlated; Human comforts; Land cover; Model simulation; Negative values; Plant structures; Radiation shield; Radiation shield effectiveness model; Radiation transmission; SEM; Single layer; Thermal buffers; Thermal properties; Thermodynamic model; Two layers; Vegetated roof; Computer simulation; Cooling; Ecosystems; Heat storage; Historic preservation; Radiation effects; Radiation shielding; Roofs; Solar radiation; Sun; Thermodynamic properties; Vegetation; Solar energy; absorption; artificial ecosystem; Bowen ratio; canopy reflectance; cooling; energy conservation; heat transfer; roof; solar radiation; thermodynamic property; transmittance; vegetation cover; vegetation structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957893935

Combining sensor networks with artificial intelligence and pattern recognition is envisaged to deliver smart application to end-users. In this paper, a new distributed energy efficient pattern recognition approach is proposed to first depict events of interest as patterns and then detect the occurrence of events of interest, namely: the Voting with Random Node Selection (VRNS) approach. Sensor nodes may leverage their processing and storage capabilities by collectively handling sensory data to translate local sensory information of individual sensor nodes into meaningful results that depict the global status of the environment. In contrast to classical pattern recognition approaches, the VRNS approach operates within the constrained sensor network's resources and infrastructures. Instead of utilising the entire sensor network, events of interest are recognised by employing an arbitrary sample of sensor nodes. The results show that the VRNS approach is capable of prolonging the longevity of the network's lifetime, recognising event patterns effectively, and avoiding over-utilisation hotspots in the network. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","distributed detection; energy conservation; lifetime; pattern recognition; voting; Wireless sensor networks","Arbitrary samples; Constrained sensors; Distributed detection; Distributed energies; End-users; Energy efficient; Event pattern; Event recognition; Hotspots; lifetime; Node selection; Physical world events; Sensory data; Sensory information; Smart applications; Storage capability; voting; Wireless sensor; Constrained sensors; Distributed detection; Distributed energies; Lifetime; Physical world events; Sensory information; Smart applications; Voting; Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Energy conservation; Pattern recognition; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication equipment; Data handling; Digital storage; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Next generation networks; Pattern recognition; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649874466

For a composite of TiO2 anatase and solid acid CsHSO4, the strong enhancement of the ionic conductivity at the nanoscale also can be assigned to this space-charge effect. Surprisingly high hydrogen concentrations in the order of 1021 cm-3 in TiO2 are measured, which means that about 10% of the available sites for H+ ions are filled on average. Such high concentrations require a specific elaboration of the space-charge model that is explicitly performed here, by taking account of the large occupation numbers on the exhaustible sites. It is shown that ionic defects with negative formation enthalpy reach extremely high concentrations near the interfaces and throughout the material. By performing first-principles density functional theory calculations, it is found that proton insertion from CsHSO4 into the TiO2 particles is preferred compared to neutral hydrogen atom insertion and indeed that the formation enthalpy is negative. Moreover, the average proton fractions in TiO2, estimated by the theoretical ionic density profiles, are in good agreement with the experimental observations. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

The Brazilian hydro power system is formed by hundreds of reservoirs capable of multi-year storage capacity. Historically, this has been measured in the Brazilian Power System in terms of the duration of the critical period, which in turn is obtained from optimization models that calculate the firm energy (FE) of hydroelectric systems. These models, however, only represent the hydroelectric system explicitly and do not take into account the synergy between hydro and thermal plants. This synergy can be an important aspect in defining the storage capacity of the hydrothermal system.

This paper presents a new approach to solve the economic dispatch in smart grids. The proposed methodology for resource management involves two stages. The first one considers fuzzy set theory to define the natural resources range forecast as well as the load forecast.

We have further elaborated the use of dispersed Cladophora cellulose nanofibers in the production of conductive paper composites. By coating the individual Cladophora cellulose nanofibers by a 50 nm thick layer of polypyrrole one can obtain an electrode material useful both in all-polymer energy storage devices and in current-controlled ion-exchange membranes. When used in energy storage devices, one can obtain mechanically flexible, lightweight, thin energy storage devices featured with ultra-fast charge-discharge rates and large charge capacity. The latter are thanks to the inherent large surface area of the composite as well as unique nanostructure of composite nanofibers. The described electrode material shows great promise for developing novel paper-based all-polymer batteries and supercapacitors.",,"Cellulose nanofibers; Charge capacities; Cladophora; Composite nanofibers; Current-controlled; Electrode material; Energy storage devices; Global environmental problems; Green alga; Large surface area; Native cellulose; Polymer battery; Super capacitor; Thick layers; Ultra-fast; Cellulose; Electric discharges; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytic capacitors; Energy storage; Flywheels; Ion exchange; Ion exchange membranes; Nanofibers; Nanostructures; Polypyrroles; Storage (materials); Algae",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649552215

The western Danish power system, which is currently the grid area in the world that has the largest share of wind power in its generation profiles and may represent the future of electricity markets in some ways, is chosen as the studied power system in this paper. Two kinds of BESS, based on polysulfide-bromine (PSB) and vanadium redox (VRB) battery technologies, are studies in the paper. Simulation results show, that the proposed optimal operation strategy is an effective measure to achieve maximum profits of the BESS. The results also show that it will take longer time to return the original investment of the VRB battery.

The types of upcoming renewable and low-carbon generation technologies are being preferred for such systems depending on their availability and economic viability in these countries. Moreover, HPSs are also being preferred in order to improve the overall energy efficiency of the system and to get a judicious generation mix which would minimize the operating cost of the system.

Based on their approach the evaporation models were ranked in five classes, respectively the Bowen ratio energy budget (BREB) approach, three energy-aerodynamic based methods, a mass transfer method, two temperature and five solar radiation-temperature approaches. State dependent parameter models were used to estimate the sensitivity indices of the different evaporation estimation methods at daily and monthly frequencies. A drastic reduction in the cost of the sensitivity analysis was obtained when coupled with efficient sampling methods, producing quasi-Monte Carlo sequences (Latin Hypercube samples). Analysis of the sensitivity indices (Si) revealed that the energy and advective parameters (Qx and Qv) in the Bowen ratio energy budget method most strongly affect evaporation estimates. The most sensitive parameters for the energy-aerodynamic methods (Penman, Priestley-Taylor and the deBruin-Keijman methods) are the change in heat storage (Qx) and solar radiation. For the other methods the most sensitive parameters were solar radiation, air temperature and vapour pressure, but with lower sensitivities. After investigation of the first and second-order sensitivity indices, it was found that the first-order sensitivity indices capture more than 90% of the total variance of the evaporation estimates. Interactions between input parameters were found limited with a maximum contribution to variance of less than 3.3% for daily frequency and less than 8.5% for the monthly frequency. Results indicated that many parameters in the 12 evaporation models could be fixed without appreciably affecting the output of these models. This helped to reduce the computational load of these models. The uncertainty results show that the Dalton group is subject to the highest error. The overall uncertainty ranged from 9% (BREB method) to 15% (mass transfer method) of the mean evaporation rate. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Energy budget; Evaporation; Nasser Lake; Sensitivity; Uncertainty","Aerodynamic methods; Air temperature; Bowen ratio; Computational loads; Efficient sampling; Energy budgets; Evaporation estimation; Evaporation model; Evaporation rate; First-order sensitivity; Input parameter; Latin hypercube samples; Nasser Lake; Prediction uncertainty; Priestley-Taylor; Quasi-Monte Carlo; Second-order sensitivity; Sensitive parameter; Sensitivity; Sensitivity indices; State-dependent parameter models; Total variance; Transfer method; Two-temperature; Uncertainty; Vapour pressures; Aerodynamics; Budget control; Evaporation; Frequency estimation; Heat storage; Lakes; Mass transfer; Monte Carlo methods; Parameter estimation; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Sun; Uncertainty analysis; aerodynamics; air temperature; Bowen ratio; energy budget; evaporation; mass transfer; Monte Carlo analysis; reaction kinetics; sampling; sensitivity analysis; solar radiation; uncertainty analysis; Egypt; Lake Nasser",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78349306403

This is of course in the light of the new climate and energy policy of the EU and shall consider the most important energy sources currently used in Europe. Neither a single current or future energy source - be it nuclear, fossil, renewables or hydrogen - nor a single support technology, such as carbon capture and storage, can alone represent the remedy to cope with the challenges of increasing energy demand, increasing levels of greenhouse gas emissions and increasing dependence on fuel supply from outside Europe. However, the different sources and related technologies can effectively complement each other. Nuclear power should thus be seen in combination with its alternatives. How the mixture is done in order to achieve an appropriate, ""sustainable"" energy mix depends on the resources and local conditions of each country or region. There are, nevertheless, some basic commonalities and inevitable limiting conditions related to the specificities of the use of the various sources which should form the basis of any such decision-making and which will be introduced in this article. Getting eventually to a decarbonised, non-fossil world will demand great determination, huge financial burden and true patience. But there is hope on the short- and mid-term horizons by means of effectively complementing and synchronising existing technologies, such as nuclear baseload electricity generation with other low CO2-intensive sources, e.g. some of the renewables. On the long-term horizon, only large-scale technological innovation will help, including advanced nuclear technologies in combination with significantly improved renewables and technologies to store energy, to largely replace fossil fuels also as power source for nonelectrical applications. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Short-term and seasonal variability of the primary resource and power demand detracts from the efficiency of these autonomous installations. In this context, hydrogen storage appears as a very attractive option to overcome this problem. From another point of view, solar energy appears as one of the most attractive renewable resources for the sustainable and green production of hydrogen via electrolysis. Currently, there are many research and technical projects oriented to the development of renewable-powered hydrogen production plants. In this context, this work focuses on an autonomous hydrogen production system basically consisting in a photovoltaic generator supplying an electrolyzer. Following the current tendency of eliminating component duplication, these devices are not connected-with dedicated power electronics-to a common DC bus, but directly through a single DC-DC converter. This converter is aimed at adjusting the output voltages of the solar array and electrolyzer in order to maximize hydrogen production. In addition to the efforts to reduce the costs of associated technologies, the development of suitable modeling techniques and high performance controllers are needed for cost-competitive hydrogen production by solar-powered electrolysis. Given the architecture and operation of solar-hydrogen power systems, the dynamic behavior can be described by a discrete dynamics that capture the different modes of operation of the system, each of them having its own continuous dynamics. In view of this hybrid structure, the hybrid system theory appears as a suitable approach to the study of the system dynamics. With this motivation, this work applies concepts of hybrid systems to the modeling, dynamic analysis and control design of a solar-hydrogen power plant. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Congress may consider options to increase the carbon stored (sequestered) in forests as it debates this and related issues. Forests are a significant part of the global carbon cycle. Plants use sunlight to convert CO2, water, and nutrients into sugars and carbohydrates, which accumulate in leaves, twigs, stems, and roots. Plants also respire, releasing CO2. Plants eventually die, releasing their stored carbon to the atmosphere quickly or to the soil where it decomposes slowly and increases soil carbon levels. However, little information exists on the processes and diverse rates of soil carbon change. How to account for changes in forest carbon has been contentious. Land use changes-especially afforestation and deforestation-can have major impacts on carbon storage. Foresters often cut some vegetation to enhance growth of desired trees. Enhanced growth stores more carbon, but the cut vegetation releases CO2; the net effect depends on many factors, such as prior and subsequent growth rates and the quantity and disposal of cut vegetation. Rising atmospheric CO2 may stimulate tree growth, but limited availability of other nutrients may constrain that growth. In this context, timber harvesting is an especially controversial forestry practice. Some argue that the carbon released by cutting exceeds the carbon stored in wood products and in tree growth by new forests. Others counter that old-growth forests store little or no additional carbon, and that new forest growth and efficient wood use can increase net carbon storage. The impacts vary widely, and depend on many factors, including soil impacts, treatment of residual forest biomass, proportion of carbon removed from the site, and duration and disposal of the products. To date, the quantitative relationships between these factors and net carbon storage have not been established. Some observers are concerned that ?leakage? will undermine any U.S. efforts to sequester carbon by protecting domestic forests. By leakage, they mean that wood supply might shift to other sites, including other countries, exacerbating global climate change and causing other environmental problems, or that wood products might be replaced by other products that use more energy to manufacture (thus releasing more CO2). Others counter that the ?leakage? arguments ignore the enormous disparity in ecological systems and product preferences, and discount possible technological solutions. Several federal government programs affect forestry practices and thus carbon sequestration. Activities in federal forests affect carbon storage and release; timber harvesting is the most controversial such activity. Federal programs also provide technical and financial help for managing and protecting private forests, and tax provisions affect private forest management. Various federal programs can also affect the extent of forested area, by supporting development (which may cause deforestation) or encouraging tree planting in open areas, such as pastures. Global climate change is a widespread and growing concern that has led to extensive international discussions and negotiations.1 Responses to this concern have focused on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, and on measuring carbon absorbed by and stored in forests, soils, and oceans. One option for slowing the rise of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and thus possible climate change, is to increase the amount of carbon removed by and stored in forests. As Congress debates climate change and options for addressing the issue, ideas for increasing carbon sequestration in forests are likely to be discussed. This report examines basic questions concerning carbon sequestration in forests. The first section provides a brief ackground on congressional interest in forest carbon sequestration. The second describes the basic carbon cycle in forests, with an overview of how carbon cycling and storage vary among different types of forests. The third section then addresses how forest carbon is considered in the global climate change debate. This third section begins with an overview of accounting for forest carbon, then discusses the carbon consequences of forest management practices, the effects of changes in land use, and ?leakage.? The section then concludes with a summary of existing federal programs that could affect forest carbon sequestration. 2. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892028069

The stored water has the potential energy that will make a special plunger pump work. The piston of this special plunger pump is designed so that high pressure (over 55 bar) can be achieved in a different way from the conventional one. Conventionally, RO plants use a high-pressure pump, powered by electricity or fossil fuel. The function of the pump is to send a flux of saline water to a group of semi-permeable membrane modules, capable of ""filtering"" the dissolved salts. In the alternative systems, here proposed, to lift water to the reservoir, the first one uses multi-bladed windmills and the second one uses wind generators that power an electric pump. To pump water to the RO membranes, the special pistons go downwards due to their own weight, and are lifted, through a system of pulleys, with a counterweight filled with water obtained from the reservoir. The technical viability of the alternatives was theoretically proven by deductions based on physics and mathematics and with a prototype. Case studies are presented and, along them, the two systems are compared based on some chosen performance parameters such as specific consumption of energy, occupied area, availability etc. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Gravitational potential energy; Reverse osmosis; Water desalination; Wind energy",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892027440

Hilendarski', Tzar Assen Str. 24, 4000 Plovdiv, Bulgaria","This chapter is a brief review of the investigations devoted to polymer film changes initiated by corona treatment and their possible applications. Polymer films, among which arepolypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polytetrafluoroethylene, are most widely used as materials for the production of stable charged films. One of the simplest and most widespread methods for charging the polymers involves the use of corona discharge in air at room temperature. The corona discharge creates high energy oxygen-containing charged particles, which are accelerated by the electric field of the corona and then interact with the surface of the polymer films. Firstly, changes in electret surfaces initiated by corona treatment, which are analyzed by XPS and an optical method, are discussed. The XPS investigations show that oxygen content in negative corona charged samples is several times higher than the ones of positive corona charged samples. The optical method of disappearing diffraction pattern is proposed to determine the surface modifications of the charged polymer films. The strongest surface modification is observed at the center of the samples and they are greatly affected by the applied corona voltage and the corona device configuration. The electric charges are mainly deposited onto the surface and do not penetrate into the sample bulk when corona charged films are formed under not very strong charging conditions (air ambient, room temperature and humidity, 5kV corona voltage).Secondly, the influence of different treatments (low pressure and low-energy laser irradiation) on charged polymer film stability and its possible applications are discussed. Thesharp surface potential decay in charged films stored under pressure lower than atmospheric down to 0.1mbar is observed. It is possible to calculate pressure at which sharp decay occurs if the initial surface potential is known. Preliminarily placing the charged films under pressure less than 1mbar can be used as a method for stabilizing the surface charge. The different surface potential decay and the relevant steady state surface potential values for charged films being under different irradiation conditions (continuous He-Ne, pulsed CuBr and quasi-continuous CO2 lasers) are revealed. These results can find applications in optical storage and processing of information as a direct registration of information on electret films using low energy lasers. Thirdly, the influence of corona treatment on holographic recording in photopolymer films is discussed. An additional inducted polarizability, which is due to an electric charging, influences the exposure characteristics and diffraction efficiency of the holographic recordings in amorphous side-chain azobenzene polymers. The additional electric corona charging seems to be a promising method for increasing both the diffraction efficiency and the sensitivity ofthe azo-polymer recording media. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Electron gun must provide high perveance electron beam with low transversal temperature and variable beam profile. The gun control electrode assembled of four separate sections will provide measurements of beam envelope along the transport section of the cooler. Displacement of corresponding part of the beam may be observed if alternating voltage is applied to each section. Collector should have high perveance, low secondary emission coefficient, and small dimensions. Wien filter is supposed to be installed before the collector to satisfy these requirements.

A dependence of the lifetime on different parameters (RF voltage, horizontal geometric and dynamic aperture, bunch current, betatron coupling value, electron energy) was analyzed. A betatron coupling regulation was recognized the easiest way to increase lifetime value at injection energy. It was done by two families of skew-quadrupole lenses.

Obtaining the energy spread less than 1% is the actual problem. In this work we consider numerically unsteady self-consistent beam dynamics in one section RF linac. For transient beam loading compensation a method of delay of a beam with respect to RF pulse is applied.

The spring is connected with the knee motor by a cable pulley system, which allows the advantageous placement of the motor in the hip joint and enables us to use a compression spring instead of a heavier torsional element. Additionally, the pulley system creates a nonlinear spring characteristic at joint level which can be shaped by altering the cable tension. This nonlinearity and the inertial effects associated with it substantially increase the effective damping in the unloaded leg and allow precise foot-placement during the flight phase. Still, damping of the loaded leg during stance phase is kept minimal for highly efficient energy recovery.",,"Compression springs; Effective damping; Energy recovery; Inertial effect; Non-linear springs; Periodic energy; Running robots; Series elastic actuations; Cables; Joints (anatomy); Mobile robots; Pulleys; Robotics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885674477

The skin is composed of three different layers: epidermis, dermis and hypodermis. The epidermis contains the stratum corneum, the uppermost layer of the epidermis, that acts as the barrier function of the skin due to its very high density and its low hydration. The dermis is an extensive vascular network providing skin nutrition, repair, thermal regulation and immune response. The hypodermis acts as a heat insulator, a shock absorber, and an energy storage region. There are also several appendages in the skin: hair follicles, sebaceous, sweat glands and nails. The skin properties play an important role to allow penetration of topically applied drugs or substances into the skin. Drug permeation through the skin include the diffusion through the intact epidermis and the skin appendages. In this chapter we reviewed structure, immunological and electrical properties, penetration routes of drugs throughout skin, types of skin and the most common skin disorders that affect humans. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

In this framework, biomass utilization has proven to be a viable alternative for energy production even though its usage is still at its infancy on a global scale. Thus, a number of critical issues for all the involved stakeholders, such as potential investors, involved regulators and decision-makers, need to be addressed systemically. One of the first challenges that hinders the increased biomass utilization for energy production is the cost of its respective logistics operations. What differentiates biomass supply chains from traditional supply chains is the importance of factors such as biomass product quality as this is dictated by the relevant energy production technology, weather related variability, localized agricultural capacity and seasonality, and stochasticity of demand. In this chapter, we present a novel methodological framework for the design and evaluation of sustainable waste biomass supply chains, taking into account the collection, storage, and transport operations for supplying facilities with organic raw materials for energy production. First, the potential of waste biomass for energy production is presented, as well as the relevant regulatory incentives, the constraints and the critical issues that have to be tackled. Moreover, the generic system components of Biomass Supply Chains (BSCs) are described in conjunction with their relevant key variables and unique characteristics. Following that, we recognize the natural hierarchy of the decision-making process and propose an integrated methodological framework that spans all levels of the hierarchy. We then map the existing research efforts within the proposed framework in order to identify gaps and overlaps. We proceed with a taxonomy of the current state of the art research, based on the relevant modeling techniques in order to identify the limitations of the existing modeling efforts. We wrap-up by discussing our conclusions in the last section. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883156442

The results presented here are for three different sites. The first site discussed is for remote non-grid application of wind energy, the second for grid application and the third for wind pump application. The economic comparison for non-grid power applications is made between diesel engine generating sets alone and wind-diesel hybrid system at the selected location. The economic cost of grid system extension is also estimated for comparison purposes. The results show that for non-grid application for the selected site the levelized cost of winddiesel system is 0.105 $/kWh comparing to 0.148 $/kWh for diesel system alone. For grid power application the study found that installing a 20 MW wind farm in Quiroon Hariti has a levelized cost of energy comparable to long-run marginal cost of open cycle gas turbines. For wind pump application the study found that the total annualized cost of installing wind pumps for irrigating a selected farm in Thumrait without and with one day water storage is $1, 368 and $2, 067 respectively.

Current energy storage technologies do not have the required capacity and powertrains are no longer efficient enough. Construction is difficult due to small size and low weight requirements.

In the case of fuel cell automobile simulation, a series connection is used to pass all the generated electricity through a traction battery rather than directly to the motor. The vehicle used is still the Volkswagen Lupo where the battery chosen is just small enough with a capacity of 1.25 MJ to perform only smoothing operations and not act like an independent power source. The lithium-ion traction battery weighs 6 kg, the motor/controller system 60 kg, and the 40 kW fuel cell system weighs 130 kg, which include hydrogen fuel onboard storage and handling, leading to a total mass of 961 kg. The performance is as good as that of the diesel Lupo and the average energy use of the fuel cell during the trip is 1.138 MJ/km, which is equivalent to 3.5 l of gasoline per 100 km. The electric vehicle used for the simulation of a battery vehicle has a range of 455 km, requiring 1,000 modules of a model lithium-ion battery, storing up to 250 MJ and weighing 1,134 kg, which is more than double the vehicle mass. The simulation finds that the best performance is ensured when the battery is never discharged below 40%. For the simulation of a hybrid vehicle, the smallest self-recharging hybrid vehicle is used, which in addition to a 20-kW fuel cell, must have a 15-MJ lithium-ion battery. The battery efficiency in this case is found to be over 90%, with the lowest values occurring during freeway accelerations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) is the one of those technologies for new energy sources. UCG is a gasification process carried on low calorific value, non mined or no minable coal seams due to the geological conditions (high fracture frequencies, volcanic, complex storage/tectonic structures). UCG process converts coal in situ into product gas (syngas) by using oxygen/steam mixture (air, enriched air, oxygen/water and carbon dioxide/oxygen). Here the coal beds react as a chemical reactor, thus gasification process is maintained underground rather than conventional gasification methods. In this process; coal, steam and oxygen are brought together to the combustion temperature for coal by adjusting the amount of oxygen carefully, the coal is not completely burned but decomposed chemically. The process is a partial oxidation rather than combustion. The resulting mixture (carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane) is UCG gas (syngas) can be used Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) configuration as a supplement and substitute fuel for electricity generation and chemical synthesis resulting in manufacturing of synthetic liquid fuel or chemicals by Fisher-Tropsch process.

Main problem in using natural gas as fuel for vehicles is low volumetric energy density of methane at room temperature. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is a solution used worldwide (more than 4 millions vehicles), but heavy and expensive cylinders have to be used for its storage at pressures about 200 bar. Adsorbed Natural Gas (ANG) can overcome issues with heavy storage systems by lowering operating pressure down to 35-40 bar. Key to the success of adsorptive storage is the choice of suitable adsorbent and operating conditions. Porous carbonaceous materials are well known as one of the best adsorbents for gases. Preparation procedure of carbonaceous adsorbents for natural gas storage is described. Based on physicochemical parameters Polish hard coal type 34.1 from KWK Marcel was selected as precursor material for adsorbents for gas storage. Four grindings were performed on selected coal and particle size distribution was determined. Fullers distribution was calculated as providing best packing of precursor material. Comparison between optimal and obtained distributions allowed to select the best way of grinding coal providing best packing of precursor material. Thermo prepared coal tar and phenol-formaldehyde resol type resin were selected as binders, thermoreological study of binders and coal-binder mixtures were performed. Granules and pastilles from coal-binders mixtures were prepared and pyrolysed. Influence of binder amount in mixtures on mechanical resistance of granules were studied.

Especially the intermittent sources of wind and photovoltaic are expected to increase further within the near future. Production and consumption of these intermittent energy sources do not coincide. Hence energy storages are needed to overcome periods of mismatch. To the operator of a power supply system the location, kind, capacity and type of these storages are important questions. They are discussed in this paper, determining the optimal position and size of storage within a given scenario. Optimality is defined by minimum CO2 emissions. The developed approach compares centralized and decentralized approaches of power generation of a larger region. The location of the storage and the renewable energy plants is varied within these systems. Here, an exemplary Swiss region is examined, consisting of a main city and several surrounding villages. Heat and electricity are supplied by various generation technologies processing different energy carriers. Conventional and renewable production are both available, and have to be coordinated to meet the demand. The energy supply infrastructure is assessed by a multiple-level model. It structures the region according to its settlement units. The resulting model consists of several superimposed levels, starting from small and going up to large settlement units. Each level comprises energy generation technologies and storages - if present - to supply the load. The plants of each level are aggregated in one energy hub, a unit that allows the conversion and storage of multiple energy carriers. The hubs are sorted hierarchically according to the multiple-level structure of the region, thus allowing the comparison of different locations and sizes of storages within the considered region. The aim is to determine the power supply strategy for the examined agglomeration with the smallest amount of emissions possible. Different storage positions are evaluated for a given scenario, i.e. a given set of generation units, regarding their emissions saving potential. Also, the renewable share and grid electricity mix are varied to evaluate preferable storage locations. The simulations showed that storage taps its full potential best in combined heat and power production situations, and that the power generation structure remarkably influences the benefits that can be drawn from storage use. Consequently the supply infrastructure has to be analyzed carefully in order to determine the optimal storage location within the system.","Energy hub; Mulitple-level model; Optimization; Power supply; Renewables; Storage","Combined heat and power production; Energy hubs; Generation technologies; Intermittent energy source; Power supply; Production and consumption; Renewables; Use of renewable energies; Carbon dioxide; Electric power generation; Electricity; Energy storage; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Electric power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876765032

This is because; the capacitors must be sufficiently large for reliable sensing and charge storage mechanism. This leaves DRAM memory scaling in jeopardy, as charge sensing and storage mechanisms become extremely difficult. In this paper we provide an overview of the potential and the possibilities of using Phase Change Memory (PCM) as an alternative for the existing DRAM technology. The main challenges that we encounter in using PCM are, the limited endurance, high access latencies, and higher dynamic energy consumption than that of the conventional DRAM. We then provide an overview of various methods, which can be employed to overcome these drawbacks. Hybrid memories involving both PCM and DRAM can be used, to achieve good tradeoffs in access latency and storage density. We conclude by presenting, the results of these methods that makes PCM a potential replacement for the current DRAM technology.","DRAM; Phase change memory","Access latency; Charge sensing; Charge storage; DRAM memories; DRAM technology; Dynamic energy consumption; Hybrid memories; Storage densities; Storage mechanism; Capacitors; Phase change memory; Dynamic random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871402531

Coal again acquired an important role in the global energy survey. International organizations are now conscious and resolved to systematically move into clean/cleaner coal technologies (CCTs) and, above all, into zero (or near zero) emission technologies (ZETs). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, acting in a complementary way to CCTs, are becoming one of the solutions to facing climate changes, permitting us not to avoid entirely but to minimize the green house gas effect (GHGE) to an acceptable level. It is also imperative to emphasize the actual crucial role of coal as a natural gas source rock and as a reservoir. Yet it is also important to understand that when coal has a high gas generation potential it does not necessarily imply that coal also has a high gas storage capacity and a high gas circulation performance. This investigation aims to compare the gas storage capacity and the gas circulation behavior between Gondwana and North Atlantic coal types. Two sets of Gondwana and North Atlantic coal types, with different ranks, were selected in the present research. Results revealed that the two sets of samples corresponded to different facies and, consequently, have different chemical and physical properties and quite different gas storage and gas circulation behaviors. In general terms, ""North Atlantic-type"" coals have a higher CH4 storage capacity than ""Gondwana-type"" coals due to differences in their petrographic characteristics, mainly in terms of vitrinite content and rank but also, although in a smaller scale, in terms of gas sorption temperatures. Diffusion coefficient values present a higher dependency on temperature changes than on gas storage capacities due to the high activation energy induced by high temperatures. © 2010 by Begell House, Inc.","Gas circulation; Gas storage; Gondwana-type coal; North Atlantic-type coal; Petrography","Carbon capture and storage; Coal technologies; Coal types; Emission technology; Energy products; Gas circulation; Gas generation; Gas Sorption; Gas storage; Gas storage capacity; Global energy; High activation energy; High temperature; International organizations; Natural gas sources; North Atlantic; Petrographic characteristics; Storage capacity; Temperature changes; Vitrinites; Carbon capture; Climate change; Diffusion; Energy utilization; Gas supply; Greenhouse gases; Oceanography; Petrography; Sorption; Technology; Coal; activation energy; carbon sequestration; cleaner production; climate change; coal; diffusion; energy use; gas flow; gas storage; Gondwana; greenhouse effect; high temperature; international organization; methane; natural gas; petrography; physicochemical property; sorption; source rock; vitrinite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870378764

Technical constraints of the conventional generating units keep RES penetration in these islands at low levels. To overcome such limitations, in the case of small island systems (peak power less than 1 MW) battery energy storage appears today as an attractive solution from a technical, economic and operational point of view. In the paper, the operation of a hybrid power station that consists of a Wind Turbine and Lead Acid batteries is simulated on an annual basis, using a steady-state ""logistic"" model, which accounts for the energy transactions between its various components, ignoring all electrical transients. Battery operation is modeled by the Hybrid2 model, which describes the operation of lead-acid accumulators during charge and discharge cycles, estimating also their expected lifetime. Moreover, the ideal size of the hybrid station is investigated considering the RES penetration and the economic feasibility of such a project. The results of the simulations indicate that a wind penetration levels up to 80% may be feasible.",,"Aegean sea; Attractive solutions; Autonomous islands; Battery energy storage; Battery operation; Charge and discharge; Economic feasibilities; Electrical transients; Expected lifetime; Generating unit; Hybrid power stations; Low level; Peak power; Penetration level; Small island; Technical constraints; Wind penetration levels; Computer simulation; Diesel engines; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Exhibitions; Lead acid batteries; Power quality; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870029311

Reversible pump turbines (RPTs) have an increasing importance for regulation purposes for obtaining power balance in electric power systems. Especially in grids dominated by thermal energy, reversible pump turbines improve the overall governor stability. Increased use of new renewables (wind, wave and tidal power plants) will utterly demand better regulation ability of the more traditional power suppliers, enhancing the need for reversible pump turbines. It is, however, a necessity that both machine and system is designed for maximum flexibility in changing modes of operation from pump to turbine and vice versa. A reversible pump turbine is known for having very steep speed-flow characteristics which might give stability problems. During the design process, focus on the system dynamics in such power plants is essential. Simulation of the dynamic behaviour of the system implies a good representation of the turbine by its characteristics. It is necessary to be able to represent the characteristics before any measurements of the actual machine are available. This paper presents an possible explanation of the reason for these steep characteristics. Based on this hypothesis, a representation of the turbine for system dynamic simulation purposes is suggested.",,"Better regulation; Compensating mode; Design process; Dynamic behaviours; Idle speed; In-phase; Modes of operation; Power balance; Power suppliers; Pump-turbines; Pumping modes; Renewables; Reversible pump-turbine; Stability problem; System Dynamics; Turbine modes; Computer simulation; Electric power systems; Pumped storage power plants; Rotating machinery; Tidal power plants; Transport properties; Hydraulic turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865641404

Although there are several storage technologies, as chemical, potential or heat energy, not all of these technologies are optimal for each energy system. The results of energy planning and several cases where use of smart energy storage system could help with integration of the energy flows, the transformations and energy demand at the location of the energy end use or close to it are presented.

Hydrogen can be subsequently used to generate electric energy, e.g., via fuel cells. A new type of heterogeneous anion exchange membrane with enhanced conductivity was tested. Heterogeneous anion selective polymer membranes based on ion exchange resin with trimethylbenzylammonium functional group bonded by different matrix polymers, i.e., linear polyethylene, low density polyethylene, and linear polyethylene blended with poly(ethylene-co-vinylalcohole), were prepared. They showed sufficient stability within the framework of the experimental conditions used. An attempt was made to improve their ionic conductivity while keeping chemical and mechanical stability. It was based on increasing porosity of the matrix polymer by an addition of the water soluble polymer to the matrix polymer.

In spite of the advantages associated with ANG over other storage modes, there are some issues that need be properly addressed in order to ensure a viable employment of such alternative. One major problem is that the thermal effects associated with the sorption phenomena tend to diminish the storage capacity, thereby resulting in poorer performance. Hence, in order to design commercially viable storage vessels, the heat and mass transfer mechanisms that occur in these devices must be carefully understood and controlled. In this context, this work presents different mathematical models for simulating ANG charge and discharge processes. For the sake of improving the understanding of mass and energy transport within ANG vessels, dimensionless groups associated with this problem are also discussed. By using the proposed formulations, simulation results were numerically calculated and the process of charging ANG vessels was analyzed for different combinations of the presented dimensionless groups. Pressure, temperature and stored mass histories are compared, showing that the unwanted heating effects can be minimized for certain values of the dimensionless groups. Finally, a comparison between the results obtained using the two different formulations suggests that there may be cases in which the simpler model could be employed. © 2010 by ASME.",,"Adsorbed natural gas; Charge and discharge; Dimensionless groups; Heat and mass transfer; Heating effect; Mass and energy transport; Sorption phenomena; Storage capacity; Storage vessel; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Natural gas; Sorption; Heat transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860528170

Deposition processes and surface modification by plasma have been developed in order to modify the surface of commercially available coatings, making them as non-adhesive coatings too. The main obtained results allow the creation of a coating that combines high adhesion to steel surfaces and low surface tension, due the presence of a thin layer with high concentrations of fluoride.

The samples treated in an atmosphere of fluorine-rich plasma showed values of contact angle measured with water with an increase up to 76%, which dramatically decreased the surface energy of the commercial anti-corrosion coating.

However, with carbon capture and storage, the efficiency will be penalized by almost 10 percent units. To limit the energy consumption for a carbon capture NGCC plant, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is necessary. Utilizing EGR increases the CO2 content in the gas turbine exhaust while it reduces the flue gas flow to be treated in the capture plant. Nevertheless, due to EGR, the gas turbine will experience a different media with different properties compared to the design case. This study looks into how the turbo machinery reacts to EGR. The work also discusses the potential of further improvements by utilizing pressurized water rather than extraction steam as the heat source for the CO2 stripper. The results show that the required low-pressure level should be elevated to a point close to the intermediate-pressure to achieve optimum efficiency; hence one pressure level can be omitted. The main tool used for this study is an in-house off-design model based on fully dimensionless groups programmed in the commercially-available heat and mass balance program IPSEpro.

Among them coal will increase its share because of its vast reserves, its relatively even global distribution and its low prices compared to oil and gas. On the other hand the burning of coal emits larger quantities of CO2 than oil and gas. As CO2 is the leading cause for global warming, the use of coal for power generation demands a clean coal technology with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Therefore in this work it is suggested to combine a coal gasification unit with a Graz Cycle power plant, an oxy-fuel technology of highest efficiency. The firing of the syngas from coal gasification with pure oxygen avoids the expensive precombustion CO2 sequestration and leads to a working fluid of CO2 and steam, where CO2 is captured by simple steam condensation. In contrast to this, the more conventional technology is to send the syngas to a water-shift reactor and a CO2 scrubber so that a fuel containing mainly hydrogen is obtained which can be fired in a conventional combined cycle plant. In order to evaluate these two competing technologies a thermodynamic simulation as well as an economic cost analysis of both power cycles is performed. It turns out that the achievable efficiency of the Graz Cycle plant is - despite of the increased oxygen demand - far higher than that of a plant of conventional capture technology due to the avoidance of shift reaction and scrubbing. The following economic analysis shows mitigation costs of 22.5 €/ton CO2 avoided for the Graz Cycle plant compared to 33 €/ton for an IGCC plant with CO2 capture.

Distributed power plants based on solar radiation, solar heat, wind power and water power from river flow, tidal flow and even wave motion should drive electrolysers producing hydrogen and oxygen. The units are connected with a pipeline system delivering hydrogen and oxygen at high pressure into respective storage tanks in the vicinity of the proposed power plant. So periods of generation of hydrogen and oxygen can overlap and these fuel gases are available to produce peak power according to demand. The proposed plant is an hybrid plant incorporating SOFC fuel cells into an innovative power cycle with steam as working fluid. Twelve fuel cells of 2.5 MW power produce electricity and heat up working fluid from 600 to 800°C. In a succeeding combustion chamber the fuel cell surplus hydrogen as well as the gas turbine hydrogen demand is burned with pure oxygen leading to a working gas (steam) of 1550°C and 40 bar. The working gas is expanded in an innovative cycle producing additional 109 MW of electrical energy.

Assistance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was requested to condition and store disused radium needles and tubes present at two facilities. The mission took place on July 25, 2001 and was organized by the IAEA in cooperation with the Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission (LAEC). Other disused radioactive sources were kept in the facilities till a safer and securer solution is provided; however orphan sources, found mainly during export control, were brought and stored temporarily in LAEC. The necessity of a safe and secure store became a must. Prior to October 2005, there was no clear legal basis for establishing such store for disused radioactive sources, until the ministerial decree no 15512 dated October 19, 2005 (related to the implementation of decree-law no 105/83) was issued which clearly stated that ""The LAEC shall, in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, establish a practical mechanism for safe disposal of radioactive waste"". Following this, the work on inventory of disused sealed sources along with collecting orphan sources and placing them temporarily in LAEC was legally supported. Moreover, several missions were planned to repatriate category I and II sources, one of which was completed specifically in August 2009; other missions are being worked on. In 2008, a national technical cooperation project with the IAEA was launched. Under the Technical Cooperation (TC) project with reference number LEB3002, the project was entitled ""Assistance in the establishment of a safe temporary national storage at the LAECfor orphan sources and radioactive waste"" which cycle is 2009-2011. Under this project, a national store for radioactive sources in the third basement of LAEC is being established. The area is being reconstructed currently and will be equipped when ready under LEB3002 project. Along with this, a system for sealed disused sources management has been prepared, part of which is applied now and the rest will be applied upon the establishment of the store. This paper will cover the inventory collection process, the study for the establishment of this store, the present and prospective waste management system, and the waste acceptance criteria. © 2010 by ASME.",,"Atomic energy commissions; Collection process; Export controls; International atomic energy agency; Lebanon; Orphan sources; Public health; Radioactive sources; Research fields; Safe disposals; Sealed sources; Technical co-operation; Waste acceptance criteria; Waste management systems; Industrial research; International trade; Nuclear energy; Radioactive prospecting; Radioactive waste storage; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Radium; Waste disposal; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80055064272

Virtual all of these waste streams can be treated by the plasma technology resulting in a final product free of organics, liquids and moisture, and meeting without a doubt the acceptance criteria for safe storage and disposal. The plasma is a highly desirable heat source. Its high temperature of up to 10.000 °C can treat the radioactive waste as is. The inorganic materials are melted into a glassy slag, containing most of the radioactive isotopes, while the organic material is vaporized into a syngas and subsequently oxidized in an afterburner. This technology is very suitable for historical waste containing mixtures of inorganic, organic, liquids, sludge, etc, with almost no waste preparation and with minimal risk for radioactive contamination and exposure. Plasma technology offers a high volume waste reduction factor (VRF) that minimizes the volume and overall costs of waste storage and disposal. In addition, as plasma technology can recondition previously conditioned waste packages that no longer meet the present acceptance criteria for final disposal, it offers a solution to the growing demand for improved quality of final waste forms. As such, plasma technology is of great value, not just to waste producers but to future generations as well.

In production facilities, there is often a reluctance to commit to this type of change without a clear view of the benefit. Furthermore, there is very little detailed information available in the open literature that allows even a qualitative assessment of priorities. In order to address this shortcoming, analyses of two industrial compressed air systems which are already installed in manufacturing plants have been conducted in the context of energy usage. The installations are quite different in compressed air needs: one is focused on actuation and drying; while the other uses compressed air primarily for material handling. In both sites, the energy of the compressed air is evaluated at each key element of the system and the typical end use application profile is assessed. Simple models of the consumption rates are used to relate duty cycle and device count with actual total consumption. A new way of assessing the leak rate from the entire system has been developed, based on the pressure decay time, and has been implemented at one site. In this way, the energy balance of the system entire has been analyzed quantitatively, with the effect of distribution leaks accounted for directly. It is found that in both sites, open blowing operations (e.g. drying) are the largest, consumers which are amenable to optimization. It is also found that the measured leak rate at one site represented 23% of the compressed air generated, with an energy input of 455kWh per day. It is concluded that this approach can help to identify priorities for optimizing CA use at an industrial site.

The seam weld in pipes is subjected to a significant stress range normal to its weld toes when it is subjected to varying internal pressure from start and stop of gas transportation through pipelines and from filling and emptying of cylinders. A reliable methodology is required for fatigue design of long pipes in order to meet target safety level at an acceptable cost.

This SALM system is part of the ""Vityaz"" Production Complex in which the produced oil is exported from the Piltun-Astokhskoye-A platform via a subsea pipeline and the SALM to the Okha floating storage and offloading (FSO) unit for subsequent loading onto tankers for delivery to customers. Yearly oil production using the SALM system starts normally in June and lasts till December, during the ice free period. Full year round production were planned using a pipeline replacement for the SALM system (on-stream early 2008). However, in the interim period, there was a significant production opportunity if the SALM could be reinstalled in time for the summer 2008 ice-free season. Another significant incentive for SEIC was an early gas flow through the offshore pipelines to the Onshore Processing Facility for commissioning purposes, which expedites first gas delivery for the whole project by an estimated 4 months. In order to make this production season possible, a unique and fast track project to reinstate the SALM was necessary. SEIC, Shell International E&P in Rijswijk and Single Buoy Moorings Inc. in Monaco, had jointly undertaken this project, incorporating proven engineering standards with an immense amount of creativity to meet these time constraints. The SALM project, that would normally take 2 years, has been hailed as a great success with design, fabrication and installation completed in just 7 months time. This paper describes the key challenges overcome to successfully deliver a fully working SALM system to an extreme time schedule. The emphasis is on a description of the technical challenges and the engineering repair solutions developed with reference to the constructibility, transportation, installation and operation. The challenges include: Re-engineering of the SALM Unijoint cast components to meet the limitations of the available foundries, implementation of a novel pull down installation method using a subsea linear winch, design and construction of independent contingency option, installation trials, worldwide logistics and project coordination.

These terminals are preferably located nearshore i.e. in relatively shallow water. Design of floating structures is most of the time performed assuming long-crested waves. In shallow water, diffraction of waves by a variable bathymetry can result in wave spreading i.e. in short crested seas. The effect of short crested seas on the wave drift load spectral densities for a 135,000m3 storage capacity LNG Carrier in 15m water depth is investigated. It is shown that the impact of wave spreading on drift loads depends on the natural frequency of the moored vessel and thus on the stiffness of the mooring system under consideration. Although response calculations are not performed herein for reasons to be discussed, it is conceivable that wave spreading could adversely affect loading/offloading terminal availability for stiff moorings.

The ac/ac power converter takes energy from the grid during voltage sag/swell. By connecting the matrix converter's input terminals on the load-side and injecting the compensation voltages on the supply-side, it is possible to hold a constant input voltage, resulting in an efficient solution for compensating deep voltage sags and swells. Thus, the proposed topology has the ability to compensate balanced and unbalanced voltage fluctuations and to eliminate the energy storage elements. The space-vector modulation (SVM) technique is utilized to fulfill the input and output requirements.

Here five criteria are presented that can be used in the static balancing of compliant mechanisms. The criteria are combined in a systematic way with design methods for compliant mechanisms as an exercise to find feasible combinations for the development of design methods for statically balanced compliant mechanisms. The feasibility of the combination between criteria and design methods for compliant mechanisms is demonstrated by using rigid body mechanisms with torsion springs, roughly emulating their compliant counterpart. © 2010 by ASME.",,"Compliant mechanism; Design method; Rigid body; Static balancing; Torsion Springs; Design; Mechanisms; Mechanical engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053033774

Study of morphology using a SEM micrograph and the High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images of the nanocomposite films suggests that the SiO2 nanoparticles are within the range of 2-7nm in diameter and are uniformly dispersed in the polymer matrix. Thermal properties of these composite materials have been studied as a function of silica, indicating that thermal stability of the chitosan film is enhanced.

Box 17, 6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","The indoor climate of many storage facilities for agricultural produce is controlled by mixing ambient air with the air flow through the store room. Hence, the indoor climate is affected by the ambient weather conditions. Given hourly fluctuating energy tariffs, weather forecasts over some days are required to effectively anticipate. Hence, typically a real-time optimal control strategy results. As weather forecasts are uncertain, predicted model outputs and related costs of the control strategy become uncertain. Usually, a medium-range weather forecast for a period of some days consists of an ensemble of forecasts. Hence, the uncertainty in the weather forecast is known a priori. In addition to this, in past-performance studies where weather forecasts and observed weather variables are given, an a posteriori evaluation of the forecast errors can be made as well. The objective of this study is to evaluate the uncertainty in the costs related to weather forecast errors and uncertainty, given the control inputs. In a simulation case-study with real weather forecasts and observed weather, it appeared that only slight cost increases can be expected due to errors and uncertainties in weather forecasts if the optimal control problem is calculated every 6-12 h in a receding horizon context. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960073961

One of the major impediments for the transition to a hydrogen based energy system is the lack of satisfactory hydrogen storage alternatives. Hydrogen storage in nanostructured materials has been proposed as a solution for adequate hydrogen storage for a number of applications, in particular for transportation. Also, hydrogen is an important, though little studied, trace component of the atmosphere. It exists at the mixing ratio of about 510 ppb. Hydrogen is an indirect greenhouse gas with a global warming potential GWP of 5.8 over a 100-year time horizon. A future hydrogen economy would therefore have greenhouse consequences and would not be free from climate perturbations. Our study focuses on the environmental impact of using hydrogen as a energy source. If a global hydrogen economy replaced the current fossil fuel-based energy system and exhibited a leakage rate of 1%, then it would produce a climate impact of 0.6% of the current fossil fuel based system.","Energy; Environment; Greenhouse effect; Hydrogen economy; Impact","Climate impacts; Energy; Energy carriers; Energy source; Energy systems; Environment; Global impacts; Global warming potential; Hydrogen economy; Impact; Leakage rates; Mixing ratios; Renewable energies; Sustainable energy systems; Time horizons; Trace components; Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Hydrogen; Storage (materials); Sustainable development; Urban planning; Hydrogen storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959663483

The paradigm shift is so paramount that one speaks of the ""Hydrogen Economy"", as the energy in this new and ecological type of economy is to be distributed by hydrogen. However, H2 is not a primary energy source like nuclear power but rather an energy carrier. As such it is a means of storing, transporting and distributing energy, which has to be generated by other means, like solar, wind or nuclear power plants - such as by the process heat of Gen IV reactors - if one wants to avoid any GHG emissions. Various H2 storage methods are possible, but as it stands right now the most favoured one in terms of energy density of storage and practicability is the storage of gaseous hydrogen in high pressure tanks. The biggest promoter of this storage methodology is the automotive industry that is already preparing the generation change from the fossil fuel internal combustion engines to hydrogen based fuel cells. Yet there are more applications, all adding to the synergy potential with the aerospace sector. The JRC-IE plays a key role in the European Union's 20-20-20 strategy. The Institute for Energy (IE) is part of the Directorate General Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission. Its mission is to provide scientific and technical support for the conception, development, implementation and monitoring of community policies related to energy. The JRC-IE's research efforts in solar and nuclear power, power management, as well as hydrogen generation and storage, detection and usage render its activities a contribution of high importance for the policy maker trying to set up the proper energy mix of the future. This paper presents the activities at the JRC-IE related to the upcoming Hydrogen Economy and the potential synergies with space power systems. In the context of the Hydrogen Economy, the JRC-IE deals with the entire hydrogen value chain: from the generation to the storage in solid materials and tanks, the H2 sensors to detect any leakages and the final usage in fuel cells. The research on solar cells, nuclear systems and power management systems complements the activities, which provide an important technology input for space related energy issues.",,"Aerospace sectors; Earth's climate; Energy carriers; Energy density; Energy mix; Energy-dependent society; European Commission; European Union; Gaseous hydrogen; GHG emission; High-pressure tanks; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen generations; Nuclear systems; Paradigm shifts; Policy makers; Potential applications; Potential synergies; Power management systems; Power managements; Primary energy source; Process heat; Research centres; Research efforts; Solid material; Space activities; Space power systems; Technical support; Value chains; Automotive industry; Earth (planet); Energy management; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Fuel storage; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Internal combustion engines; International law; Mergers and acquisitions; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Research; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Spacecraft power supplies; Tanks (containers); Hydrogen storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959464762

During day light hours the modules convert the incident sun energy into useful electrical power, while shielding the roof from direct sun-radiation. At night time, the roof cover and modules are retracted to expose the roof to the cool night-sky, thus enhancing cooling. The paper employs time-dependent modeling of Solar input and heat transfer to predict the roof, wall and window temperature distributions and cooling loads, as well as energy generated by the modules. With the aid of battery storage, the modules provide the entire energy needs of the house.

Techniques for heat dissipation can include heat sinks and fans for air cooling, and other forms of computer cooling such as liquid cooling. Computer cooling is the process of removing heat from computer components. Because a computer system's components produce large amounts of heat during operation, this heat must be dissipated in order to keep these components within their safe operating temperatures. In addition to maintaining normative function, Components which produce heat and are susceptible to performance loss and damage include integrated circuits such as CPUs, chipset and graphics cards, along with hard drives (though excessive cooling of hard drives has been found to have negative effects). Overheated parts generally exhibit a shorter maximum life-span and may give sporadic problems resulting in system freezes or crashes. Both integral (manufacturing) and peripheral means (additional parts) are used to keep the heat of each component at a safe operational level. With regard to integral means, CPU and GPUs are designed entirely with energy efficiency, including heat dissipation, in mind, and with each advance CPUs/GPUs generally produce less heat (though this increased efficiency is always used to increase performance, producing similar heat levels as earlier models anyway). Cooling through peripheral means is mainly done using heat sinks to increase the surface area which dissipates heat, fans to speed up the exchange of air heated by the computer parts for cooler ambient air, and in some cases soft cooling. Comparisons between traditional methods of CPU cooling, and new fashions of cooling (like Heat pipes, and Thermoelectric cooling) have been performed. Moreover, Thermal affects on processor performance, has been studied.

Local conventional power stations operate with low load factors and the systems are characterised by high electricity production cost. In parallel, wind energy is a mature, free of charge, local source, but wind penetration is restricted due to technical reasons related with the safe operation of the autonomous power systems. Combined use of wind energy with pumped storage systems (WHPS) is considered as a mean to exploit the abundant wind potential, increase the wind installed capacity and substitute conventional peak supply. In this study, the effect of wind energy on the reliability of the autonomous power systems is analysed. A definition of the WHPS capacity credit (CC) and a methodology for the calculation that is based on probability theory principles are proposed and applied in three representative Greek islands. The aim is to assess the prospects of wind energy with or without pumped storage systems to substitute the installation of conventional power plants.

About 20k applications will provide the needed capabilities in terms of run control, event selection, data flow, local storage and data monitoring.

Lowering the Auger energy threshold by more than one order of magnitude allows a precise measurement of the cosmic ray spectrum in the very interesting regions of the second knee and the ankle.

Application of this toolbox led to blueprints of a CO2 infrastructure in the Netherlands. The results show that in a scenario with 20% and 50% CO2 emissions reduction targets compared to their 1990 level in respectively 2020 and 2050, an infrastructure of around 600 km of CO2 trunklines may need to be built before 2020.

If the same strategy is applied to mainstream computers and data center servers, we will not only reduce electricity bills but we will also contribute to greener computing by improving the IT sector's CO2 emissions.

To increase the resolution we need to decrease the aperture diameter, to this end increase of energy throughput is necessary. Recently, we proposed that the interface between the fiber core and metal coating is structured into parallel grooves of different profiles curved inward the core. The role of grooves is to facilitate conversion of photons to plasmons at the core - cladding interface. In this paper we prove that a singe groove is enough to increase energy throughput by 500% in the case of aluminum cladding and 3000% for gold cladding over probes without corrugations.

Hence, hydropower plants in Switzerland are increasingly selling peak energy in a liberalized European electricity market. This development leads to higher start/stop-cycle frequencies of their hydrogenerators and some older machines are also subjected to more starts per year than they were originally designed for. In consequence the high voltage insulation system in the stator conductor bars is stressed by a higher number of thermal cycles which might shorten machine lifetimes significantly. In this paper a new test for assessing the impact of thermal cycling in modern mica/epoxy insulation systems is presented. The new method isolates insulation aging exclusively caused by thermal cycling by the use of cycles with short heating intervals and a maximum temperature close to the glass transition point of the insulation system's binder (epoxy) resin. The insulation aging condition is monitored with non-destructive measurements of the Dissipation Factor and Partial Discharges during, and a destructive voltage endurance test after completion of the thermal cycling. A first implementation of the new test method with 1.500 cycles resulted in no severely greater deterioration of the cycled group compared to an uncycled group but shows the necessity of further investigation. ©2010 IEEE.",,"Dissipation factors; Electricity market; Glass transition points; High voltage insulation systems; Hydro generator; Hydro-generators; Hydropower plants; Insulation aging; Insulation system; Maximum temperature; Non-destructive measurement; Peak energy; Renewable energies; Solar plant; Stator insulation; Storage capacity; Switzerland; Test method; Thermal cycle; Voltage endurance tests; Epoxy resins; Glass transition; Hydroelectric generators; Partial discharges; Resins; Solar energy; Stators; Thermal cycling; Thermal insulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952980066

In 1971, Leon Chua showed using argument that there should exist another passive element which he named memristor. It is basically a resistor whose resistance increases when current flows through it from one direction and decreases when current flows from the other direction. After 37 years researchers of HP became able to build world's first working memristor and surprised the electronics community. Chua proved that the characteristics of a memristor cannot be simulated using resistor, capacitor and inductor only and hence it is a fundamental element. Many new types of circuits can be built using memristor in it. But as it is a very new element so the no. of circuits is only a few. As memristor can have many resistance levels, we can use some discrete value as different logic level and thus can use in multivalued logic system. In this paper a method has been shown to achieve those different levels. Using this method we can use an array of memristor for making a non-volatile multivalued data storage system. ©2010 IEEE.","Data storage system; Linear drift model; Low energy; Memristor; Multivalued logic","Data storage systems; Linear drift model; Low energies; Memristor; Multivalued logic; Capacitors; Data storage equipment; Information technology; Memristors; Passive filters; Transistor transistor logic circuits; Resistors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952961995

Low-cost actuators may degrade and perform poorly and erroneously in demanding conditions; therefore, one major inspiration for this work relies on the potential energy storage mechanism, using elastic elements to overcome the motors limitation, avoiding their operation near the limits, while saving energy and wearing, and also obtain faster responses of the overall platform in various motion schemes and gaits.

This energy can be next transferred to semiconductor substrate via a near-field channel, in a more efficient manner in comparison to the direct photo-effect. We explain this enhancement by inclusion of all indirect inter-band transitions in semiconductor layer due to near-field coupling with plasmon radiation in nanoscale of the metallic components, where the momentum is not conserved as the system is not translationally invariant.

Damping of plasmons is analyzed including Lorentz friction, and irradiation losses in far- and near-field regimes. Resulting resonance shifts are verified experimentally for Au and Ag (10-80 nm) colloidal water solutions with respect to particle size. Probability of interband transition (within the Fermi golden rule) caused by coupling to plasmons in near-field regime turns out to be 4-order larger than for coupling of electrons to planar-wave photons. Inclusion of proximity effects (for type of deposition of nano-components and their shape) allows for explanation of photo-current growth experimentally measured. We describe also a non-dissipative collective mode of surface plasmons in a chain of near-field-coupled metallic nanospheres, for particular size/separation parameters and wave-lengths. © 2010 SPIE.","Metallically nano-modified solar cells; Plasmon-polariton; Surface plasmons","Collective modes; Fermi golden rule; Inter-band transition; Lorentz; Metallic clusters; Metallic component; Metallic nanospheres; Metallically nano-modified solar cells; Modified surfaces; Nano scale; Near-field; Near-field coupling; Photoeffect; Plasmon oscillations; Plasmon-polariton; Proximity effects; Resonance shift; Semi-conductor surfaces; Semiconductor layers; Semiconductor substrate; Surface plasmons; Volume modes; Water solutions; Gold coatings; Nanospheres; Optical data storage; Optical properties; Phonons; Photons; Quantum theory; Semiconductor growth; Silver; Solar cells; Spheres; Plasmons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952660564

CSP harnesses a much larger portion of the sun's energy than PV systems do; however, CSP drives the absorption refrigeration cycle while PV can drive vapor compression cycles with a higher coefficient of performance (COP). Comparing the combined efficiencies of solar harnessing and coefficient of performance, both CSP and PV become virtually equivalent from a solar cooling perspective. The balance tips in favor of CSP systems due to its many advantages over PV systems such as cost per ton, energy payback time, and recyclability at the end of panel life. PV systems have the advantage of an essentially free storage system (the public utility grid); however, solar cooling systems' economics dictate that they only be sized for transient peak loads and storage is not a significant advantage when that factor is taken into account. ©2010 ASHRAE.",,"Coefficient of Performance; Energy pay back time; Peak load; PV system; Recyclability; Solar cooling; Solar cooling systems; Solar panels; Storage systems; Vapor compression cycle; Absorption refrigeration; Cooling; Drives; Heating; Photovoltaic effects; Public utilities; Vapor compression refrigeration; Cooling systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952659334

Due to the complexity of the microencapsulated PCM slurry thermo-physical properties an alternative approach was used: first, tests were carried out using water in order to obtain natural convection heat transfer correlations and then a comparison was made with the results obtained for the MEPCS.

Former measurement on p-CrSi2/n-crystSi structure confirmed an abrupt type junction together with a building voltage at the proximity of 0.7 V. Though a fairly well rectification ratio (103 at ±2 V) was realized by IV measurement, it became deteriorated with the increase in ambient temperature. From temperature dependence of IV variations, distinct conduction mechanisms were identified. In forward (reverse) direction trap assisted single-multistep tunneling recombination (generation) and space-charge limited current flow that corresponded to low and high bias voltage regions, respectively, were identified. Moreover, an activation energy (EA) determined from the slopes of IVT curves as 0.22 and 0.26 eV was interpreted as the energy position of a chromiumboron (CrB) complex-type point defect residing in n/p doped c-Si semiconductor in CrSi2/nc-Si and CrSi2/pc-Si junctions. The retrieved EA was in agreement with the recent DLTS measurement. Based on the experimental observations, schematic current path was built to interpret IV/CV behaviors.

Side disturbances caused by a specific technology can ""solve"", sometimes by using additional technologies, but by using this solution that causes other new problems that increase entropy. Problems in general are growing faster than their solutions. With each new problem is more difficult comparing with older problems, because the environmental entropy increases with every event and freely available energy degrades (down), and maintaining ""order"" gradually becoming more expensive. This fact, mathematic, increases exponentially with time. It is interesting to note that speed ""exhaustion"" reserves continue at a rate exponentially as increasing energy consumption. Changes in technology create temporary zones of order, but the risk of accelerating the entropic process, consequence being a ""disruption"" in the world. Result the need for advanced analytical methods to meet these developments. One possible solution may be to extend and improve the method of exergoeconomic analysis in many industries domains.

The four main sequential steps used in this research were: (1) pre-assessment, (2) assessment, (3) feasibility study, and (4) implementation. In the first step, raw data, such as process flows, raw material usage and defects data were collected. In the second step, the loss during production and causes of loss were analyzed. Opportunities to reduce raw material, chemical and energy wastage could then be recommended. The next step was to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of a particular Cleaner Technology opportunity. Finally, in the last step, after a thorough evaluation and implementation of the opportunities to apply clean technology, the results showed that Arm Coil defects could be reduced by improving the production process using the ECRS technique. ECRS stands for Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange and Simplify. This improvement reduced arm coil defect rates from 0.48% to 0.15%, thus saving approximately 139,638 Thai Baht per month. In addition, production stoppage decision made by workers was used to increase employee involvement in defect detection. Allowing workers to participate in such a decision was an effective way to reduce defect rate and could motivate workers to produce a better quality job. This resulted in arm coil defects reducing from 0.41% to 0.025%, with about 74,562 Thai Baht per month saving. Additionally, an increase in the efficiency of electricity consumption occurred, by increasing the speed of the infrared oven conveyor belt, improving average productivity from 533 pieces/hour to 560 pieces/hour, without adversely affecting product costs and quality, thus producing products of up to the value of 206,242 Thai Baht per month. Furthermore, the new 2-layer curing equipment was designed, developed and used. The upper layer of the equipment was used for arm curing and the lower layer was used for arm coil curing. The result of using such equipment led to a saving of approximately 25,502 Thai Baht per month in electricity costs, without affecting product quality. The outcome of these Cleaner Technology applications was that total costs of approximately 239,702 Thai Baht per month were able to be saved.","Cleaner Technology; Defect Reduction; Efficiency Improvement; Hard Disk Drive","Clean technologies; Cleaner technologies; Coil assemblies; Conveyor belts; Curing equipments; Defect detection; Defect rate; Defect Reduction; Efficiency Improvement; Electricity costs; Electricity-consumption; Employee involvement; Energy consumption efficiency; Energy wastages; Feasibility studies; Hard Disk Drive; Infrared oven; Material usage; Potential benefits; Pre-assessment; Process flows; Product cost; Product quality; Production process; Production stoppage; Total costs; Upper layer; Assembly; Belt conveyors; Cost accounting; Curing; Defects; Efficiency; Energy utilization; Engineers; Equipment; Hard disk storage; Industrial research; Power quality; Rating; Technology; Manufacture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952423714

Given a set of goods, a transportation network with delivery locations and a fleet of transportation vehicles the goal is to carry out deliveries from the central storage facility to all customers incurring minimal costs and subject to certain additional constraints. Computationally this is known to be a hard problem. However, with a computational technology of nowadays, it is feasible to find ""good enough"" solutions in a reasonable time. The purpose of this paper is to present one such prototype tool, which is focused on the road transportation in Slovenia. Transportation networks are usually modeled by weighted graphs. With development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) geographic information concerning transportation networks and other geographic information relevant for logistics became available for research and practical purposes. In Slovenia, GIS data on transportation networks are maintained in Cadastral register of the economic public infrastructure. During the efforts invested in optimization of processes of a leading Slovenian energy company, it turned out that the transportation costs represent an important component of a storage facility operation. In our case specific additional constraints have to be taken into consideration such as use of different types of vehicles, with different capacities (trucks and vans), different costs per kilometer and limitation of route duration to 8 hours due to regulations. As an additional constraint, some customers occasionally require delivery at a certain hour of day. With this constraint we have a well known and a well studied problem of VRP with time windows (VRPTW). The initial situation involved a central storage facility from which a fleet of more than 20 vehicles coming from several regions in Slovenia carried out deliveries on a daily basis. A dispatching in the storage facility was manual and the delivery locations were first distributed to route regions. We have developed a practical prototype software implementation which uses the data from the information system of the storage facility, GIS data of the transportation network, integrated together with an open source tool for graphical representation and our own implementation of special purpose optimization algorithms. For optimization we use heuristics based on local optimization upgraded with some meta-heuristics like tabu-search. The system is operational but as it is further tested in practice, we expect yet unforeseen constraints to emerge. The system represents a powerful tool for research in road transportation logistics in Slovenia. The emphasis is set on implementation of algorithms which have to be structured in such a way that incorporation of additional constraints in the future is possible. In our case additional constraints are included in the object function through penalization when particular constraint is not respected.","Transportation optimization; Vehicle routing problem","Computational technology; Energy companies; Geographic information; GIS data; Graphical representations; Hard problems; Initial situation; Local optimizations; Meta heuristics; Minimal cost; Object functions; Open source tools; Optimization algorithms; Practical implementation; Prototype software; Prototype tools; Public infrastructures; Road transportation; Slovenia; Storage facilities; Time windows; Transportation cost; Transportation network; Transportation vehicles; Vehicle routing problem; Weighted graph; Automobiles; Engineers; Fleet operations; Geographic information systems; Graphic methods; Information systems; Open systems; Roads and streets; Routing algorithms; Software prototyping; Tabu search; Trucks; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952408623

One of the tools to achieve these goals is the complex management information system (CMIS) starting from the local automation equipment of each processing facility and right up to the the automated integration and data processing system (AIDPS) of the company. The application of complex management information systems provides ample opportunities for the mobilization of reserves meant for the reduction in manufacturing and non-manufacturing costs and losses and also at the increase of income of oil-and-gas companies. To implement the necessary functions in Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoe field, the facilities of automated process control systems (APCS) are supplied with certain amounts of automation. To solve the functional tasks, the special-purpose software tools are used as capable of operation with real time data. Construction of the CMIS system in compliance with the assigned requirements provides the collection of production information to the necessary extent, storage, processing and representation of the information, completion of the applied tasks which contribute to complex engineering evaluations and modeling of production processes and facilities. While designing the CMIS of Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoe field, the controlled facilities were combined on the technological basis as facilities of oil production and reservoir pressure maintenance, oil treatment and transportation, life support and power engineering. In the CMIS structure the second level of APCS is implemented for operational dispatcher control over the production. The AIDPS accumulates information from lower levels of the automation in real time and converts them into meaningful production events for the further analysis. The basic performance indicators of an enterprise, which are positively influenced by the CMIS application mainly include the increase of efficiency and reduction in production costs. Decrease in cost of production refers to all types of costs: raw materials, energy carriers, human resources, etc., and it is conditioned by an accurate production planning which enables to optimize the use of all the enterprise resources. Increase in efficiency is mainly resulted from improvement of workflow, in particular the planning process, paperless production management, more effective preparation of accounts, elimination of doubling during data access, etc. The CMIS application also provides increase in the enterprise prestige and improvement in the quality of production, emergency situation prevention, production and environmental safety.

It is proposed the resonant transfer of energy in the fiber can be predicted by considering the coincident propagation constant for two distinct waveguides, namely a circular step-index fiber; and a multilayered step-index planar waveguide having refractive indices assuming those of the core, cladding, metal film and the outer dielectric. The point of coupling is observed to be the intersection of the dispersion curves for the surface plasmon modes and the circular fiber mode. The theoretical results are in good agreement with numerical simulation results of the Dshaped fiber obtained using Finite Element Method based software.",,"D-shaped fiber; Dispersion curves; Fiber mode; Metal film; Mode coupling; Multi-layered; Numerical simulation; Propagation constant; Resonant transfer; Step-index fibers; Surface plasmon excitation; Surface plasmon modes; Surface plasmons; Theoretical models; Theoretical result; Computer simulation; Computer software; Energy transfer; Finite element method; Numerical methods; Optical data storage; Photonics; Plasmons; Refractive index; Waveguides; Fibers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952342388

It is smart because takes advantage of the capability of the electric machine to behave as a generator. So, it is possible to recover the kinetic energy store in the rotating inertias by using regenerative braking during the deceleration and restore it into batteries. Some authors are focused on maximizing the energy regenerated, applying techniques as independent factors of the process, like storage elements, control of speed, acceleration, current, etc. In this work we exposes the regenerative braking process and its main parts in a holistic model, where discrete and continuous states and events are related, also linked into the dynamic behavior, bringing the possibility not only to have a general model that commands all the process, but also improve and monitor each stage as a whole.

Based on the input data and assumptions made, the simulations indicated that the scenario with the utilization of a single parabolic trough CSP plant (either 50MWe or 100MWe and with or without thermal storage capability) in combination with BAU will effect an insignificant change in the electricity unit cost of the generation system compared to the BAU scenario. In addition, a sensitivity analysis on natural gas price, showed that increasing fuel prices and the existence of thermal storage capability in the CSP plant make this scenario marginally more economically attractive compared to the BAU scenario.","Csp; Renewable energy sources; Solar energy; Solar thermal power plants","Business-as-usual; Concentrated solar power; Csp; Feed-in tariff; Fuel prices; Generation systems; Input datas; Natural gas price; Parabolic trough; Power generation systems; Power systems; Renewable energy sources; Solar thermal power plants; Techno-Economic analysis; Thermal storage; Unit cost; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power generation; Energy conversion; Gas fuel analysis; Gas fuel storage; Heat storage; Natural gas; Power plants; Sensitivity analysis; Solar concentrators; Solar heating; Solar radiation; Thermoelectric power plants; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952031897

Fuel demanding sectors, such as transportation, impose utilisation of environmentally friendly technologies which will contribute in increased hydrogen production, which is considered as energy carrier for future applications. The state-of-the-art of solar/thermal power plants, and technologies for hydrogen production, storage and application are briefly reviewed. The utilisation of solar/thermal power plants from technical and economical point of views, for electricity production which will subsequently be exploited for hydrogen production is examined. It is argued that use of hydrogen to empower internal combustion engine vehicles, as well as fuel cell vehicles, can extensively satisfy the energy requirements of the transportation sector in the near future. Hydrogen usage can subsequently decrease the dependency on fossil fuel imports of local economies of southern Mediterranean insular areas with high solar radiation. Recent statistical data both for fuel demands for transportation, as well as pertinent CO 2 emissions are illustrated for the case study of the island of Cyprus. In the case study, the energy requirements for the transportation sector are used and the exploitation of solar/thermal power plants is analysed. From the case study results and findings, conclusions are drawn and recommendations are provided for the type and size of solar/thermal power plants, and the appropriate hydrogen technologies to be adapted in the near future for limiting dependency on fuel imports and largely decreasing CO2 emissions.","Compressed hydrogen; Electrolysis; Fuel cells; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Internal combustion engines; Liquefied hydrogen; Metal hydrides; Solar/thermal power plants","Compressed hydrogen; Electricity production; Energy carriers; Energy requirements; Environmentally-friendly technology; European Union; Fuel cell vehicles; Fuel demand; Future applications; Hydrogen technologies; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Liquefied hydrogen; Local economy; Metal hydrides; Solar/thermal power plants; Statistical datas; Transportation sector; Climate change; Combustion; Combustion equipment; Electric power generation; Electrochemistry; Electrolysis; Energy conversion; Engines; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Internal combustion engines; International trade; Motor transportation; Research; Solar power generation; Sun; Hydrogen production",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952015400

The main features of the studied system are high efficiency, operation at maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and long battery lifetime. The Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) operates at variable wind speed and it is connected to a full controlled active rectifier. The dc-link voltage is controlled to be fixed by using a storage system through Bi-directional power flow link. As the battery is the most costly part in the small WECS, the controller should have the ability to reduce the battery current ripple, which results in longer life for the battery. It is found here that the designed dc voltage level is the main factor that affects the battery current ripple. Therefore, a full study for choosing the optimum dc voltage level that results in better system performance is provided. A maximum power point tracking control is employed using hysteresis control for the fully controlled active rectifier. The complete system is studied, analyzed and simulated using PSIM to validate the system performance. ©2010 IEEE.","Bi-directional converter; H-bridge inverter; Hysteresis control; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG)","Active rectifiers; Battery lifetime; Bi-directional; Bidirectional converters; Complete system; Current ripples; DC voltage level; DC-link voltages; H-bridge inverter; High efficiency; High performance systems; Hysteresis control; Maximum power point tracking; Maximum power point tracking controls; Optimum design parameters; Optimum designs; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG); Power conditioning; Power flows; Storage systems; Wind energy conversion system; Wind energy systems; Wind speed; DC power transmission; Electric inverters; Energy conversion; Hysteresis; Magnetic devices; Optical flows; Permanent magnets; Primary batteries; Pumps; Synchronous generators; Wind power; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951787085

Various variants of hydrogen adsorption relative to nanotubes were considered, namely, the positions of hydrogen molecules at different distances from the nanotube walls in the direction perpendicular to the central axis and along it. Hydrogen adsorption inside and outside open carbon nanotubes in different positions relative to the surface of nanotubes was considered. Both single-wall and double-wall carbon nanotubes were considered in the work. It is shown for the former that the energy of physical adsorption of a hydrogen molecule inside nanotubes is higher than the energy of adsorption on the outside of the tubes. It turned out for the latter that the adsorption of hydrogen between the layers of the tubes is energetically more beneficial. In the case of single-layer carbon nanotubes, the dependence of the hydrogen adsorption energy on the diameter of the tube and its chirality was considered. The ""armchair"" and ""zig-zag"" types of nanotubes were used. Calculations showed that carbon nanotubes of different chirality but similar in diameter virtually identically adsorb hydrogen, but with increase in the diameter of a nanotube hydrogen adsorption becomes less advantageous energetically. Moreover, adsorption of hydrogen in nanotubes containing nanoinclusions of some transition metals was considered. These metals can naturally and partially fill nanotubes in the course of their catalytic synthesis where they are used as catalysts. In particular, it is shown that nanoclusters of iron and cobalt inside single-layer and multilayer carbon nanotubes activate them increasing considerably the energy of hydrogen adsorption inside nanotubes modified by the metals. The obtained results of modeling agree well with the well-known experimental data (Dillon et al., 1997; Li et al., 2001; Ye et al., 1999; Liu et al., 1999). © 2010 by Begell House, Inc.","Carbon nanotubes; Hydrogen storage; Physical adsorption; Quantum-mechanical modeling","Catalytic synthesis; Central axis; Double-wall carbon nanotubes; Energy of adsorption; Experimental data; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen molecule; Molecular hydrogen; Multi-layer carbon nanotubes; Nano inclusion; Nanotube walls; Parallel Computation; Physical adsorption; Quantum mechanical method; Quantum-mechanical modeling; Semi-empirical; Single layer; Single-wall; Structural feature; Zig-zag; Carbon nanotubes; Chirality; Cobalt; Enantiomers; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Models; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN); Stereochemistry; Walls (structural partitions); Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951787063

Special hardware primitives (counter, queues) are used for the the communication and synchronization of the cores that are most suitable in network processing applications.

These hybrid systems require separate dc-dc converters, or at least one dc-dc converter for the supercapacitor bank, to connect them to the dc-link of the grid connecting inverter. However, the use of such dc-dc converters introduces additional cost and power losses. Therefore, the possibility of direct connection of energy storage systems, to the dc-link of a diode clamped 3-level inverter is investigated in this paper. Even though the proposed topology does not use dc-dc converters, a vector selection method is proposed to produce a similar control flexibility that is found in the separate dc-dc converter topology. The major issue with the proposed system is the imminent imbalance of the neutral point potential. A PWM technique with modified carriers is used to solve this problem.

Development of cost-effective process for CO2 storage is one of the pressing issues in environmental protection. In last decade, meta-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a special class of hybrid nanoporous materials and been considered as versatile candidates for storage. Using molecular simulations, we have examined CO2 storage in a series of MOFs by varying metal center, organic linker, functional group and framework topology. The affinity with CO2 is enhanced by the addition of functional groups and the formation of constricted pores; both lead to a stronger adsorption at low pressures. The organic linker plays a critical role in tuning the free volume and accessible surface area, and thus largely determines CO2 adsorption at high pressures. The capacities correlate well with framework density, free volume, porosity and accessible surface area of MOFs. These molecular-based structure-function correlations are useful for a priori prediction of CO2 capacity and for rational screening of MOFs toward the high-efficacy CO2 storage. An equally important issue is CO2 capture from mixtures such as syngas, natural gas, and flue gas in chemical industry. We have investigated CO2 capture in a unique rho zeolite-like MOF (ZMOF) with anionic framework and charge-balancing extraframework ions. At ambient temperature and pressure, the selectivities are 1800 for CO2/H2 mixture, 80 for CO2/CH4 mixture, and 500 for CO2/N2 mixture. Compared with other MOFs and nanoporous materials reported to date, rho-ZMOF exhibits unprecedentedly high selective adsorption for these gas mixtures. The simulation results reveal that rho-ZMOF is a promising candidate for the separation of syngas, natural gas, and flue gas. Finally, simulation studies for CO2 separation in polymeric membranes will be also discussed.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951537959

The proposed scheme uses the popular dual inverter topology for grid connection as well as interfacing a supercapacitor bank. The dual inverter system is formed by cascading two 2-level inverters named as the ""main inverter"" and the ""auxiliary inverter"". The main inverter is powered by the rectified output of a wind turbine coupled permanent magnet synchronous generator. The auxiliary inverter is directly connected to a super capacitor bank. This approach eliminates the need for an interfacing dc-dc converter for the supercapacitor bank and thus improves the overall efficiency. A detailed analysis on the effects of non-integer dynamically changing voltage ratio is presented. The concept of integrated boost rectifier is used to carry out the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) of the wind turbine generator. Another novel feature of this paper is the power reference adjuster which effectively manages capacitor charging and discharging at extreme conditions.

The mentioned approach, called the energy hub, developed at the ETH Zurich, is used to simulate energy generation and storage units of an energy system and is particularly suitable for hourly or quarter-hourly unit dispatch cost optimization. The paper's first contribution is to show how the model of the generation and storage units of a system can be extended through demand response, to include the energy consumption side as an active participant in the system. The demand response schemes have a similar effect as energy storage and are defined as an analogue to energy storage units. The modeling approach and its utility are demonstrated through examples based on a city quarter of around 1.000 households in which buildings are currently heated with gas and oil boilers. The examples show how heat load management in combination with heat pumps and different cogeneration systems can influence load behaviour and total energy costs. For each system setting, energy inputs into the system are optimized for each hour of the chosen day. Fuel costs are naturally constant through the day and the whole dynamics of the system is determined by the changes in the electricity spot market price.

Proper storage and comprehensive utilization of power were needed to make full use of power. Several types of storage of power was introduced and a certain example for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) was given in this paper. In Demark, combined heating/cooling and power system was used to make improvement of energy efficiency, in which hot water was used as medium. By district heating and CHP, the rate of energy effeciency was increased about 50%, compared with conventional power plants.

The proposed system uses the popular dual inverter topology in which one inverter is supplied by a PV cell array and the other by a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). The resulting conversion structure is controlled in a way that both demand matching and maximum power point tracking of the PV cell array are performed simultaneously. This dual inverter topology can produces 2, 3, 4 and 5 level inverter voltage waveforms at the dc-link voltage ratios of 0:1, 1:1, 2:1 and 3:2 respectively. Since the output voltage of the PV cell array and the battery are uncorrelated and dynamically change, the resulting dc-link voltage ratio can take non-integer values as well. These noninteger dc-link voltage ratios produce unevenly distributed space vectors. Therefore, the main issue with the proposed system is the generation of undistorted current even in the presence of unevenly distributed and dynamically changing space vectors. A modified space vector modulation method is proposed in this paper to address this issue and its efficacy is proved by simulation results.

Film-capacitors have a lower capacitance per volume ratio; therefore a direct replacement leads to very large and expensive solutions, especially for single-phase applications. This paper presents an active circuit which acts as an interface between the DC-link of a PV-inverter and an additional storage capacitor. The voltage ripple in the storage capacitor can be increased compared to the DC-link capacitor, allowing a more efficient use of the stored energy and thus a massive reduction of the overall installed capacitance. An especially promising application can be found in module-integrated PV-inverters, because here the most efficient and cheapest topologies suffer from big electrolytic capacitors which deteriorate the lifetime. The paper focuses on different possible control schemes of the decoupling circuit. Results from simulations are used for discussing the proposed control methods. Also results from an experimental efficiency comparison between systems with electrolytic and film-capacitors are given.

This paper explores the importance and necessity of batteries within DG systems, especially with renewable power generation systems. The paper looks at different varieties of batteries with a specific emphasis on lead-acid batteries. To integrate batteries into renewable energy system models, the system and the energy storage, must be simulated to test the impact on as well as optimise the sizing of the system in terms of cost and efficiency. As batteries are a fairly large capital investment in the system, it is crucial to ensure maximum life span.

Motivated by the need to use novel fuel utilization techniques, such as porous burners and fuel cells, which have to be fed with a gaseous fuel, a Diesel fuel evaporation device, operating in the ""Stabilized Cool Flame"" (SCF) regime, is numerically investigated. In this device, a thermo-chemically stable lowtemperature oxidative environment is developed, which produces a well-mixed, heated air-fuel vapour gaseous mixture that can be subsequently fed either to premixed combustion systems or fuel reformer devices for fuel cell applications. In this work, the ANSYS CFX 11.0 CFD code is used to simulate the three-dimensional, turbulent, twophase, multi-component and reacting flow-field, developed in a SCF evaporation device. An innovative modelling approach, based on the fitting parameter concept, has been developed in order to simulate cool flame reactions. The model, based on physicochemical reasoning coupled with information from available experimental data, is implemented in the CFD code and is validated by comparing numerical predictions to experimental data obtained from an atmospheric pressure, recirculating flow SCF device. Numerical predictions are compared with temperature measurements, achieving satisfactory levels of agreement. The developed numerical tool can effectively support the theoretical study of the physical and chemical phenomena emerging in practical devices of liquid fuel spray evaporation in a SCF environment, as well as the design optimisation process of such innovative devices.",,"3d cfd modelling; CFD codes; Chemical phenomenas; Cool flame; Design optimisation; Diesel oil; Evaporation devices; Experimental data; Fitting parameters; Fuel cell application; Fuel evaporation; Fuel reformer; Fuel sprays; Gaseous Fuel; Gaseous mixture; Heated air; High energy densities; Low temperatures; Modelling approaches; Multicomponents; Novel fuels; Numerical predictions; Numerical tools; Oxidative environment; Porous burners; Premixed combustion; Reacting flows; Recirculating flow; Technological applications; Theoretical study; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric pressure; Computational fluid dynamics; Diesel fuels; Equipment; Evaporation; Forecasting; Fuel cells; Temperature measurement; Three dimensional; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651554957

The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is enrolled in this context. It's a collection of component (nodes) organized into a cooperative network. The main components of this network are tiny battery powered cameras with wireless communication capability. Therefore, image transfer in WSNs presents major challenge which raises issues related to its representation, its storage and its transmission. However, communication of image content has several bottlenecks, including limited bandwidth of cellular networks, restricted computational power, limited storage capability, and battery constraints of the appliances. In this paper, we address the energy, system lifetime and bandwidth bottlenecks of image communication. We present an efficient adaptive compression scheme that can significantly minimize the energy required for wireless image communication while meeting bandwidth constraints of wireless network and image quality. Based on Discrete Wavelet Transform, we propose an efficient image compression scheme, enabling significant reduction in computation energy needed with minimal degradation of image quality. Simulation results are done with C++ and show that the proposed scheme optimizes network lifetime, reduces significantly the amount of required memory and minimizes both (i) computation energy, by reducing the computation needed to compress an image and (ii) communication energy, consumed by the RF component which is proportional to the number of transmitted bits. ©2010 IEEE.","Energy optimization, skipped high-pass sub-band technique; Image compression; Wireless sensor network","Adaptive compression; Bandwidth bottlenecks; Bandwidth constraint; Battery powered; Cellular network; Communication energy; Compression scheme; Computation energy; Computational power; Cooperative networks; Energy efficient; Exponential growth; High-pass; Image communication; Image content; Image transfer; Limited bandwidth; Limited storage; Main component; Network lifetime; Radio frequency communication; RF components; Simulation result; Wireless communication capabilities; Wireless sensor; Wireless technologies; Bandwidth; Bandwidth compression; Cellular neural networks; Communication; Computer simulation; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image compression; Image quality; Optimization; Radio broadcasting; Radio transmission; Sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651515941

This is used by selected generators to adjust the generation to level out imbalances continuously, as well as in the case of disturbances in the system. However, previous theoretical and empirical studies indicate that this service might as well be provided by demandside control. In this paper we investigate in detail how thermal energy storage capacity in thermostatically controlled electric loads can be utilised for frequency-responsive control. We use two specific applications as cases for our work: Refrigerators and electric space heating. These two cases clearly illustrate the vast diversity of critical parameters like heat capacity, switching cycles, and temperature tolerance. Based on these, we design appropriate control algorithms that bridge the gap, between on the one hand, the unique properties and needs of each application, and on the other hand the requirements of the system operator. The control algorithms are implemented on a microcontroller unit that is interfaced with existing thermostats for each application. To validate the control algorithms and overall system design, a series of experiments are conducted, where the controller is subject to the actual grid frequency as well as designed frequency inputs, such as step inputs. The results demonstrate that frequency-responsive thermostats can indeed provide a wide range of the frequency-responsive ancillary services requested by the system operators, with little negative impact on device operation and performance. The design analyses and the implementation experience also show that the retro-fitting approach to frequency response limits the ability for some devices to provide these services, compared with integrating the frequency response when designing the thermostat.","Ancillary services; Demand; Frequency-responsive; Reserve","Ancillary service; Control algorithms; Critical parameter; Demand; Demand-side; Design Analysis; Device operations; Empirical studies; Frequency-responsive; Grid frequency; Heat capacities; Microcontroller unit; Negative impacts; Power balance; Power systems; Reserve; Switching cycles; System design; System operator; Temperature tolerance; Algorithms; Controllers; Design; Heat storage; Heating; Mathematical operators; Systems analysis; Thermography (temperature measurement); Thermostats; Frequency response",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651462948

However, the global nature of image-wise transform renders the performance at local high-frequency edge area suboptimal. The computation load for global inverse transform also prohibit the use of wavelet on video coding over legacy machines. This paper presents an efficient image coding scheme which tackles the mission of image compression in a completely different way. Instead of globally filtering the image as a whole, the scheme classifies local image blocks into categories. Different spatially decorrelators are applied to the blocks as pre-processing step before transformation and entropy coding. Experiment result shows that the proposed scheme outperforms JPEG2000 by a maximum of 6dB, which translates to an average file size reduction of 18%.

The nodes are highly resource-constrained in terms of energy, processing, and data storage capacity. Thus, the protocols used in WSNs must be highly energy-efficient.

In this paper, we show how network signaling frames of state-of-the-art synchronized communication protocols for low power WSNs supporting mobile nodes can be used for positioning.

Blood pressure and metabolic changes are correlated when heat accumulation is due to increment of the body core temperature (+1.0 °C). However, increase in temperature could be controlled by lowering dialysate's temperature using two main modalities techniques (isothermic and thermoneural) with different patient's thermal balance consequences, not yet well studied. In this work, a new method to observe the main physiological parameters (hearth rate variability (HRV), blood pressure, BTM dialysate temperature control and substrate utilization by indirect calorimtery) which are involved in hemodiafitration (HDF), are displayd. An experiment was carried out in a group of 5 patients waiting kidney transplant. In each patient, EE was assessed as well as the HRV during isothermic and thermoneutral modalities as a manner of cross and prospective study (a) at before therapy, (b) during therapy and (c) at the end of the HDF therapy. Power extraction was also measured by a BTM (Blood Temperature Monitor from Fresenius Inc), in order to determine how the dialysate temperature was controlled. The results showed important method's advantages which place the BTM performance as unstable control system with the possibility to produce undesirable HRV changes as the vagotonical response. However more patient cases are needed in order to identify the real advantage of this new method. © 2010 IEEE.",,"Blood temperature; Core temperature; Dialysates; Heat accumulation; Hemodiafiltration; Kidney transplants; Metabolic changes; Patient case; Physiological parameters; Power extraction; Prospective study; Substrate utilization; Thermal balance; Blood; Blood pressure; Hydrodynamics; Metabolism; Physiological models; hemodialysis fluid; adult; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biological model; blood pressure measurement; calorimetry; chemistry; chronic kidney failure; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted therapy; computer graphics; computer interface; computer simulation; electrocardiography; energy metabolism; equipment; equipment design; equipment failure; female; heart rate; hemodiafiltration; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; information retrieval; kinesiotherapy; male; mathematical computing; methodology; pathophysiology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; statistical model; thermoregulation; three dimensional imaging; Adult; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Blood Pressure Determination; Body Temperature Regulation; Calorimetry; Computer Graphics; Computer Simulation; Electrocardiography; Energy Metabolism; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Exercise Therapy; Female; Heart Rate; Hemodiafiltration; Hemodialysis Solutions; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Subtraction Technique; Therapy, Computer-Assisted; User-Computer Interface",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650848950

The thermal behavior of these types of memories has not been considered in detail. This thermal behavior plays an important role in the reliability of silicon devices and in their static (leakage) power consumption. In this paper, we propose two different techniques to improve the thermal behavior of SPMs. First, we propose a hardware-based, thermal-aware address translation technique that physically distributes memory accesses to consecutive addresses evenly over the whole memory area. Second, we propose a software-based, thermal-aware address generation technique. This technique tries to distribute the variables that are allocated to the SPM in such a way that an even thermal distribution is achieved. The first technique works particularly well for applications with a regular access pattern, whereas the second technique can also improve the behavior of applications with irregular access patterns. The two techniques thus complement each other and work well together. Using the first technique we show that the peak temperature of an SPM in 65nm technology, when running a typical streaming application, is decreased by up-to 10.0°C. Temperature cycling is reduced from up-to 14.8°C"" to almost zero in comparison with a non-thermal-aware solution. For our benchmark applications with an irregular access pattern, the second technique is able to reduce the peak temperature by up-to 3.5°C. These savings for both techniques are obtained without any performance degradation or extra silicon area. © 2010 IEEE.",,"65nm technology; Access patterns; Address generation; Address translation; Benchmark applications; Memory access; Nonthermal; On-chip storage; Peak temperatures; Performance degradation; Power Consumption; Scratch pad memory; Silicon area; Silicon devices; Software-based; Streaming applications; Temperature cycling; Thermal behaviors; Thermal distributions; Thermal-aware; Design; Embedded systems; Multiprocessing systems; Benchmarking",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650735652

The use of latent heat storage materials in lime mortars aims to reduce the energy consumption of buildings. This work intends to evaluate the impact of phase change materials (PCM) incorporation in rheological and hardened state properties of aerial lime mortars. A fresh state characterization was conducted through the rheological study complemented with flow table tests of different mortar formulations. To complete the mortar characterization some hardened state properties (porosity, mechanical strength and microstructure) after 28 days, were also evaluated. It was concluded that, the PCM microcapsules incorporation does not compromise aerial lime mortars overall performance and may help to improve some characteristics like workability and mechanical strength. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the energy demand in old buildings, improving their performance and sustainability. © Appl.

This article reviews the effects of gamma and UV-C radiations on the control of postharvest diseases on a wide variety of fruits, as well as the possibility that these treatments promote physical-chemical changes during the postharvest phase. Findings: Gamma and UV-C irradiations are physical treatments that can be used for the control of postharvest diseases. Irradiation has been used to delay ripening-associated processes and control pathogens and insects, and different types of radiation have been tested for fruits. The primary mode of action of many physical treatments is disinfection of the commodity. Thus, fungal spores and mycelial infections on and in the outer cell layers of fruits or vegetables are removed or destroyed. However, physical stress can lead to induced resistance against future infection in some species. Directions for future research: The data accumulated so far indicate that UV-C and ionising energy has some potential applications for fresh fruits. These applications have real potential amongst physical methods for controlling postharvest diseases and can also extend the postharvest life of fruits by delaying ripening. Besides economic and logistic factors, and opposition based on psychological discernment problems due to lack of public knowledge on wholesomeness of irradiated food, physical-chemical changes frequently constitute a dose limitation. Proper information about the safety and benefits of irradiated foods could increase the level of understanding and acceptance of irradiated products by consumers. © 2010 Stewart Postharvest Solutions (UK) Ltd.","Control; Gamma radiation; Quality; Resistance induction; Rots; UV-C light","Fungi; Hexapoda",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650499836

While weight loss or impaired growth can lead to muscle wastage, as well as to susceptibility to infections and organ dysfunctions, the development of excess fat predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, with insulin resistance as a central feature of the disease entities of the metabolic syndrome. Although widely used as the phenotypic expression of adiposity in population and gene-search studies, body mass index (BMI), that is, weight/height2 (H2), which was developed as an operational definition for classifying both obesity and malnutrition, has considerable limitations in delineating fat mass (FM) from fat-free mass (FFM), in particular at the individual level. After an examination of these limitations within the constraints of the BMI–FM% relationship, this paper reviews recent advances in concepts about health risks related to body composition phenotypes, which center upon (i) the partitioning of BMI into an FM index (FM/H2) and an FFM index (FFM/H2), (ii) the partitioning of FFM into organ mass and skeletal muscle mass, (iii) the anatomical partitioning of FM into hazardous fat and protective fat and (iv) the interplay between adipose tissue expandability and ectopic fat deposition within or around organs/tissues that constitute the lean body mass. These concepts about body composition phenotypes and health risks are reviewed in the light of race/ethnic variability in metabolic susceptibility to obesity and the metabolic syndrome. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

District heating (DH) is used to supply heat to areas with high energy demand. However, there are still detached houses and sparse areas that are not connected to a DH network. In such areas, electrical heating or oil/pellet boilers are used to meet the heat demand. Extending the existing DH network to those spare areas is not economically feasible because of the small heat demand and the large investment required for the expansion. The mobilized thermal energy storage (M-TES) system is an alternative source of heat for detached buildings or sparse areas using industrial heat. In this paper, the integration of a combined heat and power (CHP) plant and an M-TES system is analyzed. Furthermore, the impacts of four options of the integrated system are discussed, including the power and heat output in the CHP plant. The performance of the M-TES system is likewise discussed. © 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","combined heat and power; detached houses; district heating; Mobilized thermal energy system; thermal energy storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649903139

Experimental results have shown that bulk and thin films of crystalline Ge4Sb 1Te5 have ferroelectric properties with a ferroelectric-paraelectric transition temperature Tc about 600 K. This transition is reversible and probably related to the phase transformation from the fcc-Ge4Sb1Te5 to a phase close to the fcc-GeTe. It was found that films have ferroelectric domains with dimension approximately equal to the dimension of grains, when the films were crystallized without electrical field. An external electric field increases the degree of polarization of Ge4Sb1Te5 films which leads to an increase in domain dimensions and in capacitance at Tc of about two orders of magnitude compared to films crystallized without an electrical field. It was found that the applied external electrical field also increases grain dimensions and changes the crystallization kinetics, decreasing the onset of crystallization temperature, the effective activation energy of crystallization and the Avrami exponent. These changes could be related with an increase in atomic diffusion, promoting the growth of crystalline phase. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The SMES is expected to be the smart storage device for power system stabilization. Although the stabilizing effect of SMES is significant, the SMES is quite costly. Particularly, the superconducting magnetic coil size which is the essence of the SMES, must be carefully selected. On the other hand, various generation and load changes, unpredictable network structure, etc., cause system uncertainties. The power controller of SMES which is designed without considering such uncertainties, may not tolerate and loses stabilizing effect. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes the new design of robust SMES controller taking coil size and system uncertainties into account. The structure of the active and reactive power controllers is the 1st-order lead-lag compensator. No need for the exact mathematical representation, system uncertainties are modeled by the inverse input multiplicative perturbation. Without the difficulty of the trade-off of damping performance and robustness, the optimization problem of control parameters is formulated. The particle swarm optimization is used for solving the optimal parameters at each coil size automatically. Based on the normalized integral square error index and the consideration of coil current constraint, the robust SMES with the smallest coil size which still provides the satisfactory stabilizing effect, can be achieved. Simulation studies in the two-area four-machine interconnected power system show the superior robustness of the proposed robust SMES with the smallest coil size under various operating conditions over the non-robust SMES with large coil size. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The paper is based on the Advanced International Policies (AIP) scenario of the European Renewable Energy Council agency forecast by the year 2040, which foresees the share of 82% of RES, extended to 100% of RES. The key element that creates conditions for achieving this ambitious scenario is an innovative solution of the so-called solar hydroelectric power plant (SHE) which is basically combined photovoltaic (PV) power plant and pump storage hydro (PSH) which can provide continuous supply of electric power and energy to consumers. Therefore, SHE is presented in this paper as the main building element of the future SEPS. For covering unit consumption of electric energy of 1 GWh in a power system, the paper calculates unit values of the SHE system: 0.73 MW of PV generator; 4,545 m2 of PV generator; 0.36 hm 3 of reservoir volume, 0.21 GWh of PSH energy and 0.24 MW of PSH. In the case of the power system in Croatia, which is rich in solar and hydroenergy and whose climate conditions are very similar to those in the European countries, it has been shown that implementation of the green strategy of energy balance fulfilling can be realized with present day technology. Precisely, this fact shows that further increase of efficiency of SHE and other RES and their combining into RES+PHS power plants, along with increase in the cost of classic power fuels and the growing needs for environment protection, the proposed solution of SEPS realization could be widely important and thus become a serious alternative to the existing energy strategies and a guideline to decision makers in many countries. © 2010 ASCE.","Energy policy; Energy storage; Photovoltaic; Renewable resources; Solar energy; Sustainable development","Building element; Climate condition; Croatia; Decision makers; Electric energies; Electric power; Environment protection; European Countries; European renewable energy councils; Existing energies; Innovative solutions; International policies; Key elements; Photovoltaic; Power systems; PV generators; Renewable energy source; Renewable resource; Reservoir volume; Sustainable energy supply; Electric energy storage; Electric equipment protection; Electric load forecasting; Electric power systems; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Flywheels; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Planning; Power plants; Pumps; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Sustainable development; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649283752

Three suture morphologies were simulated with an increasing interdigitation index (I.I.): butt-ended, moderate interdigitated, and complex interdigitated. The collagen matrix within all sutures was modelled as an isotropic material, and as an orthotropic material in the interdigitated sutures with fibre alignment as reported in studies of miniature pigs. Static uniform compressive or tensile loading was applied to the complex. In interdigitated sutures with isotropic material properties, the orientation of the maximum (tensile) principal stresses within the suture matched the collagen fibre orientation observed in compressed and tensed sutures of miniature pigs. This suggests that randomly arranged sutural collagen fibres could optimise to an orientation most appropriate to withstand the predominant type of loading. A compression-resistant fibre arrangement imparted the highest suture strain energy relative to the isotropic and tension-resistant arrangements, indicating that this configuration maximises energy storage. A comparison across the different suture morphologies indicated that bone strain energy generally decreased with a decrease in I.I., irrespective of the sutural fibre arrangement. However, high bone stress at the interdigitation apices shifted to the limbs of the suture with an increase in I.I. These combined findings highlight the importance of suture morphology and anisotropy as properties having a significant influence on sutural mechanics. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Anisotropy; Bone; Skull; Strain energy; Stress; Suture","Collagen fibres; Collagen matrices; Cranial sutures; Finite element models; Interdigitations; Isotropic materials; Orthotropic materials; Principal stress; Skull; Suture; Tensile loading; Tensile loads; Anisotropy; Bone; Collagen; Finite element method; Morphology; Strain; Strain energy; Tensile stress; Fibers; collagen fiber; anisotropy; article; biomechanics; bone strength; bone stress; bone structure; compressive strength; controlled study; cranial suture; finite element analysis; functional morphology; mathematical computing; mathematical model; minipig; nonhuman; priority journal; simulation; skull suture; tensile strength; Young modulus; Animals; Anisotropy; Biomechanics; Collagen; Compressive Strength; Cranial Sutures; Finite Element Analysis; Models, Biological; Stress, Mechanical; Swine; Swine, Miniature; Tensile Strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78549287081

In this work, aligned and homogenously distributed diphenylalanine PNT have been used to modify carbon electrodes for SC devices. Electrochemical properties of PNT coatings of different density and height, modifying carbon electrodes have been studied. We have found that aligned PNT arrays significantly increase the double layer capacitance of the carbon electrodes. The found enlargement of the PNT-modified electrode capacitance has been ascribed to increasing of usable electrode surface area of the carbon electrodes coated by PNT. We show that the critical factor of the accumulation process of the electrolyte ions at the PNT-modified electrode surface is a wetting process of the PNT nanoscale hydrophilic channels by aqueous electrolyte. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Aqueous electrolyte; Bio-inspired; Bio-inspired materials; Biological structures; Carbon electrode; Critical factors; Double-layer capacitance; Electrochemical energy storage devices; Electrode surface area; Electrolyte ion; Elementary building blocks; Hydrophilic channels; Modified electrodes; Nano scale; Ordered nanostructures; Peptide nanotubes; Self-assembled; Supercapacitor electrodes; Supercapacitors; Wetting process; Biological materials; Capacitance; Capacitors; Electrochemical properties; Electrolytes; Electrolytic capacitors; Molecular biology; Nanospheres; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes; Peptides; Physical vapor deposition; Electrochemical electrodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149281392

Affected energy production is however difficult to determine. In this article the future long-term affected energy production is identified by use of energy system analysis. The focus is on different uses of waste for energy production. The Waste-to-Energy technologies analysed include co-combustion of coal and waste, anaerobic digestion and thermal gasification. The analysis is based on optimization of both investments and production of electricity, district heating and bio-fuel in a future possible energy system in 2025 in the countries of the Northern European electricity market (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Germany). Scenarios with different CO2 quota costs are analysed. It is demonstrated that the waste incineration continues to treat the largest amount of waste. Investments in new waste incineration capacity may, however, be superseded by investments in new Waste-to-Energy technologies, particularly those utilising sorted fractions such as organic waste and refuse derived fuel. The changed use of waste proves to always affect a combination of technologies. What is affected varies among the different Waste-to-Energy technologies and is furthermore dependent on the CO2 quota costs and on the geographical scope. The necessity for investments in flexibility measures varies with the different technologies such as storage of heat and waste as well as expansion of district heating networks. Finally, inflexible technologies such as nuclear power plants are shown to be affected. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Cocombustion; Consequential life-cycle assessment; Denmark; District heating networks; Electricity market; Energy productions; Energy system analysis; Energy systems; Finland; Germany; Organic wastes; Thermal gasification; Waste-to-energy technologies; Anaerobic digestion; Coal combustion; District heating; Electric network analysis; Energy conversion; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Heating; Investments; Life cycle; Nuclear power plants; Refuse derived fuels; Refuse incineration; Refuse incinerators; Sewage; Systems analysis; Technology; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; carbon dioxide; coal; carbon dioxide; electricity supply; energy efficiency; environmental impact; incineration; investment; life cycle analysis; waste management; anaerobic digestion; article; biofuel production; combustion; Denmark; energy cost; energy yield; environmental impact assessment; Finland; gasification; Germany; incineration; Norway; organic waste; power supply; priority journal; process model; process optimization; sensitivity analysis; Sweden; system analysis; waste disposal; waste management; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Energy Resources; Incineration; Models, Theoretical; Power Plants; Northern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957658942

However, a FC system combined with an energy storage system (ESS) can perform better for vehicle propulsion as considering several points. As the additional ESS can fulfill the transient power demand fluctuations, the FC system can be downsized to fit the base power demand without facing peak loads. Besides, braking energy can be recovered by the ESS. Interfacing of traction drive requirements with characteristics and modes of operation of on-board generation units and ESSs calls for suitable power electronic converter configuration. In this paper, a FC/UC hybrid vehicular power system using a multi-input converter-based power interface is proposed.

Using a new type of terrestrial laser scanner, which is particularly suited for measurements of snow covered surfaces, snow depth was monitored in a high alpine catchment during an ablation period. From these measurements snow water equivalents and ablation rates were calculated. This allowed us for the first time to obtain a high resolution (2.5 m cell size) picture of spatial variability of the snow cover and its temporal development. A very high variability of the snow cover with snow depths between 0-9 m at the end of the accumulation season was observed. This variability decreased during the ablation phase, while the dominant snow deposition features remained intact. The average daily ablation rate was between 15 mm/d snow water equivalent at the beginning of the ablation period and 30 mm/d at the end. The spatial variation of ablation rates increased during the ablation season and could not be explained in a simple manner by geographical or meteorological parameters, which suggests significant lateral energy fluxes contributing to observed melt. It is qualitatively shown that the effect of the lateral energy transport must increase as the fraction of snow free surfaces increases during the ablation period. © Author(s) 2010.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954544927

A simple hypothetical example is used to compare the results obtained from three alternative allocation methods for allocating GHG emissions between different stored products: allocation by mass (tonnes), storage time (tonne.day), and on the basis of heat load calculation and refrigeration effectiveness estimation (kWh).","Carbon footprint; Energy efficiency; Life cycle assessment; Refrigeration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053107751

Adipose tissue is not simply a storage depot for surplus energy but rather, is an active organ that modulates various biological functions and synthesizes and secretes multiple cytokines into the circulation. Adiponectin and visfatin are two cytokines which are considered to be possible links between obesity, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. In turn, concentrations of adiponectin and visfatin are mainly influenced by the overall body fat mass which is one of the main determinants of insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, physical activity and exercise are negatively related to body fat mass and also have an influence on cytokine concentrations in the blood. It is of particular interest whether physical activity or lifestyle interventions have a positive effect on adiponectin and visfatin concentrations in the blood.

Food restriction during AA increased circulating ghrelin, corticosterone, decreased leptin, and ameliorated arthrogram score and systemic inflammation compared to normofeeding. Overfeeding worsened arthrogram score and systemic inflammation, and led to lipid accumulation in the liver, but not to alterations of adipokine and ghrelin plasma levels relative to normofeeding. Independently of feeding status, AA induced cachexia, in which modulation of mRNA expressions for appetite-regulating neuropeptides (NPY, AgRP, POMC, CART) in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) does not play a primary role. The overexpression of IL-1β mRNA in the ARC suggests its role in the mechanisms of impaired energy balance during AA under all feeding conditions.

The method is based on slowing down of sample deformation by viscous flow above the glass transition due to macroscopic crystal growth. This process might be detected by thermomechanical analysis (TMA). The influences of sample length, applied force and heating rate have been examined. Newly developed method has been used to study crystallization in (GeS2)0.3(Sb2S3)0.7 glass. It was found that a typical TMA measurement reasonably well corresponds to previously reported crystal growth kinetics by means of optical microscopy. The activation energy obtained from the shift of extrapolated TMA onset temperature with heating rate (E = 286 ± 8 kJ mol-1) is very similar to the activation energy of Sb2S3 crystal growth in (GeS2)0.3(Sb2S3)0.7 glass (EG = 288 ± 7 kJ mol-1) from optical microscopy measurements.

The subsoils at the site are primarily soft marine clay deposits up to 10m deep. One third of the site was covered by a former garbage dump site. The original proposed foundation was conventional piled foundation but this was later found to present a few undesirable construction limitations such as noise pollution during pile driving; and transportation and storage of pre-cast piles on a congested site. Alternative ground improvement technology comprising of Vibro Concrete Columns, Cement Columns and Vibro Stone Columns were introduced to support the process tanks and ancillary structures. The construction methods are considered environmental friendly as they produced minimum spoil and consumed relatively low energy.

In a coalbed methane (CBM) well, pumping water from the coalbeds lowers this pressure, facilitating the release of methane from the coal for extraction and use as an energy source. Water pumped from coalbeds during this process--CBM 'produced water'--is managed through some combination of treatment, disposal, storage, or use, subject to compliance with federal and state regulations. CBM produced water management can be challenging for regulatory agencies, CBM well operators, water treatment companies, policy makers, landowners, and the public because of differences in the quality and quantity of produced water; available infrastructure; costs to treat, store, and transport produced water; and states' legal consideration of water and produced water. Some states consider produced water as waste, whereas others consider it a beneficial byproduct of methane production. Thus, although current technologies allow CBM produced water to be treated to any desired water quality, the majority of CBM produced water is presently being disposed of at least cost rather than put to beneficial use. This book specifically examines the Powder River, San Juan, Raton, Piceance, and Uinta CBM basins in the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah.

This 1-year randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of SODIS of drinking water and motivation on the incidence of dysentery and nondysentery diarrhea among children of age 6 months to 5 years living in periurban communities in South Africa. We compared 383 children in 297 households using SODIS with 335 children in 267 households with no intervention. At baseline 62.4% of the study households had stored water which met World Health Organization guidelines for zero thermotolerant coliforms per 100 mL. Dysentery was recorded using a pictorial diary. Incidence of dysentery was significantly associated with higher motivation, defined as 75% or better completion of diarrhea data. Incidence rates were lower in those drinking solar disinfected water (incidence rate ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.39-1.0, P = 0.071) but not statistically significant. Compared with the control, participants with higher motivation achieved a significant reduction in dysentery (incidence rate ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.16-0.81, P = 0.014). However, there was no significant reduction in risk at lower levels of motivation. Solar disinfection was not significantly associated with nondysentery diarrhea risk overall (P = 0.419). A statistically significant reduction in dysentery was achieved only in households with higher motivation, showing that motivation is a significant determinant for measurable health gains.

The life cycle of the species consists of three life stages, embryonic, juvenile and adult whereby the transitions of life stages (gametogenesis, birth and maturation) occur at species-specific sizes. The dynamics of the population is studied in a semi-chemostat environment where the inflowing food concentration is periodic (annual). A dynamic energy budget-based continuous-time model is used to describe the uptake of the food, storage in reserves and allocation of the energy to growth, maintenance, development (embryos, juveniles) and reproduction (adults). A discrete-event process is used for modelling reproduction. At a fixed spawning date of the year, the reproduction buffer is emptied and a new cohort is formed by eggs with a fixed size and energy content. The population consists of cohorts: For each year one consisting of individuals with the same age which die after their last reproduction event. The resulting mathematical model is a finite-dimensional set of ordinary differential equations with fixed 1-year periodic boundary conditions yielding a stroboscopic map. We will study the evolutionary development of the population using the adaptive dynamics approach. The trait is the timing of spawning. Pairwise and mutual invasibility plots are calculated using bifurcation analysis of the stroboscopic map. The evolutionary singular strategy value belonging to the evolutionary endpoint for the trait allows for an interpretation of the reproduction strategy of the population. In a case study, parameter values from the literature for the bivalve Macoma balthica are used. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Adaptive dynamics; Bifurcation analysis; Bivalve Macoma balthica; Dynamic energy budget-structured model; Iteroparous species","adaptation; bioenergetics; bivalve; chemostat; data set; developmental stage; energy budget; evolutionary biology; food availability; life cycle; life history trait; mortality; numerical model; population structure; reproductive strategy; resource allocation; spawning; Bivalvia; Macoma balthica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149271629

While it has been under scrutiny in the last decade and there is a constant demand for alternative technologies, it remains the only established method for extended storage of table grapes. We present 3 tools which improve the efficiency, longevity and accuracy of storage of grapes with SO2. Most of the industry is packaging grapes in cartons containing liners in which dual release SO2 sheets are placed on the grapes. This packaging confines the SO2 to the clusters but it compromises the efficiency of forced air cooling. The alternative method is to avoid the use of liners and to wrap the pallet with polyethylene stretch film. This process reduces forced-air cooling time, saving energy and a considerable amount of plastic packaging material. The level of SO2 in the pallet is low because the pallet's bottom is open and the quality of the rachis is high because the humidity in the pallet is high as well. Adoption of this technology for extended storage of 'Red Globe' grapes stored in plastic boxes, by closing the bottom of the pallets, proved to be problematic due to high levels of SO2 and short duration of release. By placing the SO2 releasing sheets in plastic bags containing holes in the bottom, it was possible to extend the storage from 3 month to 4.5 month with satisfactory quality and levels of sulfites within the grapes that did not exceed the threshold of 10 mg kg-1. To improve the quality of the process we developed an analytical method to measure the rate of SO2 released from the SO2 sheets. These 3 methodologies are practiced on a commercial scale enabling storage of table grapes of consistent quality.","Decay; Fruit quality; Sulfur dioxide measurement; Vitis vinifera","Vitaceae; Vitis vinifera",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650815847

The European Union promotes systems for combined heat and power generation. In Europe in general - and Poland in particular - there are numerous large district heating systems powered by CHP plants. Most plants are equipped with back-pressure turbines. Energy conversion efficiency for this class of installations reaches approximately 80%. The main disadvantage of cogeneration is that electricity production is directly related to heat production (i.e. demand). The load curve of the heating system varies depending on the time of day, day of the week, and season. On the daily scale the largest heat demand is observed at night and smallest during the day. In contrast, electricity demand is lowest at night and highest during the day, with two standard peaks in the morning and afternoon. Accordingly, electricity is at its most expensive at that time. Therefore it is beneficial to maximise electricity generation during the morning and afternoon peaks, and minimise it during the decreased night-time demand. Electricity and heat outputs at a CHP plant can be uncoupled by using a heat accumulator. This study proposes a mathematical model to plan out a large CHP plant with a heat storage tank to be used for the purposes of operational optimization. Potential increases in profits from electricity sales enabled by the heat accumulator are also quantified.","Cogeneration; Heat accumulator; Heating system; Optimization","Back-pressure turbines; CHP plant; Cogeneration; Combined heat and power generation; District heating system; Electricity demands; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Electricity sales; European Union; Generate electricity; Heat accumulator; Heat demands; Heat output; Heat production; Heat storage tanks; Heating system; Load curves; Operational optimization; Time of day; Conversion efficiency; District heating; Electric power generation; Electricity; Energy conversion; Heat storage; Heating; Heating equipment; Mathematical models; Medical nanotechnology; Optimization; Profitability; Sensors; Electric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049428706

As in adults, childhood obesity is closely related to hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance (IR) syndrome. Moreover, obese children have been found to be at increased risk of becoming obese adults. Obese children and adolescents tend to develop serious medical and psychosocial complications and also are at greater risk morbidity and mortality in adulthood. The molecular basis of the pathogenesis of obesity-linked disorders has not been fully elucidated. Adipose tissue serves not only as an energy storage organ, but also as an endocrine organ. It releases many factors with autocrine, paracrine and endocrine functions. Adipokines such as leptin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, adipsin, visfatin, and adiponectin are biologically active molecules produced by adipose tissue. They play a role in energy homeostasis, and in glucose and lipid metabolism. Adiponectin level, unlike that of other adipocytokines, is decreased in obesity and increased after weight reduction.

Microbes may interfere with the hygiene and storage stability of feed and different by-products utilised in the feed industry; reduce palatability of the feed; and reduce bioavailability of minerals and proteins. It is therefore of great interest to manage/control the microbial species present in animal feed. Fungi (yeasts and moulds) belong to the natural microbial flora on plants and thus also occur in plant-derived feed during storage. The impact of yeasts on storage is not well defined, but they may degrade organic compounds and thus decrease the nutritional value of the feed, as well as degrade lactic acid in silage, decreasing the preservation capacity. Moulds can produce mycotoxins and spores. Spores can promote allergic reactions while mycotoxins can persist in the feed and food chain, having acute or long term toxic effects on animals and humans. Traditional methods of preservation include drying or the addition of acids, both of which are very energy consuming. Inappropriate processing may even increase the risk of mould contamination. Biopreservation based on microbial activities may therefore provide a sustainable alternative to traditional conservation methods. © 2011 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.","Biocontrol; Feed preservation; Lactic acid bacteria; Moulds; Mycotoxins; Yeasts",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903802570

In BASF's process, a metal oxide and citric acid are simply mixed in water in a stirred-tank reactor, which leads to the production of cubic MOF with the metal atoms at the corners of the organic frame. The key to making the synthesis viable on a large scale is that an organic solvent is not required, making the process safer and environmentally friendly. The company is able to achieve large surface areas and high porosity, which enables the MOF to hold relatively large amounts of gases. The pore size and polarity can be adjusted for specific applications.

However, the interpretation of the observed temperature signal is often not straightforward due to its non-conservative behavior. The objective of this research is to explore and quantify the retardation of heat along a small first order stream, with the long-term objective of identifying different runoff mechanisms by using heat as a tracer. We carried out two tracer experiments. A small water storage basin was emptied into the stream over time periods of 50 and 18. min increasing stream discharge roughly by a factor of two. Salt was added as a tracer in both experiments. In the second experiment the temperature of the added water was additionally cooled to about 0 °C by adding snow into the storage basin. The electrical conductivity was measured at three points along the 565. m long stream, while the temperature was measured with a resolution of 2. m and 3. min using the DTS system. During the second experiment, we observed a significant time lag between the salt breakthrough curves (BTC) and the heat BTCs. We routed the water with a hydraulic model, which we coupled with a 1-D advection-dispersion model, and in case of heat we also coupled it with an energy balance. We used the salt BTCs to calibrate the transient storage zones, after which we applied the energy balance to simulate the heat BTCs. Although heat exchange with the streambed delays the advection of heat, it could not fully explain the retarded BTC we observed. We hypothesize that the retardation of heat is caused by its storage in the many rock clasts present in the stream and positioned on top of the streambed. To allow for water-rock clast interaction, we included the fraction of rock clasts in the storage term of the advection-dispersion equation. In this approach we only have to add one additional parameter to account for the fraction of rock clasts in the cross-sectional area of the stream. By applying a fraction of 35% we were able to simulate the retarded heat BTC correctly. Although the fraction of rock clasts in the stream will change with different water levels, it is a straightforward approach, which enables us to couple the hydraulic model directly with the advection-dispersion model, while ensuring that the retardation of heat is simulated correctly. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","DTS; Retardation of heat; Transient storage modeling","Added water; Advection-dispersion equation; Breakthrough curve; Cross sectional area; Dispersion models; Distributed temperature sensing; DTS; Effect of In; Electrical conductivity; First-order streams; Heat as a tracers; Heat exchange; Retardation of heat; Rock clasts; Space and time; Stream discharge; Streambeds; Temperature signal; Time lag; Time-periods; Tracer experiment; Transient storage; Transient storage modeling; Water storage; Advection; Computer simulation; Dispersions; Electric conductivity; Energy balance; Experiments; Hydraulic models; Hydraulic structures; Rocks; Water levels; Rivers; advection-diffusion equation; breakthrough curve; computer simulation; data interpretation; discharge; energy balance; experimental study; flow modeling; heat production; hydrology; numerical model; one-dimensional modeling; quantitative analysis; runoff; streamflow; tracer; water storage; water temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649795706

Viscoelastic behaviour of both uncured and cured specimens filled with carbon black exhibits a strain-dependent behaviour. Storage modulus (G') and damping factor (tanδ) significantly increase with increasing carbon black loading and/or specific surface area. Mechanical properties are found to be governed by combined effects of hydrodynamic effect, filler transient network, molecular slippage and crosslink density, associated probably with black dispersion particularly at high black loading.

As many new grid participants like combined heat and power plants involve other forms of energy in addition to electricity, the consideration of multi-energy networks represents a useful planning approach. This approach consists in an integrated analysis of combined infrastructures for conversion, transmission and storage of electricity, heat and chemical energy carriers. The integrated operation of systems with different energy carriers offers a new degree of freedom to system planners: energy can be generated, stored, and transmitted in various forms before being distributed to consumers in the adequate form. Different possible solutions for the design of multi-energy systems will exhibit differences in costs and risks. In order to adequately assess these two quantities, mean-variance portfolio theory is applied. Portfolio theory has been used in several cases of electricity generation planning. This paper shows the required modeling adaptations for the analysis of portfolios with multiple energy outputs and illustrates the application of portfolio theory in the context of multi-energy infrastructures. The presented method can be used for the integrated planning of energy systems including the generation, the transmission and the possibility of additional conversion of multiple energy carriers.

Adenosine dysregulation can cause various pathologies, exemplified by a deficiency in adenosine deaminase in severe combined immunodeficiency. We have established a Drosophila model to study the effects of increased adenosine in vivo by mutating the main Drosophila adenosine deaminase-related growth factor (ADGF-A). Using a genetic screen, we show here that the increased extracellular adenosine in the adgf-a mutant is associated with hyperglycemia and impairment in energy storage. The adenosine works in this regard through the adenosine receptor as an anti-insulin hormone in parallel to adipokinetic hormone, a glucagon counterpart in flies. If not regulated properly, this action can lead to a loss of energy reserves (wasting) and death of the organism. Because adenosine signaling is associated with the immune response and the response to stress in general, our results mark extracellular adenosine as a good candidate signal involved in the wasting syndrome that accompanies various human pathologies.",,"adenosine; adenosine deaminase; adenosine deaminase related growth factor a; adipokinetic hormone; insulin antibody; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; controlled study; death; Drosophila; embryo; energy resource; enzyme activity; enzyme release; gene repression; genetic screening; hemolymph; hyperglycemia; immune response; in vivo study; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; stress; wasting syndrome; Adenosine; Adipokines; Animals; Caloric Restriction; Carbohydrates; Diet; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins; Energy Metabolism; Extracellular Space; Fat Body; Hemolymph; Larva; Mutation; Phenotype; Phosphorylase Kinase; Receptors, Purinergic P1; Signal Transduction; Suppression, Genetic; Wasting Syndrome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649274403

The seabed placed substation interconnects three linear generator wave energy converters (WECs) at the Swedish Lysekil wave energy research site. The power from the WECs fluctuates because of their direct-driven topology. The generator voltage has varying electrical frequency and amplitude. To reduce the fluctuations, the individual voltages of the WECs are rectified and the power is added on a common DC-bus in the substation. The voltage is inverted, transformed and power is transmitted to an on-shore resistive load. The substation was retrieved on two occasions since the deployment in the spring of 2009. The functionality of the substation is validated by comparing voltage and current wave forms from Simulink with measured results from laboratory experiments. In addition, a sample of results from real offshore operation is illustrated and discussed. With a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-regulator in the inverter control, the small fluctuations in the DC-bus voltage could be minimised.

The choice treatment for Gaucher's disease is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The use of bisphosphonate treatment for osteopenia and osteoporosis has been suggested. Case: A 22-year-old woman diagnosed with GD1 had received ERT intermittently, depending on availability of the enzyme since the enzyme was not always available. Due to severe bone involvement and multiple vertebral fractures, intravenous administration of 60 mg of pamidronate every 3 months and safe contraception were indicated. Fifteen days after receiving the fourth infusion, the patient informed us she was pregnant. A baby girl was born by cesarean delivery at week 37, showing no evidence of skeletal abnormality or clinical signs of hypocalcemia. The baby developed normally, presenting no significant pathology. At present (age 15 months), height, body weight, and bone mineral density by DXA are within normal range. The mother showed stable total skeleton and right femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) values, no new fractures, and only ~3% decrease in lumbar spine BMD 15 months post-delivery and after a 1 year breastfeeding period (expected average ~7-8%). Conclusion: It could be posited that pamidronate exerted a positive protective effect on the mother's skeleton with no evidence of adverse effects on pregnancy or on the baby's health to date. © 2009 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","Bone mineral density; Fetal; Gaucher's disease; Maternal; Outcome; Pamidronate","bisphosphonic acid derivative; calcium; ergocalciferol; imiglucerase; pamidronic acid; adult; article; bone density; breast feeding; case report; contraception; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; enzyme replacement; female; Gaucher disease; human; infant; lumbar spine; lysosome storage disease; pregnancy; priority journal; vertebra fracture; Bone Density; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Diphosphonates; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gaucher Disease; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Osteoporosis; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149409812

Ions formed by electrospray ionization were thermalized in collisions with helium buffer gas at room temperature in a 22-pole ion trap. A bunch of ions was then accelerated to keV-kinetic energies and injected into an electrostatic ion storage ring in which they circulated with a revolution time of 69 microseconds. After several milliseconds to allow for the decay of metastable ions, the ions were photoexcited and their decay monitored in time. Dissociation was found to occur on the microsecond time scale. Based on the time spectra, the initial number of photoexcited ions was estimated at each wavelength (relative and not absolute numbers). This approach circumvents the problem of kinetic shifts often encountered when dissociation is sampled within a finite time interval in the case of finite length time-of-flight instruments. The obtained absorption spectrum is found to be similar to the solution phase spectrum (acetonitrile solvent) but with a blueshift of the lowest energy metal-to-ligand charge transfer transition. This finding indicates a localized electronic transition in solution involving only one of the bipyridine ligands. There are small differences in the relative intensities of the bands between the gas-phase and solution-phase spectra. Finally, our gas-phase spectrum serves as a reference to benchmark theoretical calculations of excited states. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Action spectroscopy; Metal to ligand charge transfer; Ru(bipy)32+; Storage ring experiment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049257751

The main aims of this study were to determine the level of major and trace metals (Al, Ti, Mn, Fe, and Zr) of lithologic origin and airborne contaminating trace elements (Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb) in soils in the Central Pyrenees as an indication of background contamination over SW Europe, to establish whether there is a spatial pattern of accumulation of trace elements in soils as a function of altitude, and to examine whether altitude-related physicochemical properties of soils affect the accumulation of major metals and trace elements. METHODS: Major metals and trace elements were measured in ""top"" (i.e., first 10 cm) and ""bottom"" (i.e., below 10 cm) soil samples along an altitudinal transect (1,520-2,880 m a.s.l.) in the Central Pyrenees. Total concentrations were determined by X-ray fluorescense spectrometry. Total major metal concentrations were analysed by conventional X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) with a Siemens SRS 303 instrument. Total trace element concentrations were determined with an energy-dispersive multielement miniprobe XRF analyser. Acid-extractable concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma after previous extraction with nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide in closed beakers. Acid-extractable major metal concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-Optic Emission Spectrometry with a Perkin Elmer 3200 RL Instrument. Acid-extractable trace element concentrations were determined by ICP-Mass Spectrometry with a Perkin Elmer ELAN 6000. RESULTS: Trace element concentration ranges were (in mg kg(-1), inventories in g m(-2) between parenthesis) <2-58 (0.5-6.6) for Ni, 6-30 (0.2-3.4) for Cu, 38-236 (1.6-32.4) for Zn, 6-209 (0.2-12.8) for As, 0.02-0.64 (<0.04) for Cd, and 28-94 (0.6-13.0) for Pb. These concentrations were, in general, comparable to those recorded in soils from other European mountainous areas and were in many cases above the threshold recommended for ecosystem protection by regional and European environmental authorities. The highest concentrations were found at lower altitudes, indicating an effect of local contamination up to ∼2,300 m a.s.l. Only above this altitude can trace elements in soils be considered representative of a background, long-range atmospheric contamination. CONCLUSIONS: None of the storage capacity properties of soils examined were determinant of the differences in elemental concentrations along the altitudinal transect. At the upper altitude range, Ni, Cu, and Pb showed a approximately two- to fivefold increase over the average concentration of the local dominant lithology, reflecting the regional and global background of atmospheric contamination in the area.",,"trace element; air pollutant; altitude; article; atmosphere; chemistry; environmental monitoring; pollution; soil pollutant; Spain; statistics; Air Pollutants; Altitude; Atmosphere; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Soil Pollutants; Spain; Trace Elements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958142282

The proposed methodology presents two major novelties in FSPN modeling, namely: 1) the introduction of a new kind of Petri net arc, called the database arc, which makes possible the direct import of real data in the simulation process; and 2) the selection of constant time intervals in FSPN modeling, instead of assuming continuous dynamics defined by the change of fluid level over time. Moreover, in order to construct the overall system model, this paper proposes a general framework for modular representation of the system under study following a number of well-defined steps. The obtained model is fully parameterized and compared to classical simulation methods, it provides to its user the additional advantage of graphical representation of system's components and attributes. Four scenarios, which describe power system's performance under different conditions, were implemented.

This concern arises from the continuous increase in fructose (and total added caloric sweeteners consumption) in recent decades, and from the increased use of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as a sweetener. A large body of evidence shows that a high-fructose diet leads to the development of obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia in rodents. In humans, fructose has long been known to increase plasma triglyceride concentrations. In addition, when ingested in large amounts as part of a hypercaloric diet, it can cause hepatic insulin resistance, increased total and visceral fat mass, and accumulation of ectopic fat in the liver and skeletal muscle. These early effects may be instrumental in causing, in the long run, the development of the metabolic syndrome. There is however only limited evidence that fructose per se, when consumed in moderate amounts, has deleterious effects. Several effects of a high-fructose diet in humans can be observed with high-fat or high-glucose diets as well, suggesting that an excess caloric intake may be the main factor involved in the development of the metabolic syndrome. The major source of fructose in our diet is with sweetened beverages (and with other products in which caloric sweeteners have been added). The progressive replacement of sucrose by HFCS is however unlikely to be directly involved in the epidemy of metabolic disease, because HFCS appears to have basically the same metabolic effects as sucrose. Consumption of sweetened beverages is however clearly associated with excess calorie intake, and an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases through an increase in body weight. This has led to the recommendation to limit the daily intake of sugar calories. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Fructose; Metabolic diseases","fructose; sucrose; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein; beverage; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; causal attribution; diabetes mellitus; dietary intake; dyslipidemia; fructose metabolism; glucose homeostasis; glucose intake; human; hyperuricemia; insulin resistance; lipid storage; metabolic disorder; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; review; triacylglycerol blood level; Animals; Dietary Carbohydrates; Energy Intake; Fructose; Glucose Metabolism Disorders; Health Transition; Humans; Hyperlipidemias; Metabolic Diseases; Metabolic Syndrome X; Nutritional Sciences; Obesity; Sweetening Agents; Rodentia; Zea mays",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957652786

Moreover, storage negates some of the CO2 emissions reduction of the wind generation. It was also found that the wind and storage output can significantly reduce the variability of the net load under certain operational strategies and the optimal strategy depends on the installed wind capacity.

Inherently coupled with the design process is design optimization, namely the selection of the best solution out of many feasible ones on the basis of a criterion, or rather a set of criteria. A systemic approach to ship design may consider the ship as a complex system integrating a variety of subsystems and their components, for example, subsystems for cargo storage and handling, energy/power generation and ship propulsion, accommodation of crew/passengers and ship navigation. Independently, considering that ship design should actually address the whole ship's life-cycle, it may be split into various stages that are traditionally composed of the concept/preliminary design, the contractual and detailed design, the ship construction/fabrication process, ship operation for an economic life and scrapping/recycling. It is evident that an optimal ship is the outcome of a holistic optimization of the entire, above-defined ship system over her whole life-cycle. But even the simplest component of the above-defined optimization problem, namely the first phase (conceptual/preliminary design), is complex enough to require to be simplified (reduced) in practice. Inherent to ship design optimization are also the conflicting requirements resulting from the design constraints and optimization criteria (merit or objective functions), reflecting the interests of the various ship design stake holders. The present paper provides a brief introduction to the holistic approach to ship design optimization, defines the generic ship design optimization problem and demonstrates its solution by use of advanced optimization techniques for the computer-aided generation, exploration and selection of optimal designs. It discusses proposed methods on the basis of some typical ship design optimization problems with multiple objectives, leading to improved and partly innovative designs with increased cargo carrying capacity, increased safety and survivability, reduced required powering and improved environmental protection. The application of the proposed methods to the integrated ship system for life-cycle optimization problem remains a challenging but straightforward task for the years to come. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The trade-off is analysed for four future energy market scenarios having different levels of CO 2 charge. The technology pathways included in this study are increased electricity production in new turbines, production of district heating, increased sales of biomass in the form of bark and/or lignin, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). The results show that the proven pathways, increased electricity production, bark export and district heating production, are economically robust, i.e. they are profitable for all of the studied energy market scenarios. The new and emerging technology pathways, that are CCS and lignin extraction, hold a larger potential for reduction of global CO 2 emissions, but their economic profitability is more dependent on the development of the energy market. All in all, it can be concluded that to realize the larger potential of reduction of global CO2 emissions a high carbon cost alone may not be sufficient.

The effects of hydrogen ion, solvent and hydroxide ion concentration are discussed with particular emphasis on the kinetics of degradation of bupropion. Kinetics and degradation of bupropion were determined by HPLC-UV and LC-MS analysis both utilising high pH chromatographic methods. Degradation of bupropion in aqueous solutions follows first-order reaction kinetics. The pH-degradation profile was determined using non-linear regression analysis. The micro- and macro-reaction constants for degradation are presented. Bupropion was most stable in aqueous solutions below pH 5. Degradation was catalyzed by water but mainly by hydroxide ion on the unionised form of bupropion. The energy of activation for decomposition in aqueous solution pH 10.7 I=0.055 was determined to be 53kJmol-1 with a frequency factor of 6.43×1010s-1. The degradants of bupropion were positively identified and a mechanism of degradation is proposed.

The intermetallic was prepared by thermal induction in an argon atmosphere. The obtained ingot was submitted to a thermal homogenization treatment at 573 K for 72 h. The particle size diminished with a high energy mill type spex, for which the milling time was 30 and 60 min. The material was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Hydrogenation tests were carried out in a micro-reactor with varying pressure, temperature and reaction time. The material was analyzed with a thermogravimetric system before and after the hydrogenation process. The results indicate that the intermetallic phase range with the mill process did not change with the times used. Because of this, smaller particle sizes of less than a micron were obtained just as scanning electronic microscopy analyses demonstrated. X-ray diffraction showed that phase change does not exist in the intermetallic structure after one hour of milling time.

To encounter the existing situation, the concept of wind energy storage suggests an alternative worth investigating. On the other hand, the expansion of natural gas networks in big islands, where remarkable wind potential may be met as well, questions the future of wind energy. To recover wind energy rejections and benefit from the introduction of natural gas, the adoption of wind-compressed air energy storage (Wind-CAES) systems is currently investigated. More specifically, the proposed solution examines the operation of a dual-mode CAES configuration in collaboration with private wind parks operating on the island of Crete. The system operation is configured so that guaranteed amounts of energy may be delivered to the local network on a daily basis, during certain peak demand hours. Based on a simulation algorithm for the dual-mode CAES system, configurations ensuring maximum recovery of wind energy curtailments may be obtained, while the proposed solution considerably reduces fuel consumption, otherwise required to operate conventional gas turbine plants. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The studies have been performed using step heating in the temperature range 300-1000°C in combination with a mass spectrometric isotope analysis of helium extracted at each temperature step. It has been demonstrated that the diffusion does not obey Fick's law, which should be attributed to a large number of radiation damages in crystals of lunar soil minerals and can be described in terms of the formalism accepted for jump diffusion. The diffusion activation energy for both helium isotopes (4He, 3He) has been found to be identical and equal to 0.5 eV, and the frequency factors amount to 0.51 and 0.59 s-1, respectively. The random errors σ in the determination of these parameters are approximately equal to 5%. The lunar soil delivered to the Earth loses helium during the storage. At the beginning of the storage at room temperature, one gram of the lunar material under investigation loses approximately 3 × 109 helium atoms every second. It has been revealed that the jump diffusion of helium exhibits a strong isotopic effect: the light isotope 3He escapes at substantially higher rates. In order to prevent helium losses accompanied by isotope fractionation, the brought lunar soil should be stored at a low temperature. © 2010 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958494396

This paper presents a model of a forced circulation solar water heating system for supplying a hot water at a required temperature for an aquaculture system. The main component of the system is flat plate collector, storage tank, and auxiliary heater. The optimization problem is carried out using genetic algorithm, which is one of the modern optimization techniques because of their evolutionary nature it can handle any kind of objective function and constraints. Genetic algorithm don't have mathematical requirements about the optimization problem, also it is very effective at performing a global search (in probability), and provide a great flexibility. The optimal design of flat plate collector area using genetic algorithm are used to optimize the objective function considering the constraints required for the system. As the genetic algorithm is a discrete optimization tool the number of variables in principle is free of choice. The economic analysis of such system is evaluated with the life cycle cost method. The collector area is equal to 63 m2, at this value the solar fraction reached to 98%which is very high value. Also sensitivity analysis to solar radiation variation, air temperature variation, and interest rate has been carried out. © 2010 IEEE.","Aquaculture system; Economic; Genetic algorithm; Optimal sizing; Optimization; Solar thermal energy","Air temperature variations; Aquaculture systems; Auxiliary heater; Discrete optimization; Flat-plate collector; Global search; Hot water; Interest rates; Lifecycle costs; Main component; Mathematical requirements; Objective functions; Optimal design; Optimal sizing; Optimization problems; Optimization techniques; Radiation variations; Solar fraction; Solar thermal energy; Solar water heating systems; Storage tank; Water heating systems; Wide spreads; Aquaculture; Economic analysis; Heating; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar radiation; Solar water heaters; Sun; Genetic algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958490608

Various technical aspects and criteria for thermal energy storage systems and applications are discussed and energy saving techniques and environmental impacts of these systems are highlighted with illustrative examples. This study describes the result of the operation of the TES system. The data obtained were observed and analyzed to measure the cooling load demand capacity, electrical load, and building load profile of S &amp; T Complex in certain duration. The results show that, the operation of TES is not fully utilized. The ice charging process does not constantly meet the nominal tank capacity of 10,800 RTh. Energy consumption is higher since the chiller has to top up the remaining cooling capacity during peak period. Also, in this paper the Building Energy Index of S &amp; T is calculated as 201.48kWh/m 2/year.

Controversies exist as to whether the numerous infrastructural development projects that are on the drawing board in Ethiopia will generate positive or negative externalities downstream in Sudan and Egypt. This study attempts at (1) examining the (re-)operation of infrastructures, in particular the proposed reservoirs in Ethiopia and the High Aswan Dam and (2) assessing the economic benefits and costs associated with the storage infrastructures in Ethiopia and their spatial and temporal distribution. To achieve this, a basin-wide integrated hydro-economic model has been developed. The model integrates essential hydrologic, economic and institutional components of the river basin in order to explore both the hydrologic and economic consequences of various policy options and planned infrastructural projects. Unlike most of the deterministic economic-hydrologic models reported in the literature, a stochastic programming formulation has been adopted in order to: (i) understand the effect of the hydrologic uncertainty on management decisions, (ii) determine allocation policies that naturally hedge against the hydrological risk, and (iii) assess the relevant risk indicators. The study reveals that the development of four mega dams in the upper part of the Blue Nile Basin would change the drawdown refill cycle of the High Aswan Dam. Should the operation of the reservoirs be coordinated, they would enable an average annual saving of at least 2.5 billion m3 through reduced evaporation losses from the Lake Nasser. Moreover, the new reservoirs (Karadobi, Beko-Abo, Mandaya and Border) in Ethiopia would have significant positive impacts on hydropower generation and irrigation in Ethiopia and Sudan: at the basin scale, the annual energy generation is boosted by 38.5 TWh amongst which 14.2 TWh due to storage. Moreover, the regulation capacity of the above mentioned reservoirs would enable an increase of the Sudanese irrigated area by 5.5%. © 2010 Author(s).",,"Allocation policies; Annual savings; Basin scale; Blue Nile; Blue Nile River Basin; Economic benefits; Economic consequences; Economic models; Energy generations; Ethiopia; Evaporation loss; Hydro-power generation; Hydrologic models; Hydrologic uncertainty; Hydrological risks; Infrastructural development; Irrigated agriculture; Management decisions; Multi-reservoir systems; Negative externalities; Optimal operation; Policy options; Regulation capacity; Risk indicators; River basins; Spatial and temporal distribution; Storage infrastructure; Dams; Economics; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; River basin projects; Rivers; Stochastic models; Uncertainty analysis; Watersheds; Reservoirs (water); cost-benefit analysis; dam construction; decision making; drawdown; electricity generation; hydroelectric power; infrastructural development; irrigation system; multireservoir system; numerical model; optimization; policy approach; risk assessment; river basin; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal distribution; water resource; water storage; Aswan [Egypt]; Aswan Dam; Egypt; Ethiopia; Lake Nasser; Nile Basin; Sudan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958007727

It is quite alarming since that it will increase makes the fuel cost for Gas Turbine power plant usage. Hence, a new technology called the Compressed Air Energy Storage System (CAES) is created. The main concept of this system is the use off-peak power to pressurize air into an underground reservoir, which is then released during peak daytime hour to power Gas Turbine for power production. This project is aimed to design a small scale system to produce 12 VAC voltage. The hardware for this system consists of 4 parts, which are; air compressor, micro-turbine, DC electric generator and DC-AC converter circuit. The analysis of the result shown that the objective is partially achieved where the system have shown that it only manage to obtain 6 V- 8VAC output voltage. This happened because of low input air pressure entering micro-turbine to rotate the micro-turbine blades. Thus, the analysis has shown that the output voltage produced is proportional with the speed rotation of the micro-turbine. © 2010 IEEE.","Air turbine; Compressed air energy storage (CAES); Compressor; DC motor; Mini scale","Air compressor; Air pressures; Air turbine; Compressed air energy storage; Compressed air energy storage (CAES); DC-AC converter; Fuel cost; Micro turbine; Mini scale; New technologies; Output voltages; Peak power; Power production; Small-scale systems; Speed rotations; AC generator motors; Atmospheric pressure; Cold storage; Compressed air; Compressors; DC motors; Electric generators; Energy storage; Flywheels; Gas fuels; Gas turbine power plants; Gas turbines; Optimization; Pneumatics; Pressure vessels; Turbomachine blades; Underground reservoirs; DC power transmission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958002827

Protection is achieved via the mitigation of excessive anterior tibial translation (ATT) and axial rotation of the tibia relative to the femur that leads to ACL rupture. Cadaveric knee specimens were tested under incremental drop-land compressive impact loads to obtain the ACL failure impact load and ATT limits. A finite element knee model, verified by the experimental data, was utilized to obtain the transverse planar axial torsion and angular rotation limits of the knee joint that leads to ACL failure. In the attempt to mitigate excessive ATT, care was exercised to minimize overconstraining the knee joint by allowing the physiological range of ATT. The completed ESR knee brace prototype was assessed for its protection efficacy on a knee surrogate fixture using a test system. The results indicated a protection level that is well within the impact and twisting limits for ACL rupture. Assistance to locomotion was achieved by storing energy in the brace joint during knee flexion and returning the stored energy during knee extension. This functional aspect was tested on 10 healthy male volunteers of weight, height and age averaged at 61.5 ± 7.1kg, 1.70 ± 0.05m and 24.9 ± 1.5 years old. The volunteers performed a 60 cm high drop-landing without and with the ESR knee brace worn. Surface EMG data on the leg muscles was measured together with lower limb motion and ground reaction force data. The EMG work done and mean EMG in the quadriceps showed significant (P<0.05) reduction during the landing and rising phases of the maneuver by up to 23% and 27% respectively. Biomechanical results also showed significant reduction of 10.8% in peak energy generation during the rising phase. © 2010 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.","ACL; energy storage and return; Knee brace","ACL; ACL rupture; Angular rotations; Anterior cruciate ligament injury; Axial rotation; Brace joint; Compressive impact; Experimental data; Finite Element; Functional aspects; Ground reaction forces; Healthy individuals; Impact loads; Knee brace; Knee extension; Knee flexions; Knee joint; Knee models; Leg muscles; Lower-limb motion; Peak energy; Physiological range; Protection level; Stored energy; Surface EMG; Test systems; Biomechanics; Biomedical engineering; Biophysics; Drops; Energy storage; Finite element method; Flywheels; Joints (anatomy); Landing; Ligaments; Muscle; Rotation; Technical presentations; Physiological models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958002014

Restricted computational power, memory limitations, narrow bandwidth and energy supplied present strong limits in sensor nodes. Therefore, maximizing network lifetime and minimizing energy consumption are always optimization goals. To reduce the energy consumption of the sensor network during image transmission, an energy efficient image compression scheme is proposed. The image compression scheme reduces the required memory. To address the abovementioned concerns, in this paper we describe an approach of image transmission in WSNs, taking advantage of JPEG2000 still image compression standard and using MATLAB and C from Jasper. JPEG2000 provides a practical set of features, not necessarily available in the previous standards. These features were achieved using techniques: the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and Embedded Block Coding with Optimized Truncation (EBCOT). Performance of the proposed image compression scheme is investigated with respect to image quality and energy consumption. Simulation results are presented and show that the proposed scheme optimizes network lifetime and reduces significantly the amount of required memory by analyzing the functional influence of each parameter of this distributed image compression algorithm. © 2010 IEEE.","C; Energy conservation; Image compression; JPEG2000; Matlab; System lifetime; WSNs","Adaptive images; C; Compression scheme; Computational power; Critical points; Distributed image compression; Embedded block coding with optimized truncation; Energy consumption; Energy efficient; Image transmission; JPEG 2000; Minimizing energy; Narrow bandwidth; Network lifetime; Optimization goals; Real time data transmission; Simulation result; Still image compression; System lifetime; WSNs; Computer simulation; Digital image storage; Discrete wavelet transforms; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Image compression; Image quality; Imaging systems; Integrated control; Nanostructured materials; Optimization; Quartz; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957917577

From isothermal kinetic analysis the Avrami exponent for PEO/SWCNTs was calculated as 1.81-2.19, while for PEO/fullerenes (90/10, w/w) its value was in the range of 1.41-2.02. Based on the Hoffman and Weeks theory it has been found that for crystallization of all samples under temperature conditions corresponding to the crystallization regime III, incorporation of SWCNTs and fullerenes lowers the activation energy of nucleation. A shift of absorption bands of C-O stretching vibrations in PEO/SWCNT and PEO/fullerene blends has been found as compared to PEO-the C60 and SWCNT molecules interact with PEO oxygen ethers and reduce the mobility of the polymer chains. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, ultracapacitors, just like conventional capacitors, inevitably suffer from constant voltage drop during discharging, which may limit their energy utilization, increase the voltage ripple of the DC bus across which the capacitors are connected and consequently increase the VA stresses of the subsequent converter stage. To alleviate the above limitations, parallel-series ultracapacitor shift circuits are employed to improve the energy utilization and minimize the DC bus voltage ripple.

Most of these generators are based on renewables (PV, wind) which have an intermittent character and are dispersed over a large area. In order to cope with the unpredictability of the generation, the best solution is, despite its high cost, to deploy electrical energy storage units. Further intelligent control of the distribution network is using the storage not only for energy leverage (minutes-term balance of generation and consume) but also for system services, as during perturbations following faults in the network. This paper presents such an application - intended to cope with the lower level of inertia in the active distribution networks, due to intensive use of static converters for power transfer. The resulting virtual synchronous generator (VSG) is developed around electrical storages, selected as a function of the application case and desired nominal power of the VSG.

Taking into account the hub's flexibility to change its output power(s), this series of call options is valued with a Monte Carlo simulation method that calculates an optimal dispatch of the hub for a large amount of possible price paths of the input and output energy carriers. Using the nodal prices from an optimal power flow analysis (OPF) of a system of interconnected energy hubs, each hub can be valued depending on its location.

The application of the strategies to the Portuguese case study show that the curtailment of the excess of wind energy is the worst case, resulting in a waste of 10.4 % of the annual wind generation.

This lightweight, rechargeable battery uses thin pieces of paper - originating from cellulose fibers from the environmentally polluting Cladophora sp.algae - as electrodes, while a solution of sodium chloride acts as the electrolyte. Conducting polymers for battery applications have been subject to numerous investigations during the last decades. However, the functional charging rates and the cycling stabilities have so far been found to be insufficient for practical applications. These shortcomings can, at least partially, be explained by the fact that thick layers of the conducting polymers have been used to obtain sufficient capacities of the batteries. We now introduce a novel nanostructured high-surface area electrode material for energy storage applications composed of cellulose fibers of algal origin individually coated with a 50 nm thin layer of polypyrrole.

Hybrid composites with different fiber loadings and different volume ratios between glass and sisal were studied. The effect of the fiber length has also been investigated. The densities of the composites were compared with the theoretical values, showing agreement with the rule of mixtures. The results obtained in the flexural and impact analysis revealed that, in general, the properties were always higher for higher overall reinforcement content. By DMTA, an increase in the storage and loss modulus was found, as well as a shift to higher values for higher glass loading and overall fiber volume. It was also noticed an increase in the efficiency of the filler and the calculated activation energy for the relaxation process in the glass transition region. The fiber length did not significantly change the results observed in all analyses carried out in this work.

Surface free energy of polymeric films, its polar and dispersive components have been calculated by Owens-Wendt method. Moreover, the work of adhesion was estimated and the recovery of hydrophobic properties of modified films after storage have been also studied.

A double wound flywheel machine, divided in two different voltage levels by the windings, acting like a rotating transformer, is studied. The flywheel stator windings have two sides: a low voltage side connected to the battery and a high voltage side connected to the wheel motor. The load variations on the high voltage side have minimal affect on the low voltage side of the system, in which the speed control of the machine is performed. In this paper the functionality of the system is investigated by means of simulations and experiments. Different standard drive cycles are applied on the high voltage side to assess the effect of load variations in the system as a whole and particularly in the speed control. The response of the speed control system is investigated with computer simulations and experimental verification. The energy storage in the flywheel allows a steady power supply from the battery via the inverter, proving the functionality of the system. © 2010 Berkeley Electronic Press.

Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and cycling tests have been carried out on the nanobelt network in 1 M LiClO4/propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte for a 1 V potential window. A high specific capacitance of 320 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 scan rate has been achieved with two sets of redox peaks being identified, corresponding to the half occupancy at M3 and M2 intercalation sites along the tunnel in the β-Na0.33V2O5 crystal lattice. The β-Na0.33V2O5 nanobelt electrode is able to deliver a high energy density of 47 W h kg-1 at a high power density of 5 kW kg-1. Slight degradation in energy density at high power density has been observed. This can be attributed to the charge storage in the nanobelt network which is dominated by the fast surface dependent reaction. Superior cycling stability, with only 34% degradation in specific capacitance, is observed in the β-Na0.33V 2O5 nanobelts after 4000 cycles.

Medium chain length (mcl-) polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are synthesized by many bacteria in the cytoplasm as storage compounds for energy and carbon. The key enzymes for PHA metabolism are PHA polymerase (PhaC) and depolymerase (PhaZ). Little is known of how mcl-PHA accumulation and degradation are controlled. It has been suggested that overall PHA metabolism is regulated by the -oxidation pathway of which the flux is governed by intracellular ratios of [NADH]/[NAD] and [acetyl-CoA]/[CoA]. Another level of control could relate to modulation of the activities of PhaC and PhaZ. In order to investigate the latter, assays for in vitro activity measurements of PhaC and PhaZ in crude cell extracts are necessary. Results. Two in vitro assays were developed which allow the measurement of PhaC and PhaZ activities in crude cell extracts of Pseudomonas putida U. Using the assays, it was demonstrated that the activity of PhaC decreased 5-fold upon exponential growth on nitrogen limited medium and octanoate. In contrast, the activity of PhaZ increased only 1.5-fold during growth. One reason for the changes in the enzymatic activity of PhaC and PhaZ could relate to a change in interaction with the phasin surface proteins on the PHA granule. SDS-PAGE analysis of isolated PHA granules demonstrated that during growth, the ratio of [phasins]/[PHA] decreased. In addition, it was found that after eliminating phasins (PhaF and PhaI) from the granules PhaC activity decreased further. Conclusion. Using the assays developed in this study, we followed the enzymatic activities of PhaC and PhaZ during growth and correlated them to the amount of phasins on the PHA granules. It was found that in P. putida PhaC and PhaZ are concomitantly active, resulting in parallel synthesis and degradation of PHA. Moreover PhaC activity was found to be decreased, whereas PhaZ activity increased during growth. Availability of phasins on PHA granules affected the activity of PhaC. © 2010 Ren et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"nitrogen; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; acyltransferase; bacterial protein; carboxylesterase; poly(3 hydroxyalkanoic acid) depolymerase; poly(3 hydroxyalkenoate)polymerase; poly(3-hydroxyalkanoic acid) depolymerase; poly(3-hydroxyalkenoate)polymerase; article; bacterial cell; bacterial growth; enzyme activity; in vitro study; nonhuman; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Pseudomonas putida; culture medium; enzyme specificity; enzymology; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Pseudomonas putida; Acyltransferases; Bacterial Proteins; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases; Culture Media, Conditioned; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Nitrogen; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Pseudomonas putida; Substrate Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957684948

Changes in parameters of the viscoelastic material such as storage modulus (G′) and complex viscosity (η*) during the cure process were evaluated accurately. The isothermal kinetics reaction was described using a phenomenological equation based on the Malkin and Kulichikhin model. The systematic increase in (Ea) values showed that the increase in bulk viscosity during the reaction alters the resin curing process by reducing diffusion of molecules and hindering network growth. Higher HMTA contents lead to faster growing rates in the crosslinking network, hence there are more crosslinked bonds after a shorter period of reaction. This fact implies that active species need more energy to form new crosslinking bonds, changing the curing reaction mechanism. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Cure; Novolac resins; Rheokinetics; Viscoelastic properties","Active species; Bulk viscosity; Complex viscosity; Crosslinked bonds; Cure; Cure process; Curing behavior; Curing reaction mechanism; Dynamic rheological measurements; Isothermal conditions; Isothermal kinetics; Network growth; Nonisothermal; Novolac resin; Phenol-formaldehyde; Phenomenological equations; Resin curing; Rheokinetics; Storage moduli; Visco-elastic material; Viscoelastic properties; Formaldehyde; Phenols; Reaction rates; Resins; Rheology; Viscoelasticity; Viscosity; Curing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956461562

Pulsed laser ablation of Mn and InAs targets was used to form the layers on GaAs(100) substrates. Spectra of the optical constants and TKE depended substantially on layer fabrication conditions and testified to the presence of MnAs inclusions in the samples. The cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of inclusions of size 10-40 nm in the layers. At room temperature a strong resonant band was observed in the TKE spectra of the InMnAs layers in the energy range of 0.5-2.2 eV. In this band the TKE was comparable in magnitude but opposite in sign to that in the strong ferromagnetic MnAs. The resonant character of the TKE spectra was explained by excitation of surface plasmons in the MnAs nanoclusters embedded in the InMnAs semiconductor host.

NAFLD is now considered as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, and both are triggered by mechanisms including inflammation, lipid overload and oxidative stress in adipose tissue and liver. Despite accumulation of numerous data on NAFLD physiopathology, therapeutic modulation of the pathways involved appear insufficiently efficient or associated with serious adverse effects. The increased prevalence of NAFLD and metabolic syndrome during the last decades was associated with deep modifications of dietary habits, especially increased fat intakes. Recent literature provides clues of increased saturated (SFA) and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as well as reduced n-3 PUFA in the diet of NAFLD and NASH patients. Indeed, strong data support the detrimental role of high SFA and n-6/n-3 ratio as well as low monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and n-3 PUFA on metabolic parameters, which are ameliorated by administration of n-3 PUFA and MUFA. Despite governments and health associations having revised their recommendations for n-3 PUFA intakes upward during the last decade, those are still inferior to levels proved of therapeutic efficiency and are still not reached in the general population. This short review discusses these issues and provides consequent pragmatic suggestions for enhanced dietary measures for prevention of NAFLD and metabolic syndrome in the general population.

Storage of microbial samples was studied using three sediment types of varying carbon contents (10-57% carbon of dry weight). Four different storage solutions were tested at three temperatures. Freezing of samples at -20 °C or -80 °C, either without preservative or in phenol-chloroform solution, retained nucleic acid quantities very efficiently. Storage of samples in phenol-chloroform solution at +4 °C also gave good yields except for sediment with extremely highcarbon content. Ethanol and RNAlater® preservation decreased nucleic acid yields drastically at all temperatures. To study how sample preservation may affect the result of microbial community analysis, one type of sediment was selected for length heterogeneity-PCR analysis and PCR cloning of the 16S rRNA genes.

Although we know its origin—it results when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure—at present, the only proven therapy is bariatric surgery. This is a major abdominal procedure that, for reasons that are largely unknown (it cannot be explained solely by a reduction in ventricular volume), significantly reduces energy intake, but because of cost and limited availability, it will most likely be reserved for only a small fraction of those who stand to gain from effective antiobesity treatment. Clearly, alternative ways to treat obesity are needed. Another way to combat excessive accumulation of white adipose tissue would be to increase energy expenditure. Rodents, hibernators and human infants all have a specialized tissue—brown adipose tissue (BAT)—with the unique capacity to regulate energy expenditure by a process called adaptive thermogenesis. This process depends on the expression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), which is a unique marker for BAT. UCP1 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that short circuits the mitochondrial proton gradient, so that oxygen consumption is no longer coupled to adenosine triphosphate synthesis. As a consequence, heat is generated. Mice lacking ucp-1 are severely compromised in their ability to maintain normal body temperature when acutely exposed to cold and they are also prone to become obese. We have shown that, in mice, BAT protects against diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. This is based on prevention of excessive accumulation of triglyceride in non-adipose tissues such as muscle and liver. Ectopic triglyceride storage at these locations is associated with initiation of insulin resistance and, ultimately, development of type 2 diabetes. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Similarities and differences in plasma focus devices working with stored energies ranging from 1 MJ to 0.1 J are found. First, a brief review listing the most important results achieved by the Thermonuclear Plasma Department of the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission, CCHEN, is presented. The aim of the work at CCHEN has been to characterize the physics of dense plasma foci and also to carry out the design and construction of smaller devices-in terms of both input energy and size-capable of providing dense hot plasmas. Certain scaling rules have been found from this research. These rules combined with other scaling laws have been applied to design and construct plasma focus devices with storage energy in a region never explored before (tens of joules and less than 1 J). Thus, a comprehensive analysis also including results from other groups is presented. In particular, all the devices, from the largest to the smallest, maintain the same value of ion density, magnetic field, plasma sheath velocity, Alfvén speed and the quantity of energy per particle. Therefore, fusion reactions are even possible to obtain in ultraminiature devices (driven by generators of 0.1 J for example), as they are in the larger devices (driven by generators of 1 MJ).

Noting that gas-fired generators typically used to feed peaking demand are notoriously inefficient, expensive to run, and sit idle for long periods of time, the scientists have instead proposed a novel use of an integrated energy storage system using natural gas and liquid nitrogen and oxygen or cryogen. The key idea is to use excess electricity to run a unit producing cryogen. At times of peak demand, the nitrogen would be boiled using heat from the environment and waste heat from the power plant. The hot nitrogen gas would then be used to drive a turbine or engine, generating ""top-up"" electricity. Meanwhile, the oxygen would be fed to the combustor to mix with the natural gas before it is burned.

In power modulators based on capacitor discharge, this voltage droop is mainly defined by the input capacitance. In order to overcome this problem, in power modulator systems, compensation circuits are added, whereby in spite of a smaller storage capacitor, a flat pulse top is achieved. Depending on the pulse duration, different approaches for voltage droop compensation exist. For short pulse durations, in the range of several microseconds, only passive solutions or bouncer circuits are applicable. In this paper, the design and optimization of a two-winding inductor bouncer circuit are presented in order to achieve an output voltage droop of less than 1%. Due to the realized galvanic isolation, a new degree of freedom is obtained, which allows an adaptation of the bouncer circuit's voltage and current ratings to standard semiconductor switches. With an optimal design of the two-winding inductor bouncer circuit for the existing system, the volume of the input capacitor is reduced by a factor of 10.5, and the stored energy is decreased by a factor of 24 compared to a system without a bouncer circuit. © 2010 IEEE.","Compensation circuit; pulse transformer; solid state modulator","Capacitor discharge; Compensation circuits; Current rating; Degree of freedom; Design and optimization; Existing systems; Galvanic isolation; Input capacitance; Optimal design; Output pulse; Output voltages; Passive solutions; Power modulators; Pulse durations; Pulsed-power; Short pulse duration; solid state modulator; Storage capacitor; Stored energy; System operation; Voltage droop; Capacitors; Design; Differentiating circuits; Electric switchgear; Modulators; Optimal systems; Optimization; Pulse transformers; Winding; Electric inductors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957902264

High-fat feeding is obesogenic, but the role of polyunsaturated fats is not well understood. This study examined the influence of different high-PUFA diets on serotonin-induced hypophagia, hypothalamic serotonin turnover, and hypothalamic protein levels of serotonin transporter (ST), and SR-1B and SR-2C receptors. Male Wistar rats received for 9 weeks from weaning a diet high in either soy oil or fish oil or low fat (control diet). Throughout 9 weeks, daily intake of fat diets decreased such that energy intake was similar to that of the control diet. However, the fish group developed heavier retroperitoneal and epididymal fat depots. After 12 h of either 200 or 300 μg intracerebroventricular serotonin, food intake was significantly inhibited in control group (21-25%) and soy group (37-39%) but not in the fish group. Serotonin turnover was significantly lower in the fish group than in both the control group (-13%) and the soy group (-18%). SR-2C levels of fish group were lower than those of control group (50%, P = 0.02) and soy group (37%, P = 0.09). ST levels tended to decrease in the fish group in comparison to the control group (16%, P = 0.339) and the soy group (21%, P = 0.161). Thus, unlike the soy-oil diet, the fish-oil diet decreased hypothalamic serotonin turnover and SR-2C levels and abolished serotonin-induced hypophagia. Fish-diet rats were potentially hypophagic, suggesting that, at least up to this point in its course, the serotonergic impairment was either compensated by other factors or not of a sufficient extent to affect feeding. That fat pad weight increased in the absence of hyperphagia indicates that energy expenditure was affected by the serotonergic hypofunction. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Appetite regulation; Fish oil; High-fat diet; Hypothalamus; Obesity; Soy oil","5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid; docosahexaenoic acid; fish oil; icosapentaenoic acid; linolenic acid; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; serotonin; serotonin transporter; soybean oil; animal experiment; animal model; article; caloric intake; controlled study; dietary intake; energy expenditure; epididymis fat; fat intake; hypophagia; hypothalamus; lipid storage; macronutrient; male; nonhuman; priority journal; protein blood level; rat; retroperitoneal fat; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Diet; Dietary Fats, Unsaturated; Eating; Fish Oils; Humans; Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid; Hypothalamus; Infusions, Intraventricular; Male; Organ Size; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1B; Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2C; Serotonin; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Soybean Oil; Rattus; Rattus norvegicus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957691028

The experiments were performed at 45 °C in two batch reactors with internal volumes of 0.229 L and 0.369 L, made of stainless-steel with bottom conical shape, positioned vertically. The results showed that working at moderate pressures, up to 2.7 MPa, increases slightly the H2 dissolution in the liquid phase, enhanced by the changing of the polarity of the remained solution inside the reactor: a value of 0.182 for dimensionless H2 solubility in the liquid phase with 0.25 wt% CMC was found, at 45 °C, based on Henry's law. As a consequence, sodium tetrahydroxoborate, NaB(OH)4 by-product was produced in the presence of CMC additive, showing the absence of crystalline water in its crystal structure (NaB(OH)4 presents structural water, with boron atoms linked to four hydroxyl groups). This new finding never reported to form at &lt; 50 °C, has a positive impact in recyclability costs of NaBO2 back to NaBH4 due to the elimination of two energy consuming steps in the metaborate dehydration kinetics. In fact our system of compressed hydrogen, shows that both H2 generation rates and yields and hydrogen storage capacities can be augmented, the latter to reach ≈ 6 wt%, by adding small amounts of an organic polymer (CMC) to the classic NaBH4 hydrolysis, performed with stoichiometric amount of water. The eventual success of this new route will depend upon developing a advantageous method of converting borates into tetrahydroborate and also finding materials (chemicals) which enhance the solubility of H2, promoting its reversible storage in the liquid phase. We therefore attempted to show that a less Polar Organic Polymeric Solution (lPOPS) of NaBH4 is a suitable hydrogen carrier for portable and/or niche applications. © 2009 Professor T.

Of the three inborn errors of creatine metabolism causing brain creatine depletion, l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency has been described in only two families. We describe clinical and biochemical features, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) findings and response to creatine supplementation in two siblings with a novel mutation in the AGAT-encoding GATM gene. The sister and brother were evaluated at age 12 and 18. years, respectively, because of mild mental retardation, muscle weakness and low weight. Extensive work-up had previously yielded negative results. Electron microscopy of the muscle revealed tubular aggregates and the activity of respiratory chain complexes was decreased in the muscle. Urine organic acid concentrations normalized to urine creatinine concentration were all increased, suggesting a creatine metabolism disorder. Brain MRS was remarkable for absence of creatine. Urine guanidinoacetate levels by tandem mass spectrometry were low, suggesting AGAT deficiency.

Knowledge of the reactivity of dawsonite is crucial to better understand its role as a CO2 storage host. Here the results of free-drift batch dissolution rate experiments at 22, 60 and 77°C performed on synthesized dawsonite are presented. Based on previously reported dawsonite dissolution rate data at circumneutral conditions and the present experiments, it is suggested that the dissolution rates can be expressed by two parallel mechanisms according to r+=k1aH+v+k2, where aH+ denotes the proton activity. The rate coefficient k1 (22°C) and order with respect to the proton activity v were estimated from the 22°C dataset to be 10-4.48±0.48 and 0.982±0.15, respectively, at the 95% confidence level. The rate coefficient for the pH-independent region k2 (77°C) was found to be approximately 10-6.89 from the maximum R2=0.95 for the rate equation using the 77°C dataset. The k2 value was however uncertain because of the few data points in the transition into the pH-independent region. The apparent activation energy Ea for the proton-promoted mechanism was estimated to 49.43kJ/mol, increasing to 63.82kJ/mol for the data points approaching pH independence. From the trends of data points for the 22 and 77°C data series, it is likely that the difference in rates between 22 and 77°C increases further at higher pH. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Apparent activation energy; Batch dissolution; Confidence levels; Data points; Data series; Data sets; Dawsonite; Dissolution rates; Geological formation; Long-term storage; Natural CO; Parallel mechanisms; Proton activity; Rate coefficients; Rate equations; Activation energy; Mechanisms; Optical glass; Protons; Silicate minerals; Dissolution; accumulation rate; activation energy; carbon dioxide; data set; dawsonite; dissolution; pH; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957019707

Box 40, 2027 Kjeller, Norway","Mineral carbonation is one of several alternatives for CO2 sequestration and storage. The reaction rates of appropriate minerals with CO2, for instance olivine and serpentine with vast resources, are relatively slow in a CO2 sequestration context and the rates have to be increased to make mineral carbonation a good storage alternative. Increasing the dissolution rate of olivine has been the focus of this paper. Olivine was milled with very high energy intensity using a laboratory planetary mill to investigate the effect of mechanical activation on the Mg extraction potential of olivine in 0.01M HCl solution at room temperature and pressure. Approximately 30-40% of each sample was dissolved and water samples were taken at the end of each experiment. The pH change was used to calculate time series of the Mg concentrations, which also were compared to the final Mg concentrations in the water samples. Percentage dissolved and the specific reaction rates were estimated from the Mg concentration time series. The measured particle size distributions could not explain the rate constants found, but the specific surface area gave a good trend versus dissolution for samples milled wet and the samples milled with a small addition of water. The samples milled dry had the lowest measured specific surface areas (&lt;4m2/g), but had the highest rate constants. The crystallinity calculated from X-ray diffractograms, was the material parameter with the best fit for the observed differences in the rate constants. Geochemical modelling of mechanically activated materials indicated that factors describing the changes in the material properties related to the activation must be included. The mechanically activated samples in general reacted faster than predicted by the theoretical models. Mechanical activation as a pre-treatment method was found to enhance the initial specific reaction rates by approximately three orders of magnitude for a sample milled dry for 60min in a planetary mono mill compared to an unactivated sample. Wet milling in the planetary mill did not produce samples with the same maximum reaction rate as dry milling, but wet milling in general might be easier to implement into a wet carbonation process. Mechanical activation in a planetary mill is likely to consume too much energy for CO2 sequestration purposes, but the increase in obtained olivine rate constants illustrates a potential for using milling as a pre-treatment method. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Activated materials; Best fit; Carbonation process; Crystallinities; Dissolution rates; Dry milling; Geochemical modelling; HCl solution; Material parameter; Material property; Maximum reaction rate; Mechanical activation; Mg concentrations; Mineral carbonation; pH change; Planetary mills; Pretreatment methods; Room temperature; Theoretical models; Three orders of magnitude; Very high energies; Water samples; Wet milling; X-ray diffractograms; Carbonation; Chemical activation; Dissolution; Hydrochloric acid; Milling (machining); Minerals; Olivine; Organic polymers; Pressure effects; Serpentine; Silicate minerals; Specific surface area; Time series; Water resources; Rate constants; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; dissolution; magnesium; milling; olivine; particle size; serpentine; surface area; time series",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957019507

Among a total cohort of 46 patients with adrenal incidentalomas, we studied 29 patients with NFAIs (mean age, 54 ± 9 years; body mass index, 29 ± 3 kg/m2) and 37 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched healthy controls. Besides the endocrine workup, IR was evaluated using fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, homeostasis model assessment of IR, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index. In a subgroup of patients undergoing an oral glucose tolerance test, Matsuda index and total area under the curve for glucose and insulin were also evaluated. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and other biochemical parameters were measured with standard techniques. Body composition was determined with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Patients with NFAIs exhibited higher fasting glucose, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of IR values; decreased quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and Matsuda index; and an increased-although not statistically significant-area under the curve for glucose and insulin compared with controls (P &lt; .05). In addition, they exhibited higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and γ-glutamyltransferase and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with controls (P &lt; .05). Patients with NFAIs were all obese with a central type of fat accumulation and increased appendicular lean mass. Indices of IR showed a positive correlation with indices of MS (P &lt; .05), but no correlation with markers of hormonal activity. Nonfunctioning adrenal incidentalomas are characterized by IR, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease, all of them being components of MS. Thus, patients with NFAIs should be screened for MS during their initial workup to identify those at cardiometabolic risk and implement the appropriate interventions. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Here we propose an original approach to identify tsunami-induced deposits by combining numerical simulation and rock magnetism. To test our method, we investigate the tsunami deposit of the Boca do Rio estuary generated by the 1755 earthquake in Lisbon which is well described in the literature. We first test the 1755 tsunami scenario using a numerical inundation model to provide physical parameters for the tsunami wave. Then we use concentration (MS, SIRM) and grain size (χARM, ARM, B1/2, ARM/SIRM) sensitive magnetic proxies coupled with SEM microscopy to unravel the magnetic mineralogy of the tsunami-induced deposit and its associated depositional mechanisms. In order to study the connection between the tsunami deposit and the different sedimentologic units present in the estuary, magnetic data were processed by multivariate statistical analyses. Our numerical simulation show a large inundation of the estuary with flow depths varying from 0.5 to 6m and run up of ∼7m. Magnetic data show a dominance of paramagnetic minerals (quartz) mixed with lesser amount of ferromagnetic minerals, namely titanomagnetite and titanohematite both of a detrital origin and reworked from the underlying units. Multivariate statistical analyses indicate a better connection between the tsunami-induced deposit and a mixture of Units C and D. All these results point to a scenario where the energy released by the tsunami wave was strong enough to overtop and erode important amount of sand from the littoral dune and mixed it with reworked materials from underlying layers at least 1m in depth. The method tested here represents an original and promising tool to identify tsunami-induced deposits in similar embayed beach environments. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Beach embayment; Numerical modelling; Rock magnetism; Tsunami deposit","Algarve , Portugal; Flow depth; Grain size; Magnetic data; Magnetic mineralogy; Magnetic proxies; Multivariate statistical analysis; Numerical modeling; Numerical modelling; Numerical simulation; Physical parameters; Rock magnetism; SEM; Study case; Titanomagnetites; Tsunami deposit; Tsunami deposits; Tsunami waves; Underlying layers; Beaches; Computer simulation; Crystallography; Deposits; Electron emission; Estuaries; Magnetic storage; Magnetism; Mathematical models; Mineralogy; Minerals; Multivariant analysis; Quartz; Rocks; Tsunamis; beach; computer simulation; deposition; earthquake event; estuarine sediment; grain size; magnetic field; mineralogy; multivariate analysis; numerical model; rock property; sedimentology; tsunami event; Algarve; Boca do Rio; Faro [Portugal]; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956936924

This work assesses the various methods used in sizing such systems. Most of the published papers relate the use of simulation tools such as HOMER, HYBRID2 and TRNSYS, to simulate the operation of different configurations for a given application in order to select the best economic option. But, with these methods one may not accurately determine certain characteristics of the energy resources available on a particular site, the profiles of estimated consumption and the demand for hydrogen, among other factors, which will be the optimal parameters of each subsystem. For example, velocity design, power required for the wind turbine, power required for the fuel cell and electrolyzer and the storage capacity needed for the system. Moreover, usually one makes excessive use of bi-parametric Weibull distribution function to approximate the histogram of the observed wind to the theoretical, which is not appropriate when there are bimodal frequency distributions of wind, as is the case in several places in the world. A new perspective is addressed in this paper, based on general system theory, modeling and simulation with a systematic approach and the use of exergoeconomic analysis. There are some general ideas on the advantages offered in this method, which is meant for the implementation of wind/ hydrogen/fuel cell-integrated systems and in-situ clean hydrogen production. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Integrated system design; Wind power","Electrolyzers; Exergoeconomic analysis; Frequency distributions; General system theory; In-situ; Integrated system design; Integrated systems; Modeling and simulation; Optimal parameter; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy technologies; Simulation tool; Storage capacity; Wind technology; Computer simulation; Design; Distribution functions; Electric utilities; Electrolytic cells; Energy resources; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Gas fuel purification; Gas producers; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Integrated control; Integrated optics; Weibull distribution; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956916419

It is provoked by imbalance between the spending and consumption of energy associated with a chronic inflammatory condition due to excessive storage of fat tissue. Obese patients have an impaired inflammatory profile that contributes to the development of vascular complications, with fat tissue being partially responsible for controlling both processes: energy balance (through PPAR) and inflammatory condition (through inflammatory markers). White adipose tissue produces cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, resistin, adiponectin, etc.) and participates in a broad spectrum of processes. Recently, glycine has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties which reduce TNF-α and IL-6 levels and increase adiponectin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in fat tissue of obese mice. In this study, the possible regulatory role of glycine on some factors involved in storage and energy burning (PPAR-γ, PPAR-α, PPAR-δ and UCP-2) was analyzed in lean and monosodium glutamate-induced obese mice (MSG/Ob mice). Glycine clearly increased fat tissue PPAR-γ expression in lean but not in MSG/Ob mice. The PPAR-γ and PPAR-α liver expression was repressed in both groups of mice, while the expression of PPAR-δ decreased only in lean mice. Interestingly, glycine treatment also suppressed the expression of UCP-2, TNF-α and IL-6 in lean mice, and increased adiponectin and insulin serum levels. In conclusion, glycine regulates the production of inflammatory cytokines through PPAR-γ. These results provide clues on glycine signaling mechanisms as an anti-inflammatory agent that might be useful for treatment of metabolic and vascular complications associated to inflammation in obesity. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Glycine; Monosodium glutamate; PPARs","adiponectin; glutamate sodium; glycine; insulin; interleukin 6; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; tumor necrosis factor alpha; uncoupling protein 2; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; article; controlled study; cytokine production; drug mechanism; insulin blood level; lean body weight; male; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; obesity; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Energy Metabolism; Glycine; Insulin; Interleukin-6; Ion Channels; Leptin; Mice; Mitochondrial Proteins; Obesity; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sodium Glutamate; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956877625

An FC is a clean energy source and has a high energy-storage capability. However, an FC has a slow dynamic response. A secondary power source is needed during start-up and transient conditions. An ultracapacitor can be used as a secondary power source to improve the performance and efficiency of the overall system. Several methods have been devised to connect an energy-storage device to an FC. This paper presents a converter system for connecting an ultracapacitor as secondary energy storage to an FC electric-vehicle system. A bidirectional dcdc converter is used for interfacing ultracapacitor energy storage to an FC system. The controller of the converter system was designed and implemented based on dynamic evolution control. The performance of the proposed dynamic evolution control is tested through simulation and experiment. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed techniques are suitable for controlling bidirectional dcdc converters. © 2010 IEEE.","Bidirectional dcdc converter; dynamic evolution control; fuel cell (FC); ultracapacitor energy storage","Bidirectional DC-DC converters; Clean energy sources; Converter system; Dynamic evolution; dynamic evolution control; Fuel cell system; High energy; ON dynamics; Secondary power sources; Start-ups; Storage capability; Storage devices; Transient conditions; Ultracapacitors; Vehicle system; Automobiles; Biology; Capacitors; DC power transmission; Dynamic response; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Evolutionary algorithms; Flywheels; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Land vehicle propulsion; Power converters; Capacitor storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956591987

The novelty of the wall system consists of the fact that two PCM wallboards, impregnated with different PCMs are used. The structure of the new wall system is that of a three-layer sandwich-type insulating panel with outer layers consisting of PCM wallboards and middle layer conventional thermal insulation. The PCM wallboard layers have different functions: the external layer has a higher value of the PCM melting point and it is active during hot season and the internal layer with a PCM melting point near set point temperature for heating is active during cold season. A year-round simulation of a room built using the new wall system was carried out and the effect of PCM presence into the structure of the wall system was assessed. It was found that the new wall system contributes to annual energy savings and reduces the peak value of the cooling/heating loads.

A shell-and-tube TES unit was designed, constructed and tested in Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey. This experimental unit basically consisted of a heat exchanger section, a measurement system and flow control systems. For the charging mode, the inlet temperatures varied to be -5 °C, -10 °C and -15 °C, while the volumetric flow rates changed to be 2 l/min, 4 l/min and 8 l/min. The experiments were performed for three different tube materials, copper, steel and PE32 and two various shell diameters of 114 mm and 190 mm to investigate the tube material and shell diameter effects on energetic and exergetic efficiencies. It may be concluded that for the charging period, the exergetic efficiency increased with the increase in the inlet temperature and flow rate. For discharging period, irreversibility increased as the temperature difference between the melting temperature of the PCM and the inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid (HTF) increased and hence the exergy efficiency increased. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Decreasing the condensation temperature can be achieved either by increasing the overall heat transfer coefficient or heat transfer surface area of the condenser. Usually, the radiuses of condenser tubes of domestic refrigerators are quite smaller than the critical radius. Thus, the radius can be increased up to the critical radius by coating the bare condenser tube to increase heat transfer. On the other hand, refrigerators operate discontinuously depending on the ambient temperatures. Coating material stores some of the heat during the working period and continues heat transfer during the off period so that the condenser continues transferring heat while the compressor is not working. Storage effect depends on the specific heat and density of the coating material. Transient and steady-state natural convection heat transfer from a heated horizontal cylinder covered with concrete layer by molding is studied experimentally and numerically to determine the effects of the parameters considered above. The copper and the concrete test cylinders used in the experimental study have a length of 1 m and outer diameter of 9.45 mm and 68.5 mm respectively. The ambient and copper cylinder surface temperatures varied between 20 °C÷30 °C and 30 °C÷50 °C respectively. Constant heat flux was applied to bare and concrete cylinders. Transient heat transfer experiments were performed when bare, and concrete cylinders were reached to steady state condition. Heat transfer rates under transient conditions from bare and concrete horizontal cylinders were compared and heat transfer enhancement was determined. Based on the experimental data average Nusselt numbers were calculated and compared with the well known correlations. Also temperature distributions obtained from numerical simulations were very close to the experimental data. The effect of the decrease in the temperature of the inner copper cylinder surface (condensation temperature) on COP was investigated considering an ideal Carnot refrigeration cycle. It is found that the enhancement in COP of a Carnot refrigeration cycle is 35.7% under transient condition. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The blends were made of PLA mixed with 3 wt% of TMPTA (PLA/TMPTA), and PLA mixed with 3 wt% of TAIC (PLA/TAIC). Injection moulded samples were irradiated with the use of high energy (10 MeV) electron beam at various radiation doses to crosslinking PLA macromolecules. Thermal and mechanical properties were investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), tensile strength, and impact strength measurements. The samples were also characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It was found that under the influence of electron irradiation PLA/TMPTA samples underwent degradation while PLA/TAIC samples became crosslinked.

Empirical models were tested to fit the experimental data. Textural changes of the product were investigated. In addition, activation energies (Ep) for water vapor permeability (WVP) of polyolefin films were determined. Finally, the product was packaged in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or oriented polypropylene (OPP) pouches, and stored at 30 ± 1 °C and 50 ± 2% RH to simulate actual storage conditions and to determine shelf life. This actual shelf life was compared to the predicted shelf life by using empirical models and Ep for WVP. Moisture sorption kinetics was more rapid during the initial stage, while a lesser amount of moisture was adsorbed as adsorption time increased. The higher the relative humidity used, the more pronounced the effect. The sigmoidal moisture sorption isotherms of this product can be classified as type II. The GAB model was found to be the best-fit model for this product. Once the product hardness or work reached the maximum and began to reduce at moisture content (MC) ≈6%, the product texture began to be detected as becoming slightly soft. This implies that hardness and work at the maximum level could be used to identify the critical MC which causes a loss of crispness to an unacceptable degree. The predicted shelf lives - estimated by employing Ep for WVP of LDPE and OPP, and the GAB model - were close to the actual shelf lives. Therefore, the estimation by empirical models and activation energy was found to be applicable for rapid and accurate shelf life prediction. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The difficulty in controlling and monitoring the temperature history of food products makes it difficult to precisely predict shelf life. Time-temperature indicators (TTIs) provide a visual summary of a product's accumulated chill-chain history, recording the effects of both time and temperature. Attempts have been made to develop a prototype of a time-temperature indicator based on the diffusion of lactic acid, which is temperature-dependent. Four lactic acid-based TTIs were made in different substrate concentrations. Color changes associated with the diffusion of lactic acid were monitored. In the vapor diffusion of lactic acid, an irreversible color change of a chemical chromatic indicator (from green to red) clearly and progressively occurred due to the pH reduction. The temperature dependence of these TTIs kinetics was characterized isothermally in the range of 4-45 °C, yielding activation energy (Ea) of, approximately, 50 kJ mol-1. The mathematical models of each TTI were established according to the relationships between color changes and time and temperature. The differences between the Ea values of the TTIs and the Ea associated with food quality losses - including enzymatic loss, hydrolysis, lipid oxidation, nutrient loss and microbial growth - were less than 40 kJ mol-1, and therefore these TTIs could be considered as good candidates to monitor food quality losses. Although these TTIs do not cover the whole range of food quality losses, they could be applied to show the time-temperature history of some foods, especially fruits and vegetables, and to indicate food quality associated with time-temperature exposure. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Papers trying to combine the strong points of EF and EA, and obtain more accurate results have appeared in scientific literature, in which Zhao's et al. (2005) [61] approach is an important one. Unfortunately, some weak points of the original methods still remain on the new approaches proposed. The aim of this present work is to discuss some weak points found in Zhao's approach, trying to overcome them through a new approach called emergetic ecological footprint (EEF). The main difference between Zhao's approach and EEF is that the last one accounted for the internal storage of capital natural in the biocapacity calculation. Besides that, soil loss and water for human consume were considered as additional categories in the footprint calculation. After discussing it through comparisons with other approaches, EEF was used to assess Peru as a case study, resulting in a biocapacity of 51.76 gha capita-1 and a footprint of 12.23 gha capita-1, with 2004 data; that resulted in an ecological surplus of 39.53 gha capita-1. The load capacity factor obtained was 4.23, meaning that Peru can support a population 4.23 times bigger considering the life style of 2004. The main limitations of the EEF are: (i) it is impossible to make comparisons between the biocapacity and footprint for each category; (ii) a need for a handbook with emergy intensity factors with good quality. On the other hand, the main positive points are: (i) its easiness of application in global and national scales; (ii) its final indicators account for all the previous energy (or emergy) used to make something; (iii) internal natural capital storage was accounted for in the biocapacity calculation, which can be a valid step towards the evaluation and assess of services provided by nature. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The motion of the probe particles was tracked with diffusing wave spectroscopy, and the mean square displacement as a function of time for the particles was obtained. This allowed us to obtain the long-time diffusion coefficient for microspheres moving in the micellar network and the cage size where each particle is harmonically bound at short times in that network. The bulk mechanical susceptibility of the fluid determines the response of the probe particles excited by the thermal stochastic forces. As a consequence, the mean square displacement curves allowed us to calculate the elastic (storage) and the viscous (loss) moduli as a function of the frequency. From these curves, spanning a wide frequency range, we estimated the characteristic lengths as the mesh size, the entanglement length, the persistence length, and the contour length for micellar solutions of different zwitterionic surfactant concentration, surfactant ratio ([SDS]/[TDPS]), salt concentration, and temperature. Mesh size, entanglement length, and persistence length are almost insensitive to the change of these variables. In contrast, the contour length changes in an important way. The contour length becomes shorter as the temperature increases, and it presents a peak at a surfactant ratio of ∼0.50-0.55. When salt is added to the solution, the contour length presents a peak at a salt concentration of ∼0.225 M, and in some solutions, this length can reach values of ∼12 μm. Scission energies help us to understand why the contour length first increases and then decreases when salt is added. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Brownian movement; Probes; Sodium sulfate; Surface active agents; Brownian motion; Cage sizes; Characteristic length; Contour lengths; Diffusing-wave spectroscopy; Diffusion Coefficients; Function of time; Mean square displacement; Mesh size; Micellar fluids; Micellar networks; Micellar solution; Microrheology; Persistence length; Salt concentration; Salty water; Scission energy; Sodium dodecyl sulfate; Stochastic forces; Surfactant ratio; Temperature increase; Wide frequency range; Worm-like micelles; Zwitterionic surfactants; Micelles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957121065

Models of MgH2 (rutile) / TiH2 (fluorite) and MgH2 (fluorite) / TiH2 (fluorite) multilayers with different Mg:TM ratios have been designed. With a fixed thickness of the TM H2 layer, structure transformation of MgH2 from rutile to fluorite occurs with a decrease in thickness of the MgH2 layer. The hydrogen desorption energy from the fluorite MgH2 layer in the multilayers is significantly lower than that of the bulk rutile MgH2. The structural deformation of the MgH2 layer due to the strain induced by TM H 2 is found to be responsible for the destabilization of the Mg-H bond: the more structural deformation, the more destabilization of the Mg-H.

Rain falling in the urban fringe catchments is not harvested; these areas experience bouts of heavy rain but dry up during the dry season and, as such, the conventional approach of constructing large dams for storage to support large water treatment plants is not economically viable. This paper explores the viability of a newly developed variable salinity water desalination treatment plant to harvest water from estuarine catchments. The plant is able to treat estuarine waters which vary gradually from low salinity river water into high salinity seawater. When the river water has high salinity or dries up, treatment is maintained with the plant operating in seawater desalination mode instead of remaining idle, thus affording high plant utilisation.

Both speakers, Saudi Aramco President and Chief Executive Officer Khalid A. Al-Falih and Royal Dutch Shell PLC Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser, tied their projections to population growth and improving conditions of the world's poor. Some 2 billion people have no access to modern forms of energy, while another 2 billion only enjoy limited access. Population growth of a further 2 billion by the middle of this century and poverty relief ensures structural growth in energy demand. Coal, oil, and natural gas will account for 4 out of every 5 units of energy that mankind will consume in the foreseeable future. While their combined share of energy use will give way to growth from alternative sources, total demand for hydrocarbon fuels will grow because of market expansion. According to Al-Fathi, global coal consumption has grown at an average 4.5%/yr this decade after changing little in the 1990s, while oil consumption over the period has grown at about 1.5%/yr. Environmental concerns and growing energy needs to combine with a supply revolution to make the future bright for natural gas. The revolution has increased energy security for North America and has the potential to perform similarly worldwide. Fulfillment of that potential depends not only on availability of supply but also on the market forces and government policies that will shape the demand for natural gas. Voser called on governments to forge a clean electricity coalition between natural gas, renewable, nuclear, and carbon capture and storage technology.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117435215

This is mainly due to their high energy conversion efficiency and simple operation. Since the output of the fuel cell is low voltage DC, fuel cell systems supplying power to AC loads are usually constructed using a two stage approach cascading a DC-DC converter and an inverter. It can be shown that in such a system the current drawn from the fuel cell under normal single phase (or unbalanced three phase) operation contains a large second harmonic component. Due to the internal impedance of the fuel cell stack the presence of low frequency current ripple has as side effect additional heating, and more importantly, a reduction in its output power thus diminishing the power availability and power conversion efficiency of the system. To mitigate this problem an auxiliary power converter is proposed in this paper. The proposed converter operates as an active filter supplying the low frequency ripple current demanded by the power converter allowing the fuel cell stack to supply the DC component, which in turn optimizes system operation. In addition the proposed converter, if suited with an energy storage element such as a supercapacitor, can be controlled to supply transient load changes further improving stack characteristics. © 2010 IEEE.","Fuel cell systems; Low frequency ripple; Power conditioning","AC load; Active power Filter; Additional heating; Auxiliary power; DC components; Fuel cell application; Fuel cell stack; Fuel cell system; High energy; Internal impedance; Low frequency; Low voltages; Low-frequency currents; Output power; Power conditioning; Power conversion efficiencies; Ripple currents; Second harmonic component; Side effect; Simple operation; Single phase; Storage Elements; Super capacitor; System operation; Three phase; Transient load; Two stage approach; Active filters; Conversion efficiency; Energy conversion; Fuel systems; Power converters; Power electronics; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); DC power transmission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956581631

They help interconnect renewable sources and energy storage systems in a microgrid. In addition, power converters can provide ancillary services to improve power quality within the microgrid and facilitate interconnection with the electrical power system. The size and the number of the power converters required will depend on the fluctuating power flow within the microgrid. A modular approach is possible where power converters can be paralleled and operated in a load sharing mode to facilitate best use of power converter assets within the microgrid.

Usage of energy storage becomes mandatory, when such micro-grids are used to supply quality power to the loads. However, it is difficult to meet the various needs from both the source and the load. The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like PV demands usage of storage with high energy density. At the same time, quick fluctuation of load demands storage with high power density. This paper proposes a Composite Energy Storage System (CESS) which contains both high energy density and high power density storages to meet the above mentioned requirements. The proposed power converter configuration and the energy management scheme can actively share the power flow among the different energy storages.

Providing seamless connection and collaboration between low and high capacity nodes, i.e. interoperability, remains a challenge.

A dual inverter system, formed by cascading two 2-level inverters through a coupling transformer, is used as the testing model. The inverters are named as ""main inverter"" and ""auxiliary inverter"". The main inverter is powered by the rectified output of the wind generator while the auxiliary inverter is attached to a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). If there is a surplus of wind power compared to the demand, then that would be stored in BESS while if there is a deficit in wind power then the demand will be satisfied by supplying power from the BESS. This enables constant power dispatch to the grid irrespective of wind changes. Novel modulation and control techniques are proposed to address the problem of non-integer, dynamically-varying dc-link voltage ratio, which is due to random wind changes. Furthermore, a maximum power tracking controller for this unique system is explained in detail. Simulation results verify the efficacy of proposed modulation and control techniques in suppressing random power fluctuations © 2010 IEEE.","Dual inverter; Energy storage interfacing; Non-integer voltage ratio","2-level inverters; Battery energy storage systems; Constant power; Control techniques; Coupling transformers; DC-link voltages; Dual inverter; Energy storage systems; Inverter system; Maximum power tracking; Novel modulation; Power fluctuations; Simulation result; Testing models; Voltage ratios; Wind generators; Wind power systems; DC power transmission; Electric converters; Electric transformer testing; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Flywheels; Power electronics; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956505021

It is known that lightning can produce huge scale of electricity. The restriction in harvesting the gratis lightning energy is regarding the process to detain and store the energy within a microsecond according to the typical lightning wave shape. Due to that, a small-scale laboratory is set up based on natural characteristics of lightning. The purpose is to determine the performance and potential of the sampling capacitor as storage for the electricity produced by lightning. In this paper, the results of the laboratory experiment focusing on the sampling capacitors were presented. The capacitors are subjected to 1.2/50μs, 4.2kV single-stroke impulse voltages. The results show that the small-scale system successfully illustrates the concept of capturing energy from lightning return strokes that can be a potential source of renewable energy. © 2010 IEEE.","Lightning; Renewable energy; Small scale","Impulse voltage; Laboratory experiments; Lightning return stroke; Lightning strokes; New sources; Potential sources; Renewable energies; Sampling capacitor; Small scale; Small-scale systems; Wave shape; Capacitors; Energy harvesting; Harvesting; Lightning; Power electronics; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956497677

The effectiveness of the approach is validated by a case study where the optimal ESS rating for MG is determined. The quantitative results show that the ESS with an optimal size is not only storing renewable energy and re-dispatching it appropriately, but also saving the the total cost for MG.

We used dietary and laboratory indices to assess change in Zn status during a 4-month partially blinded placebo-controlled Fe intervention in women with low Fe stores (serum ferritin<20g/l and Hb120g/l) from Dunedin, New Zealand. Subjects aged 18-40 years were randomly assigned to three groups: dietary advice (diet group; DG; n 29), daily Fe supplement with meals (supplement group; SG; n 23; 50mg Fe as amino acid chelate) and placebo (placebo group; PG, n 26). A validated semi-quantitative FFQ (SFFQ) was administered at baseline, and at 4, 8 and 15 weeks; fasting morning blood samples were assayed for serum Zn, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and C-reactive protein at baseline, and at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks; hair Zn and taste detection thresholds by electrogustometry were measured at baseline and at 16 weeks. Intakes of flesh foods and vitamin C but not Zn or Fe increased, whereas phytate and phytate:Zn molar ratios decreased (all P001) in the DG compared with the PG and SG, based on three SFFQ. Serum Zn increased in both the DG and PG (adjusted, P0002), so the between-group difference was not significant; the lack of a parallel rise in the SG was significant when compared with the PG (P=002). ALP activity (but not hair Zn or taste acuity) followed a similar trend. In conclusion, Zn status was not improved compared with placebo by an Fe-based dietary intervention. However, a daily moderate-dose Fe supplement with meals appeared to lower Zn status in these young adult women.

The study found that the introduction of higher-level blends into the marketplace is not simple or straightforward. There are many changes that need to be made to federal, state, and local requirements as well as issues with vehicle warranties and the country's fuel distribution and marketing infrastructure. In addition to a waiver of federal Clean Air Act pre-emption, introducing E15 would require changes to EPA's reformulated gasoline and detergent regulations, new CAA and EPA regulations if the Rvp allowance granted to E10 is extended to higher ethanol blends, and new federal fuel rating and labeling requirements. It also would require changes to a myriad of state fuel requirements, with the number and nature of those changes varying from state to state; and changes in equipment and operating practices in the gasoline transportation and distribution system, including pipelines, storage tanks, and retail dispensing facilities. Growth Energy, the ethanol advocacy organization that has petitioned EPA to increase allowable ethanol limits in motor fuels to 15% from 10%, responded that the study simply defends the status quo, and a sound body of science accompanies its request. API, the NPRA, and several engine makers have argued that extensive tests now being carried out need to be completed first. The automotive and oil industries are evaluating the effects of higher level ethanol blends on vehicle and engine durability and performance, and the DOE and API are investigating the changes to the retail gasoline station equipment that an E15 waiver would necessitate.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957308283

The engineers have now developed a new system that, in theory, could manage short-lived draws on the electricity grid and halve consumption of fuel. Crucially, the system would store excess energy made by a plant supplying the base demand and use this to supply the peaks in demand as and when they happen. Using such an integrated system, the amount of fuel needed to cater for peak demand could be cut by as much as 50%. Greenhouse gas emissions would be lower, too, because of reduced nitrogen oxide emissions and the capture of carbon dioxide gas in solid form for storage.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859042525

After the Unit 1 of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in 2004, approximately 1000 fuel assemblies from Unit 1 were safely transported and reused in the reactor of Unit 2 before final shutdown of the Unit 2 reactor in 2009. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the content and main results of safety analysis, which includes both - safety justification of fuel reuse in the Reactor of Unit 2 and safety justification of irradiated fuel assemblies transportation from Unit 1 to Unit 2 reactor. The RBMK reactor is continuously reloaded at power. Therefore the reactor core contains fuel assemblies with different burn-up level. After permanent reactor shutdown hundreds of fuel assemblies in the reactor core have considerably less burn-up than their design value. Such fuel assemblies have high energetic potential and can be reused. The reloading process has been modeled and reactor core behaviour has been analyzed in order to find out the optimal reloading mode of the fuel assemblies of Unit 1 to be reused at the reactor of Unit 2. Selected re-use mode features mixed loading of suitable irradiated fuel assemblies from Unit 1, i.e. subsequent loading one minimum bum-up and one maximum burn-up fuel assembly, so fuel assemblies with burn-up values close to average are loaded last. Both fresh and partly burnt fuel assemblies should be loaded into the reactor of the second unit. The performed calculations demonstrated that in order to keep the core parameters within the set limits, the preferred ratio of Reuse and Fresh Fuel Assemblies (RFA:FFA) should be 1:1. The analysis of Unit 2 core behavior showed that parameters in the selected re-use mode are safely kept within the required limits. The fuel-transportation container, vehicle, protection shaft and other necessary equipment were designed in order to implement the process for on-site transportation of Unit 1 Fuel Assemblies for reuse in the Unit 2. The developed equipment can be used also in decommissioning phase for fuel transportation to fuel storage facilities. The set of this equipment can be applied for NPP-s with RBMK type reactors. The structural integrity, thermal, radiological and nuclear criticality safety calculations are performed to assess the acceptance of the proposed set of equipment. Performed analysis demonstrated that the proposed nuclear fuel transportation container and other equipment are in compliance with functional, design and regulatory requirements, assure the required safety level for both normal operation and accident conditions and can be used for fuel transportation.",,"Accident conditions; Burn up; Burn-up fuels; Burnt fuels; Core behaviors; Design value; Fuel assembly; Fuel transportations; Irradiated fuels; Lithuania; Mixed loading; Normal operations; Nuclear criticality safety; Permanent reactors; RBMK reactors; RBMK-1500 reactor; Regulatory requirements; Safety analysis; Safety level; Shut down; Storage facilities; Flood control; Fuels; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Plant shutdowns; Radiology; Reactor cores; Security systems; Transportation; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956212621

The dissociative adsorption energy barrier of an H2 molecule on a pristine graphene layer changes from 2.7 to 2.5 eV on N-doped graphene, and to 0.88 eV on N-doped graphene under an electric field of 0.005 au. When increasing the electric field above 0.01 au, the reaction barrier disappears. Therefore, N doping and applying an electric field have catalytic effects on the hydrogenation of graphene, which can be used for hydrogen storage purposes and nanoelectronic applications. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalytic effects; Density functional theory calculations; DFT calculation; Dissociative adsorption; Electrical field; Graphene layers; N-doped; N-Doping; Nanoelectronic applications; Nitrogen atom; Nitrogen-doped; Potential applications; Reaction barriers; Density functional theory; Doping (additives); Electric fields; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Nitrogen; Photodissociation; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956156254

To first determine the integrity of the air supply, the refinery commissioned an air leakage survey prior to the data-logging exercise. This identified minimal leakage, confirming the effectiveness of the site's maintenance procedures and enabled the focus to be placed on the energy-savings potential of the compressors themselves.

Dry matter contents of more than 30% are seldom obtained, leaving a final product containing more than two thirds of water. Many approaches have been used to improve the dewatering step by influencing the conditioning or dewatering process. One of the physical conditioning methods used is freeze-thawing, in which the physical structure of the sludge is destroyed. Most studies so far have been focusing on freeze-thawing of sludge at low solids concentrations, making it an inefficient process with regard to energy and cost. This study focuses on the freeze-thawing of predewatered sludges for subsequent mechanical dewatering in order to reduce the final sludge volume and hence disposal costs. Predewatered sludge with a dry matter content of 25-30% was frozen for different times periods (1-96 h) and at different temperature gradients (slow to fast freezing) using a variety techniques (submersion in glycol, commercial freezer and liquid nitrogen). The results from this study indicated that thawing followed by a second mechanical dewatering resulted in dry matter contents of up to 50%. Slow freezing times and long storage times yielded the best dewaterability results. An economical assessment of the process showed that a depreciation time of 2 years already delivers a profitable process. © 2009 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Dewatering; Energy efficiency; Filtration; Freeze-thawing","Biological sludge; Dewaterability; Disposal costs; Dry matter content; Energy and cost; Freeze-thawing; Mechanical dewatering; Physical structures; Sludge cake; Sludge volumes; Solids concentrations; Temperature gradient; Biological materials; Energy efficiency; Freezing; Glycols; Liquid nitrogen; Profitability; Sludge disposal; Thawing; Dewatering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650091025

The heterojunction was investigated by current-voltage-temperature (I-V-T) and capacitance (conductance)-voltage/ temperature (C,G-V/T) measurements for the purpose of studying transport and storage features. Excess current, manifested as a crossover at a large forward bias, was observed in I-V-T curves since minority carriers injected into the quasi-neutral region of p-c-Si were neutralized by majority carriers supplied from the p-c-Si semiconductor side. This phenomenon, known as conductivity modulation, appeared distinctly as a hump in C-V/T curves (storage property); a sharp rise in capacitance towards a maximum value as forward bias increased and the subsequent fall after a specific value. For reverse and low forward bias regions, where minority carrier injection was negligible, geometrical junction capacitance and a shoulder in C-V/T curves were observed. In the voltage range where the peak was observed in C-V/T measurements, trap-assisted tunneling recombination generation and space-charge-limited current (SCLC) mechanisms were determined in the CrSi2/p-c-Si isotype junction. Traps introduced during tunneling were identified as bulk point defects due to the chromium-boron (Cr-B) complex for the CrSi2/p-c-Si junction on the Si side by I-V-T and C(G)-T analyses. This finding seemed to be in agreement with a recent DLTS [Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy] measurement in terms of both energy depth (0.26 eV) and bulk nature. Finally, the shoulder in C-V/T curves indicated Cr-B point defects in the measurement. © 2010 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.",,"Cathodic arc physical vapor deposition; Conductivity modulation; Crystalline Si; Crystalline silicons; Current voltage; Deep level; DLTS; Energy depth; Excess current; Forward bias; Junction capacitances; Majority carriers; Maximum values; Minority carrier; Minority carrier injection; Neutral region; P-type; Space-charge-limited current; Specific values; Storage properties; Transient spectroscopy; Trap assisted tunneling; Voltage ranges; Bias voltage; Boron; Boron compounds; Capacitance; Chromium; Chromium compounds; Crystalline materials; Deep level transient spectroscopy; Defects; Heterojunctions; Physical vapor deposition; Point defects; Radiation detectors; Semiconducting silicon; Superconducting materials; Semiconducting silicon compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049377615

The aim is to evaluate the nutritional value of these plant species and their potential impact on the nutritional status of the people living in sub-Saharan Africa. Processing and the presence of antinutritional factors are taken into consideration as they adversely affect the nutritional content of the ALVs. The role of dietary fiber and other important components found in ALVs is also discussed due to their importance in the prevention of chronic and lifestyle diseases. Many of the ALVs are good sources of micronutrients, especially Manihot esculenta which contains 1970μg retinol equivalents/100. g edible portion and 311. mg/100. g of vitamin C, as well as Chenopodium album with up to 6. mg/100. g iron, 18.5. mg/100. g zinc, 226. mg/100. g calcium and up to 211. mg/100. g magnesium. These vegetables may help to meet daily requirements of these and other essential nutrients, especially in individuals with marginal nutritional status. Furthermore, ALVs such as Arachis hypogea and Bidens pilosa are good sources of dietary fibre, while Nasturtium aquatica, Urtic dioica and Xanthosoma mafaffa are excellent free radical scavengers. In many instances ALVs have levels of these components that are higher than those of exotic vegetables such as spinach and cabbage. Factors such as storage, cooking methods and drying influence the micronutrient, antioxidant and antinutritional factor content of these vegetables. The consumption, cultivation and possibly the commercialization of these ALVs should therefore be promoted. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Antinutrients; Food analysis; Food composition; Horticulture and biodiversity; Human health; Indigenous foods; Leafy vegetables; Micronutrient deficiencies; Nutrient retention after processing; Nutritional status; Nutritional value; Protein-energy malnutrition; Species differences; Sub-Saharan Africa; Undernutrition; Wild foods","Arachis hypogaea; Bidens pilosa; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Chenopodium album; Manihot esculenta; Nasturtium officinale; Spinacia oleracea; Xanthosoma; Xanthosoma mafaffa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957866583

In addition, oxy-combustion technology creates a near-zero emissions plant by eliminating almost all of the mercury, sulfur, and NOx, and particulate pollutants from plant emissions.

Such megajoule-class modularized capacitor banks individually require precise reliable cost-effective robust closing switches for synchronous operation. The closing switch, under intense mechanical and thermal shocks imposed by a high peak current, must tolerate high charge transfer and provide long service life. The most popular closing switches up to date are spark gaps due to its relatively simple design, robustness, easy field maintenance, and repair. Spark gaps cover an impressive range of voltages, currents, Coulomb transfer, and repetition rates and an extremely wide range of applications. The main drawback of spark gaps is limited lifetime, which is related directly or indirectly to the erosion of the electrodes. The various types of switches have been introduced which utilize the principle of arc motion in a magnetic field thus effectively decreasing the current density on the switch electrodes. This paper presents the numerical calculations of arc motion and electrode erosion in a rail spark gap. The results of the numerical calculations are compared with the experimental results in this paper. The conditions for reduced electrode erosion are defined. © 2010 IEEE.","Arc motion; railguns; spark gaps","Arc motion; Capacitive energy storage; Capacitor bank; Closing switches; Electrode erosion; High-current; High-peak currents; Laser systems; Long service life; Modularized; Numerical calculation; Pulsed power systems; Repetition rate; Spark gaps; Synchronous operations; Capacitors; Charge transfer; Electric current distribution; Electric power systems; Electrodes; Erosion; Guns (armament); Ion exchange; Magnetic fields; Pulsed laser applications; Pulsed lasers; Rail guns; Repair; Electric sparks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956615792

The solution of this problem belongs to the field of non-linear combinatorial multiobjective optimisation. In a multiobjective optimisation problem, the target is not to find an optimal solution, but a set of non-dominated solutions called Pareto-set. The present article considers as an economic objective the minimisation of system's cost of energy (COE), whereas the environmental objective is the minimisation of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the system during its lifetime. The main novelty of this article is that the calculation of GHG emissions is based on life cycle analysis (LCA) of each system's component. In LCA, the whole life cycle emissions of a component are taken into account, from raw materials extraction to final disposal/recycling. This article adopts the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), which in combination with a proposed local search procedure effectively solves the multiobjective optimisation problem of SAHPS.

One objective is to stimulate high-level recovery, and the other is to introduce life cycle thinking. This paper studies decision making in recovery, comparing opportunistic decision making with short-term profit maximization (usually leading to one loop) versus a life-cycle perspective (leading to multiple loops). The question is (1) which business benefits this brings as well as reduction of environmental impact and (2) whether companies should be inclined to think multi-loop and if so how governments could stimulate this. Methods: After comparing the problem with the literature, a non-linear optimization model is presented optimizing NPV of revenues and calculating environmental impact with cumulative energy demand and cumulative recovery rates. The environmental indicators chosen are motivated based on literature research in the area of streamlined LCA. Sensitivity analysis tests solutions on various sources of uncertainty. We study a real-life case with real data. Results and discussion: Based on the results, we can formulate the following insights for industry. Firstly, cascade markets for reuse may appear attractive but new sales cannibalization compromised margins. To neutralize this effect, returns should be remanufactured to equal-to-new quality hence no difference should exist between new and recovered items. Companies must suppress their natural instincts of maximizing short-term profits and delay some of the revenues by implementing multi-loop models in order to maximize total life-cycle profit. Environmental impact improves as well according to both indicators. Feasibility of returns should be maximized which for example implies careful collection and storage of wrecks, preventing damage and corrosion, etc. Product design changes may further enhance feasibility. However, the concept requires that all loops are controlled well by one actor. For governments the following advices apply. As mentioned, most EPR-based systems in place today maximize single loop 3. Using alternative steering principles instead of target quota on recovery and collection could stimulate multi-loop solutions that prove more robust, more profitable, and have better footprint. Conclusions: It is concluded that multi-loop recovery is preferred both economically and environmentally. But both industry and governments must improve their policies. Therefore, future research is mapped based on handles and delineations of the study. © 2010 The Author(s).","Automotive case study; Disposition; Environmental impact; Legislation; Life cycle; Net present value; Streamlined LCA","article; commercial phenomena; controlled study; decision making; energy consumption; energy conversion; energy recovery; energy resource; environmental economics; environmental impact; intermethod comparison; life cycle assessment; motor vehicle; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; waste disposal; Nucleopolyhedrovirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956457249

However, only few cellular assays have been developed. We describe a simple and robust method to quantitate SCD activity and its inhibition in primary rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes assimilate stearic acid, with or without modification by SCD, into its lipid pool. To measure the extent of this conversion primary rat hepatocytes were cultivated 4h or overnight with [1-14C]18:0 and extracellular fatty acids were washed out. Total cell lipids were then hydrolyzed and extracted. Recoveries of 18:0 were secured with a modified Folch method by addition of 0.1% Triton X-114 to the samples. The extracted fatty acids were dissolved in 85% ethanol and separated by reverse phase HPLC, which took 10min including column recovery time. [1-14C]18:0 and [1-14C]18:1(n9) were detected and quantified by on-line flow scintillation analysis. Incubation of the cells with SCD inhibitors resulted in decreased ratios of 18:1/18:0 in dose-dependent manners. The improvements enabled us to establish a novel robust assay based solely on HPLC analysis of cellular SCD activity, which was developed in 12-well format. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Desaturation index; Folch method; HPLC; Primary rat hepatocyte; Stearic acid; Stearoyl-CoA desaturase","Desaturation; Folch method; HPLC; Primary rat hepatocyte; Stearoyl-CoA desaturase; Assays; Ethanol; Extraction; Recovery; Stearic acid; Acids; acyl coenzyme A desaturase; stearic acid; stearoyl coenzyme A; triton x 114; animal cell; article; concentration response; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; enzyme inhibition; high performance liquid chromatography; liver cell; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Enzyme Inhibitors; Fatty Acids; Hepatocytes; Male; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stearic Acids; Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956262443

Solubility of NaBH4 and sodium borates in water is also a restricting factor together with the need for stabilizers necessary for reaction control in aqueous medium. In this work, methanol was used as an alternative to water. Literature data on this subject are scarce. Methanol lowers the freezing temperature of the reactant mixture with the advantage of providing short times for the initiation of the reaction and possibility of use at low temperatures. The effect of the water fraction on the efficiency of the reaction was studied at 45 °C. Results indicated increase in the reaction rates with decreasing water fraction. Sodium tetramethoxyborate was identified as the main by-product in methanol with no added water. When using methanol with no added water the reaction follows a first order rate kinetics with respect to sodium borohydride. Activation energy is reduced by a factor of 5 in the presence of methanol with no added water, when compared to values found in 100% water solutions. Methanol can be recovered by reaction of the by-product with water, offering increased storage and energy density to the system. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Professor T.

Moreover, because of the reason that PV power plants are often located on the terrain which is accessible by the man, galvanic isolation may be obligatory.

The composite PCMs were characterized by SEM and FTIR techniques. Thermal properties of the composite PCMs were determined by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) method. DSC results showed that the melting temperatures and latent heats of the prepared composite PCMs are in the range of 19.09-25.64°C and 61.03-72.05. J/g, respectively. The thermal cycling test including 5000 heating and cooling process was conducted to determine the thermal reliability of the composite PCMs. The test results showed that the composite PCMs have good thermal reliability and chemical stability.

The introduction of enzyme replacement therapy as treatment for the disease may change prospects for patients and may require that more attention be paid to co-morbidities such as osteoporosis. Methods: Bone mineral status was assessed in children and adults with Pompe disease and compared with reference values by means of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) technology (GE Lunar DPX, GE Health Care). Bone mineral density (BMD) of the total body and the lumbar spine (L2-L4) was measured in adults and children; BMD of the femoral neck was measured in adults only. Exclusion criteria were: age<4. years, severe contractures, and inability to transfer the patient. Results: 46 patients were enrolled in the study; 36 adults and 10 children. The BMD was significantly lower in Pompe patients than in healthy individuals. Sixty-seven percent of patients had a BMD Z-score below -1, 26% were classified as osteoporosis/low bone mass for chronological age (T-score<-2.5 in adults or Z-score<-2 in children), 66% had a BMD Z-score below -1 of the femoral neck, and 34% had a BMD Z-score below -1 for the lumbar spine. Osteoporosis/low bone mass for chronological age was more frequent in patients who were wheelchair-bound, but was also observed in ambulant patients. We found a significant correlation between proximal muscle strength and total body BMD. Of the 10 children, 8 (all four patients with the classic infantile form) had a low BMD. Conclusion: Low BMD is a frequent finding in patients with Pompe disease and may be causally related to decreased proximal muscle strength. BMD should be monitored at regular intervals.

We tested three predictions developed from this hypothesis in free-living, semi-altricial Eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus nestlings. We measured baseline and handling-induced corticosterone levels and the binding capacity of corticosteroid binding globulins CBG on day 10 and 21 of age and related these to age, the development of the defence behaviour, hatching asynchrony and fat stores (a measure of body condition). First, the adrenocortical response to handling (total plasma corticosterone) increased with age and thus during the time when nestlings developed the ability to defend themselves, but free corticosterone did not, because of a concomitant increase of CBG with age. Second, nestlings with adequate fat stores mounted a stronger adrenocortical stress response to an acute stressor, while nestlings with low fat stores avoided additional energy expenses. While baseline corticosterone levels were negatively related to fat stores, increase in corticosterone to handling was positively related. Third, both baseline corticosterone levels and the adrenocortical response to handling were not related to hatching order, but predominantly determined by body condition. The pattern of decreasing corticosterone levels with hatching order found in the lab seems to be neutralized by opposite effects of varying body condition on corticosterone levels in free-living birds. We argue that the postnatal adrenocortical response to stress is adaptively modulated by both variations in the release of corticosterone and in CBG, which is particularly important because elevated corticosterone may adversely affect the phenotype. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Anti-predator-behaviour; Body condition; Corticosteroid-binding-globulin; Corticosterone; Developmental hypothesis; Falco tinnunculus; Fat stores; Hatching asynchrony; Nestling","corticosterone; transcortin; adrenal cortex; age distribution; animal behavior; article; controlled study; corticosterone blood level; energy expenditure; Eurasian kestrel; female; hatching; hormone binding; insect; lipid storage; male; nestling; nonhuman; phenotype; postnatal development; priority journal; stress",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955578857

The objectives of this study were to identify the most significant environmental impacts from pig manure management considering a wide range of impact categories and to determine which integrated technology system at which handling stage can achieve the highest impact reduction. Twelve scenarios applying various treatment, storage and land application systems were developed and compared. Life cycle assessment (LCA) with the aim of capturing the actual consequences of the considered scenarios was selected as the tool for impact quantification. The most important impact categories in this investigation are global warming (GWP), aquatic eutrophication (AEP), respiratory inorganics (RIP), and terrestrial eutrophication (TEP). The two latter impacts, caused by ammonia emissions, have not been widely considered in most of previous LCA studies on pig manure management. The main keys for the effective impact reduction are the integration of treatment technology systems aiming at energy recovery with high nutrient recovery and control of greenhouse gas, ammonia, and nitrate emissions at every handling stage. For GWP and AEP, the anaerobic digestion-based scenario with natural crust storage achieves the highest impact reduction because of high efficiencies in energy and nutrient recovery with restricted emissions of GHG and nitrate. For RIP and TEP, the incineration and thermal gasification based scenarios and the scenario without a treatment system applying the deep injection method yield the highest impact minimisation due to the lowest ammonia emissions. This study further indicates the need to consider all significant impacts to decide the best management options taking into consideration local conditions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: For MA, class V cavities (4 mm× 2 mm× 2 mm) were prepared in 40 bovine incisors. The adhesive system Adper Single Bond 2 (3M/ESPE) was applied. Before being placed in the cavities, the resin composite was either kept at room-temperature (25 °C) or previously pre-heated to 68 °C in the Calset™ device (AdDent Inc., Danbury, CT, USA). The composite was then light polymerized for 20 or 40 s at 600 mW/cm2 (12 or 24 J/cm2, respectively). The percentage of gaps was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, after sectioning the restorations and preparing epoxy resin replicas. DC (n = 3) was obtained by FT-Raman spectroscopy on irradiated and non-irradiated composite surfaces. FS (n = 10) was measured by the three-point-bending test. KHN (n = 6) was measured after 24 h dry storage and again after immersion in 100% ethanol solution for 24 h, to calculate PCL density. Data were analyzed by appropriate statistical analyses. Results: The pre-heated composite showed better MA than the room-temperature groups. A higher number of gaps were observed in the room-temperature groups, irrespective of the energy density, mainly in the axial wall (p &lt; 0.05). Composite pre-heating and energy density did not affect the DC, FS and PCL (p &gt; 0.05). Significance: Pre-heating the composite prior to light polymerization similar in a clinical situation did not alter the mechanical properties and monomer conversion of the composite, but provided enhanced composite adaptation to cavity walls. © 2010 Academy of Dental Materials.","Composite pre-heating; Degree of conversion; Dental composite; Flexural strength; Marginal adaptation","Adhesive systems; Bovine incisors; Cavity wall; Class V; Clinical situations; Composite surface; Degree of conversion; Dry storage; Energy density; Ethanol solutions; Flexural strength; FT- Raman spectroscopy; Light polymerization; Marginal adaptation; Monomer conversions; Prepolymerization; Resin composites; Room temperature; Single bond; Statistical analysis; Bending strength; Computerized tomography; Dental composites; Epoxy resins; Ethanol; Heating; Polymerization; Polymers; Raman spectroscopy; Resins; Scanning electron microscopy; Mechanical properties; filtek Z350; polymer; resin; analysis of variance; animal; article; cattle; chemistry; dental bonding; dental care; endodontics; hardness; heat; materials testing; pliability; polymerization; randomization; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Cattle; Composite Resins; Dental Marginal Adaptation; Dental Stress Analysis; Hardness; Hot Temperature; Light-Curing of Dental Adhesives; Materials Testing; Pliability; Polymerization; Polymers; Random Allocation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955515922

A new software tool - ToSIA - has been developed for assessing sustainability impacts of Forest-Wood-Chains (FWCs). In the approach, FWCs are defined as chains of production processes (e.g. harvesting-transport-industrial processing), which are linked with products (e.g. a timber frame house). Sustainability is determined by analysing environmental, economic, and social sustainability indicators for all the production processes along the FWC. The tool calculates sustainability values as products of the relative indicator values (i.e. indicator value expressed per unit of material flow) multiplied with the material flow entering the process. Calculated sustainability values are then aggregated for the segments of the FWC or for the complete chain. The sustainability impact assessment requires carefully specified system boundaries. ToSIA uses a data-oriented approach that is very flexible in the focus of the analysis and the selection of indicators of sustainability. An example of alternative Norway spruce management systems in Southern Germany and their effects on six sustainability indicators is presented. The less intensive management system with natural regeneration and motor-manual harvesting shows higher carbon storage and slightly less energy use. It creates more employment and higher labour costs, but the average rate of accidents is also higher. ToSIA offers a transparent and consistent methodological framework to assess sustainability impacts in the forest-based sector as affected, e.g. by changes in policies, market conditions, or technology. The paper discusses strengths and limitations of the approach and provides an outlook on further development perspectives of the methodology. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","EFORWOOD; Environmental; Forest-based sector; Social and economic sustainability; Sustainability impact assessment; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable development","Average rate; Carbon storage; Economic sustainability; Energy use; Forest sectors; Forest-based sector; Further development; Indicator values; Industrial processing; Intensive management; Labour costs; Management systems; Market condition; Material Flow; Methodological frameworks; Motor-manual; Natural regeneration; Norway spruce; Per unit; Production process; Social sustainability; Software tool; Southern Germany; Sustainability impact assessment; Sustainability impacts; Sustainability indicators; System boundary; Timber frame house; Value chains; Wood production; Automobile exhibitions; Cost accounting; Employment; Energy harvesting; Environmental impact assessments; Harvesting; Population statistics; Production engineering; Reforestation; Strategic planning; Wages; Sustainable development; coniferous forest; environmental impact assessment; forest management; forestry production; market conditions; socioeconomic impact; software; sustainability; sustainable development; sustainable forestry; technological change; wood; Accounting; Automobiles; Employment; Exhibitions; Forests; Harvesting; Planning; Production Engineering; Reforestation; Salaries; Sustainable Forest Management; Germany; Picea abies; Tosia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955481174

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect the oxidized sulfur species (S2p binding energy from 167 to 168 eV) resulting from oxidation of the surfaces. CH3-terminated SAMs stored for a period of 9 weeks in a nitrogen chamber were not altered. The same did not happen with OH- and EG4-SAMs, for which the XPS spectra evidenced oxidized peaks after 2 weeks. Regarding the stability of these surfaces under biological conditions, 30 min of immersion at 37°C in serum-free or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented medium did not induce detectable oxidation. However, a small percentage of oxidized sulfur could have been washed out by the media, as confirmed in studies using SAMs immersed in water. Despite the possible rinsing out of oxidized thiols, high amounts of oxidation can still be detected by XPS. SAMs degradation during ethanol sterilization was not detectable by XPS, although a small increase on the wettability of OH-SAMs was observed. The data suggest that SAMs must be used freshly prepared, being recommended for short-term biological studies. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Biological conditions; Oxidized sulfur; Self-assembled monolayers; Stability; XPS","Biological studies; Fetal bovine serum; In-cell; Nitrogen chamber; Oxidized sulfur; Sams; Storage condition; XPS; XPS spectra; Binding energy; Body fluids; Cell culture; Ethanol; Organic polymers; Oxidation; Photodegradation; Stability; Sulfur; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Self assembled monolayers; self assembled monolayer; sulfur; article; female; measurement; molecular stability; nonhuman; oxidation; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Animals; Cattle; Culture Media; Ethanol; Materials Testing; Oxidation-Reduction; Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Sulfur; Surface Properties; Water; Wettability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954806701

These key conditions include early participation by major sectors and regions in sufficiently stringent policy regimes, and a wide portfolio of mitigation options. Bio-energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) play an important role in achieving low stabilisation targets. This would require optimistic lassumptions with respect to the expansion of the area needed for food production, to allow space for bio-energy crops, and a significant increase in the efficiency of second-generation biofuels.

Losses in ODM content were minor in all samples. These results might indicate that more divergent biological additives involving yeasts or enzymes during ensiling are preferred as maize preservation tools for anaerobic digestion instead of a spontaneous ensilage population or to add only homo- and hetero-fermentative strains.

In 2007 we introduced the Wireless Resonant Magnetic Micro-actuator (WRMMA) and its application in a successful microrobotic platform, the MagMite. The term MagMite is derived from Magnetic Mite - a tribute to the underlying magnetic propulsion principle and the microscale dimensions of the robot. The device harvests magnetic energy from the environment and effectively transforms it into impact-driven mechanical force while being fully controllable. It can be powered and controlled with oscillating fields in the kHz range and strengths as low as 2 mT, which is only roughly 50 times the average earth magnetic field. These microrobotic agents with dimensions less than 300 μm x 300 μm x 70 μm are capable of moving forward, backward and turning in place while reaching speeds in excess of 12:5 mm/s or 42 times the robot's body length per second. The robots produce enough force to push micro-objects of similar sizes and can be visually servoed through a maze in a fully automated fashion. The devices exhibit an overall degree of flexibility, controllability and performance unmatched by other microrobots reported in the literature. The robustness of the MagMites leads to high experimental repeatability, which in turn enabled them to successfully compete in the RoboCup 2007 and 2009 Nanogram competitions. In this video contribution we offer an integrated explanation of the non-intuitive MagMite actuation principle. This is achieved with the help of computer animation in direct comparison with real experimental footage. Furthermore, new recordings of the microrobots operating under dry and wet conditions while performing automated microhandling tasks are presented. ©2010 IEEE.",,"Actuation principles; Computer animation; Degree of flexibility; Dry and wet; Dry and wet conditions; Earth magnetic fields; Locomotion mechanism; Magnetic energies; Magnetic propulsion; Mechanical force; Micro-objects; Micro-scales; Microhandling; Microrobots; Nanograms; Oscillating fields; Power storage; RoboCup; Animation; Geomagnetism; Magnetic field effects; Robotics; Robots",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955781237

The experiment was performed in a beam of photons obtained by the method of the Compton backscattering of laser photons at the electron storage ring of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) by using a wide-aperture detector covering a solid angle close to 4π. The total photoabsorption cross sections were determined by two independent methods: by subtracting the emptytarget background and by summing partial cross sections for meson photoproduction. The total cross sections for photoabsorption on quasifree protons and neutrons are shown to agree both in magnitude and in shape within a 5% precision of the measurements. In contrast to data previously available in the literature, both cross sections show distinctly the F15(1680) resonance at a photon energy of about 1 GeV. Data obtained in the present experiment for the cross sections for photoabsorption on a free and a bound nucleon are compared. This comparison reveals a substantial role of two-nucleon correlations in estimating the nuclear-medium effect on meson photoproduction. © 2010 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955808788

The nanostructures exhibit the unique feature of Co or Co3O4 nanoparticles (20 nm) encapsulated inside and well-graphitized carbon layers coating outside. The peapod-like Co@carbon and Co3O4@carbon nanostructures exhibit intriguing morphologies, architectures, and chemical compositions. What is more important, the unique morphologies, architectures, and chemical compositions will lead to perfect performances in many applications. In this paper, a good example of Li-ion battery testing is given to demonstrate the superior stability and rate capability of the Co3O 4@carbon. The peapod-like nanostructure of Co3O 4@carbon demonstrates very high specific capacity (around 1000 mAh/g at the charge/discharge rate of 1C) and wonderful cyclability (at least 80% retention is available when cycled back from very high charge/discharge rate of 10C) during the galvanostatic cycling, indicating it as the promising candidate for Li-ion batteries' anodes. Additionally, the excellent electrochemical performance is significantly associated with the unique architecture in the samples, which verifies the feasibility of rational design of hierarchical materials for the actual applications. Meanwhile, the Co@carbon and Co 3O4@carbon nanostructures demonstrate the regular and uniform distribution of magnetic nanoparticles in well-graphitized carbon fiber, which is a great achievement in the field of monodispersing and isolating magnetic nanoparticles.

For one-dimensional and two-dimensional test systems, we previously showed that S-QN gives rise to efficient configurational space sampling with good thermodynamic consistency. Potential applications of S-QN are quite ambitious, and include structure optimization, analysis of correlations and automated extraction of cooperative modes. However, the potential can only be fully exploited if the computational and memory requirements of the original algorithm are significantly reduced. In this paper, we consider a factorized mobility matrix B=J JT and focus on the nontrivial fundamentals of an efficient algorithm for updating the noise multiplier J. The new algorithm requires O (n2) multiplications per time step instead of the O (n3) multiplications in the original scheme due to Choleski decomposition. In a recursive form, the update scheme circumvents matrix storage and enables limited-memory implementation, in the spirit of the well-known limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) method, allowing for a further reduction of the computational effort to O (n). We analyze in detail the performance of the factorized (FSU) and limited-memory (L-FSU) algorithms in terms of convergence and (multiscale) sampling, for an elementary but relevant system that involves multiple time and length scales.

Acoustic propagation in water is characterized by high and variable delays, fading effect, Doppler spread and multi path which in turn lead to a limited bandwidth and high error rates. Also, battery life and storage capacity of nodes is limited. So there is a need of suitable routing protocol that takes all these limitations into consideration and makes communication in underwater networks viable. This is the first attempt to analyze the performance of ad-hoc routing protocols in underwater acoustic network environment. We used performance metrics like packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, throughput, routing overhead and energy consumption of the sensor nodes.

However, it comes at the cost of timing overhead which is a problem for most of the applications where real-time constraints exist. Designing efficient power gated circuits is very challenging problem due to contrasting requirements in active mode (low timing overhead implying larger power switch size) and standby mode (low standby leakage power implying smaller power switch size). In this work, we show that applying Forward Body Biasing (FBB) to the logic gates in conjunction with power gating (PG + FBB) will provide us with an additional degree of freedom which can be utilized to improve the efficiency of the power gated circuit.

In order to validate the proposed idea, we build a system which adaptively changes the effect of the regularization parameter for the graph cut segmentation. The method calculates the probability of being part of the boundary for each pixel using the Canny edge detector at different hysteresis threshold levels. Then, it adjusts the regularization parameter of the pixel depending on the probability value.

The cultivation increased the amount of microbial biomass carbon and microbial respiration in peat mostly in the uppermost 5 cm layer where the impacts of roots and litter are most pronounced.

The activation of inflammatory pathways, used normally as host defence, reminds the seriousness of this condition. There is probably more than one cause for activation of inflammation. Apparently, metabolic overload evokes stress reactions, such as oxidative, inflammatory, organelle and cell hypertrophy, generating vicious cycles. Adipocyte hypertrophy, through physical reasons, facilitates cell rupture, what will evoke an inflammatory reaction. Inability of adipose tissue development to engulf incoming fat leads to deposition in other organs, mainly in the liver, with consequences on insulin resistance. The oxidative stress which accompanies feeding, particularly when there is excessive ingestion of fat and/or other macronutrients without concomitant ingestion of antioxidant-rich foods/beverages, may contribute to inflammation attributed to obesity. Moreover, data on the interaction of microbiota with food and obesity brought new hypothesis for the obesity/fat diet relationship with inflammation. Beyond these, other phenomena, for instance psychological and/or circadian rhythm disturbances, may likewise contribute to oxidative/inflammatory status. The difficulty in the management of obesity/metabolic syndrome is linked to their multifactorial nature where environmental, genetic and psychosocial factors interact through complex networks.

In an attempt to mitigate the externalities downstream due to a reduction in flow fluctuation, minimum flow requirements have been imposed to reservoir operators. However, it is now recognized that a varying flow regime including flow pulses provides the best conditions for many aquatic ecosystems. This paper presents a methodology to derive a trade-off relationship between hydropower generation and ecological preservation in a system with multiple reservoirs and stochastic inflows. Instead of imposing minimum flow requirements, the method brings more flexibility to the allocation process by building upon environmental valuation studies to derive simple demand curves for environmental goods and services, which are then used in a reservoir optimization model together with the demand for energy. The objective here is not to put precise monetary values on environmental flows but to see the marginal changes in release policies should those values be considered. After selecting appropriate risk indicators for hydropower generation and ecological preservation, the trade-off curve provides a concise way of exploring the extent to which one of the objectives must be sacrificed in order to achieve more of the other. The methodology is illustrated with the Zambezi River basin where large man-made reservoirs have disrupted the hydrological regime. © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"Allocation process; Aquatic ecosystem; Coordinated operation; Demand curves; Ecological preservation; Energy generations; Environmental flow; Environmental valuation; Flow fluctuations; Flow pulse; Flow regimes; Hydro-power generation; Hydrological regime; Minimum flow; Monetary value; Multi-reservoir systems; Optimization models; Risk indicators; River basins; Stochastic inflows; Storage facilities; Trade-off curves; Trade-off relationship; Zambezi river; Confined flow; Curve fitting; Ecology; Economics; Flow of water; Hydroelectric power; Rivers; Watersheds; Reservoirs (water); energy resource; environmental restoration; flow regulation; hydroelectric power; hydrological regime; inflow; multireservoir system; optimization; power generation; river basin; trade-off; water storage; Zambezi River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955179542

We suggest a novel spatially continuous approach for stereo matching based on the variational framework. The proposed method suggests a unique regularization term based on Mumford-Shah functional for discontinuity preserving, combined with a new energy functional for occlusion handling. The evaluation process is based on concurrent minimization of two coupled energy functionals, one for domain segmentation (occluded versus visible) and the other for disparity evaluation. In addition to a dense disparity map, our method also provides an estimation for the half-occlusion domain and a discontinuity function allocating the disparity/depth boundaries. Two new constraints are introduced improving the revealed discontinuity map. The experimental tests include a wide range of real data sets from the Middlebury stereo database. The results demonstrate the capability of our method in calculating an accurate disparity function with sharp discontinuities and occlusion map recovery. Significant improvements are shown compared to a recently published variational stereo approach. A comparison on the Middlebury stereo benchmark with subpixel accuracies shows that our method is currently among the top-ranked stereo matching algorithms. © 2006 IEEE.","Mumford-Shah functional; occlusion handling; Stereo matching; Total Variation; variational stereo vision","Mumford-Shah functionals; Occlusion handling; Stereo matching; Total variation; variational stereo vision; Stereo vision; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; photography; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photogrammetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149282989

In this paper we propose a foreground-background separation algorithm designed for multi-spectral images. The main contribution is the simultaneously utilization of spectral and spatial features. While spectral features incorporate the spectral components of the multi-spectral images, the spatial features are based on stroke properties. Higher order Markov Random Fields enables an efficient way to combine both features. To solve higher order energy functions, we introduce a new message update rule in the well known belief propagation algorithm based on a higher order potential function.

Many methods have been used to estimate this value, resulting in a very wide range of suggested rates from 10-7-10-14 cm2/s. We examine the diffusion of polymer chains formed using short low intensity exposures, recorded in a modified material composition and then use these results to provide an estimate of monomer diffusion under low viscosity conditions i.e. minimal uncrosslinked polymerisation. Our modification of the material involves removing the crosslinking agent, the purpose of which is to increase polymer chain size and complexity and so make the recorded grating more stable. Removing it, the chains should be shorter and more linear - i.e. closer to the size of the monomer and so the rate of diffusion of the polymerised chains should approach the rate of diffusion of the monomer as the exposure and duration energy are smaller. © 2010 SPIE.","Diffusion; Optical data storage; Photopolymer","Acrylamides; Cross linking agents; Diffusion rate; Holographic materials; Low viscosity; Low-intensity; Material compositions; Monomer diffusion; Polymer chains; Polymerisation; Amides; Diffusion; Monomers; Optical data processing; Optical data storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954976481

It is produced in almost every country of the world and it is a very important energy food, used as an ingredient in hundreds of manufactured foods, mainly in cereal-based products, for sweetness, flavour, colour, caramelisation and viscosity. Sugars represent the largest portion of honey composition (95-99% of the honey solids). Fructose and glucose are the most abundant sugars in honey, but others are usually mentioned, namely, sucrose, maltose, melibiose and trehalose. Its composition depends highly on the types of flowers used by the bees as well as on regional and climate conditions. Adulteration of honey is possible, so its quality must be controlled analytically with the aim of guaranteeing that it has not been adulterated and of preventing consumers from commercial speculations. Detection of honey adulteration is difficult and depends on the composition of the honey or on the presence of a specific component in the adulterant, like HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde). The presence of HMF in honey could be due to the partial decomposition of the endogenous or exogenous fructose or to the honey overheating. Therefore, the HMF content is essential to evaluate the quality of honey according to the current legislation. Both the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Alinorm 01/25, 2000) and the European Union (Directive 110/2001) established that its concentration in honey usually should not exceed 80 or 40 mg/kg, respectively. The present paper focuses on the determination of sugars (fructose and glucose) and HMF from different types of honey from Transylvania using UV-vis. spectrophotometry. The experimental results showed that some of investigated samples had high soluble solids, reducing sugars, but low moisture content and HMF indicating a good quality of the honey. In other samples, the too high HMF indicated their adulteration with invert sugar.","5-hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde; Adulteration; Honey","climate conditions; European Union; glucose; honeybee; sugar; viscosity; Romania; Transylvania; Apis mellifera; Apoidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954965015

In January 2010, Cavy Process Technology Ltd (DPT) entered into contracts with Datang Energy Chemical Co for a plant to produce SNG from coal. The scope of the project includes a technology license, basic engineering design, catalyst, and support services for the methanation unit that converts synthesis gas (syngas, mainly H2 and CO) to SNG (mainly CH4). In late 2009, Topsøe signed a design contract with an undisclosed client in China for a new plant that will produce SNG from coal-derived syngas. When the plant comes on stream in 2011, it will produce ∼ 180,000 N-cu m/hr of SNG, and will be the first large-scale order for Tremp technology. In April 2010, ConocoPhillips completed an agreement with POSCO, a Korean steel-manufacturing company, to use ConocoPhillip's E-Gas technology in POSCO's Gwangyang coal-to-SNG project. The facility will produce 500,000 ton of SNG from ≈ 1.8-million ton of coal. The E-Gas technology is also being used at the Wabash River Coal Gasification Plant, near Terre Haute, IN, and has been licensed by Mississippi Gasification LLC for a project planned for Moss Point, MS. Meanwhile, while coal-to-SNG technology makes a comeback in regions where coal is plentiful, other technologies are being developed to produce SNG from biomass, such as wood or straw. These numerous efforts to make so-called bio-SNG (or green gas) will not only lead to applications in coal- and gas-scarce regions, but have the added advantage over coal-based SNG of being nearly CO2 neutral - without CO2 capture and storage.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960640111

Bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice (without microbiota) increases by 60% their fat mass, alters their fasting glucose and insulin levels, triples their hepatic triglycerides and induces adipocyte hypertrophy. IM favors fat storage in adipocytes through the inhibition of Fiaf (Fasting-Induced Adipocyte Factor), an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase. Compared with normal weight subjects, the IM from obese exhibits a higher proportion of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and is more efficient in extracting energy from foodstuffs. The loss of bodyweight by a hypocaloric diet reverts the proportion of bacteria to that of lean subjects. The intake of a high fat diet also alters the IM, affecting intestinal barrier function and favoring endotoxinemia. These events increase oxidative and pro-inflammatory processes in plasma and peripheral tissues and increment the risk of insulin resistance. Such events are reverted by the administration of prebiotics which stimulate the growth of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species in the colon, reestablishing the gut homeostasis. Interestingly, products resulting from the fermentation of prebiotics stimulate the differentiation of enteroendocrine cells and the release of glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide YY, that have insulin-like and anorexigenic activities, thus contributing to body weight equilibrium.","Insulin resistance; Obesity; Prebiotics","prebiotic agent; article; drug effect; fat intake; human; insulin resistance; intestine; microbiology; obesity; Dietary Fats; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Intestines; Obesity; Prebiotics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649251964

Although evidence suggests that genetics plays an important role in body weight regulation, rapid increases in obesity rates do not seem to be caused by significant genetic changes within populations. Total energy expenditure and total energy intake are not the only factors that regulate body fat. Nitrogen and carbohydrate balances are eased by the capacity of the organism for adjusting amino acids and glucose oxidation rates, respectively. Regarding fat, this mechanism is considerably less precise; a fat intake increase does not stimulate its oxidation on the same basis. In addition, dietary fat is stored very efficiently as body fat. Elevated carbohydrate ingestion enhances glycogen reserves, which usually are much smaller than the maximum capacity of storage and enlargement of these stores, thus stimulating this nutrient's oxidation. These data point to a very well controlled carbohydrate balance in the body. Various studies show lack of efficiency of the hyperlipidic diet in stimulating satiety. Signals arising from the gastrointestinal tract play a fundamental role in regulation of appetite and energy intake, and evidence indicates that the gastrointestinal and hormonal mechanisms involved in the suppression of appetite and in energy intake are compromised in obesity. A high-fat diet is important in its origin. Additional studies are necessary to explain the mechanisms that lead to adipose tissue retention resulting in a fat-rich diet. © 2010 American College of Nutrition.","Diet; Fat intake; Insulin; Leptin; Obesity","adipocytokine; carbohydrate; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; ghrelin; glycogen; insulin; leptin; nitrogen; peptide YY; adipose tissue; appetite; body fat; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; energy balance; energy expenditure; fatty acid oxidation; gastrointestinal tract; hormonal regulation; human; hyperphagia; lipid diet; regulatory mechanism; review; satiety; Adipose Tissue; Appetite Regulation; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Gastrointestinal Hormones; Glycogen; Humans; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Satiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78549258820

Several interesting extensions of the standard model dealing with solution of this problem motivate the concept of hidden sectors consisting of SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y singlet fields. Among these models, the mirror matter model is certainly one of the most interesting. The model explains the origin of parity violation in weak interactions, it could also explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and provide a natural ground for the explanation of dark matter. The mirror matter could have a portal to our world through photon-mirror photon mixing (ε). This mixing would lead to orthopositronium (o-Ps) to mirror orthopositronium oscillations, the experimental signature of which is the apparently invisible decay of o - Ps. In this paper, we describe an experiment to search for the decay o-Ps→ invisible in vacuum by using a pulsed slow positron beam and a massive 4π BGO crystal calorimeter. The developed high efficiency positron tagging system, the low calorimeter energy threshold and high hermiticity allow the expected sensitivity in mixing strength to be ε b∼ 10-9, which is more than one order of magnitude below the current Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limit and in a region of parameter space of great theoretical and phenomenological interest.

It then relates this concept to current policy concerns about climate change and energy and presents research results about what a low-carbon energy system might look like and how it could be achieved. It then briefly explores the policy implications and possible macro-economic costs of moving to a low-carbon energy system. Technological transitions are relevant to climate change and energy because the energy system is a major technological system in society, and to reduce its carbon emissions dramatically, as is required if dangerous anthropogenic climate change is to be avoided, will require a full technological transition. There are many low-carbon technologies with the potential for large-scale deployment. Simulations suggest that the decarbonisation of the electricity system, involving any or all of carbon capture and storage, nuclear power and renewables, with increasing use of electricity in the residential and transport sectors, will be required. There may also be a role for bioenergy and hydrogen. In all cases strong public policies will be required to achieve large cuts in carbon emissions, involving carbon pricing, technology support and removing barriers to lifestyle and behaviour changes. Currently, while many different policies have been implemented, they have not been strongly enough applied to achieve sustained emissions reduction. Most models suggest that the macroeconomic costs of substantial cuts in carbon emissions are relatively small (1-4% GDP by 2050) compared to the costs of unabated dimate change. However, the political costs of implementing the required policies may mean that politicians are unable in practice to prevent runaway climate change.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957805889

Timber production in this sector is associated with increasing environmental burdens in terms of use of materials and energy, production of emissions and waste, and land use changes. The purpose of this study was to compile a comprehensive life cycle inventory (LCI) to identify the most dominant environmental pressures for five major production lines in the timber industry, and to evaluate the influence of the choice of the functional unit on the results (1 m3, 1 kg, and 1 euro). LCA's of wood typically base their functional unit on volume, but mass or money may be more appropriate for the rather different products considered in this study. Materials and methods The LCI covers five timber production lines, namely, air-dried lumber, kiln-dried lumber, plywood, veneer, and furniture parts. Three functional units were used for this study to identify the most appropriate basis for a fair comparison of the different timber products (functional units were 1 m 3, 1 kg and 1 euro). Questionnaires were administered to thirty selected companies in Ghana. These companies provided data about their material uses, energy requirements, and waste production for their operations from 2000 to 2007. The collected data were first converted into total annual average values, and next extrapolated to reflect the national average data for all 104 active companies. Finally, these data were expressed per functional unit for each of the five product lines on the basis of their production outputs (in volume, mass or money according to functional unit applied). Forest land used changes data was taken from the Ghana Timber Industry Development Division. Emissions for the several activities were taken from literature. esults and discussion Land use change for timber production in Ghana between the estimated periods turned out to be 34.0 × 103 ha per year, which will lead to complete deforestation in the year 2023 if continued. The total energy consumed by the timber sector per year was estimated at 1.9 × 10 9 MJ per year. The results showed that CO2 emissions by the timber sector activities per year accounted for 745k tons per year and dominate overall greenhouse gases emissions in the timber sector (changes in carbons storage related to land use changes not included). Wood waste by the timber sector accounted for 0.8 million m3 per year. The enormous wastage of wood contributes enormously to the rapid depletion of the country's timber resources. The choice of the functional unit influences inventory results. The money-based functional unit, which also seems more appropriate for the different products considered, favors the value-added. Value-added products with strict sustainable forest management policy hold a promising future in terms of sustainability for the timber industry in Ghana. Conclusions This study has yielded good quality primary data unique for LCA research in Africa. This will enhance LCA approaches in Ghana, and allows here identification of the main environmental pressures and their dominantly contributing processes in the timber sector. Land use changes due to forestry form a critical issue and require urgent attention. The chosen functional units' plays a crucial role in the environmental comparison of production line in the timber sector in Ghana. Recommendations and perspectives A comprehensive and transparent inventory for the timber industry provides the industry with an overview of areas in which material and thus economic savings can be made for the good of both environment and the industry finances. Good data keeping in the Ghanaian timber industry will help to build the required research capacity to develop local familiarity and competence in LCA techniques and applying these techniques will help to further certify tropical timber international markets. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Functional units; Ghanaian timber; Inventory analysis; Life cycle inventory (LCI); Tropical wood","carbon dioxide; air pollution; article; composite material; deforestation; energy resource; environmental sustainability; forest management; Ghana; greenhouse gas; industrial waste; industry; information retrieval; land use; life cycle assessment; priority journal; questionnaire; timber industry; wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956886460

Hydrogen absorption by activated palladium in base results in enhanced levels of surface activation and eventually to the spontaneous generation of recalcitrant hydrous oxide species which deactivate the electrode surface. Hydrous oxide behaviour at palladium in base is significantly more complicated than in acid; the deposits in question are less readily formed in base, and the main component of a multilayer oxide film grown in acid (HO2) seems to alter to a more readily reducible form (HO1) on transferring the electrode to base. However, evidence was obtained serendipitously in the present work for the formation of a recalcitrant oxide deposit on palladium in base; the involvement of metastable metal and hydrous oxide states provides the basis of energy storage and anomalous heat emission behaviour which is a controversial topic in the case of this electrode system. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Anomalous behaviour; Base; Electrochemistry; Oxide films; Palladium","Anomalous behaviour; Base; Controversial topics; Electrochemical behaviour; Electrode surfaces; Electrode systems; Heat emission; High energy; Hydrogen absorption; Hydrous oxides; Isolated atoms; Main component; Noble metals; Overpotential; Reduction products; Spontaneous generation; Surface activation; Acids; Deposits; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Palladium; Precious metals; Reduction; Oxide films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956483479

Some synthetic polymers, having chemical compositions resisting enzymatic attacks, can be microbially degraded with slower processes. Bioplastics is a term used for packaging materials derived from renewable resources and are considered safe to be used in food applications. In comparison to conventional plastics, the monomer composition of bio-based polymers can be differed by varying the producing strains, substrates and cosubstrates, and biopolymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), polylactic acid (PLA), polysaccahrides. PHAs are carbon-energy storage material accumulated intracellularly in a variety of microorganisms under controlled concentrations. Their biodegradability and possibility to be synthesised from renewable agricultural or even industrial wastes, make PHAs of considerable interest.

According to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, oil-output should expand from about 1.5 million to 3.5 million bpd by 2025. Rising production and limits on the water that can be drawn from the Athabasca River could lead to industry water shortages as soon as 2014, according to consultancy company RiskMetrics. Water levels may decline because of climate change, exacerbating any shortages - and probably requiring significant additional investments in water storage, treatment, and recycling facilities. Pembina predicts that existing and proposed oil-sands projects could result in the withdrawal of > 15% of the Athabasca River's water flow during its lowest flow periods, reducing the available fish habitat and impairing the health of the river's ecosystem. Indeed, a bigger problem for the industry is how to deal with the large volumes of watery, toxic mining waste - tailings - produced by open-pit mining. For 40 yr, producers were subject to a zero-discharge policy because of the toxins in the waste water. As a result, waste has gradually stockpiled. According to Pembina, it now covers an area of 170 sq km. In a report for Environmental Defense, Pembina estimated that seepage from the deposits amounts to 11 million L/day. In February 2009, the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board announced new rules to speed up the reclamation of tailings waste.

The reaction force, measured by the scale and recorded (throughout time) as an electrical signal, is analyzed via system identification principles for estimating the fish stiffness and damping ability in each freshness stage. Results highlight significant and highly repeatable reductions of the fish damping in 6 days of ice storage, due to textural changes undermining its ability of absorbing the shock-induced energy. The methodology correlates well with organoleptic findings, describing significant elasticity loss in the 6th day ice-stored fish.

However, the influence of the homogenisation-induced mechanical stress on β-glucan has not been reported. The influence of three different homogenisers (two high-pressure homogenisers and a rotor/stator homogeniser) was examined in terms of the change in flow and molecular properties of oat β-glucan in semi-dilute and concentrated solutions. A clear and irreversible decrease in viscosity and change in flow behaviour were observed after each homogenisation treatment of the semi-dilute solution. The viscosity had a linear relationship with molar mass in the high-pressure homogenised samples and they both decreased in parallel with the mechanical energy input. With the molar mass decrease, the shape of β-glucan became more spherical and dense. In addition, the molecular weight distribution narrowed and storage-related viscosity stabilized. No considerable differences between the influences of the two high-pressure techniques were observed inconsistently with previous studies. Both molecular and technical characteristics were concluded to affect the fragmentation of β-glucan in high-pressure homogenisation. Since homogenisation enhanced the structural stability of the solution and the fragmentation was dependent on the energy input, the techniques were concluded to be relevant methods for controlled fragmentation of β-glucan. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","β-Glucan; High-pressure homogenisation; Molecular weight; Solution properties",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955054924

One approach to improve drug solubility and administration flexibility is by wet milling to nanosize. Particle size reduction increases the surface energy which requires adequate stabilization by excipients. In this study, the practically water-insoluble miconazole was nanoground, and a variety of surface active and polymeric excipients were tested for their stabilizing effects. For efficient milling, two preformulation criteria had to be fulfilled: a relatively low contact angle (<70°) and high dispersibility of the native drug particles in the milling medium. Hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC-LF) in combination with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) stabilized best the miconazole nanosuspensions. A design of experiments was used to achieve drug particle mean sizes of 140-170. nm by varying the concentrations of miconazole (5 and 20%, w/w), SDS (0.05 and 0.2%, w/w), and HPC-LF (1.25 and 5%, w/w). Further experiments revealed that minimal 0.0125% SDS and 3.125% HPC-LF were required for miconazole nanogrinding and nanosuspension stabilisation. Storage of the nanosuspensions at 5°C for up to 6 months caused only minor changes, whereas storage at 25°C resulted in particle agglomeration and single crystal growth. Altogether the study showed that excellent wetting of drug particles as well as their electrostatic and steric stabilization by excipients is necessary to produce stable nanosuspensions by nanogrinding. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Drug solubility; Miconazole; Nanogrinding; Nanonization; Nanosuspension; Suspension stability","dodecyl sulfate sodium; hydroxypropylcellulose; hydroxypropylmethylcellulose; miconazole; nanoparticle; nanosuspension; poloxamer; povidone; unclassified drug; antifungal agent; cellulose; excipient; miconazole; nanomaterial; article; contact angle; drug design; drug formulation; drug solubility; drug stability; drug storage; grinding; particle size; preformulation; priority journal; process optimization; screening; stereospecificity; storage temperature; storage time; thermostability; time; analogs and derivatives; chemical model; chemistry; medicinal chemistry; nanotechnology; pharmaceutics; procedures; solubility; temperature; viscosity; Antifungal Agents; Cellulose; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Drug Compounding; Drug Stability; Drug Storage; Excipients; Miconazole; Models, Chemical; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Particle Size; Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate; Solubility; Technology, Pharmaceutical; Temperature; Time Factors; Viscosity; Antifungal Agents; Cellulose; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Drug Compounding; Drug Stability; Drug Storage; Excipients; Miconazole; Models, Chemical; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Particle Size; Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate; Solubility; Technology, Pharmaceutical; Temperature; Time Factors; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955052417

Solutions that reduce the impact of these problems are urgently needed. Common reed (Phragmites australis) is capable of sanitizing surface water and may function as green energy source because of its high productivity. Here, the results of an experiment in a constructed wetland in the Netherlands are presented where two different sanitation treatments were compared. Depending on the residence time and volume per unit area, reed is capable to reduce the total amount of nitrogen in the water with average efficiencies from 32 to 47% and the total amount of phosphorous with 27-45%. Although biomass production still varies largely between different parts of the constructed wetland, a rapid increase in biomass was observed since planting. Constructed wetlands with reed provide opportunities to improve water quality and reed produces enough biomass to serve as green energy source. Moreover, these wetlands also function as a flood water reservoir and are possibly advantageous for biodiversity. The optimal moment of reed harvesting depends on the goal of the owner. This moment should be chosen wisely, as it may have consequences for reed filter regeneration, biomass production, biodiversity, methane emission and water sanitation efficiency. © 2010 The Author(s).","Biomass production; Constructed wetlands; Phragmites australis; Reed; Water sanitation; Water storage","agricultural practice; biodiversity; biomass; constructed wetland; desiccation; drought; eutrophication; flooding; hydrological response; methane; nitrogen; phosphorus; reedbed; residence time; sanitation; surface water; water quality; water storage; water treatment; Netherlands; Phragmites australis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954623100

To save on storage energy, the DRAM should be small and the disk should be spun down for long periods of time. We show that this can be achieved for predominantly streaming workloads by connecting the disk to the DRAM via a large non-volatile memory (NVM). We refer to this as the NVM-based architecture (NVMBA); the conventional architecture with only a DRAM and a disk is referred to as DRAMBA. The NVM in the NVMBA acts as a traffic reshaper from the disk to the DRAM. The total system costs are balanced, since the cost increase due to adding the NVM is compensated by the decrease in DRAM cost. We analyze the energy saving of NVMBA, with NAND flash memory serving as NVM, relative to DRAMBA with respect to (1) the streaming demand, (2) the disk form factor, (3) the best-effort provision, and (4) the stream location on the disk. We present a worst-case analysis of the reliability of the disk drive and the flash memory, and show that a small flash capacity is sufficient to operate the system over a year at negligible cost. Disk lifetime is superior to flash, so that is of no concern. © The Author(s) 2008.","Disk drive; DRAM; Energy efficiency; NAND flash; Non-volatile memory; Soft real-time system; Streaming architecture","Disk drive; NAND Flash; Non-volatile memories; Soft real-time systems; Streaming architecture; Approximation theory; Architecture; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Disks (structural components); Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Real time systems; Reliability analysis; Flash memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954563857

Methods Six male subjects were randomly divided into three different groups: control, low CHO and high CHO. These groups differed in the diet to which the subjects were submitted before each exercise session. The lipid profile [triglycerides (TG), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, TG/HDL-C ratio and total cholesterol) was determined at rest, immediately after exercise and 1 h after exercise bouts. Results The time to exhaustion was lower in the low CHO condition compared with the control and high CHO condition (3·59 ± 0·72; 2·91 ± 0·56; and 4·26 ± 0·69 min; P &lt; 0·05). The energy expenditure (control: 251·1 ± 56·0 kJ; low CHO: 215·2 ± 28·6 kJ; and high CHO: 310·4 ± 64·9 kJ) was significantly different between the low and high CHO conditions (P &lt; 0·05). There were no significant changes in the lipid profile for any of the experimental conditions (control, low and high; P &lt; 0·05).

It concludes that when these criteria are taken into consideration, renewable electricity technologies present policy makers with a superior alternative for minimising the risk of fuel interruptions and shortages, helping improve the fragile transmission network and reducing environmental harm. These more environmentally-friendly generators cost less to construct, produce power in smaller increments and need not rely on continuous government subsidies. They generate little to no waste, have fewer greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity produced and do not substantially contribute to the risk of accidents. In contrast, the costs for nuclear plant construction, fuel, reprocessing, storage, decommissioning and further research are expected to rise. Modern nuclear reactors are prone to accidents, failures, shortages of high quality uranium ore may be imminent and the thermoelectric fuel cycle of nuclear plants consumes and degrades vast quantities of water. Greenhouse gas emissions associated with the nuclear lifecycle are notable and reactors and waste storage sites can degrade land and the natural environment. Thus, the article concludes that any effective response to electricity demand in an Asia facing climate change should promote the rapid expansion of renewable technologies and a more limited use of nuclear power. © 2010 Journal of Contemporary Asia.","Climate change; Energy policy; Energy security; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953826739

The new fossil fuelled capacity needed and the likely technology mix are estimated using a cost optimisation model based on the screening curve method, taking into consideration the rate of retirement of the current power plant fleet, the capacity already planned or under construction and the role of carbon capture and storage technologies. This analysis shows that measures to increase both non-fossil-fuel-based power generation and the price of CO2 are necessary to drive the composition of the European power generation capacity so that the European policy goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is achieved.

In order to explore the potential for a 100% renewable electricity generation system with substantially increased levels of wind penetration, fossil-fuelled electricity production was removed from an historic 3-year data set, and replaced by modelled electricity production from wind, geothermal and additional peaking options. Generation mixes comprising 53-60% hydro, 22-25% wind, 12-14% geothermal, 1% biomass and 0-12% additional peaking generation were found to be feasible on an energy and power basis, whilst maintaining net hydro storage. Wind capacity credits ranged from 47% to 105% depending upon the incorporation of demand management, and the manner of operation of the hydro system. Wind spillage was minimised, however, a degree of residual spillage was considered to be an inevitable part of incorporating non-dispatchable generation into a stand-alone grid system.

This software application enables conducting an operational evaluation of a studied photovoltaic system in terms of energy exchange with the electrical grid. The system model consists of a photovoltaic array, a converter and an optional generic energy storage component that supports scheduled charging/discharging. In addition to system design parameters, the software uses hourly solar data and hourly load data to determine the amount of energy exchanged with electrical grid for each hour of the simulated year. The resulting information is useful in assessing the impact of the system on demand for electrical energy of a building that uses it. The software also aggregates these hourly results in daily, monthly and full year sums. The software finds the financial benefit of the system as the difference in grid electrical energy cost between two simultaneously considered cases. One is with load supplied only by the electrical grid, while the other is with the photovoltaic system present and contributing energy. The software supports the energy pricing scheme used in Jordan for domestic consumers, which is based on slices of monthly consumption.

The PCM storage advantage is firstly demonstrated under controlled energy input experiments with the aid of an electrical heater on an isolated storage tank, with and without the PCM containers. It was found that the use of the suggested configuration can result in a 13-14 °C advantage in the stored hot water temperature over extended periods of time. The storage performance was also investigated when connected to flat plate collectors in a closed-loop system with conventional natural circulation. Over a test period of 24 h, the stored water temperature remained at least 30 °C higher than the ambient temperature.

The sustainability of such system is based on solar photovoltaic (PV) and hydroelectric (HE) energy as renewable energy sources (RES). For the purpose of connecting all relevant values into one integral SHE system, a mathematical model was developed for selecting the optimal size of the PV power plant as the key element for estimating the technological feasibility of the overall solution. Sensitivity analysis (parameter analysis) was made for the model, where local climate parameters were varied: solar radiation, air temperature, reservoir volume, total head, precipitation, evaporation and natural water inflow. It has been established that, apart from total head (which is to be expected), solar radiation, hydro accumulation size and natural water inflow have the biggest effect on the calculated power of the PV power plant. The obtained results clearly show a wide range of implementation of the new energy source (SHE system), i.e. from relatively cold climates to those abundant in solar energy, but also with relatively small quantity of water, because it only recirculates within the system. All this points to the necessity for further development of hybrid systems (RES + HE systems) and to the fact that they could play an important role in achieving climate objectives. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In the recent decade, with the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, and smart electrical appliances, the centralized model may no longer hold, and the supply and demand for electricity become more dynamic. Moreover, the latest developed information and communication technologies (ICT) and power electronic technologies could enhance the efficiency and performance of power system operations. Recently, concerns with global warming have prompted many countries to announce research programs on smart grid, which is the transformation of the traditional electric power grid into an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly grid by the integration of ICT, power electronic, storage and control technologies. With the smart grid, there is an opportunity for a new operating paradigm that recognizes the changing structures of the power grid with renewable generation, and the high-resolution data, high speed communications, and high performance computation available with the advanced information infrastructure.

The impact of wax modification on binder, binder/filler mixtures, and mastic asphalt was investigated in the laboratory. Wax modified binder properties were determined using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and conventional tests (softening point, penetration, elastic recovery, breaking point, viscosity, and storage stability). The bending beam rheometer (BBR) was used for determining low temperature creep compliance and the tensile stress restrained specimen test (TSRST) for determining low temperature fracture. The fatigue cracking behavior of mastic asphalt was investigated using Superpave Indirect Tensile Test (IDT). Based on hot mix asphalt (HMA) Fracture Mechanics the influence of wax on the asphalt mixture resistance to fatigue and brittle cracking has been evaluated. The addition of wax to the polymer modified binder resulted in a viscosity reduction at higher temperatures, indicating a possible lower production and laying temperature as compared to asphalt without wax additive. DMA and BBR results showed some increase in stiffness and a more elastic response of the wax modified binder at medium and low temperatures. The TSRST fracture temperature was higher for the mastic asphalt containing wax, indicating a certain negative impact of wax modification. © Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering.","Energy saving; HMA fracture mechanics; Low temperature performance; Superpave IDT","Asphalt mixture; Bending beam rheometer; Breaking point; Elastic recovery; Elastic response; Energy saving; Fatigue cracking; Higher temperatures; Hot mix asphalt; Indirect tensile test; Low temperature creep; Low temperature performance; Low temperatures; Mastic asphalt; Mechanical performance; Modified binders; Negative impacts; Polymer-modified binders; Softening points; Specimen tests; Storage stability; Superpave; Viscosity reduction; Asphalt pavements; Beams and girders; Binders; Brittle fracture; Dynamic analysis; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Energy conservation; Fourier transforms; Fracture mechanics; Infrared spectroscopy; Low temperature properties; Mechanical properties; Tensile testing; Viscosity; Wavelet transforms; Asphalt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651573129

The present study aimed to quantify the associations between 10 novel and known single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes coding for leptin and leptin receptor with performance traits in 848 Holstein-Friesian sires, estimated from performance of up to 43,117 daughter-parity records per sire.Results: All single nucleotide polymorphisms were segregating in this sample population and none deviated (P > 0.05) from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Complete linkage disequilibrium existed between the novel polymorphism LEP-1609, and the previously identified polymorphisms LEP-1457 and LEP-580. LEP-2470 associated (P < 0.05) with milk protein concentration and calf perinatal mortality. It had a tendency to associate with milk yield (P < 0.1). The G allele of LEP-1238 was associated (P < 0.05) with reduced milk fat concentration, reduced milk protein concentration, longer gestation length and tended to associate (P < 0.1) with an increase in calving difficulty, calf perinatal mortality and somatic cells in the milk. LEP-963 exhibited an association (P < 0.05) with milk fat concentration, milk protein concentration, calving difficulty and gestation length. It also tended to associate with milk yield (P < 0.1). The R25C SNP associated (P < 0.05) with milk fat concentration, milk protein concentration, calving difficulty and length of gestation. The T allele of the Y7F SNP significantly associated with reduced angularity (P < 0.01) and reduced milk protein yield (P < 0.05). There was also a tendency (P < 0.1) for Y7F to associate with increased body condition score, reduced milk yield and shorter gestation (P < 0.1). A80V associated with reduced survival in the herd (P < 0.05).Conclusions: Several leptin polymorphisms (LEP-2470, LEP-1238, LEP-963, Y7F and R25C) associated with the energetically expensive process of lactogenesis. Only SNP Y7F associated with energy storage. Associations were also observed between leptin polymorphisms and calving difficulty, gestation length and calf perinatal mortality. The lack of an association between the leptin variants investigated with calving interval in this large data set would question the potential importance of these leptin variants, or indeed leptin, in selection for improved fertility in the Holstein-Friesian dairy cow. © 2010 Giblin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"leptin; leptin receptor; milk fat; milk protein; leptin; leptin receptor; allele; article; body constitution; dairy cattle; energy conservation; energy expenditure; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic code; genetic trait; gestation period; herd; milk production; milk yield; mortality; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; perinatal mortality; progeny; single nucleotide polymorphism; somatic cell; survival rate; animal; cattle; chemistry; DNA sequence; female; genetics; genotype; lactation; male; milk; Bos; Bovinae; Friesia; Animals; Cattle; Female; Genotype; Lactation; Leptin; Linkage Disequilibrium; Male; Milk; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, Leptin; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954984539

A major change in the energy economy from fossil energy carriers to renewable energy fluxes is necessary. The main challenge is to efficiently convert renewable energy into electricity and the storage of electricity or the production of a synthetic fuel. Hydrogen is produced from water by electricity through an electrolyser. The storage of hydrogen in its molecular or atomic form is a materials challenge. Some hydrides are known to exhibit a hydrogen density comparable to oil; however, these hydrides require a sophisticated storage system. The system energy density is significantly smaller than the energy density of fossil fuels. An interesting alternative to the direct storage of hydrogen are synthetic hydrocarbons produced from hydrogen and CO2 extracted from the atmosphere. They are CO2 neutral and stored like fossil fuels. Conventional combustion engines and turbines can be used in order to convert the stored energy into work and heat. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Efficiency; Energy carriers; Hydrogen; Synthetic fuels","Energy management; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Heat engines; Hydrides; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Renewable energy resources; Conventional combustions; Electrolysers; Energy carriers; Energy demands; Energy density; Energy economy; Fossil energy; Hydrogen densities; Renewable energies; Storage of hydrogen; Storage systems; Stored energy; Synthetic hydrocarbons; System energy; Synthetic fuels; carbon dioxide; hydrogen; water; chemistry; electricity; energy conservation; energy resource; photosynthesis; power supply; review; solar energy; time; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Energy Resources; Electric Power Supplies; Electricity; Energy-Generating Resources; Hydrogen; Photosynthesis; Solar Energy; Time Factors; Water",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955496897

The plate is exposed in a light-tight cassette and then read out in a digitizer to create the digital image. Traditionally, CR powder imaging plates (PIP) are used based on BaFBr1-xIx:Eu2+ phosphor. The active layer consists of phosphor micro-crystals in a polymer binder. A needle imaging plate (NIP), created by vapor deposition of needle-shaped phosphor crystals, is expected to lead to better image quality. A first reason is that lateral light spread is less in NIP. Further, the system gain is higher, because more storage centers are created per unit of absorbed X-ray energy, because read-out depth can be higher and because the stimulated light escape efficiency is higher. The more transparent NIP guarantees a more constant image contribution over the thickness of the plate. Finally, the NIP layer is more homogeneous than the PIP layer, which leads to a lower degree of screen-structure noise. Measurements confirm that CsBr:Eu2+ NIP's in CR mammography have significantly better image quality (DQE), especially in the high frequency range. A linear-systems approach is used to model signal and noise transfer in a CR system using PIP or NIP. The transfers are described by cascading transfer relationships for each process. The calculated image quality (DQE) is in good agreement with measurement for both the NIP and the PIP systems. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","computed radiography (CR); detective quantum efficiency; digital mammography; image quality measurement; modeling; needle imaging plate","Computed radiography; Detective quantum efficiency; Digital mammography; Image quality measurement; Imaging plate; Crystals; Europium; Image quality; Light emission; Needles; Particle detectors; Phosphors; Plates (structural components); Quantum efficiency; Radiology; X ray radiography; Digital image storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954646314

We propose a new type of spatially periodic structure - polaritonic crystal (PolC) formed by trapped two-level atoms interacting with quantum electromagnetic field in one-dimensional array of tunnelcoupled microcavities, which allows polaritons to be fully localized. The quantum degeneracy and phase transition to superfluid (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-type) state for low branch polaritons is discussed. The principal result is that the group velocity of polaritons depends essentially on the order parameter of the system, i.e. on the average photon number in the cavity array. An algorithm for the spatially distributed writing, storing, and retrieving of quantum optical information using polariton wave packet propagated in the cavity array is examined.

Multi-bank memory architecture is commonly applied in 8-bit microcontrollers to increase the size of memory without extending address buses. To switch among different memory banks, a special instruction, Bank Selection, is used. How to minimize the number of bank selection instructions inserted is important to reduce code size for embedded systems. In this paper, we consider how to insert the minimum number of bank selection instructions in a program to achieve feasibility. A program can be represented by a control flow graph (CFG). We prove that it is NP-Hard to insert the minimum number of bank selection instructions if all the variables are pre-assigned to memory banks. Therefore, we introduce a 2-approximation algorithm using a rounding method. When the CFG is a tree or the out-degree of each node in the CFG is at most two, we show that we can insert the bank selection instructions optimally in polynomial time. We then consider the case when there are some nodes that do not access any memory bank and design a dynamic programming method to compute the optimal insertion strategy when the CFG is a tree. Experimental result shows the proposed techniques can reduce bank selection instructions significantly on partitioned memory architecture. © 2010 ACM.","bank selection instruction minimization; partitioned memory architecture","8-bit microcontrollers; Address bus; Code size; Control flow graphs; Dynamic programming methods; Low costs; Memory Architecture; Memory banks; NP-hard; Optimal insertion; Polynomial-time; Rounding method; Approximation algorithms; Dynamic programming; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Linguistics; Microcontrollers; Optimization; Polynomial approximation; Program compilers; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954519424

It relies on the use of edge-triggered flip-flops as the only storage elements, not only for the datapaths, but also for the control circuits; latches and C-elements that are common in many asynchronous circuit design styles are not required. The design template uses a two-phase handshake protocol for inter-component communication. In a pipeline structure, these circuits operate near the speed of Mousetrap circuits, but the required design-flow is simpler. The implementation style - which we refer to as Click elements - has been chosen to resemble synchronous circuits as much as possible. This allows for the use of conventional optimization and timing tools in the design flow and for a cheaper design-for-test implementation. The click templates are well suited for a data-flow driven compilation flow, which avoids much of the control overhead of traditional syntax-directed compilation. The two-phase circuits show a significant improvement in performance and energy efficiency compared to four-phase single-rail circuits. © 2010 IEEE.","Asynchronous circuits; Control-data-flow circuits; Pipelines; Two-phase circuits","Asynchronous circuit design; Asynchronous circuits; Control circuits; Control overhead; Conventional optimization; Data-driven; Data-paths; Dataflow; Design flows; Design for test; Design templates; Four-phase; Handshake protocol; New design; Phase circuits; Pipeline structure; Storage Elements; Synchronous circuits; Design; Energy efficiency; Flip flop circuits; Flow measuring instruments; Pipelines; Integrated circuit manufacture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954500990

Squirrel simplifies developing such applications by decoupling data processing from storage, and by transparently handling the latter. We achieve this through: i) a modular programming abstraction, and ii) a lightweight run-time layer that efficiently allocates data to different storage areas, based on size vs. energy tradeoffs.

We have designed cache-integrated network interfaces (NIs), appropriate for scalable multicores, that combine the best of two worlds the flexibility of caches and the efficiency of scratchpad memories: on-chip SRAM is configurably shared among caching, scratchpad, and virtualized NI functions. This paper presents our architecture, which provides local and remote scratchpad access, to either individual words or multi-word blocks through RDMA copy. Furthermore, we introduce event responses, as a mechanism for software configurable synchronization primitives. We present three event response mechanisms that expose NI functionality to software, for multiword transfer initiation, memory barriers for explicitly-selected accesses of arbitrary size, and multi-party synchronization queues. We implemented these mechanisms in a four-core FPGA prototype, and evaluated the on-chip communication performance on the prototype as well as on a CMP simulator with up to 128 cores. We demonstrate efficient synchronization, low-overhead communication, and amortized-overhead bulk transfers, which allow parallelization gains for fine-grain tasks, and efficient exploitation of the hardware bandwidth. © 2010 ACM.","cache; explicit communication; inter-processor synchronization; network interface","Bulk transfer; Configurable; Event-response; Explicit communication; Four-core; Integrated networks; Multi-word; On chip communication; On chips; Overhead communications; Parallelizations; Processor synchronization; Scratch pad memory; Scratchpad; Synchronization mechanisms; Synchronization primitive; Communication; Computer software; Interfaces (computer); Microprocessor chips; Nanotechnology; Static random access storage; Synchronization; Telecommunication networks; Telecommunication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954469274

The primary particles of the photocatalysts were around 10 nm, and the mean size of the catalyst clusters in water was about 100 nm. The band gaps of the catalysts ranged from 2.25 to 2.46 eV. The experiments of photocatalytic H2 generation showed that the catalysts (CdS)x/(ZnS)1-x with x ranging from 0.1 to 1 were able to produce hydrogen from water photolysis under visible light. The catalyst with x = 0.9 had the highest rate of hydrogen production. The catalyst loading density also influenced the photo-hydrogen production rate, and the best catalyst concentration in water was 1 g L-1. The stability of the nano-catalysts in terms of size, morphology and activity was satisfactory during an extended test period for a specific hydrogen production rate of 2.38 mmol g-1 L-1 h-1 and a quantum yield of 16.1% under visible light (165W Xe lamp, λ &gt; 420 nm). The results demonstrate that the (CdS)/(ZnS) core/shell nano-particles are a novel photo-catalyst for renewable hydrogen generation from water under visible light.

The analysis is made taking into consideration the correlation between energy balances, public energy R&D spending and long-term energy policy objectives. Special attention is directed towards the prospective of developing cleaner forms of energy production. Governments in the European Union are increasingly accepting the implications of climate change and taking measures to transform their economies to a low carbon future. In this context, energy research development and demonstration (RD&D) are important policy instruments to meet national energy and climate policy objectives. Long-term public investments in RD&D play a central role in achieving these goals. It suggests that despite an increase in recent years, the three selected countries award a relatively low importance to energy research. When looking at research areas which receive public funding, it emerges that renewable energy and energy efficiency are highly prioritised, when compared to other areas such as fossil and nuclear energy. In all three countries, biomass research in particular is awarded extensive importance. It appears that changing preferences in society (relative to the incumbent need to reduce green house gases) are driving the political priorities towards funding more climate-friendly energy technologies. The three countries remain, to a large extent, dependent on fossil fuels in their energy balance. The paper concludes that increased attention on new renewable energy source and carbon capture and storage is needed if policy makers are determined in their intentions to direct their societies towards a low carbon future. © 2010 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Energy mix; Energy policy; Innovation; Low carbon economy; RD&D budgets; Renewable energy; Research and development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873249931

This paper reports the microbiologically induced corrosion (MIC) and electrochemical behavior of aluminum alloy (AA 2024) in the presence of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria Bacillus cereus ACE4 (a Gram-positive bacteria) and Serratia marcescens ACE2 (a Gram-negative bacteria). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and metallographic analysis of the metal AA 2024 exposed to a simulated fuel tank environment showed that the bacteria caused pitting corrosion. Scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (SEM-EDAX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses of the aluminum alloy coupons with bacterial biofilm developed after exposure to minimal salt medium confirmed that extracellular polymeric substances accumulate with exposure time and revealed that biofilms are formed as microcolonies, which subsequently cause pitting corrosion. Hydrophobicity of the cell surface was examined using bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons (BATH) assay. The hydrophobicity and emulsification index of B. cereus ACE4 grown in n-hexadecane containing medium was higher (86% and E72 85%) than that of S. marcescens ACE2 (60% and E72 75%), This significant difference may be due to the efficiency of biosurfactant production, which contributes to increase in the cell surface hydrophobicity of the B. cereus ACE4, and enhanced bacterial adhesion on the AA 2024 metal surface.

Traditional fish production has some inherent food safety concerns considering the high susceptibility of seafood to bacterial spoilage. Some strategies of seafood products preservation using lactic acid bacteria producing bacteriocin are not very expensive and do not consume energy very much. They can be adapted in the preservation of fish in Senegal particularly in the fermentation in which the catches, generally handled for many hours at ambient temperature, are only added salt (NaCl) and sun dried. Lactic acid bacteria producing bacteriocins could be used as starters (with addition of carbohydrates) during the preparation of fish for rendering them more resistant to the growth of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria by in situ production of organic acids and bacteriocins. A second alternative of application of these bacteria is to use bactericidal solutions obtained from their cultures as additional barrier to sodium chloride to prevent growth of the flora during fish storage for maturation. These new strategies of preparation combined with drying can be used to enhance microbiological and dietetic qualities of local seafood commodities.","Bacteriocins; Fermentation; Fsh; Lactic acid bacteria; Salt; Senegal","Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954172093

The electron beam can also be used as a target for an electron-ion recombination reaction, which offers a chance to carry out atomic physics experiments and ensure slow uniform extraction of the ion beam from the storage ring. A high-per-veance electron beam with a variable profile is required for effective cooling, while a high current density and a low energy of transverse motion of electrons in the beam is needed for extraction by means of recombination. It is shown that a convex cathode placed in a magnetic field can be used to form such a beam. A high current density can be attained with this shape of the cathode, but additional efforts must be focused on optimizing the gun's optics in order to obtain a low energy of transverse motion of particles. Since ions repeatedly pass through the cooling section during their lifetime at different values of the betatron oscillation phase, the rates of recombination and cooling are dependent on the rms electron velocity averaged over the volume in which the beam interaction occurs. The proposed design of the gun with a convex cathode 10.2 mm in diameter ensures formation of a variable-profile electron beam with a nominal current of 1 A and a current density of 1.2 A/cm2. The rms energy of Larmor gyration of electrons at the exit from the gun, averaged over the beam cross section (the ""transverse"" temperature) is 1 eV. A focusing electrode that forms the Pierce optics near the edge of the cathode, an electrode controlling the beam profile, and an anode are included in the optics of the electron gun. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2010.",,"Beam cross section; Beam interactions; Beam profiles; Betatron oscillations; Cooling section; Electron coolers; Electron velocity; Electron-ion recombinations; High current densities; Low energies; Nominal currents; Phase volume; Transverse motions; Atomic physics; Betatrons; Cathodes; Cooling; Electron beams; Electron guns; Electron optics; Electrons; Ion beams; Ions; Magnetic fields; Optics; Current density",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053424359

All the strains were subjected to fermentation and showed PHA accumulation with glucose, gluconate or octanoate as carbon source. In order to obtain PHA produced by these strains, a special procedure was developed, which allowed 80% PHA recovered. Differences in msc-PHA accumulation were observed in chemically induced mutants. RAPD analysis of these mutants proved that some rearrangements are produced as result of mutagenesis. The best results concerning msc-PHA accumulation were obtained when 0.4% octanoate was used. Different other lipid substrates (vegetal oils) were tested in order to establish the best substrate that allowed the largest accumulation of PHA. The results showed that the selected strains of P. putida (wild type or mutant) could utilize oil waste in the medium as a carbon source better than that of glucose and thus could substantially lower the cost of production of PHA. © 2010 University of Bucharest.","Carbon source; Mutants; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Pseudomans putida; Recombinant strains","Bacteria (microorganisms); Pseudomonas putida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957002009

The film formed by Metolose® SM-4 polymer containing Macrogol 2000 (polyethylene glycol) as plasticizer showed structure changes depending on the concentration of the plasticizer during storage. This could be explained by the fact that the small quantity of plasticizer can be built in among the methyl cellulose molecules more easily, while the greater amount of plasticizer forms a separate phase in the beginning and can be built in into the film structure only later. On the other hand, the water bound by the hygroscopic property of the plasticizer can further influence the properties of the film as water also serves to function as a plasticizer. The increase in the quantity of the plasticizer enhanced the tensile strength of the film: the resulting film was less breakable and easier to handle mechanically.

The company works closely with several major large engine companies, and such work has increased in both volume and importance as rising fuel costs and tighter emission regulations have forced engine designers as well as vessel operators to look towards ever more radical solutions to raising efficiency without compromising cleanliness. The company is exploring advanced technology in the whole power and propulsion system. Advanced computer modeling and simulation technology permits relevant and in-depth research and development into fuel cell and hybrid technology using various techniques, in some cases executed in real time. The company sees considerable potential in radial turbines, bottoming- or organic-Rankine cycles, and split cycle regenerative engine technologies. Other current activities include research into true hybrid technologies for ship propulsion. Battery-based systems are an obvious choice, similar to those used in hybrid road vehicles, but batteries have proved less than ideal in marine applications. They are heavy, bulky, and costly in terms of initial investment and replacement. Fuel reforming has been a significant part of Ricardo's work. Energy recovery and energy storage technologies also have promising applications in the marine sector. However, as with most technologies, existing hybrid propulsion technology is cost effective up to a point, but becomes a very costly option as higher levels of CO2 reduction are demanded.

The new report by the IEA, the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum and the Global CCS Institute, shows that CCS is an essential component of a portfolio of technologies and measures to reduce global emissions and help avoid the most serious impacts of climate change. Together with renewable energy technologies, nuclear energy and greater energy efficiency, CCS contributes significantly to the least-cost route of reducing and stabilizing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. The report integrates a recent study commissioned by the Global CCS Institute, which identified 80 large-scale integrated CCS projects at various stages of development around the world. The report points to a strong momentum that has been developed over the past 2 yr, due in part to the high-level political focus offered by the 68 and several other countries.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954833029

The impacts of sedation with AQUI-S™ and exercise to exhaustion before electrical stunning were also assessed to monitor the possible depletion of rested muscle energy levels by electrical stunning. Stress (blood glucose, haematocrit, muscle pH, muscle excitability, high-energy phosphates and rigor mortis) and flesh quality (fillet texture, colour, liquid leakage (LL), gaping, residual blood and K-value) were assessed. For the industrial stunning method, an average of 41 V, 0.2 A dc was applied to individual cod for 18-27 s. For the SW method, a bipolar square wave current (170 Hz, 33% duty cycle) was applied for 5 s. After stunning, recovery was prevented by exsanguination in chilled SW. There were no differences (P&gt;0.05) between the two stunning methods except for a higher ultimate fillet pH for cod stunned in air 8 days postmortem. Exercise before stunning depleted muscle energy levels at slaughter, increased LL and fillets had redder and darker flesh after storage on ice for 8 days. Electrical stunning (in air) of AQUI-S™-treated fish partly depleted muscle energy levels (pH 7.3, ATP 18.7 μmol g-1, PCr 70.1 μmol g-1). However, flesh quality was not affected.

Internal combustion engines, as the most widely used power generation mean for transportation, represent a large share of such gases, which motivates active research efforts for alternative solutions. In this regard, PEM fuel cells represent a promising prospect and are thoroughly investigated, whether experimentally or through numerical simulation. The present work presents a simulation of the power potential of a PEM fuel cell, which is integrated to the full power electric traction chain of a medium size car. The cell potential is modelled by taking into account the different types of polarization. The driving performances of the vehicle and its hydrogen consumption are evaluated through a simple mathematical model and an application is performed for the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) standard driving cycle. A preliminary sizing of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) membrane area for the chosen vehicle is presented, along with that of a hydrogen storage tank for a typical autonomy. The main goal of the simulation is to estimate CO2 indirect emissions due to the production of the needed hydrogen for the cycle via an electrolyser, compared with the case of a gasoline fueled vehicle. This is performed solely on a 'fuel tank to wheel' basis in order to have comparable figures. The results indicate that the environmental advantage of hydrogen cars is quite questionable if hydrogen is produced using carbon-based energy sources. © 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","CO2 emissions; Electric car; Hydrogen; PEMFC","Carbon-based; Cell potential; CO2 emissions; Driving cycle; Driving performance; Electrolysers; Energy source; Hydrogen car; Hydrogen storage tank; Medium size; Membrane area; New european driving cycles; Numerical simulation; PEM fuel cell; Power electric; Power potential; Research efforts; Automobile drivers; Automobile fuel tanks; Automobile parts and equipment; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Electric traction; Fuel storage; Fueling; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Hydrogen; Internal combustion engines; Mathematical models; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Vehicles; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954253623

To maintain the increased energy intake in the face of increased adiposity and rising leptin levels, pregnant females become resistant to the central anorectic actions of leptin. In rats, pregnancy-induced leptin resistance is characterised by elevated neuropeptide Y and reduced pro-opiomelanocortin expression in the arcuate nucleus, reduced leptin receptor mRNA levels and suppression of leptin-induced phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 protein in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, as well as a loss of anorectic responses to both leptin and α-melantocyte-stimulating hormone. Our recent data suggest that this leptin-resistance may also cause central insulin resistance and an altered peripheral glucose homeostasis. The specific hormone changes during pregnancy that might mediate these effects on leptin signalling are a current focus of investigation. In pseudopregnant rats, chronic i.c.v. infusion of ovine prolactin to mimic patterns of placental lactogen secretion that occur during pregnancy completely blocked the ability of leptin to suppress food intake. These data suggest that placental lactogen secretion may mediate the hormone-induced loss of response to leptin during pregnancy. This action of prolactin/placental lactogen appears to be mediated downstream of the primary leptin-responsive neurones in the mediobasal hypothalamus, possibly in the paraventricular nucleus. Our studies show complex hormone-induced adaptations in the normal hypothalamic pathways regulating body weight homeostasis during pregnancy. © 2010 The Authors.

The measurement is carried out under the conditions that the actuator is controlled and the head movement amplitude is growing by changing the references. The hysteresis of friction versus head position is then obtained. An operator-based modeling approach is adopted for the hysteresis, and an optimal model is obtained by minimizing the energy gain between the head position and the modeling error. It is also found that the frequency response of the actuator model with the inclusion of the hyteresis model matches well with the measured frequency response of the actuator.

Energy harvesting system (EHS) technology is used for prolonging network lifetime. Robust operation of such systems heavily relies on accurate models of EHS efficiency and node power dissipation for calculating sustainable operation modes. A node's energy balance can be described with a power state model (PSM). While for battery operated WSNs PSM measurement errors and battery effects have to be considered, this paper widens the point of view to EHS properties. We analyze varying PSMs at runtime, EHS efficiency and measurement error's impacts on duty cycled WSNs. We show a measurement system setup and results from profiling a PSM for Mica2 nodes with an EHS. We explain important considerations for such systems with showing the variance of a node's energy consumption depending on its supply and we profile EHS efficiency for deducing an energy storage level operating point. The results contribute to problems in the field of low power WSNs and especially EHS supported ones. Robustness of duty cycled WSNs heavily depends on measurement error bounds and is impacted by EHS efficiency. The reader is provided with a methodology for measuring and modeling robust WSNs. © 2010 IEEE.","Efficiency; Energy harvesting system; Measurement; Power dissipation; Power state model; Wireless sensor networks","Battery effect; Energy consumption; Energy harvesting systems; Low Power; Measurement system; Network lifetime; Operating points; Power dissipation; Power state; Power state model; Power supply; Robust operation; Runtimes; Sustainable operations; Energy harvesting; Error analysis; Harvesting; Measurement errors; Potential flow; Sensor networks; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954027017

Using the powerful CPUs of modern mobile devices depletes the energy resources very rapidly; as does using wireless networking. Cyber foraging is a pervasive computing technique where small mobile devices offioad resource intensive tasks to stronger computers in the vicinity to improve performance and battery life. This comes at the cost of spending energy on wireless networking, and it is commonly assumed that wireless networking is too costly on smaU mobile devices. We investigate this claim in this paper, and show that it does not always hold, and that energy may indeed be preserved by utilising cyber foragingeven for relatively smaU tasks. This paper presents energy measurements of a modern mobile computing device, showing that utilising the relatively large CPU of such a device is very expensive-even more so than using Wi-Fi. Experiments performed with the Scavenger cyber foraging system are presented; a system enabling easy development of lightweight, highly mobile cyber foraging applications. It is shown how the energy nsage of performing large tasks can be brought down drastically, and that even for relatively small tasks the total energy usage can be almost halved. © 2010 IEEE.","Distributed systems; Energy efficiency; Mobile environments; Peer-to-peer; Pervasive computing","Battery life; Distributed systems; Energy measurements; Hand held device; Limiting factors; Mobile computing devices; Mobile environments; Peer to peer; Pervasive computing; Processing speed; Remote execution; Save energy; Smart phones; Storage capacity; Total energy; Wireless networking; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Peer to peer networks; Portable equipment; Program processors; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Wi-Fi; Wireless networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954017673

This calls for innovative technical solutions and new approaches to the design and management of increasingly interdependent energy- and CO2 value chains. The "" intelligent"" capabilities that the industry has developed over the past decade can be leveraged to meet these twin challenges. The combination of CO2 EOR with Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) in particular, offers attractive opportunities to combine enhanced oil- and gas recovery with GHG reduction, in a profitable way. This can be done at the level of individual field developments but also at the level of integrated energy/CO2 systems. The technical and economic implications of an ""eco-efficient"" approach to the design of CO2 EOR projects are discussed, taking a North-Sea EOR feasibility study and CO2 supply project example.

In a conventional IGCC design without carbon capture, the syngas is purified for dust and hydrogen sulphide removal and then sent to a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) for power generation. Carbon capture technologies are expected to play an important role in the coming decades for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. In a modified IGCC design for carbon capture, the syngas is catalytically shifted to maximize the hydrogen level and to concentrate the carbon species in the form of carbon dioxide which can be later captured in a pre-combustion arrangement. After carbon dioxide capture, the hydrogen-rich syngas can be either purified in a Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) unit and exported to the external customers (e.g., chemical industry, PEM fuel cells) or used in a CCGT for power generation. This paper investigates the most important energy and process integration issues for hydrogen and electricity co-production scheme based on coal gasification process with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The evaluated coal-based IGCC case produces around 400 MW net electricity and has a flexible hydrogen output in the range of 0-200 MW (LHV) with a 90% carbon capture rate. The principal focus of the paper is on the evaluation of energy integration aspects so as to maximize the overall plant energy efficiency. Optimization includes heat and power integration of the main plant sub-systems (e.g., integration of steam generated in gasification island, with the requirements for syngas treatment, power generation in the combined cycle, best use of PSA tail gas in the power block, heat and power demand for acid gas removal unit, integration of air separation unit and gas turbine compressor etc.), sensitivity analysis (e.g., influence on ambient conditions). © 2010 Professor T.

In contrast, we focus in this article on houses connected to the grid with a small-scale storage to store a part of the solar power for postponed consumption within the day or the next days. In this way the house owner becomes less dependent on the grid and does only pay for the net shortage of his energy production. Local storage solutions pave the way for many new applications like omitting over-voltage of the line and bridging periods of power-line black-out. Since 2009 using self-consumption of PV energy is publicly encouraged in Germany, which can be realised by electric storage. This paper develops methods to determine the optimal storage size for grid-connected dwellings with PV panels. From measurements in houses we were able to establish calculation rules for sizing the storage. Two situations for electricity storage are covered: - the storage system is an optimum to cover most of the electricity needs; - it is an optimum for covering the peak power need of a dwelling. After these calculation rules a second step is needed to determine the size of the real battery.

Newly prepared malonanilides M1-M5 were tested in stabilizing double-base propellants (DBPs). Their stabilization was compared with the effect of classical stabilizer N,N'-diethyldiphenyl urea (C1) using both practical thermal stability tests (qualitative and quantitative tests) and theoretical molecular orbital calculations. This research shows that the new stabilizers (malonanilides) have good stabilizing effects. Some of malonanilides e.g. (M5) and (M2) have higher stability effects. Different mechanisms were suggested to explain the role of different stabilizers. Molecular orbital calculations using the semi-empirical program AM1 are performed on the new and classical stabilizers. Correlation was made between the volume (ml) of NOx, weight loss (wt%), other thermal analyses data, calculated thermodynamic parameters like activation energy (Ea, kJmol-1) of the decomposed propellant samples containing different stabilizers and some of their calculated properties such as HOMO, LUMO energies, the charge distribution and the π-bond order. The stabilization effect decreases with the increase in HOMO energy. The correlation between the net charge and parameters measured for the stabilization effect shows good accordance. Comparison of the results obtained show that the high electron charge on N atom of the stabilizers and on its benzene ring is the most important factor, but not the only factor governing the stabilization effect of the stabilizers. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Double-base propellants; Molecular orbital calculations; Theoretical-practical study; Thermal stability","Benzene ring; Bond orders; Different mechanisms; Double-base propellant; Electron charge; HOMO energies; LUMO energy; MO calculations; Molecular orbital calculations; Net charges; Nitrate esters; Quantitative tests; Semi-empirical; Stability study; Stabilization effects; Stabilizing effects; Thermal analysis; Thermal stability; Thermal study; Thermodynamic parameter; Weight loss; Activation energy; Benzene; Esters; Explosives; Molecular modeling; Molecular orbitals; Propellants; Spacecraft propulsion; Thermodynamic stability; Thermogravimetric analysis; Urea; Stabilization; benzene; centralite; malonanilide derivative; propellant; stabilizing agent; unclassified drug; activation energy; benzene; molecular analysis; nitrate (ester); stabilization; theoretical study; thermodynamics; urea; article; atom; chemical parameters; chemical structure; electron; energy; mathematical computing; thermal analysis; thermodynamics; weight; Acetanilides; Carbanilides; Electrons; Explosive Agents; Ions; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Temperature; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952767252

The analysis of thermal properties revealed the existence of two phases in the electrolyte, and the conductivity measurements showed a marked conductivity enhancement during the melting of the plasticizer-rich phase of the electrolyte.

The scheme consists of a reverse-osmosis desalination unit powered by wind and solar electricity production systems and by a pumped storage unit. A specific computer algorithm is developed to simulate in detail the entire plant operation and also to perform economic evaluation of the investment. A stochastic optimization software based on evolutionary algorithms is implemented to accomplish design optimization studies of the plant for various objectives, like the minimization of fresh water production cost or the maximization of water needs satisfaction. Miscellaneous parametric studies are also conducted in order to analyze the effects of various critical parameters, as population, water pricing, water demand satisfaction rate and photovoltaics cost are. The results demonstrate not only the performance, the role and the contribution of each subsystem but also the production and economic results of the whole plant.

Malaysia has a large quantity of lignocellulosic biomass from agriculture waste, forest residues and municipal solid waste. In this work, the current status in Malaysia was laconically elucidated, including an estimation of biomass availability with a total amount of 47,402 dry kton/year. Total capacity and domestic demand of second-generation bio-ethanol production in Malaysia were computed to be 26,161 ton/day and 6677 ton/day, respectively. Hence, it was proven that the country's energy demand can be fulfilled with bio-ethanol if lignocellulosic biomass were fully converted into bio-ethanol and 19% of the total CO2 emissions in Malaysia could be avoided. Apart from that, an integrated national supply network was proposed together with the collection, storage and transportation of raw materials and products. Finally, challenges and obstacles in legal context and policies implementation were elaborated, as well as infrastructures shortage and technology availabilities. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Commercial Black Pearls 2000® (BP) and Vulcan® XC-72 R (XC) carbon blacks were used. Capacitive properties of BP/RuO2 and XC/RuO2 composites were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in H2SO4 solution. Capacitance values and capacitance distribution through the composite porous layer were found different if high- (BP) and low- (XC) surface-area carbons are used as supports. The aging time (particle size) of Ru oxide sol as well as the concentration of the oxide solid phase in the impregnating medium influenced the capacitive performance of prepared composites. While the capacitance of BP-supported oxide decreases with the aging time, the capacitive ability of XC-supported oxide is promoted with increasing oxide particle size. The increase in concentration of the oxide solid phase in the impregnating medium caused an improvement of charging/discharging characteristics due to pronounced pseudocapacitance contribution of the increasing amount of inserted oxide. The effects of these variables in the impregnation process on the energy storage capabilities of prepared nanocomposites are envisaged as a result of intrinsic way of population of the pores of carbon material by hydrous Ru oxide particle. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Fertility may be influenced by cock and/or hen factors. Cock fertility is influenced by age, stage of the breeding season, frequency of ejaculation, sperm supply, disease and nutrition. Hen fertility is influenced by reproductive age, feed energy levels, disease and efficiency in sperm storage. Pre-season breeding soundness examination and artificial insemination are animal production technologies that should be implored further, while the effective grouping of breeders based on compatibility should be emphasized in order to optimize reproductive efficiency. Hatchability can be improved through, the use of contamination free eggs, appropriate incubation temperature and humidity and the attainment of the recommended 15% moisture loss during incubation among others. © Medwell Journals, 2010.","Cock factors; Farmed ostrich; Fertility; Hatchability; Hen factors; Technological advances",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953753103

The environmental and economic benefits in Ayrshire could be seen on a larger scale if the government is able to implement its CCS strategy throughout the UK.

Size reduction in nanocrystals leads to a variety of unexpected exciting phenomena due to enhanced surface-to-volume ratio and reduced transport length. We will consider a few examples of nanostructured electrode materials in the context of lithium batteries for achieving high storage and high rate performances: 1) LiFePO4 nanoplates synthesized using solvothermal method could store Li-ions comparable to its theoretical capacity at C/10, while at 30C, they exhibit storage capacity up to 45 mAh/g. Size reduction (~30 nm) at the b-axis favors the fast Li-ion diffusion. In addition to this, uniform ~5 nm carbon coating throughout the plates provides excellent electronically conducting path for electrons. This nano architecture enables fast insertion/extraction of both Li-ions as well as electrons; 2) Mesporous-TiO2 with high surface area (135m2/g) synthesized using soft-template method exhibits high volumetric density compared to commercial nanopowder (P25), with excellent Li-storage behavior. C16 meso-TiO2 synthesized from CTAB exhibits reversible storage capacity of 288mAh/g at 0.2C and 109 mAh/g at 30C; 3) Zero strain Li4Ti 5O12 anode material has been synthesized using several wet chemical routes. The best condition has been optimized to achieve storage capability close to theoretical limit of 175mAh/g at C/10. At 10C, we could retain lithium storage up to 88 mAh/g; 4) We report our recent results on α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3 using conversion reaction, providing insight for a better storage capability in γ-phase than the α-phase at 2C resulting solely from the nanocrystallinity. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","anode; cathode; high rate performance; lithium storage; Nano-size effect; soft-template approach; solvothermal synthesis","Anode cathodes; High-rate performance; Lithium storages; Nanosize effects; Solvothermal synthesis; Template approach; Anodes; Cathodes; Energy harvesting; Harvesting; Ions; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Nanostructured materials; Size determination; Synthesis (chemical); Lithium",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953802947

Significant changes were observed in a total of 35 proteins, and of those, 26 were identified and divided into three different groups: metabolic enzymes, cellular defense/stress proteins, and structural proteins, according to their predicted function. The majority of the metabolic enzymes identified are involved in the energy metabolism of the cell, while the cellular defense/stress proteins can be related to regulation and stabilization of the myofibrillar proteins. Both easily soluble proteins as well as structural proteins were identified in the insoluble protein fraction.

At $3.8 billion, Peru LNG represents the largest investment in a single project ever made in Peru, according to the announcement by the owning consortium. Start-up of the Melchorita plant, at KP 170 of the South Pan American Hwy, also incorporated commissioning a 253-mi pipeline and a marine terminal. The plant has a nominal capacity of 4.4 million ton/yr and will process 620 million cu ft/day of natural gas. At the plant site are the two largest storage tanks in Peru (130,000 cu m of LNG each) and a marine terminal that stretches more than 1 km long and will receive tankers of 90,000 to 173,000 cu m each. The consortium reported the project includes installation of pipeline infrastructure to serve the Peruvian market. Under an agreement, recently approved by Peru's Ministry of Energy and Mines, with Transportadora de Gas del Perú SA, which operates the Camisea natural gas and NGL pipelines, the Peru LNG pipeline will provide up to 550 million cu ft/day of capacity for the Peruvian market. That will debottleneck gas transportation to bring more gas to power generation companies, industrial companies, vehicles running on natural gas, and Peruvian homes using natural gas for heat. This consortium was specifically formed to develop, build, and operate Peru LNG. Among construction contractors were CB&I, in charge of the plant's engineering, procurement, and construction; CDB consortium, in charge of marine terminal EPC, and Techint, responsible for installing the pipeline.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117869877

The interface recombination velocity was measured by means of the photoacoustic (PA) technique in a heat transmission configuration, in which minority carriers are photoexcited at the CdTe layer after illumination through the substrate and the CdS thin film. For data processing, a theoretical model was developed for the generation of the PA signal. We show a reduction in the value of the recombination velocity respecting those obtained for samples where CdS was grown by CSVT, and we observe that a minimal value appears for a thiourea/CdCl 2 ratio in the CdS deposition solution equal to 5.

Such cryogenic systems may contain more than hundred tons of helium, mostly in cold and high-density phases. In spite of the high reliability of the systems, accidental loss of the insulation vacuum, pipe rupture or rapid energy dissipation in the cold helium can not be overlooked. To avoid the danger of over-design pressure rise in the cryostats, they need to be equipped with a helium relief system. Such a system is comprised of safety valves, bursting disks and optionally cold or warm quench lines, collectors and storage tanks. Proper design of the helium safety relief system requires a good understanding of worst case scenarios. Such scenarios will be discussed, taking into account different possible failures of the cryogenic system. In any case it is necessary to estimate heat transfer through degraded vacuum superinsulation and mass flow through the valves and safety disks. Even if the design of the helium relief system does not foresee direct helium venting into the environment, an occasional emergency helium spill may happen.

Nanostructuring approaches have been shown to increase the performance of hematite, but the ideal nanostructure giving high efficiencies for all absorbed light wavelengths remains elusive. Here, we report for the first time mesoporous hematite photoelectodes prepared by a solution-based colloidal method which yield water-splitting photocurrents of 0.56 mA cm-2 under standard conditions (AM 1.5G 100 mW cm -2, 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and over 1.0 mA cm-2 before the dark current onset (1.55 V vs RHE). The sintering temperature is found to increase the average particle size, and have a drastic effect on the photoactivity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and magnetic measurements using a SQUID magnetometer link this effect to the diffusion and incorporation of dopant atoms from the transparent conducting substrate. In addition, examining the optical properties of the films reveals a considerable change in the absorption coefficient and onset properties, critical aspects for hematite as a solar energy converter, as a function of the sintering temperature.

A control technique based on SVPWM is also proposed for dynamic voltage restorer. The DVR was a power electronics device that was able to compensate voltage sags on critical loads dynamically. By injecting an appropriate voltage, the DVR restores a voltage waveform and ensures constant load voltage. The compensating signals are determined dynamically based on the difference between desired and measured values. The DVR consists of VSC, injection transformers, passive filters and energy storage (lead acid battery). The efficiency of the DVR depends on the efficiency of the control technique involved in switching of the inverter. In this paper a novel structure for voltage sags mitigation and for power quality improvement are proposed. There was an increasing trend of using Space Vector PWM (SVPWM) because of their easier digital realization and better dc bus utilization. The proposed control algorithm is investigated through computer simulation by using PSCAD/EMTDC software and hardware implementation using DSP TMS320F2812.

High energy density magnets allow complete ironless stator motor/generators configurations which are suitable for high speed machines and specifically in flywheel energy storage. Axial-flux and radial-flux machines are investigated and compared. The limits and merits of ironless machines are presented. An analytic solution of Maxwell's equations is used to calculate the properties of axial-flux and radial-flux ironless generators. This method is used to investigate the influence of several parameters such as diameter and airgap width. Two machines have been calculated with FEM techniques and results are compared to validate the analytic method. Simulations conclude that end winding effects are more significant for axial-flux than for radialflux topologies. Radial-flux machines are more suitable for high speed ironless stators.

The behaviour of the alloy containing electrode was evaluated employing several electrodes containing the alloy and diverse carbons.

Several electrochemical techniques as Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Charge-Discharge cycles and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) were used. Results demonstrate that at low discharge currents, electrodes containing SWCNT exhibit better hydrogen storage than Vulcan XC72® containing electrodes. Studies made with carbon supports only show that this little but not disregarded differences are related to different hydrogen sorption behaviour of SWCNT and Vulcan XC72®.

Despite the fact that the incentive to switch to a hydrogen economy has increased, there are many problems which must be solved. One of the main unsolved issues is hydrogen storage. Among the potential materials to store hydrogen in a safe way, Mg has drawn interest owing to its high hydrogen capacity (7.6 wt%), light weight and low cost. In order to improve the hydrogen capacity of potential storage materials such as Mg, it is important to understand the site preferences of hydrogen atoms in the metal. Such behavior depends mainly on the screening charge density (Δn(r)) of the system proton-metallic host, from which all the physical macroscopic properties (viz. VH, ΔHS, B, etc.) and IDOS are determined. In the present work we study the interaction between a proton and Mg as host metal via ab initio calculations, using the Jellium model, based on the density-functional theory (DFT). The macroscopic properties are determined and compared with experimental results and values found in the bibliography. Furthermore, in order to obtain information about the electronic distribution of hydrogen and the nature of the Mg-H bonding, the IDOS is described. © 2009 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.

To achieve the goal of road-ready fuel cell vehicles, great strides must be made in the development of fuel cells, hydrogen production and hydrogen storage technologies, that includes metal-H interaction studies and safety considerations. The interaction between two-hydrogen atoms and a γ-Fe structure containing a vacancy has been studied using a cluster model and a theoretical method. For the study of the sequential absorption, the hydrogen atoms were positioned in their energy minima configurations, near the vacancy. The interactions mainly involve Fe 4s-H 1s atomic orbitals. The contribution of Fe 4p and Fe 3d orbitals is much less important. The Fe-Fe bond is weakened as new Fe-H-H and H-H pairs were formed. The effect of H atoms is limited to its first Fe neighbors. The Fe-Fe bond strength decreases with the introduction of the H atoms. Fe-H bonding is achieved at expense of weakening the metal-metal nearest bonds. There is not a real bond between the H atoms but some H-H interaction is observed.

The study of hydride forming alloys is fundamental for its use as negative electrode component in NiMH batteries. In previous works, the electrocatalytic effect of Pd element addition to the electrode, in powder form and by means of electroless technique, has been studied. In this work, AB 2-type alloys are studied, in which Pd is incorporated to the structure by re-melting inside an arc furnace. The base alloy composition is ZrCrNi, and the composition of the elaborated compounds is ZrCrNiPdx (x = 0.095 and 0.19).

The control is developed in two hierarchical levels. The higher control level or supervisor control determines the general operation strategy for the whole system according to the wind conditions and the state of charge of the battery bank. On the other hand, the lower control level includes the individual controllers that regulate the respective module operation assuming the set-points determined by the supervisor control.

The inflow is thereby treated as a random variable, and stochastic modeling relies on the well-known method of constant and variable energy production. The developed model is suitable for development of an additional determination criterion when it comes to making studies related to planning strategy of production capacities in the power system. The stochastic model presented in the paper is illustrated by a simple numerical example.","Density function; Distribution function; Method of constant and variable energy production; Probability function; Reliability; Stochastic inflow","Density function; Density functions; Energy productions; Probability functions; Stochastic inflows; Distribution functions; Electron transitions; Hydraulics; Hydroelectric power; Power plants; Probability density function; Pumps; Random variables; Reliability; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Strategic planning; Hydroelectric power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954801975

In wrestling, fat metabolism is important not only for aerobic energy system, but also for weight control and weight loss before competition. The aim of this study was to measure and compare the serum leptin levels, glucose homeostasis, and serum lipoproteins between Turkish national wrestlers and sedentary males. Materials and methods: Forty-five Turkish national wrestlers at the end of Olympic training camp before Beijing 2008 Olympic Games and 43 sedentary students were selected as subjects. Post-exercise levels of serum leptin, HOMA (Homeostasis model assessment) values, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and VLDL-cholesterol were measured after overnight fasting. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the differences between 2 groups. Pearson Correlation was conducted between leptin and the other parameters. Results: No significant difference was observed among the means of leptin and total cholesterol levels of the 2 groups. Wrestlers had significantly higher fasting insulin, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, and HOMA levels, but a lower LDL-cholesterol level compared to the sedentary males. The positive correlation was only found between leptin and fasting insulin levels (r = 0.310, P = 0.043). Conclusion: This study indicated that wrestling training had no effect on resting leptin level after overnight fasting and wrestlers had also decreased insulin sensitivity with higher fasting insulin, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, and HOMA levels compared to sedentary males. © TÜBİTAK.","HOMA; Insulin resistance; Leptin; Lipoproteins; Wrestlers","2-group; Cholesterol levels; Energy systems; Fat metabolism; Glucose homeostasis; Homeostasis model assessments; Insulin resistance; Insulin sensitivity; Mann-Whitney U test; Olympic games; Olympics; Pearson correlation; Positive correlations; Serum leptin; Training camps; Turkishs; Weight loss; Cholesterol; Glucose; Insulin; Lipids; Physiology; Proteins; Weight control; Body fluids; cholesterol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; leptin; lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; aerobic metabolism; appetite; article; China; cholesterol blood level; competition; controlled study; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; diet restriction; exercise; glucose homeostasis; human; human experiment; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipoprotein blood level; male; normal human; rank sum test; sitting; triacylglycerol blood level; Turkey (republic); weight control; weight reduction; wrestling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954396221

The frequent maintenance efforts associated with battery replacement significantly increase the system operational and logistics cost. Unnoticed power failures on nodes will degrade the system reliability and may lead to system failure. In building management applications, to solve this problem, small energy sources such as indoor light energy are promising to provide long-term power to these distributed wireless sensor nodes. This article provides comprehensive design considerations for an indoor light energy harvesting system for buildingmanagement applications. Photovoltaic cells characteristics, energy storage units, power management circuit design, and power consumption pattern of the target mote are presented. Maximum power point tracking circuits are proposed which significantly increase the power obtained from the solar cells. The novel fast charge circuit reduces the charging time. A prototype was then successfully built and tested in various indoor light conditions to discover the practical issues of the design. The evaluation results show that the proposed prototype increases the power harvested from the PV cells by 30% and also accelerates the charging rate by 34% in a typical indoor lighting condition.

Under certain conditions, it was found that 6mol of hydrogen per mol of sodium borohydride was produced in the presence of electrical field created by DC voltages, whereas 4mol of hydrogen was produced in the presence of catalyst per mole of sodium borohydride. Electrical field created by alternative current with three different waves (sin, square and triangle type) increases the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. It was found that hydrogen produced from sodium borohydride by applying an electrical field can be effectively used for both increasing the electrolysis of water and hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. The hydrolysis reaction was carried out at temperature of 20, 30, 40 and 60oC in the presence of electrical field created by AC voltages square wave. The experimental data were fitted to the kinetic models of zero-order, first-order and nth-order. The results indicate that the first-order and nth-order model give a reasonable description of the hydrogen generation rate at the temperature higher than 30oC. Reaction rate constant at different temperatures were determined from experimental data, and activation energy was found to be 50.20 and 52.28 kJmol-1 for first-order and nth-order, respectively.

The biasing influence of heat losses is studied theoretically and experimentally. Theoretically, it does not make a difference if the stratification efficiency is calculated based on entropy balances or based on exergy balances. In practice, however, exergy balances are less affected by measurement uncertainties, whereas entropy balances can not be recommended if measurement uncertainties are not corrected in a way that the energy balance of the storage process is in agreement with the first law of thermodynamics. A comparison of the stratification efficiencies obtained from experimental results of charging, standby, and discharging processes gives meaningful insights into the different mixing behaviors of a storage tank that is charged and discharged directly, and a tank-in-tank system whose outer tank is charged and the inner tank is discharged thereafter. The new method has a great potential for the comparison of the stratification efficiencies of thermal energy storages and storage components such as stratifying devices. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Healthy male subjects were studied after an isocaloric diet or a 7-day high-fructose (Fru: +3.5 g fructose/kg fat-free mass/day, +35% energy), high-fat (Fat: +30% energy as saturated-fat) or high-fructose, high-fat diet (FruFat: +3.5 g fructose/kg fat-free mass/day, +30% energy as fat, +65% total energy). IHCL was measured by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results: All hypercaloric diets increased IHCL (Fru: +16%; Fat: +86%; FruFat: +133%; P &lt; 0.05). Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triacylglycerols increased after Fru (+58%; P &lt; 0.05), but decreased after Fat (-22%; P &lt; 0.05), while no change was observed after FruFat. Conclusion: Fat and fructose both increased IHCL, but fructose increased, while fat decreased, VLDL triacylglycerols. However, excess fat and fructose combined had additive effects on IHCL and neutralizing effects on VLDL triglycerides. This suggests that fructose stimulates, while fat inhibits, hepatic VLDL triacylglycerol secretion. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Our approach is rooted in the thermodynamic fact that the reaction between Mg(OH)2 and gaseous CO2 forming MgCO3 and water releases significant amounts of heat. The main problem is, however, the chemical kinetics; the reaction is slow and has to be accelerated in order to be used in an economically viable process for large-scale (~1 Mt/a) CO2 sequestration. We have constructed a labscale PFB reactor test-setup for optimising the carbonation reaction. At high enough temperatures and conversion levels the reaction should provide the heat for the proceeding Mg(OH)2 production step, making the overall process energy neutral. So far we have been able to achieve a conversion degree of 26% at 500°C and 2.85 MPa after 30 min (particle size 125-212 μm). In this paper the test facility and our latest results and progress on CO2 mineral carbonation are summarised. Also, the possible integration of the iron as a feedstock for iron and steel production will be briefly addressed. An interesting side-effect of this carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) route is that significant amounts of iron are obtained from the serpentinite rock material. This is released during the Mg(OH)2 production and can be of great interest to the iron- and steel producing sector, which at the same time is Finland's largest CO2 producer. © 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Fluidised bed; Magnesium carbonate; Mineral carbonation; Mineralisation; Serpentinite",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952888096

For this purpose, we analyzed (a) basal and insulin-stimulated leptin release and the role of isoproterenol and palmitate on insulin-stimulated leptin secretion, (b) the correlation between leptin and glycerol released, (c) the relationship between leptin contents and adiposity, and (d) the effect of fish oil (FO) administration on the above parameters. Wistar rats were fed an SRD for 6 months. Whereas half the animals continued with SRD up to month 8, the other half was fed an SRD in which FO partially replaced corn oil from months 6 to 8. Total leptin release was reduced both basally and under insulin stimulation in SRD-fed rats. However, the ratio of leptin released after hormone stimulation to basal leptin levels was similar in the 3 dietary groups. Isoproterenol inhibited insulin-stimulated leptin release in the 3 groups, but the percentage was lower in the SRD. Palmitic acid mimicked the effect of isoproterenol. Leptin release from adipocyte of SRD-fed rats negatively correlated with glycerol release. Leptin store increased in fat pads of SRD and positively correlated with adiposity. Fish oil reduced leptin content and fat pad hypertrophy, and normalized basal lipolysis, leptinemia, and glucose homeostasis. This suggests that enhanced lipolysis and altered insulin sensitivity could play a role in the decrease of leptin released in SRD-fed rats. This is consistent with the reversion of all the alterations after FO administration. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Here we investigate the significance of Ras signalling intensity on two unrelated models of mouse brown adipocyte differentiation. Results: A constitutively active H-Ras mutant (Ras V12) caused a complete block of adipose conversion, as manifested by a lack of both lipid accumulation and induction of adipocyte gene expression. The Ras V12-mediated impediment of differentiation was inefficiently rescued by forced expression of the adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPα and PPARγ. However, the defective differentiation was alleviated by MEK inhibitors, suggesting that the obstruction of differentiation was dependent on activation of ERK. A dominant interfering H-Ras mutant (Ras N17) did not inhibit differentiation, but led to increased expression of genes important for energy dissipation in brown fat cells, including UCP1. General significance: These data suggest that the intensity of Ras signalling is important for differentiation and UCP1 expression in models of brown adipogenesis. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Adipogenesis; Brown fat; ERK; MEK; Ras; UCP1","CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta; CCAAT enhancer binding protein delta; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitor; mutant protein; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; Raf protein; Ras N17 protein; Ras protein; Ras V12 protein; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 1; adipogenesis; animal cell; animal cell culture; article; brown adipose tissue; cell differentiation; cell function; cell transformation; controlled study; embryo; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; gene expression regulation; gene induction; lipid storage; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; signal transduction; thermogenesis; upregulation; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Animals; Base Sequence; Cell Differentiation; DNA Primers; Ion Channels; Mice; Mitochondrial Proteins; Models, Biological; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; ras Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952237285

The model is validated with experimental results and reasonable agreement is obtained between simulation and experiment. Deviations between experiment and simulation are accounted for by factors such as mixing effects and mass diffusion. Discharging results of the TES system are presented using two different methods. The first method discharges the TES system at a constant flow-rate while the second method varies the flow-rate in order to maintain a desired power at a constant load inlet temperature. The results of discharging the TES system at a constant flow-rate indicate a higher rate of heat utilization. This is not beneficial to the cooking process since the maximum cooking temperature is not maintained for the duration of the discharging period. On the other hand, the controlled load power discharging method has a slower initial rate of heat utilization but the maximum cooking temperature is maintained for most of the discharging process and this is desirable for the cooking process. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we combine both line and edge detection using quadrature filters across multiple scales. The filter result gives well defined vessels as linear structures, while distinct edges facilitate a robust segmentation.

In addition to the business as usual (BAU) scenario, five more scenarios are examined in the analysis in order to assess the electricity unit cost with the penetration of parabolic trough CSP plants of 50 MWe or 100 MWe, with or without thermal storage capability. Based on the input data and assumptions made, the simulations indicated that the scenario with the utilization of a single parabolic trough CSP plant (either 50 MWe or 100 MWe and with or without thermal storage capability) in combination with BAU will effect an insignificant change in the electricity unit cost of the generation system compared to the BAU scenario.

The system frequency oscillations appear due to load disturbance. To stabilize the system frequency oscillations, the active power can be controlled via superconducting magnetic energy storage device, SMES. The error in the area control and its rate of change is used as controller input signals to the proposed fuzzy logic controller. In order to judge the effect of the proposed fuzzy logic controlled SMES, a comparative study is made between its effect and the effect of the conventional proportional plus integral (PI) controlled SMES. The studied system consists of two-area (thermal-thermal) power system each one equipped with SMES unit. The time simulation results indicate the superiority of the proposed fuzzy logic controlled SMES over the conventional PI SMES in damping the system oscillations and reach quickly to zero frequency deviation.

The inner part of the instrument with control electronics and diverse sensors (temperature and flue gas concentration measurements) requires sufficient thermal protection against the high temperature environment of the combustion process with a surrounding temperature higher than 1200 °C. The influence of the high temperature environment is limited, but not fully eliminated, by thermal protection. The thermal protection is applied in two different ways. The standard thermal insulation with low thermal conductivity represents passive protection. The optimal thickness of the insulation itself partially defines the heat flux to the central part of the measuring system and its impacts upon increase of the inner temperature. The second type of protection, in an active mode, in addition to low conductivity, also provides heat storage. The full-scale thermal protection is designed by means of computer calculations with boundary and initial conditions or laboratory measurements within a similar environment to that on the grate of the MSWI. An additional aim of the sufficient thermal protection development is also to minimize the final size of the experimental instrument. The experimental trials have approved the functionality of the measuring instrument in high temperatures by keeping the inner temperature at the very low level. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The main problem in harvesting the lightning energy is to capture and store the energy within a very short time. Hence, computer simulation works is done as the preliminary effort intended for the laboratory set up as well as to understand and verify the operational system principle. A small-scale laboratory is set up based on natural characteristics of lightning to determine the performance and capability of the sample capacitor accurately, since a capacitor nowadays becomes the most widespread, economical and reliable energy storage device. The capacitors are subjected to 1.2/50μs singlestroke impulse voltages generated by a single stage impulse generator.

Using the Internet makes it simple to use standard Web browsers for data presentation, thus eliminating the need for proprietary host software. It also eliminates the cost and complexity of long distance communications. In this Paper Primary data, i.e. the real time data (data that reflect real- time operational condition of the power system) of the power system, is acquired at every node of outward power/energy flow with the help of a client PC (RTU). The data thus acquired are sent to a central monitoring station (SCU), which may also be used as a server PC. The program Software used in the server PC performs the necessary analysis and display (both numerically and graphically) the data received from the client. With preset values of control parameters, when analyzed data finds the parameters exceeding the preset values, it sends a trip signal to the client PC. After this the client PC disconnects that node of outward power flow from the subregional power system. Also Graphical user interfaces has been introduced in this scheme both for the clients as wel as for the server.

The sensor is based on the molybdenum yellow method for phosphate detection in which a phosphate-containing sample is mixed with a reagent containing ammonium molybdate and ammonium metavanadate in an acidic medium. The yellow-colored compound which is formed absorbs strongly below 400nm and its absorbance is proportional to the concentration of phosphate in the original sample. The sensor utilizes a microfluidic manifold where mixing, reaction and detection take place. Optical detection is performed using a LED (light emitting diode) light source and a photodiode detector. The sensor also combines pumping system, power supply, reagent and waste storage, and wireless communications into a compact and portable device.

The risk of thermal stresses and melt penetration can be minimised by adopting a good preheat and start up procedure. Resistive preheating on full line current was tried out by initially using a mixture of CP coke and graphite, and later by using 100% graphite as heat transfer and resistance media. By doing so, the consumption of resistor material dropped by 93%, the preheat energy was reduced by 10%, the usage of compressed air to cool shunts was eliminated and skimming following the bath up hardly happened. The method permits accelerated start up especially in expansion projects and in restarting a potline following power outage.

Determination of branching fractions, cross sections and thermal rate coefficients for the dissociative recombination of CD3OCD 2+ (0-0.3 eV) and (CD3)2OD + (0-0.2 eV) at the low relative kinetic energies encountered in the interstellar medium. Methods. The measurements were carried out using merged electron and ion beams at the CRYRING storage ring, Stockholm, Sweden. Results. For (CD3)2OD+ we have experimentally determined the branching fraction for ejection of a single hydrogen atom in the DR process to be maximally 7% whereas 49% of the reactions involve the break up of the COC chain into two heavy fragments and 44% ruptures both C-O bonds.

These molecules vary in chemical and physical properties. The physical history of the system, such as processing and storage conditions, can impact conformation and intermolecular or intramolecular interaction. Predicting behavior of food colloids can be complicated by these interrelated properties that result in the ability to interact with the surrounding water molecules. Water in food biopolymers may distribute or compartmentalize unevenly. The water molecules may inherently rotate freely and exchange rapidly with neighboring molecules but have more diffi culty exchanging with those further away or physically separated. When trapped in a three - dimensional structure, water molecules may maintain some bulk water physical properties (e.g., freezing point and mobility), but their diffusive exchange ability is infl uenced or perturbed by physical barriers. The properties of physical barriers can infl uence the water exchange among domains either at fast or at slow rates with respect to the instrumental time frame or method. In the case of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a fast - exchange regime on a microsecond scale results in seemingly simple relaxation (free - induction decay [FID]). Recent applications of a continuous model resulted in a way to decompose the FID to identify the contributions from multiple populations. These populations represent water rapidly exchanged among domains.

Natural gas has traditionally been transported in pipelines, but ships are more efficient for transportation over long distances. When the gas is cooled down to liquid state it is called liquefied natural gas (LNG). The LNG supply chain consists of exploration, extraction, liquefaction, transportation, storage and regasification. Maritime transportation is a vital part of the LNG supply chain, and LNG is transported in special designed ships, LNG tankers. The demand for LNG tankers has increased considerably as the entire LNG industry continues to see strong growth. Hence, there is a great potential and need for optimization based decision support to manage the LNG fleet, liquefaction plants, and regasification terminals in this business. Here, we are studying the LNG supply chain in close cooperation with a worldwide actor within the LNG business. This actor is responsible for the LNG supply chain management except the exploration and extraction. We describe the real planning problem and present both an arc-flow and a path-flow model of the problem. Both models are tested and compared on instances motivated from the realworld problem. It is a very complex problem, so only small instances can be solved to optimality by these solution approaches. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Inventory routing; Maritime transportation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951659412

The presence of the Cu microparticles in the PCMs did not significantly change the crystallization behavior, thermal stability, or tensile properties of the blend composites in comparison with the corresponding poly-ethylene/wax blends and polyethylene/Cu composites. The observed differences were related to the fact that the wax seemed to have a higher affinity for the Cu particles than any of the polyethylenes, and so it crystallized as a layer around the Cu particles. The thermal conductivity of the samples increased almost linearly with increasing Cu content, but the samples had slightly lower values than the corresponding polyethylene/Cu composites, probably because of the lower thermal conductivity of the wax. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Blends; Composites; Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); Morphology; Polyethylene (PE)","Blends; Composites; Conducting phase; Copper particles; Crystallization behavior; Cu content; Fischer Tropsch; Immiscible blends; Matrix materials; Melting and crystallization; Micro-particles; Thermal stability; Crystallization; Differential scanning calorimetry; Heat storage; Morphology; Paraffin waxes; Paraffins; Polyethylenes; Pulse code modulation; Thermal conductivity; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic stability; Thermoplastics; Phase change materials; blend; composite property; crystallization; filling material; matrix; particle size; phase-change material; polyethylene; tensile property; thermal conductivity; thermal stability; wax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76949100968

The study is performed in the voltage region where there is no contribution of the Faraday capacitance at low alternating voltages. It is found that the dependence of the impedance hodograph on the magnitude of the alternating voltage is much stronger than that on the applied direct voltage. Interpretation of this effect is proposed that allows for the conduction mechanism of the superionic conductor in a porous carbon matrix.

Since SR is emitted by electron bunches in a storage ring, the SR burst corresponding to a single bunch may be very short. Should a detector capable of detecting SR from a single bunch without mixing signals from different bunches be available, it is possible to obtain information on changes in the state of the material in a sample under investigation with a very high time resolution. A detector for imaging of explosions on an SR beam-DIMEX-has been developed by the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk). This detector is a high-pressure ion-ization chamber with a strip readout at a pitch of 0.1 mm. The electron component of primary ionization is collected within 50 ns, which is substantially shorter than the orbital period of a bunch in the VEPP-3 storage ring (250 ns). The DIMEX is filled with a Xe-CO2 mixture (3: 1) at an absolute pressure of 7 atm. The spatial resolution of the detector is ∼210 μm, and its efficiency for radiation with an energy of 20 keV is ≥50%. The dynamic range of the detector is ∼100, which allows one to measure the signal with an accuracy of ∼1%. In this case, the maximum flux of X-ray photons, at which the DIMEX operates in a linear region, is ∼1010 photons/(channel s). Today, the detector has been used in experiments aimed at studying evolution of the density in detonation waves and processes of nanoparticle production at the VEPP-3 storage ring by employing the small-angle X-ray scattering technique. © 2010 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Absolute pressure; Detonation waves; Dynamic range; Electron bunch; Electron component; Fast process; High-time resolution; Its efficiencies; Linear region; Maximum flux; Mixing signals; Nano-particle production; Orbital periods; Russian Academy of Sciences; Small angle X-ray scattering; Spatial resolution; SR beams; X ray photons; Nuclear physics; Particle optics; Storage rings; Synchrotron radiation; Synchrotrons; X ray scattering; Xenon; Detectors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955876451

The results showed that high-pressure homogenizer was an efficient emulsification technique producing small emulsion droplets with narrow size distribution. In general, the results showed that different homogenization conditions had significant (p < 0.05) effect on the size distribution of prepared nanodispersions. Average particles ranging from 95 to 130 nm and 140 to 210 nm were obtained for the nanoemulsions containing palm-based tocopherol-tocotrienol and carotenoid, respectively. However, this study indicated that increasing the energy input beyond moderate pressures (20- 80 MPa) and cycles (1-3) led to ""over-processing"" of droplets.

The primary strength of CARS microscopy lies in the ability of imaging lipids; the full 3-D distribution in living cells can be mapped without exogenous tags. Thus, CARS microscopy has a strong potential to become a central instrument for in vivo studies of the lipid metabolism at cellular level, improving present understanding of the mechanisms behind the many metabolism-related diseases, the impact of natural bioactive components in foods, and supporting the development of efficient pharmaceuticals as well as bioengineering processes exploiting the metabolism of microorganisms for the production of alternative energy sources.

In this research, the effects of (partially) replacing the feed of European sea bass juveniles with PHB were investigated. During a 6-week trial period, the PHB showed the ability to act as an energy source for the fish. This indicated that PHB was degraded and used during gastrointestinal passage. The gut pH decreased from 7.7 to 7.2 suggesting that the presence of PHB in the gut led to the increased production of (short-chain fatty) acids. The diets supplemented with 2% and 5% PHB (w/w) induced a gain of the initial fish weight with a factor 2.4 and 2.7, respectively, relative to a factor 2.2 in the normal feed treatment. Simultaneously, these treatments showed the highest bacterial range-weighted richness in the fish intestine. Based on molecular analysis, higher dietary PHB levels induced larger changes in the bacterial community composition. From our results, it seems that PHB can have a beneficial effect on fish growth performance and that the intestinal bacterial community structure may be closely related to this phenomenon. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Antibiotics; Growth promoting agent; Host-microbe interactions; Infection; Prebiotics","Bacterial community composition; Bacterial storage; Beneficial effects; Dicentrarchus labrax; Energy source; European sea bass; Growth performance; Growth promoting agents; Host-microbe interactions; Hydroxybutyrate; Intestinal bacterial communities; Molecular analysis; Prebiotics; Trial period; Agriculture; Antibiotics; Aquaculture; Fish; Microorganisms; Bacteriology; poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid); short chain fatty acid; antibiotics; aquaculture; artificial diet; bacterium; community structure; diet; ester; fish culture; food supplementation; growth rate; growth regulator; infectivity; juvenile; microbial community; molecular analysis; perciform; pH; polymer; rearing; animal food; aquaculture; article; controlled study; energy resource; European sea bass; growth rate; intestine flora; microbial community; nonhuman; pH measurement; 3-Hydroxybutyric Acid; Animal Feed; Animals; Aquaculture; Bass; Body Weight; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydroxybutyrates; Intestines; Polyesters; Survival Analysis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Dicentrarchus labrax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952890806

It constrains plant transpiration and photosynthesis in several regions of the world, with consequent impacts on the water, energy and biogeochemical cycles. Moreover it is a storage component for precipitation and radiation anomalies, inducing persistence in the climate system. Finally, it is involved in a number of feedbacks at the local, regional and global scales, and plays a major role in climate-change projections. In this review, we provide a synthesis of past research on the role of soil moisture for the climate system, based both on modelling and observational studies. We focus on soil moisture-temperature and soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks, and their possible modifications with climate change. We also highlight further impacts of soil moisture on climate, and the state of research regarding the validation of the relevant processes.There are promises for major advances in this research field in coming years thanks to the development of new validation datasets and multi-model initiatives. However, the availability of ground observations continues to be critical in limiting progress and should therefore strongly be fostered at the international level. Exchanges across disciplines will also be essential for bridging current knowledge gaps in this field. This is of key importance given the manifold impacts of soil moisture on climate, and their relevance for climate-change projections. A better understanding and quantification of the relevant processes would significantly help to reduce uncertainties in future-climate scenarios, in particular with regard to changes in climate variability and extreme events, as well as ecosystem and agricultural impacts. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Atmosphere; Boundary interactions; Climate change; Climatic controls; Land cover; Soil-water balance","climate change; climate variation; land cover; photosynthesis; plant; precipitation (chemistry); soil moisture; soil temperature; soil water; transpiration",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952549483

The possible benefit of the additional active power support of a StatCom can be power oscillation damping capability, mitigation of phase-jump related disturbances, etc. Direct connection of an ES device to the dc link of the VSC incurs unnecessarily high voltage rating of the VSC due to the considerable voltage swing associated with the ES device.

Installing those systems onto merchant marine vessels could prove to be an efficient way of minimizing fuel costs and simultaneously protecting the environment by reducing significant carbon dioxide emissions. This paper examines the feasibility of installing solar panels onto vessels and also calculated the payback period from the adopted investment with respect to fuel oil savings. Thus, the two important parameters incorporated in the parametric analysis are the solar radiation density and the fuel cost. In order to calculate the energy production of the solar installation systems, the globe is divided in six different zones, according to solar radiation density (Stackhouse and Whitlock, 2008). For one square meter of the considered solar panels the peak output power is taken equal to 130 W (Kagaraki, 2001). The payback period of the investment depends greatly on the fuel prices. For a reasonable fuel price annual increase at about 10-15% the estimated payback period varies from 16 to 27 years. The more the fuel oil increases, the methodology reveals that the payback period converges to a minimum of 10 years. When using any storage media such as hydrogen, the methodology shows that the payback period increases and this depends on the proportion of the energy stored and from the storage media itself. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

GET 7.0, a global energy system model with five end-use sectors, is used for the analysis. We find that an energy system dominated either by solar or by nuclear tends to make biofuels in plug-in hybrids cost-effective. If coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) dominates the energy system, hydrogen cars, rather than plug-in hybrids tend to become cost-effective. Performing a Monte Carlo simulation, we then show that the general features of our results hold for a wide range of assumptions for the costs of vehicle propulsion technologies (e.g., batteries and fuel cells). However, sufficiently large changes in say the battery costs may overturn the impact of changes in the energy supply system, so that plug-in hybrid vehicles become cost-effective even if coal with CCS dominate the energy supply. We conclude that analyses of future energy carriers and propulsion technologies need to consider developments in the energy supply system. © 2010 Professor T.

Bulk characteristics of silver nanoparticles in aqueous solutions were carried out by measuring their extinction spectrum, fluorescence, diffusion coefficients using the PCS method and the electrophoretic mobilities. The average hydrodynamic diameter of PVA covered silver particles was 44nm, being fairly independent of ionic strength and pH in the range of 3-9. It was also shown that the hydrodynamic radius did not change within prolonged storage of suspensions (up to 75days), indicating that the sols were quite stable. A similar value of 45±8nm was determined from SEM measurements. The electrophoretic mobility measurements showed that the zeta potential of silver nanoparticles was insensitive to pH and decreased with the ionic strength, attaining -45mV for I=10-5M and -25mV for I=10-2 M. Additionally, the kinetics of silver particle deposition on mica modified by adsorption of a saturated layer of poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) was studied. Surface concentration was determined directly by counting the number of particles over various surface areas using the atomic force microscopy working in the semicontact mode. The maximum surface concentration for I=10-3M was 102μm-2, which corresponds to the coverage degree of 16%. The kinetic run and the maximum coverage value was in a good agreement with theoretical predictions stemming from the random sequential adsorption (RSA) model. This kinetic run allowed one to determine the size of Ag core, which was 20nm and the thickness of the PVA layer, equal to 12nm. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","AFM measurements of silver nanoparticles deposition; Deposition of silver nanoparticles; Monolayers of silver nanoparticles on mica cover by PEI; PVA stabilized silver nanoparticles; Silver nanoparticles deposition","AFM; Silver nanoparticles; Adsorption; Atomic force microscopy; Deposition; Electron energy levels; Electrophoretic mobility; Ethylene; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Ionic strength; Mica; Monolayers; Nanoparticles; Nitrogen compounds; Organic polymers; Polyvinyl alcohols; Self assembly; Silicate minerals; Zeta potential; Silver; mica; polyethyleneimine; silver nanoparticle; adsorption kinetics; aqueous solution; article; colloid; concentration (parameters); hydrodynamics; ionic strength; pH; physical chemistry; prediction; priority journal; suspension; zeta potential",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951093139

Globally 35% (3.5 million) of child deaths before the age of five years were attributed to under nutrition in 2004. Vulnerable communities generally consume a diet based mainly on plant-based staples, and a low consumption of animal source foods, fruit and vegetables predisposes these communities to micronutrient deficiencies. In this paper, South African data is used to illustrate the poor diet and consequences thereof in vulnerable communities. Childhood malnutrition and maternal overweight often co-exist in the same community. Dietary modification strategies to address malnutrition should therefore focus on the nutritional quality of the diet, rather than on energy content only. Animal foods are particularly rich sources of bio-available iron, zinc and vitamin A (the micronutrients of greatest concern), and these nutrients are difficult to obtain in adequate amounts from plant foods alone. Foods of animal sources (particularly muscle tissue) also enhance the absorption of the less bio-available non-heme iron. Dietary modification strategies need to be introduced from a very young age. In the developed world, commercially available baby products play an important role in meeting the nutritional requirements of infants, but in developing countries cost and possible contamination (bottle feeds) prohibit the use of baby products. Addition of small amounts of foods of animal sources can improve the nutritional quality of the diet, as well as the nutritional status and functional outcomes of vulnerable populations. A moderate increase in the consumption of animal source foods will provide critical nutritional benefits without a significant increase in the risk of chronic diseases in the poor. Constraints for frequent consumption of animal source foods include availability, affordability and lack of cold storage facilities. Adequate dietary intake is essential for good nutrition, but frequent infections can also lead to malnutrition. The underlying causes of malnutrition, i.e. inadequate care on the one hand, and insufficient health services and an unhealthy environment on the other hand, should also therefore be addressed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

If CO2 is captured from a CHP, additional energy requirements can be fully or partly met by increasing the load. Load increase improves plant efficiency and, consequently, part of the additional energy consumption would be offset. If this advantage is large enough, industrial CHPs may become an attractive option for CO2 capture and storage CCS. We therefore investigated the techno-economic performance of post-combustion CO2 capture from small-to-medium-scale (50-200 MWe maximum electrical capacity) industrial Natural Gas Combined Cycle- (NGCC-) CHPs in comparison with large-scale (400 MWe) NGCCs in the short term (2010) and the mid-term future (2020-2025). The analyzed system encompasses NGCC, CO2 capture, compression, and branch CO2 pipeline. The technical results showed that CO2 capture energy requirement for industrial NGCC-CHPs is significantly lower than that for 400 MWe NGCCs: up to 16% in the short term and up to 12% in the mid-term future. The economic results showed that at low heat-to-power ratio operations, CO2 capture from industrial NGCC-CHPs at 100 MWe in the short term (41-44 €/tCO2 avoided) and 200 MWe in the mid-term future (33-36 €/tCO2 avoided) may compete with 400 MWe NGCCs (46-50 €/tCO2 avoided short term, 30-35 €/tCO2 avoided mid-term). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Unit 1 of Ignalina NPP was shutdown for decommissioning at the end of 2004 and Unit 2 is to be operated until the end of 2009. Both units are equipped with channel-type graphite-moderated boiling water reactors RBMK-1500. According to the design, the spent fuel should be returned for reprocessing to Russia. However actually any fuel assembly has not been taken out from territory of the Ignalina NPP and all assemblies of spent fuel are stored in the spent fuel pools and dry on-site storage facility. Thus, the safety justification of facilities for intermediate spent fuel assemblies' storage in Ignalina NPP is very important. This paper presents the results of loss of heat removal accidents (the most probable beyond design basis accident) in spent fuel pools of Ignalina NPP. The analysis was performed by employing best-estimate system thermal hydraulic code RELAP5 and codes for severe accidents ATHLET-CD and ASTEC. The best-estimate analysis, performed using RELAP5, allowed to investigate in the details the water evaporation, uncovering and fuel assemblies heat-up processes, when heat removal from the structures of buildings and pools are evaluated. The processes of spent fuel assemblies' degradation due to loss of long-term heat removal were analyzed using ATHLET-CD and ASTEC codes. The results of calculations showed that the increase in water temperature in the pools from 50 °C up to 100 °C takes approximately 80-110 h, the evaporation of water volume down to uncovering of fuel assemblies takes approximately 220-260 additional hours. Later, after 200-300 h, the temperature of fuel claddings exceeds 800-1000 °C and the failures of fuel claddings occur due to cladding ballooning. The total amount of hydrogen generated up to time of complete water evaporation from spent fuel pools is about 7500-16,000 kg. These results of performed analysis were used for development of accident management guidelines for spent fuel pools of RBMK-1500. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The composites were produced in a one-step twin-screw extrusion process and the silane-peroxide solution was pumped into the extruder. Degree of crosslinking, mechanical properties, short-term creep, fractured surfaces and nature of crosslinking were studied to understand the relationship between composite structure and properties. The results showed that crosslinked composite strength, toughness and creep resistance were improved compared to uncrosslinked composites. The flexural strength was doubled compared to uncrosslinked samples and the creep strain was reduced. The crosslinked composites stored under room conditions showed the highest strength, whereas storage in a sauna resulted in a higher degree of crosslinking. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated formation of silane-bridges between wood and polyethylene, accordingly improving the interfacial adhesion between the wood and LDPE. The low concentration of peroxide in the silane-solution was shown to be a preferred composition to limit unintentional crosslinking during the process. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","A.

The problem is especially severe in mail delivery operations where the average speed is low and the drive cycle includes plenty of idling. The problem is typically solved by adding a diesel fuelled additional engine heater which is used for the preheating of the engine during cold start and additional heating of the engine if the coolant temperature falls below a thermostat set point during the drive cycle. However, this additional heater may drastically increase the total fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions of the vehicle. In this study the additional heater was replaced by a combination of exhaust gas heat recovery system and latent heat accumulator for thermal energy storage.

Compressed air is typically one of the most expensive utilities in an industrial facility.

This paper compiles latest literatures in terms of thesis (MS and PhD), journal articles, conference proceedings, web materials, reports, books, handbooks on compressed air energy use, efficiency, energy savings strategies. Computer tools for compressed air analysis have been reviewed and presented in this paper. Various energy-saving measures, such as use of highly efficient motors, VSD, leak prevention, use of outside intake air, reducing pressure drop, recovering waste heat, use of efficient nozzle, and use of variable displacement compressor to save compressed-air energy have been reviewed. Based on review results, it has been found that for an electric motor used in a compressed-air system, a sizeable amount of electric energy and utility bill can be saved using high efficient motors and applying VSDs in matching speed requirements. Also, significant amounts of energy and emission are reducible through various energy-saving strategies.

During the next 8 years over 7 GW of PHES capacity will be added to the European network while projects are also planned in the USA and Japan. This paper provides a review of existing and proposed PHES plant and discusses the technical and economic drivers for these developments. Current trends for new PHES development generally show that developers operating in liberalized markets are tending to repower, enhance projects or build 'pump-back' PHES rather than traditional 'pure pumped storage'. Capital costs per kW for proposed PHES in the review region range between €470/kW and €2170/kW, however these costs are highly site and project specific. An emergence has also been observed in recent PHES developments of the use of variable speed technology. This technology, while incurring slightly higher capital costs, offers a greater range of operational flexibility and efficiency over conventional PHES. This paper has primarily been prompted by a lack of detailed information on PHES facilities worldwide and reviews current developments in the context of market and generation mix changes. The most recent large scale review of PHES faculties was undertaken by the American Society of Civil Engineers Hydro Power Task Committee on Pumped Storage in 1996. In the absence of data in the literature on new PHES plant development, this review draws primarily on publicly available information from utilities, government bodies and electricity regulators. In the same context this study is limited to a review region of the European Union, Japan and the United States as information on developments outside these areas is difficult to procure.

Box 2390, Marrakesh, Morocco","In order to explore the capability of a solid-liquid phase change material (PCM) for cooling electronic or heat storage applications, melting of a PCM in a vertical rectangular enclosure was studied. Three protruding generating heat sources are attached on one of the vertical walls of the enclosure, and generating heat at a constant and uniform volumetric rate. The horizontal walls are adiabatic. The power generated in heat sources is dissipated in PCM (n-eicosane with the melting temperature, Tm = 36 °C) that filled the rectangular enclosure. The advantage of using PCM is that it is able to absorb high amount of heat generated by heat sources due to its relatively high energy density. To investigate the thermal behaviour and thermal performance of the proposed system, a mathematical model based on the mass, momentum and energy conservation equations was developed. The governing equations are next discretised using a control volume approach in a staggered mesh and a pressure correction equation method is employed for the pressure-velocity coupling. The PCM energy equation is solved using the enthalpy method. The solid regions (wall and heat sources) are treated as fluid regions with infinite viscosity and the thermal coupling between solid and fluid regions is taken into account using the harmonic mean of the thermal conductivity method. The dimensionless independent parameters that govern the thermal behaviour of the system were next identified. After validating the proposed mathematical model against experimental data, a numerical investigation was next conducted in order to examine the thermal behaviour of the system by analyzing the flow structure and the heat transfer during the melting process, for a given values of governing parameters. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This was discovered when investigating if thin film samples of Mg2NiH4 could be used in a switchable mirror or window device by utilizing a high to low temperature transition at about 510 K. In powder samples; this transition between an FCC high temperature phase, with dynamically disordered NiH4-complexes, and a monoclinic distorted low temperature phase, with ordered Mg2NiH4-complexes, has been demonstrated in a mechanical reversible conductor-insulator transition (Blomqvist and Noréus (2002) [7]). Black monoclinic Mg2NiH4 powders were found to have a band gap of 1.1 eV. Pressed tablets of black monoclinic Mg2NiH4 powders are conductive, probably from doping by impurities or non-stoichiometry. Thin film Mg2NiH4 samples were produced by reacting hydrogen with magnetron sputtered Mg2Ni films on quartz glass or CaF2 substrates. The Mg2NiH4 films on the other hand were orange, transparent with a band gap of 2.2 eV and a cubic unit cell parameter almost identical to the disorder HT phase but with lower symmetry. If black Mg2NiH4 powder is heated above the phase transition at 510 K and subsequently cooled down, the conductivity is lost and the powder turns brown. After this heat treatment TEM pictures revealed a multiple stacking fault having a local pseudo-cubic arrangement separating regions of monoclinic symmetry. The loss of conductivity and colour change is attributed to a higher band gap in the strained areas. The structure on each side of the stacking fault is related by a mirror plane as a consequence of the possibility for the NiH4-complexes to order with different orientations. This leads to a mismatch in the long range ordering and strain is probably creating the stacking faults. Strain is important for forming the cubic modification. A severely strained film was revealed with optical microscopy in reflected light, indicating that strain prevents it from relaxing back into the monoclinic structure. This was supported by multiple twinned red translucent Mg2NiH4 crystals grown with cubic symmetry at elevated temperatures in a LiH flux. When cooled to ambient conditions, the ""crystals"" had the same cubic symmetry as the films, probably held together by their neighbours. When they were ground to a fine powder to prepare TEM samples, they relaxed and reverted back to the conventional monoclinic unit cell. This interesting nanoscale modulated resistance could possibly be developed into novel memory devices if properly controllable. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this contribution, a silver surface was modified with mixed monolayers formed from sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MES) and four model (stable and easily available) aromatic thiols with strong basic properties: 4,6-diamino-2-mercaptopyrimidine (APY), 1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol (HTR), 4-methyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol (MTR), and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole-5-thiol (ATR). The structure of the formed monolayers was determined from surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements. These studies showed that, despite significant differences in the molecular structures, MES is a very promising candidate for making mixed monolayers with mercapto-derivative aromatic bases that are relatively homogeneous (without large one-component domains) in broad pH range. At high pH, in a one-component ATR monolayer, a significant amount of molecules are in the anionic form and adopt a flat orientation versus the metal surface. At the same pH, in mixed ATR+MES monolayers, a significantly larger part of ATR molecules than for the respective one-component monolayer is adsorbed in the neutral form with the aromatic ring(s) oriented perpendicularly to the metal surface. Also in the mixed APY+MES and HTR+MES monolayers, a significantly smaller part of HTR or APY molecules than for the respective one-component HTR and APY monolayers is deprotonated. The structure of the MTR monolayer practically does not depend on the pH of the surrounding solution. Increase of the ratio of acidic dissociation and reorientation of ATR molecules from the perpendicular to the parallel orientation is also observed during storage of the respective one-component and mixed monolayers in water, phosphorus buffers, and in the solutions of model peptides (bovine serum albumin or laccase). In some cases, the reorientation of ATR molecules forming the linkage monolayer when immersed in the peptide solution is very large. Significant spectral changes during soaking in water and solutions of model peptides has also been observed for APY monolayers. All studied mixed monolayers practically prevent the direct adsorption of peptides on the metal surface for at least 30 min. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Aromatic compounds; Body fluids; Dyes; Electron energy levels; High temperature reactors; Metals; Molecules; Nitrogen compounds; Peptides; Phosphorus; Raman scattering; Silver; Sodium; Spectroscopy; Acidic dissociation; Aromatic rings; Aromatic thiol; Basic properties; Bovine serum albumins; Electron transfer; High efficiency; High pH; Laccases; Metal electrodes; Metal surfaces; Mixed monolayers; Model peptides; Parallel orientation; Peptide solutions; pH range; Potential applications; Raman characterization; Silver surface; Spectral change; Surface-enhanced Raman scattering; Monolayers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951134444

The applied processes of synthesis consisted basically on ball milling in argon atmosphere followed by a hydriding reaction. Two mill devices with distinct milling modes were employed, i.e. a low energy mill (LEM) (Magneto Uni-Ball-Mill II) and a high energy mill (HEM) (Fritsch Planetary Mill, P6). The HEM sample showed better Mg-Fe mixing degree than the sample obtained from the LEM process due to the small particles of Fe resulting from the larger amount of mechanical energy transferred to the materials by the HEM device. The better Mg-Fe contacting was responsible for the higher hydrogen capacity and faster hydrogen uptake rate of the high energy milled material. Therefore, the HEM procedure was more effective than the LEM. The hydrogen uptake properties of the HEM synthesized material were compared with other Mg-based materials obtained via inert and reactive ball milling without a subsequent activation step. This study showed that Mg15Fe mixture of powders synthesized via reactive ball milling in hydrogen (RBM-LEM) has higher hydrogen capacity (5.5 wt% H) and faster kinetics than samples with the same composition milled in argon (LEM - 1.65 wt% H and HEM 1.87 wt% H). Nevertheless, a superior hydrogen capacity (6.5 wt% H) were obtained by adding LiBH4 to Mg15Fe via HEM in argon atmosphere. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This process leaves micro- and nano-structured materials with highly distorted microstructures. Then, further annealing is needed to obtain an intermetallic suitable for hydrogen thermal compression process. After milling, the samples were annealed and analyzed by X-ray diffraction and Differential Scanning Calorimetry. Hydriding properties were studied using volumetric methods. After annealing at 200 °C for 24 h no changes occur in neither structural nor hydriding properties. For samples annealed at 400 °C, relaxation effects of the structure were observed. It occurs due to the release of strain produced by annealing on the microstructure. It leads to the improvements in both structural and hydriding properties. Strong recrystallization effect was present between 400 and 600 °C. At 600 °C, the main improvements were larger crystallite size, lower strain values and pressure-composition isotherms with well-defined plateaus. Despite this behavior, no evidence of crystallization was observed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry measurements from room temperature up to 500 °C. These topics, the amount of energy supplied during mechanical alloying and the correlation between the structural and sorption properties are discussed according to the governing mechanisms of recrystallization observed in each temperature range. From these results, an improved synthesis-thermal treatment method is outlined. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We subjected the prepared blends at different mass fractions of PEG (50, 60, 70, 80, and 90% w/w) to leakage tests by heating the blends over the melting temperature of the PCM to determine the maximum encapsulation ratio without leakage. The prepared 70/30 w/w % PEG/PMMA blend as a form-stable PCM was characterized with optical microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The thermal properties of the form-stable PCM were measured with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). DSC analysis indicated that the form-stable PEG/PMMA blend melted at 58.07°C and crystallized at 39.28°C and that it had latent heats of 121.24 and 108.36 J/g for melting and crystallization, respectively. These thermal properties give the PCMs potential LHTES purposes, such as for solar space heating and ventilating applications in buildings.

The mechanisms and processes involved in the NH3 kinetics are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) and quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS). The crystal structures of Mg(NH3)nCl2 with n = 6, 2, 1, which contains up to 9.19 wt % hydrogen and 0.115 kg hydrogen L-1, are first analyzed using an algorithm based on simulated annealing (SA), finding all the experimentally known structures and predicting the C2/m structure for the uncharacterized low temperature phase of Mg(NH3) 6Cl2. It is found from DFT that the rotation of ammonia in the hexammine complex (n = 6) requires an activation energy of 0.09 eV in the low temperature phase of Mg(NH3)6Cl2 and 0.002-0.12 eV in the high temperature phases; effectively having free rotors as observed experimentally. The findings are supported by the QENS data, which identify C3 rotations of NH3 in the low temperature phase with an activation energy of 0.09 eV. The calculated diffusion rates were found to be 106-107 Hz at the desorption temperatures for all n = 6, 2, 1 systems. DFT calculations involving bulk diffusion of NH3 correctly reproduces the trends observed in the experimental desorption enthalpies. In particular, for n = 6, 2, 1, there is a good agreement between activation barriers and experimental enthalpies. These results indicate that the desorption of NH3 is likely to be diffusion limited. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"1-systems; Activation barriers; Be-diffusion; Bulk diffusions; Desorption enthalpy; Desorption kinetics; Desorption temperatures; DFT calculation; Diffusion rate; Free rotors; High energy densities; High-temperature phasis; Low temperature phase; Metal ammines; Metal salt; Quasielastic neutron scattering; Ammonia; Density functional theory; Desorption; Diffusion; Enthalpy; Low temperature properties; Magnesium; Neutron diffraction; Neutron scattering; Rotation; Simulated annealing; Sulfur compounds; Activation energy; activation energy; ammonia; annealing; crystal structure; desorption; diffusion; high temperature; low temperature; magnesium; neutron scattering; reaction kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950589382

However, the length of adverse periods varies over geographical or climatic gradients. To explore the potential for genotypic sources of variation in behavioural trade-offs, we compared the winter energy-depletion patterns among 13 wild populations of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) along a latitudinal gradient (58-70°N) and performed common-environment experiments of energy-state-dependent feeding. In the wild, winter lipid-depletion rates were lower for northern than for southern populations. The variation in spring lipid levels among the population was lower than autumn variation, with storage lipid levels clustered close to critical limits for survival. In semi-natural stream channels with natural food supply, hatchery-reared fish originating from northern populations showed a positive scaling of feeding activity with decreasing energy levels, whereas southern populations did not. In conclusion, juvenile Atlantic salmon from northern populations defend their energy levels more strongly than fish from southern populations. Adaptive variation in feeding activity appears important for this difference. Thus, the present study shows a link between geographical patterns in storage energy trajectories and adaptive differences in state-dependent feeding motivation. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Behaviour; Energy storage; Lipid; Overwintering strategies; Starvation; Trade-off","adaptation; altitude; behavioral response; bioenergetics; feeding mechanism; food supply; juvenile; lipid; overwintering; physiological response; salmonid; starvation; survival; trade-off; Animalia; Salmo salar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950807869

Total hydrogen concentrations were measured after hydriding. Hydrogen evolution temperatures were determined by mass spectrometry and differential scanning calorimetry. Structures and phase compositions of both as-cast and hydrided alloys were examined by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive analysis and X-ray diffraction. It is found that pure Mg is not suitable for electrochemical hydriding, because the achieved H-concentration is only 0.005 wt.% after hydriding. The best hydriding efficiency is observed for the Mg-23Ni-0.3P (0.55 wt.% H) and Mg-10Ni-5Mm (0.80 wt.% H) alloys. These results suggest that much higher H-concentrations would be obtained when using cathodes with a high specific surface.

The forecasting methods available of present sometimes not precise enough, thus to avoid this penalty-tariff, use of energy storage may be a possible solution. A computer simulation tool was prepared formerly to calculate the difference in production and schedule, the income, and penalty-tariffs.

Manmade changes in its composition have impacted on both these functions. This has led to the development of environmental policies and legislation addressing these two atmospheric problems. For predominantly historical reasons this has been done separately, creating institutional and practical separation between the two domains of climate change and clean air, from the UN down to local levels. The need for an integrated approach, which was demonstrated at several recent occasions [1-3], has been recognised at both the policy and political levels in Europe and elsewhere. The institutional separation of the two domains, however, may not favour its effective implementation. This has triggered an analysis of EU legislation on climate change and air pollution, and induced EFCA to consider the framework to support the introduction of an integrated approach. We report here on both aspects, including the results of an earlier publication on this matter [4]. In the recent Directives agreed as part of the Climate and Energy Package, notably the Directives on Renewable Energy and on Carbon Capture and Storage, the connection with the air quality domain has been signalled as an issue which requires attention. The Regulations on mobile sources reflect an integrated approach to pollutants and greenhouse gases. In other Directives in the domain of air pollution the need for an integrated approach is not reflected in the existing texts. It was concluded that several responses may be warranted in order to improve the quality of European legislation and to further promote cost-effective approaches in the implementation of the Directives. EFCA feels obliged, and wants, to make a contribution by presenting some recommendations. These range from providing the overall framework for legislation in the two domains to actual modifications to those Directives presently in force, and include institutional matters. The absence of a framework for the protection of the atmosphere against all types of impacts requires actions at several levels. In order to secure an integrated approach in the protection of the atmosphere of the earth in the future a Convention for a Law of the Atmosphere would be the authoritative and most relevant approach. To that end European policymakers are requested to take initiatives in the relevant fora of the United Nations. In support, UNECE may want to prepare the ground and promote and develop the concept of integrating different environmental objectives within overall economic targets in order to increase cost-effectiveness. Anticipating the outcome of a possible UN-process, the Commission may want to propose a European Framework Directive, comparable to the existing integration in the legislation on mobile sources, which would cover all sectors, including industry and agriculture and require integrative approaches at all levels. As these actions require time before they could achieve their effects they cannot, however, be a substitute for short-term action to improve existing European legislation. A cost-effective implementation of Directives in the air quality domain with respect to climate change objectives is a challenge for the hundreds of regional and local authorities across Europe, and opportunities to inspire and support them are currently being missed. Four Directives deserve a revision as soon as possible in this respect. The Air Quality Directive (AQD) should refer to the challenges of addressing the climate change problem in its considerations and thus provide an incentive to favour co-benefits and prevent unwanted impacts on climate from policies which aim at meeting the requirements of the AQD. In particular, the co-benefits of the PM10/PM2.5 requirements for the reduction of black carbon as climate forcer and similarly of ozone precursors for tropospheric ozone should be emphasized. The Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (EIAD) should refer in its considerations to the challenges of addressing the climate change problem and thus provide an incentive to explore alternatives which minimise emissions of GHGs. The National Emissions Ceilings Directive (NECD) should refer in its considerations to the challenges of addressing the climate change problem; it should point out the co-benefits of stringent ceiling levels for the precursors of tropospheric ozone: nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in climate change policies; in addition, it should point out the co-benefits of emission ceilings for acidifying components (sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides and ammonia (NH3)) which reduce the carbon sequestration capability of soils and potentially increase the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O). The Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive (IPPC) ""explicitly excludes"" emissions of greenhouse gases as these are being covered differently. To meet the stringent emission limits for toxic emissions in the Directive a system of reference documents on Best Available Technologies is being made available, the so-called BREFs, primarily describing downstream solutions. However, end-of-pipe technologies require additional energy and increase emissions of GHGs and their precursors. The IPPC Directive should refer to this connection in its considerations; in line with this, the revision process for existing BREF's should be modified to include the emission of toxic pollutants as well as GHGs in an integrated way. However, these revision processes may also take several years and climate change is urging us to undertake action immediately. In order to further a cost-effective implementation of the Directives in the air quality domain the European Commission may want to release a policy statement which calls for a coordinated approach of air pollution and climate change at all relevant levels in the implementation of present regulations.

In comparison with freshly prepared samples, reheated samples showed a higher resistant starch content with values of 44.2 ± 8.1 g/100 g and 39.8 ± 9.4 g/100 g when reheated after 12 and 24 h, respectively, compared with 31.4 ± 7.9 g/100 g for a fresh pap. A lower (P < 0.05) total protein content was recorded after the room storage-and-reheating cycle with values of 11.76 ± 2.4 g/100 g for fresh pap and 8.96 ± 1.57 and 7.56 ± 1.78 for pap reheated at 12 and 24 h, respectively. In vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) was also improved (P < 0.05). These results, especially the improvement of resistant starch content and the IVPD during room storage-and-reheating cycle of South African maize meal porridge, may open new perspectives to maize consumers both from the socioeconomical and nutritional point of view. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Despite the safety benefit of the thermal process that is applied to extend the shelf life of foods, natural nutrients could be significantly lost, thus in principle a continuous cycle of storage and reheating of food should be avoided. This study posits that in addition to improving the safety of room-stored maize meal porridge; resistant starch (RS) improvement during the storage-reheating cycle offers unique health benefits, including intestinal/colonic health and glycemic management. RS is also "" invisible"" in foods as it does not affect taste and texture like other insoluble fiber sources often do.The increase of the in vitro protein digestibility by the heating process may also be advantageous for populations where the high prevalence of protein-energy malnutrition is largely caused by the poor nutritional quality of the diet. These results may be useful for decision makers, public health authorities and governments with regard to food safety and regulation for consumers. © 2010 The Author(s).

These proteases are in turn specifically inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitors type 1 and 2 (PAI-1 and PAI-2), both of which belong to the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. Very little information is available on the role of PAI-1 and PAI-2 in ruminants, in mammary gland involution and in the adipose tissue. In this paper we describe the isolation of the full-length cDNAs of ovine PAI-1 and PAI-2 using a polymerase chain reaction based strategy. The ovine PAI-1 cDNA comprised of 1460. bp and it is characterized by a coding region of 1209. bp, and 5'- and 3'-UTR regions of 147 and 104. bp, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 402 amino acids. The ovine PAI-2 cDNA is comprised of 2128. bp and it is characterized by a coding region of 957. bp and 5'- and 3'-UTR regions of 58 and 819. bp respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 416 amino acids. Three-dimensional models of the putative protein products of both cDNAs showed that the proteins bear a high similarity with their human counterparts. Real-time PCR revealed that the two inhibitors were predominantly expressed in the ovine mammary gland and adipose tissue. Furthermore, PAI-1 and PAI-2 mRNA levels were higher in the involuting mammary tissue and the adipose tissue obtained from non-lactating ewes compared to the corresponding values in tissues obtained from lactating ewes. These data are consistent with the notion that the plasminogen activation cascade plays a key role in involution of the mammary gland. The upregulation of expression of both inhibitors in the adipose tissue during the non-lactating period is a rather enigmatic observation. However, the expression of both inhibitors (PAI-1 and PAI-2) together with that of urokinase type plasminogen activator and its receptor previously reported by our group, strengthen the suggestion that the adipose tissue functions as an endocrine besides an energy storage organ. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Adipose; CDNA; Homologue model; Mammary gland; Ovine; PAI-1; PAI-2","amino acid; complementary DNA; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; plasminogen activator inhibitor 2; complementary DNA; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; plasminogen activator inhibitor 2; 3' untranslated region; 5' untranslated region; adipose tissue; amino acid sequence; animal tissue; article; breast; controlled study; DNA isolation; DNA structure; ewe; female; genetic code; lactation; mammary gland; molecular cloning; nonhuman; plasminogen activation; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein expression; adipose tissue; animal; biosynthesis; endocrine gland; energy metabolism; genetics; human; metabolism; molecular cloning; nucleotide sequence; physiology; sequence homology; sheep; udder; Ovis; 3' Untranslated Regions; 5' Untranslated Regions; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Complementary; Endocrine Glands; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Lactation; Mammary Glands, Animal; Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1; Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Sheep",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952471827

While the former is characterized by excessive intrahepatic triglyceride accumulation, the latter induces overproduction of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. It has not been well elucidated whether these apparently opposite mechanisms impact on VLDL characteristics or not. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the VLDL secretion and features resulting from insulin resistance and fatty liver in rats fed a sucrose-rich diet (SRD, i.e. addition of sucrose to drinking water during 12 weeks). No differences in calorie intake were observed in comparison to controls. Both groups showed similar weight gains throughout the treatment period. However, SRD rats showed an increased proportion of body fat as assessed by X-ray absorptiometry, increased visceral obesity, liver weight and fat accumulation in the liver (p < 0.04). Histological study revealed moderate micro- and macrovesicular steatosis. Fasting insulin, triglyceride and free fatty acid (FFA) levels increased while VLDLs decreased in SRD rats (p < 0.05). The chemical composition of VLDLs of SRD rats showed a higher percentage of triglycerides, and the VLDL triglyceride/protein ratio, an estimator of lipoprotein size, suggests that VLDL particles of SRD rats are larger than those of controls (p < 0.0005). FFA levels correlated with VLDL triglycerides (r = 0.49, p = 0.03) and liver fat content correlated with plasma triglycerides (r = 0.65), VLDL triglycerides (r = 0.55) and triglyceride/protein ratio (r = 0.52, p < 0.02). The VLDL secretion rate assay showed an increase in SRD rats (p < 0.02), confirming an overproduction despite liver fat accumulation. Our findings are consistent with an insulin resistance development model in which hepatic lipid content would constitute an important determinant of a triglyceride-rich, large-particle VLDL secretion; both features would increase its atherogenic potential.

Whether an increased intake of fructose is specifically related to a dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism remains controversial. We therefore compared the effects of hypercaloric diets enriched with fructose (HFrD) or glucose (HGlcD) in healthy men. Eleven subjects were studied in a randomised order after 7d of the following diets: (1) weight maintenance, control diet; (2) HFrD (35g fructose/kg fat-free mass (ffm) per d, +35% energy intake); (3) HGlcD (35g glucose/kg ffm per d, +35% energy intake). Fasting hepatic glucose output (HGO) was measured with 6,6-2H2-glucose. Intrahepatocellular lipids (IHCL) and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) were measured by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Both fructose and glucose increased fasting VLDL-TAG (HFrD: +59%, P&lt;005; HGlcD: +31%, P=011) and IHCL (HFrD: +52%, P&lt;005; HGlcD: +58%, P=006). HGO increased after both diets (HFrD: +5%, P&lt;005; HGlcD: +5%, P=005). No change was observed in fasting glycaemia, insulin and alanine aminotransferase concentrations. IMCL increased significantly only after the HGlcD (HFrD: +24%, NS; HGlcD: +59%, P&lt;005). IHCL and VLDL-TAG were not different between hypercaloric HFrD and HGlcD, but were increased compared to values observed with a weight maintenance diet.

The blends possess fixed content (50. wt.%) of very good coking coal from the Zofiówka Mine. The remaining components of the blends are worse coking coals collected from the Janina, Krupinski, Szczyglowice, Jas-Mos mines (coals of carbon content ranging from 73 up to 92. wt.%), and very porous carbons: coke (from the coking plant Zdzieszowice), as well as woody stems of bamboo and yucca carbonized at 400. °C. The content of porous carbon in a blend does not exceed 20. wt.%. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) are used in the study. The weight loss during low-temperature pyrolysis (<600°C), and storage/loss elastic moduli measured as a function of the increasing temperature are related to the kind and concentration of additives. The temperature dependences of elastic moduli determined for binary coal blends differ clearly from those of ternary coal blends. The consumption of energy during the interaction of the components in binary blends was found to be distinctly bigger than the one observed for ternary blends. Non-softening additives such as carbonized plants and low rank coal, containing many functional groups, diminish both moduli of the blends distinctly. However, the addition of coke does not reduce the value of the elastic moduli but increases the width of the maximum occurring in the temperature dependence of the moduli. The influence of the coke additive on rheological properties of the blends, different in comparison with the remaining additives studied, was assigned with different number of functional groups and radicals. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Additives; Coal blends; Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA); Pyrolysis; Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)","Binary blends; Carbon additives; Carbon content; Coal blends; Coking coal; Concentration of; Consumption of energy; Low rank coals; Low-temperature pyrolysis; Porous carbons; Remaining component; Rheological property; Temperature dependence; Ternary blends; Thermal decompositions; Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA); Weight loss; Additives; Coal; Coal industry; Coke; Coking; Dynamic analysis; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Dynamics; Elastic moduli; Functional groups; Industrial plants; Mining; Pyrolysis; Rheology; Temperature distribution; Thermogravimetric analysis; carbon; coal; elastic modulus; pyrolysis; rheology; thermal decomposition; thermogravimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950629445

The protein composition and dynamics of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is of crucial importance for the functioning of those cells. Adipogenesis is a bi-phasic process in which the ECM develops from a fibrillar to a laminar structure as cells move from the commitment phase to the growth phase characterized by storage of vast amounts of triglycerides. Mature adipocytes appear to spend a lot of energy on the maintenance of the ECM. ECM remodeling is mediated by a balanced complement of constructive and destructive enzymes together with their enhancers and inhibitors. ECM remodeling is an energy costing process regulated by insulin, by the energy metabolism, and by mechanical forces. In the obese, overgrowth of adipocytes may lead to instability of the ECM, possibly mediated by hypoxia. © The Author(s) 2010.","Adipocytes; Dynamics; Extracellular matrix; Hypoxia; Lipid metabolism; Obesity; Proteomics","insulin; scleroprotein; adipocyte; adipogenesis; body weight; cell maturation; energy metabolism; extracellular matrix; human; nonhuman; obesity; protein analysis; protein processing; regulatory mechanism; review; animal; metabolism; physiology; Adipocytes; Animals; Extracellular Matrix; Humans; Obesity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950618036

The anthropometric and biochemical parameters of subjects were characterized in detail. ANGPTL 3 and 4 levels were determined using the developed ELISAs. The intraand inter-assay coeffi cients of variation for the assays were less than 15%. The average serum concentration of ANGPTL3 was 368 ± 168 ng/ml (mean ± SD) and for ANGPTL4 it was 18 ± 23 ng/ml (mean ± SD). ANGPTL4 serum levels displayed high variability between individuals ranging from 2 to 158 ng/ml. In post-heparin plasma, both ANGPTL 3 and 4 were increased. Low levels of ANGPTL3 were associated with decreased HDL-cholesterol and increased triglyceride levels. ANGPTL4 levels were positively correlated with FFAs (P = 0.044) and waist-hip ratio (P = 0.016). The developed ELISAs will be important tools to clarify the role of ANGPTL 3 and 4 in human energy metabolism and partitioning of triglycerides between sites of storage (adipose tissue) and oxidation (skeletal and cardiac muscle).

However in the cell, starch occurs in semicrystalline granules of various sizes depending on the plant species. Therefore, it is important to understand how crystalline starch becomes metabolically available. Recent studies provide insight into the structural basis of how rare phosphate esters present in starch granules can stimulate its degradation in the cell. Phosphorylation at the C-3 position of the glucose units seems to play a significant role by inducing strain in crystalline starch and resulting in helix unfolding. These findings add a new perspective on how plants increase bioavailability of this carbohydrate matrix through a phosphate-induced amorphisation mechanism. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This research article is based on the research of climate surfaces by Prof. Keller and Dr Burmeister at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (Burmeister and Keller, 1998). The question should be resolved whether this simplified method using climate surfaces is applicable to the entire building. The most important parameters of the building have been systematically changed and their impact on energy performance during different outdoor climate changes was observed. As a result, the impacts on the following are presented and discussed: Heat energy demands, Cooling energy demands, and Summer indoor temperatures. The results of these investigations showed that the multizone climate surface method is a very practical and clear strategy for estimating the thermal behavior of a building by the correct selection of three determining parameters. Already in an early planning stage, it is possible to establish the optimal building data, at a sufficient level of detail, where energy consumption has been concerned. The study is carried out using the monthly energy balance method and dynamic simulation using BuildOpt software. The objective was to establish if the much simpler monthly balance method will give sufficiently precise results for this optimization, or if a simulation must be performed. The results of the analysis indicate that the monthly balance method is inaccurate, especially for buildings with low energy demands. Subsequent studies deal with the optimization of the most important construction assembly parameters of a building for specific climates. The results of the optimization studies are presented in this article.","Change of location; Climate surfaces; Cooling energy demand; Heating energy demand; Storage capacity; Summer indoor temperatures; Window size and orientation","Change of location; Cooling energy; Heating energy; Indoor temperature; Storage capacity; Window Size; Window size and orientation; Atmospheric temperature; Buildings; Computer simulation; Computer software; Energy conservation; Energy management; Optimization; Space heating; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950502464

These responses are often studied under benign conditions, yet energy stress may be expected to interfere with optimal shifts in trait values. We exposed the water flea Daphnia magna to fish predation and food stress and quantified both life history responses as well as physiological responses (metabolic rate, stress proteins, energy storage and immune function) to explore the architecture of defence strategies in the face of the combined stressors and the occurrence of trade-offs associated with energy constraints. All traits studied showed either an overall or clone-dependent response to food stress. The chronic response to predation risk was less strong for the measured physiological traits than for life history traits, and stronger under food stress than under benign conditions for age at maturity, intrinsic population growth rate and offspring performance (measured as juvenile growth). Immune function (measured as phenoloxidase activity) was lower under predation risk but only at high food, probably because minimum levels were maintained at low food. Overall, food stress induced stronger adaptive predator-induced responses, whereas more energy was invested in reproduction under benign conditions at the cost of being less defended. Our results suggest that food stress may increase the capacity to cope with predation risk and underscore the importance of integrating responses to different stressors and traits, and show how responses towards one stressor can have consequences for the susceptibility to other stressors. © 2009 The Authors.

This opinion has primarily been based on altered RBC rheologic properties (i.e., enhanced aggregability, reduced deformability, and elevated endothelial cell interaction), during prolonged storage of nonleukoreduced RBC units. In this study, the rheologic properties and cell variables of leukoreduced RBC units, during routine blood bank storage in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol, were investigated. Study design and methods: Ten leukoreduced RBC units were stored at the blood bank for 7 weeks at 4°C. RBCs were tested weekly for aggregability, deformability, and other relevant variables. Results: RBC aggregability was significantly reduced after the first week of storage but recovered during the following weeks. After 7 weeks aggregability was slightly, but significantly, reduced (46.9 ± 2.4-44.3 ± 2.2 aggregation index). During storage the osmotic fragility was not significantly enhanced (0.47 ± 0.01% phosphate-buffered saline) and the deformability at shear stress of 3.9 Pa was not significantly reduced (0.36 ± 0.01 elongation index EI). The deformability at 50 Pa was reduced (0.58 ± 0.01-0.54 ± 0.01 EI) but remained within reference values (0.53 ± 0.04). During 5 weeks of storage, adenosine triphosphate was reduced by 54% whereas mean cell volume, pH, and mean cell hemoglobin concentration were minimally affected. Conclusions: RBC biochemical and physical alterations during storage minimally affected the RBC ability to aggregate and deform, even after prolonged storage. The rheologic properties of leukoreduced RBC units were well preserved during 7 weeks of routine blood bank storage. © 2009 American Association of Blood Banks.",,"adenine; adenosine triphosphate; glucose; hemoglobin; mannitol; phosphate buffered saline; sodium chloride; article; blood bank; blood pH; blood storage; cell aggregation; cell structure; cell volume; erythrocyte; human; osmotic fragility; reference value; shear stress; Adenosine Triphosphate; Blood Banks; Blood Donors; Blood Preservation; Energy Metabolism; Erythrocyte Aggregation; Erythrocyte Deformability; Erythrocytes; Hemoglobins; Hemolysis; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Netherlands; Osmotic Fragility; Rheology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950221996

The experimental results indicate that the high surface area of the water dispersed material, to a large extent, is maintained upon normal drying without the use of any solvent exchange. Thus, the employed chemical polymerization of polypyrrole on the microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) nanofibers in the hydrogel gives rise to a composite, the structure of which-unlike that of uncoated MFC paper-does not collapse upon drying. The dry composite has a surface area of ∼90 m2/g and a conductivity of ∼1.5 S/cm, is electrochemically active, and exhibits an ion-exchange capacity for chloride ions of 289 C/g corresponding to a specific capacity of 80 mAh/g. The straightforwardness of the fabrication of the present nanocellulose composites should significantly facilitate industrial manufacturing of highly porous, electroactive conductive paper materials for applications including ion-exchange and paper-based energy storage devices. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Cellulose; Chlorine compounds; Conductive materials; Dewatering; Ion exchange; Ion exchangers; Ions; Microbial fuel cells; Polymerization; Polypyrroles; Chemical polymerization; Chloride ions; Electroactive; Energy storage devices; High surface area; In-situ; Individual fibers; Industrial manufacturing; Ion exchange capacity; Microfibrillated cellulose; Nano-cellulose; Paper materials; Polypyrrole composites; Solvent exchanges; Specific capacities; Surface area; Water-dispersed; Surfaces; Cellulose; Chlorine Compounds; Conductive Papers; Drainage; Drying; Fuel Cells; Ion Exchange; Ion Exchangers; Polymerization; Pyrroles; Surfaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950219237

Intercalation/insertion processes are the best examples of these phenomena. The type of interaction/binding between guest species and host material decides about the reversibility of the processes. The important drawback of the carbon anode in Li-ion cells is often its irreversible capacity. It correlates with the active surface area and it can be significantly diminished through pyrolytic carbon coating. In situ7Li-NMR measurement is a perfect method for monitoring the type of Li-C bonding during the insertion/deinsertion process. Supercapacitor is the second category of attractive energy storage system. The main operation of a capacitor is based on an electrostatic attraction; however, very often pseudocapacitance effects take place. Intensive research is devoted to electrochemical hydrogen storage where the type of C-hydrogen bonding is crucial for practical application of this process. The reversibility of hydrogen insertion into the carbon network is ensured by a weak chemical bonding. Carbon materials with electrosorbed hydrogen play a perfect role of negative electrode in supercapacitor. Attractive host-guest interactions take place during the performance of various supercapacitor electrode materials, e.g. nitrogen-doped carbons with modified electronic structure, layered double hydroxides, conducting polymers, etc. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An overview is presented of the expected performance data of CO2 capture systems implemented at P&amp;H plants, and the expected emission of key air pollutants, being: SO2, NOX, NH3, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM). The CO2 capture systems investigated include: post-combustion, oxyfuel combustion and pre-combustion capture. For all capture systems it was found that SO2, NOx and PM emissions are expected to be reduced or remain equal per unit of primary energy input compared to power plants without CO2 capture. Increase in primary energy input as a result of the energy penalty for CO2 capture may for some technologies and substances result in a net increase of emissions per kWh output. The emission of ammonia may increase by a factor of up to 45 per unit of primary energy input for post-combustion technologies. No data are available about the emission of VOCs from CO2 capture technologies. A simple model was developed and applied to analyse the impact of CO2 capture in the European P&amp;H sector on the emission level of key air pollutants in 2030. Four scenarios were developed: one without CO2 capture and three with one dominantly implemented CO2 capture system, varying between: post-combustion, oxyfuel combustion and pre-combustion. The results showed a reduction in GHG emissions for the scenarios with CO2 capture compared to the baseline scenario between 12% and 20% in the EU 27 region in 2030. NOx emissions were 15% higher in the P&amp;H sector in a scenario with predominantly post-combustion and lower when oxyfuel combustion (-16%) or pre-combustion (-20%) were implemented on a large scale. Large scale implementation of the post-combustion technology in 2030 may also result in significantly higher, i.e. increase by a factor of 28, NH3 emissions compared to scenarios with other CO2 capture options or without capture. SO2 emissions were very low for all scenarios that include large scale implementation of CO2 capture in 2030, i.e. a reduction varying between 27% and 41%. Particulate Matter emissions were found to be lower in the scenarios with CO2 capture. The scenario with implementation of the oxyfuel technology showed the lowest PM emissions followed by the scenario with a significant share allocated to pre-combustion, respectively -59% and -31%. The scenario with post-combustion capture resulted in PM emissions varying between 35% reduction and 26% increase. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The increasing and staggering prevalence of obesity might not only be explained by nutritional habits or the reduction of energy expenditure through decreased physical activity. In addition, recent studies have focused on intestinal microbiota as environmental factors that increase energy yield from diet, regulate peripheral metabolism and thereby increase body weight. Obesity is associated with substantial changes in composition and metabolic function of gut microbiota, but the pathophysiological processes driving this bidirectional relationship have not been fully elucidated. This review discusses the relationships between the following: composition of gut microbiota, energy extracted from diet, synthesis of gut hormones involved in energy homeostasis, production of butyrate and the regulation of fat storage.","Gut microbiota; Insulin resistance; Obesity; Review; Type 2 diabetes","adiponectin; antibiotic agent; butyric acid; gastrointestinal hormone; glucagon like peptide 1; neurotransmitter; body composition; body weight; diet; environmental factor; human; inflammation; insulin resistance; intestine flora; knockout mouse; lipid diet; lipid storage; metabolic syndrome X; nonhuman; obesity; pathophysiology; priority journal; review; Atherosclerosis; Bacteria; Body Composition; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Angiopathies; Diet; Digestion; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Intestines; Obesity; Phylogeny; Prevalence",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949265935

The optical gap is found to be 1.94 eV and the transition is indirectly allowed. The chemical analysis reveals an oxygen deficiency and the oxide exhibits n-type conductivity, confirmed by a negative thermopower. The plot log σ vs 1/T shows linearity in the range (400-670 K) with the donor levels at 0.14 eV below the conduction band and a break at ∼590 K, attributed to the ionization of the donors. The conduction occurs by small polaron hopping through mixed valences Fe2+/3+ with an electron mobility μ400 K of 10-3 V cm2 s-1. α-Fe2O3 exhibits long term chemical stability in neutral solution and has been characterized photoelectrochemically to assess its activity as bias-free O2-photoanode. The flat band potential Vfb (-0.45VSCE) and the electron density ND (1.63 × 1018 cm-3) were determined, respectively, by extrapolating the linear part to C-2 = 0 and the slope of the Mott Schottky plot. At pH 6.5, the valence band (+1.35VSCE) is suitably positioned with respect to the O2/H2O level (+0.62 V) and α-Fe2O3 has been evaluated for the chemical energy storage through the photocatalytic reaction: (2 SO32 - + 2 H+ → S2 O32 - + O2 + H2 O, ΔG = 213.36 kJ mol-1).

Unlike previous theoretical treatments of this problem, based on a cylindrical-symmetry model, we use a different approach, initiated by White et al. [Phys. Rev. B 47 (1993) 5485], which properly takes account of genuine helical and rotational symmetries of the chiral SWCNTs. Taking into account the Coulomb interaction between π -electrons within the random-phase-approximation, we derive an explicit expression for the dynamic-dielectric-response function of the SWCNTs in helical representation and apply it to the numerical calculation of the dispersion and damping of the π -plasmons in a number of representative SWCNTs with chiral symmetry. Multiple (up to eight) well-defined inter- π -band-plasmon modes, with wave vectors lying in the direction of the helical line of such nanotubes, are shown to exist for each value of the quantum angular momentum L independent of whether the nanotubes are metallic or semiconducting. These π -plasmon modes, which we refer to as helical π -plasmons, are found to have several unexpected dispersive features, making them distinctly different from those obtained previously within the above-mentioned cylindrical-symmetry model. In particular, none of the helical π -plasmon branches starts from a zero value of the helical wave-number qH, and in all the calculated spectra of the helical π -plasmons, there exists the highest-lying branch of the dispersive π -plasmon modes, which either extends up to the energy of about 15 eV or makes its start with this energy. This highest-lying branch in the spectrum of the π -plasmons is found to have the largest spectral weight in the electron-energy losses, leading to the appearance of the dominant 15-eV-resonant peak in the low-loss spectra of the nanotubes under consideration. This possibly suggests an explanation, on the microscopic level, to the origin of the intensive resonant feature at ∼ 15 eV, observed in recent electron-energy-loss-spectroscopy experiments on isolated SWCNTs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this study an innovation systems perspective is applied to review the development of CCS technologies in the US between 2000 and 2009 and to come up with policy recommendations for technology managers that wish to accelerate the deployment of CCS. The analysis describes the successful built-up of an innovation system around CCS and pinpoints the key determinants for this achievement. However, the evaluation of the system's performance also indicates that America's leading role in the development of CCS should not be taken for granted. It shows that the large CCS R&D networks, as well as the extensive CCS knowledge base, which have been accumulated over the past decade, have not yet been valorized by entrepreneurs to explore the market for integrated CCS concepts linked to power generation. Therefore, it is argued that the build-up of the innovation system has entered a critical phase that is decisive for a further thriving development of CCS technologies in the US.

In this study, the fine particles of Ni-Zn ferrite were prepared and fabricated using sol-gel route at low and high temperatures. The results gathered from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated the amount of single-phase spinel ferrite constituents could be formed at a temperature below 400 °C. The Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopic (FT-IR) and the analyses using the microscopic photomicrographs were used to identify the formation of Ni-Zn spinel ferrite. The initial magnetic permeability showed that the inductance of the fabricated ferrite cores was of the highest value. Therefore, a laboratory coil equipped with a high-temperature superconducting magnetic energy storage (HT-SMES) was designed. The theoretical analysis of the torus with rectangular shaped coils was also carried out, and for this, a consideration for the average magnetic field inside the torus was used to calculate the inductance of the shape. Using uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and power conditioning system (PCS) which give details of the application of μ-SMES in solving voltage sag, a schematic diagram is also reported. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A storage system encapsulated with phase change materials in which energy is absorbed in the hot period and released in the cold period is analyzed. The thermal behaviour of isothermal heat storage composites is examined using numerical techniques. Two methods of heat transfer with latent heat storage are described in the first part. Based on the initial results, the ""effective heat capacity"" method was selected and implemented into ESP-r. Numerical studies on the effect of isothermal storage of solar energy in specific building material components are discussed in the second part. Numerical simulations were conducted for two cases of multi-zone, highly glazed and naturally ventilated passive solar buildings. PCM-impregnated gypsum plasterboard was used as an internal room lining in the first case study and transparent insulation material combined with PCM was applied for the external south-oriented wall in the second case study. The behaviour of a TIM-PCM wall and its influence on the internal surface temperature are estimated.

The material was studied by methods of X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption and thermal analysis. It was shown that calcium chloride is located basically in the pores of silica. The isotherms and kinetics curves of water ad/desorption were measured at temperature 50 °C and vapor pressure range from 0 to 50 mbar. A small hysteresis was observed for the formation di- and tetra-hydrates of CaCl2 in the pores. The equilibrium pressure over the dispersed CaCl2 dihydrate was found to be 2.5-4 times lower relative to the bulk one, allowing a significant improvement of the salt desiccative properties. The possible reasons of this pressure decrease might be the higher mobility of water in the dispersed dihydrate and/or the increase in the surface energy of the salt (hydrate) confined to the SBA pores. The latter effect is a reason of the melting point depression for dispersed hydrates CaCl2·nH2O with n = 2, 4 and 6 that was revealed by DSC tests. The effective water diffusivity in SBA pores has been determined. The Knudsen diffusion in the SBA mesopores was found to be a rate-limiting stage of water sorption on CaCl2@SBA-15. The equilibrium sorption curves for the new composite were compared with other composite sorbents ""CaCl2 in porous matrix"". Several possible applications of the new sorbent, among which are the gas drying, heat storage and adsorptive heat pumps, were preliminary evaluated. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The first evaluation of 'Elstar' apples, included weekly determination of apple diameter and the second evaluation included at harvest measurement of fruit weight and fruit quality (Streif index). All apples were cold-stored in normal atmosphere at 3 °C or in low oxygen atmosphere at 1 °C immediately after picking. Analytical data were combined with daily registered meteorological data including: the sums of degree days, rainfall in the morning including minimum precipitation and/or dew, maximum precipitation (rainfall), evaporation potential, wind velocity, average daily relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit, global radiation, soil temperature and surface wetness. Factor analyses identified three non-correlated factors; 1) energy and water, 2) heat and wind and 3) vapour deficit. The factor loadings were used to determine the importance of each climate variable and its interactions on characteristics of the apple fruit. Multiple regression analyses, with forward selection of climate variables or their interactions showed that apple fruit diameter was significantly affected by two climate factors: 1) degree days and 2) evaporation potential. Only degree day had a significant effect on apple fruit weight. Fruit quality (Streif index) was affected by two climate factors: 1) degree days and 2) relative humidity. Apple fruit diameter, fruit weight and fruit quality were modelled using climate. The differences between measured and predicted diameter, weight and fruit quality were 0.2 mm, 1 g and 0.09 kg cm-2 ww%-1 scores-1, respectively. In view of climate change with expected warmer temperatures, the value establishing and using statistical models for prediction of quality characteristics will increase considerably. © Verlag Eugen Ulmer KG, Stuttgart.","Climate factors; Diameter; Factor analysis; Fruit quality; Modeling; Weight","Malus x domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949981446

Importantly, obesity is a leading cause of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. As emerging evidence has shown over the last decade, inflammation is one of the critical processes associated with the development of insulin resistance, diabetes and related diseases, and obesity is now considered as a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. Adipose tissue, apart from its classical role as an energy storage depot, is also a major endocrine organ secreting many factors, whose local and circulating levels are affected by the degree of adiposity. Obesity leads to infiltration of the expanded adipose tissue by macrophages and increased levels in proinflammatory cytokines. The first indication for increased cytokine release in obesity was provided by the identification of increased expression of TNF-α, a proinflammatory cytokine, in the adipose tissue of obese mice in the early 1990s. TNF-α is expressed in and secreted by adipose tissue, its levels correlating with the degree of adiposity and the associated insulin resistance. Targeting TNF-α and/or its receptors has been suggested as a promising treatment for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. This review will summarize the available knowledge on the role of TNF-α in obesity and related processes and the potential implications of the above in the development of new therapeutic approaches for obesity and insulin resistance. Recent data from clinical studies will also be described together with late findings on the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance. © 2010 S.

Therefore, LRSPs attracted a great deal of attention for development of ultrasensitive biosensors based on surface plasmon resonance and surface plasmon-enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy (SPFS). In this article, the authors investigate the excitation of LRSPs on a biosensor-compatible layer structure consisting of a Cytop fluoropolymer, thin gold film modified by thiol self-assembled monolayer for coupling of receptor biomolecules, and an aqueous sample on its top. The morphology, and optical and electrical properties of the layer structure are determined and related to the performance of a SPFS biosensor. Through increasing the surface energy of Cytop fluoropolymer by O2 plasma, more compact gold films that exhibit lower roughness were prepared which resulted in a higher binding capacity, decreased nonspecific adsorption of biomolecules to the biosensor surface, and in a larger enhancement of electromagnetic field intensity accompanied with the excitation of LRSPs. The authors show that by improving the quality of a gold film supporting LRSPs, the fluorescence signal can be enhanced up to sixfold with respect to regular SPFS biosensors. © 2010 American Vacuum Society.",,"Aqueous samples; Binding capacities; Compatible layer; Enhanced fluorescence; Fluorescence signals; Fluoropolymer; Gold film; Layer structures; Long-range surface plasmons; Nonspecific adsorption; Optical and electrical properties; Optical waves; Orders of magnitude; Regular surfaces; Surface energies; Surface plasmons; Thin gold film; Thin metallic films; Ultrasensitive; Adsorption; Biomolecules; Electric properties; Electromagnetic fields; Fluorescence; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Gold; Metallic films; Monolayers; Optical data storage; Optical properties; Photoresists; Plasmons; Solids; Structural optimization; Surface chemistry; Surface plasmon resonance; Surface structure; Surface tension; Biosensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949381908

We show that the attainability of low greenhouse gas concentration targets, in particular 450 and 400 ppm CO2 equivalent critically depends on model assumptions, such as bio-energy potentials. Under standard model assumptions, these targets can be reached, although the lowest requires the use of bio-energy in combination with carbon-capture-and-storage. Regions are affected differently by ambitious climate policies in terms of energy and land use, although stringent emission reductions will be required in all regions. Resulting co-benefits of climate policy (such as energy security and air pollution) are also different across world regions.

Other than reproductive function, these hormones influence many other physiological systems, and their action during exercise may have implications for exercise performance. Although a number of studies have found exercise performance and in particular, endurance performance to vary between menstrual phases, there is an equal number of such studies reporting no differences. However, a comparison of the increase in the oestrogen concentration (E) relative to progesterone concentration (P) as the EP ratio (pmolnmol) in the luteal phase in these studies reveals that endurance performance may only be improved in the mid-luteal phase compared with the early follicular phase when the EP ratio is high in the mid-luteal phase. Furthermore, the late follicular phase, characterized by the pre-ovulatory surge in oestrogen and suppressed progesterone concentrations, tends to promote improved performance in a cycling time trial and future studies should include this menstrual phase. Menstrual phase variations in endurance performance may largely be a consequence of changes to exercise metabolism stimulated by the fluctuations in ovarian hormone concentrations. The literature suggests that oestrogen may promote endurance performance by altering carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism, with progesterone often appearing to act antagonistically. Details of the ovarian hormone influences on the metabolism of these macronutrients are no longer only limited to evidence from animal research and indirect calorimetry but have been verified by substrate kinetics determined with stable tracer methodology in eumenorrhoeic women. This review thoroughly examines the metabolic perturbations induced by the ovarian hormones and, by detailed comparison, proposes reasons for many of the inconsistent reports in menstrual phase comparative research. Often the magnitude of increase in the ovarian hormones between menstrual phases and the EP ratio appear to be important factors determining an effect on metabolism. However, energy demand and nutritional status may be confounding variables, particularly in carbohydrate metabolism. The review specifically considers how changes in metabolic responses due to the ovarian hormones may influence exercise performance. For example, oestrogen promotes glucose availability and uptake into type I muscle fibres providing the fuel of choice during short duration exercise; an action that can be inhibited by progesterone. A high oestrogen concentration in the luteal phase augments muscle glycogen storage capacity compared with the low oestrogen environment of the early follicular phase. However, following a carbo-loading diet will super-compensate muscle glycogen stores in the early follicular phase to values attained in the luteal phase. Oestrogen concentrations of the luteal phase reduce reliance on muscle glycogen during exercise and although not as yet supported by human tracer studies, oestrogen increases free fatty acid availability and oxidative capacity in exercise, favouring endurance performance. Evidence of oestrogens stimulation of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase may explain many of the metabolic actions of oestrogen. However, both oestrogen and progesterone suppress gluconeogenic output during exercise and this may compromise performance in the latter stages of ultra-long events if energy replacement supplements are inadequate. Moreover, supplementing energy intake during exercise with protein may be more relevant when progesterone concentration is elevated compared with menstrual phases favouring a higher relative oestrogen concentration, as progesterone promotes protein catabolism while oestrogen suppresses protein catabolism. Furthermore, prospective research ideas for furthering the understanding of the impact of the menstrual cycle on metabolism and exercise performance are highlighted. © 2010 Adis Data Information BV.

Activation of ATGL initiates the hydrolytic catabolism of cellular triacylglycerol (TG) stores to glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids. Mutations in both ATGL and CGI-58 cause ""neutral lipid storage disease"" characterized by massive accumulation of TG in various tissues. The analysis of CGI-58-deficient (Cgi-58-/-) mice, presented in this study, reveals a dual function of CGI-58 in lipid metabolism. First, systemicTGaccumulation and severe hepatic steatosis in newborn Cgi-58 -/- mice establish a limiting role for CGI-58 in ATGL-mediated TG hydrolysis and supply of nonesterified fatty acids as energy substrate. Second, a severe skin permeability barrier defect uncovers an essential ATGL-independent role of CGI-58 in skin lipid metabolism. The neonatal lethal skin barrier defect is linked to an impaired hydrolysis of epidermal TG. As a consequence, sequestration of fatty acids in TG prevents the synthesis of acylceramides, which are essential lipid precursors for the formation of a functional skin permeability barrier. This mechanism may also underlie the pathogenesis of ichthyosis in neutral lipid storage disease patients lacking functional CGI-58. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Dual function; Gene identification; Growth retardation; Hepatic steatosis; Hydrolases; Lipid droplets; Lipid metabolisms; Lysophosphatidic acid; Neutral lipid; Nonesterified fatty acids; Skin permeability; Triacylglycerols; Capillarity; Defects; Fatty acids; Glycerol; Hydrolysis; Metabolism; Phospholipids; Acids; alpha beta hydrolase domain containing protein 5; ceramide; fat droplet; fatty acid; glycerol; hydrolase; lysophosphatidic acid; skin lipid; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; unclassified drug; acylation; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; disease severity; embryo; enzyme activation; fatty liver; gene deletion; gene mutation; growth retardation; hydrolysis; ichthyosis; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipidosis; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; pathogenesis; permeability barrier; priority journal; protein function; skin permeability; 1-Acylglycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Animals, Suckling; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases; Fatty Liver; Fetal Growth Retardation; Fibroblasts; Humans; Ichthyosis; Lipase; Liver; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Permeability; Skin; Syndrome; Triglycerides; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951212321

Most, if not all, of these applications are also greatly dependant on the finite size of the material. As the finite size decreases, the proportion of materials residing at the surface is significantly increased, quantum effects kick in, and the effect of boundaries-such as domain wall boundaries in ferro/piezoelectric crystals-can no longer be neglected as they were in the bulk materials.

Mickiewicza 30, 30-059 Kraków, Poland","A European nuclear-fusion technology program is currently, except of other acivities, on the stage of validating the capability of neutronic codes and nuclear data for use in the ITER project. This requires a technique for reliable measurements of tritium produced by a neutron flux and these estimates must have a qualified uncertainty. The application of LiF TL detectors, calibrated by the direct measurement of tritium activity using the Liquid Scintillation Counting (LSC) technique, is a new approach to the assessment of the tritium production rate in fusion related benchmark experiments. Lithium Fluoride Thermoluminescent Detectors (TLD) are commonly used for measurements of thermal neutron dose using the 6Li(n,α)3H reaction. The accumulation of radioactive tritium in the LiF detectors is usually considered as an undesired effect to the detectors, increasing intrinsic background after high-dose neutron exposure. The same effect may be exploited for the measurement of generated tritium activity. A TL signal corresponding to the energy deposited in the -β decay of 3H, expressed as mGy/h to be recalculated to Bq/mg, requires calibration by an independent measurement of 3H activity. This calibration can be performed by applying e.g. LSC-technique. A good correlation was obtained in the tested range of tritium activity: 17-25 Bq/mg of LiF (0.080-0.118 mGy/h) with a slope of regression line: 1.75 × 10-4 [mGy/h]/[Bq], r2 = 0.94. The thermal treatment of the TLDs after irradiation (annealing: 400 °C, 1 h) leads to a loss of 37% of the initial tritium content. Prolonged storage of the irradiated TLDs at room temperature, pressure and humidity causes the escape of less than 5% of the accumulated tritium after 100 days. Thus LiF TLDs after calibration can be used as one of techniques for the assessment of tritium production in neutronic experiments. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Fluorescence spectrum of isolated Y2SiO5:Pr 3+nanocrystal demonstrates the intense fluorescence from the high crystal field components of split 1D2 manifold of Pr 3+ as the result of a suppression of phonon-assisted relaxation under the phonon quantum confinement. The direct comparison of the data obtained for nano- and bulk Y2SiO5:Pr3+ crystals has revealed that the concentration threshold of luminescence quenching is strikingly low for nanocrystals. This effect is caused by uphill diffusion of doped ions and preferred Pr segregation at the nanocrystal surface layer that provides the relaxation of elastic tension arising due to the difference of ionic radii of Pr3+ and Y3+.

Little scientific work has been done concerning the prerequisites and limitations of swimming with or without fins whilst breath-holding to extreme limits. Apneic duration influences all competitive apnea disciplines, and can be prolonged by any means that increase gas storage or tolerance to asphyxia, or reduce metabolic rate, as reviewed in the first article. For horizontal underwater distance swimming, the main challenge is to restrict metabolism despite the work, and to direct blood flow only to areas where demand is greatest, to allow sustained function. Here, work economy, local tissue energy and oxygen stores and the anaerobic capacity of the muscles are key components. Improvements in swimming techniques and, especially in swimming with fins, equipment have already contributed to enhanced performance and may do so further. High lactate levels observed after dynamic competition dives suggest a high anaerobic component, and muscle hypoxia could ultimately limit muscle work and swimming distance. However, the frequency of syncope, especially in swimming without fins, suggests that cerebral oxygenation may often be compromised before this occurs. In these pool disciplines, safety is high and the dive can be interrupted by the competitor or safety diver within seconds. The safety routines in place during pool competitions are described.","Breath-hold diving; Cardiovascular; Exercise; Hypoxia; Physiology; Respiratory; Review article; Safety","lactic acid; myoglobin; anaerobic capacity; anaerobic metabolism; apnea; asphyxia; blood flow; brain oxygen tension; breath holding; diet restriction; diving; dynamic exercise; eating; fitness; human; manual labor; metabolic rate; performance; prediction; psychological aspect; review; swimming pool; syncope; tissue oxygenation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951862141

The advantages of biodiesel as diesel fuel are its portability, ready avail- ability, renewability, higher combustion efficiency, non-toxicity, higher flash point, and lower sulfur and aromatic content, higher cetane number, and higher biodegradability. The major disadvantages of biodiesel are its higher viscosity, lower energy content, higher cloud point and pour point, higher nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, lower engine speed and power, injector cok- ing, engine compatibility, high price, and greater engine wear. The technical disadvantages of biodiesel/fossil diesel blends include problems with fuel freezing in cold weather, reduced energy density, and degradation of fuel under storage for prolonged periods. The sources of biodiesel are vegetable oils and fats. The direct use of vegetable oils and/or oil blends is generally considered to be unsatisfactory and impractical for both direct injection and indirect type diesel engines because of their high viscosities and low volatilities injector coking and trumpet formation on the injectors, higher level of carbon deposits, oil ring sticking, and thickening and gelling of the engine lubricant oil, acid composition. Biodiesel is obtained by transesterifying triglycerides with methanol. A popular variation of the batch transesterification process which needs high alcohol/acid ratio (several separation problems and high corrosivity and toxicity) is the use of continuous stirred tank reactors in series. This continuous process is heterogeneous and is based on reactive distil- lation. The key factor is the selection of the right and effective solid catalyst which leads to reduction of energy consumption and investments at all. © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Biodiesel; Biofuels; Combustion; Diesel engine; Emissions; Fatty acid methyl ester (fame); Greenhouse gas emissions; Heavy vehicles; Process design; Reaction distillation; Renewable energy sources (res); Transesterification; Triglycerides; Vegetable oil","Diesel engine emissions; Emissions; Fatty acid methyl ester; Heavy vehicle; Heavy vehicles; Reaction distillation; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy sources (res); Acids; Automobile parts and equipment; Batch reactors; Biodegradation; Chemical analysis; Cold weather problems; Combustion; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Distillation; Engines; Esterification; Esters; Fatty acids; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Investments; Jet pumps; Leakage (fluid); Lubricating oils; Methanol; Natural resources; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Process design; Renewable energy resources; Smoke; Sulfur; Toxicity; Transesterification; Vegetable oils; Viscosity; Biodiesel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951124529

This work mainly targets reducing the energy consumption of this class of devices. We derive the operation modes of a MEMS-based storage device and systemically devise a policy in each mode for energy saving. Three types of policies are presented: power management, shutdown, and data-layout policy. Combined, these policies reduce the total energy consumed by a MEMS-based storage device. A MEMS-based storage device that enforces these policies comes close to Flash with respect to energy consumption and response time.

Mice deficient for adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL-ko) exhi bit defective lipolysis and accumulate TG in adipose tissue and muscle, suggesting that ATGL deficiency affects energy availability and substrate utilization in working muscle. In this study, we investigated the effect of moderate treadmill exercise on blood energy metabolites and liver glycogen stores in mice lacking ATGL. Because ATGL-ko mice exhibit massive accumulation of TG in the heart and cardiomyopathy, we also investigated a mouse model lacking ATGL in all tissues except cardiac muscle (ATGL-ko/CM). In contrast to ATGL-ko mice, these mice did not accumulate TG in the heart and had normal life expectancy. Exercise experiments revealed that ATGL-ko and ATGL-ko/CM mice are unable to increase circulating FA levels during exercise. The reduced availability of FA for energy conversion led to rapid depletion of liver glycogen stores and hypoglycemia. Together, our studies suggest that ATGL-ko mice cannot adjust circulating FA levels to the increased energy requirements of the working muscle, resulting in an increased use of carbohydrates for energy conversion. Thus, ATGL activity is required for proper energy supply of the skeletal muscle during exercise.

The composites, including CNTs/oxide and CNTs/polymer, were further discussed to enhance the supercapacitance and keep the stability of the supercapacitor by optimally engineering the composition, particle size, and coverage. © The Author(s) 2009.","Carbon nanotubes; Oxide/nanotube composite; Polymer/nanotube composite; Supercapacitor","Electrical energy; Functionalizations; Higher energy density; Long-term operation; Low level; Oxide/nanotube composite; Physical and chemical properties; Power sources; Super capacitor; Capacitors; Chemical properties; Electronics industry; Heating; Carbon nanotubes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950516439

Both processes have in common that the biomass feedstock is densified to reduce storage space and transport costs. A comfortable, more stable and cleaner intermediate energy carrier is obtained, which is much more uniform and well defined. In this review, the principles of fast pyrolysis are discussed, and the main technologies reviewed (demo scale: fluid bed, rotating cone and vacuum pyrolysis; pilot plant: ablative and twin screw pyrolysis). Possible product applications are discussed in relation to the bio-oil properties. General mass and energy balance are provided as well, together with some remarks on the economics. Challenges for the coming years are (1) improvement of the reliability of pyrolysis reactors and processes; (2) the demonstration of the oil's utilization in boilers, engines and turbines; and (3) the development of technologies for the production of chemicals and biofuels from pyrolysis oils. One important conclusion in relation to biofuel production is that the type of oxygen functionalities (viz. as an alcohol, ketone, aldehyde, ether, or ester) in the oil should be controlled, rather then merely focusing on a reduction of just the oxygen content itself. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Bio-oil; Biomass; Pyrolysis; Review; Technology","Bio oil; Biofuel production; Biomass feedstock; Biomass pyrolysis; Fast pyrolysis; Fluid-beds; Intermediate energies; Mass and energy balance; Oxygen content; Product applications; Pyrolysis oil; Pyrolysis reactor; Rotating cones; Slow pyrolysis; Storage spaces; Technology development; Transport costs; Twin screw; Vacuum pyrolysis; Aldehydes; Biofuels; Biomass; Charcoal; Chemical reactors; Cost reduction; Esters; Ethers; Fluidization; Ketones; Oxygen; Pilot plants; Technological forecasting; Technology; Thermogravimetric analysis; Pyrolysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950433166

Triolein, a triacylglyceride (TAG) of oleic acid, is an unsaturated fat, present in natural oils such as olive oil. As a basic food component and an energy storage molecule, it has considerable importance for food and fuel industries. To generate pressure in the experiment, we used a high-pressure cylindrical chamber with sapphire windows, presented in (R.M. Siegoczynski, R. Kociesza, D.B. Tefelski, and A. Kos, Molecular collapse - modification of the liquid structure induced by pressure in oleic acid, High Press. Res. 29 (2009), pp. 61-66). Pressure up to 750MPa was applied. A Raman spectrometer in macro-configuration was employed. Raman spectroscopy provides information on changes of vibrational modes related to structural changes of triolein under pressure. Interesting changes in the triglyceride C-H stretching region at 2650-3100cm-1 were observed under high-pressures. Changes were also observed in the ester carbonyl (C= O) stretching region 1700-1780cm-1 and the C-C stretching region at 1050-1150cm-1. The overall luminescence of the sample decreased under pressure, making it possible to set longer spectrum acquisition time and obtain more details of the spectrum. The registered changes suggest that the high-pressure solid phase of triolein is organized as -polymorphic, as was reported in (C. Akita, T. Kawaguchi, and F. Kaneko, Structural study on polymorphism of cis-unsaturated triacylglycerol: Triolein, J. Phys. Chem. B 110 (2006), pp. 4346-4353; E. Da Silva and D. Rousseau, Molecular order and thermodynamics of the solid-liquid transition in triglycerides via Raman spectroscopy, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 10 (2008), pp. 4606-4613) (with temperature-induced phase transitions). The research has shown that Raman spectroscopy in TAGs under pressure reveals useful information about its structural changes.","High pressure; Phase transitions; Raman spectroscopy; Triacylglycerides","Acquisition time; Cylindrical chambers; Energy-storage molecule; Ester carbonyl; Food components; High pressure; High pressure Raman; High-pressure phase transitions; High-pressure solids; Liquid structures; Molecular orders; Natural oil; Olive oil; Raman spectrometers; Sapphire windows; Solid-liquid transition; Stretching region; Structural change; Structural studies; Temperature-induced phase transitions; Triacyl glyceride; Triacylglycerols; Triolein; Vibrational modes; Acids; Esters; Food storage; Fuel storage; Glycerol; Liquids; Oleic acid; Raman scattering; Raman spectroscopy; Sapphire; Vegetable oils; Phase transitions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950166031

We summarize the comprehensive research that has been conducted there since 1931. Several conspicuous results derived since the 1960s have been reported, emerging from the study of magma sources, eruptions, earthquakes, deformation, and the deep structure for the KGV. Our discussion of these subjects incorporates the data of physical volcanology relating to the mechanism of volcanic activity and data from petrology as to magma generation. The following five parts can be distinguished in the KGV plumbing system and the associated geophysical model: the source of energy and material at the top of the Pacific Benioff zone at a depth of about 160 km, the region of magma ascent in the asthenosphere, the region of magma storage in the crust-mantle layer at depths of 40-25 km, magma chambers and channelways in the crust, and the bases of volcanic edifices. We discuss and explain the properties of and the relationships between these parts and the mechanisms of volcanic activity and of the KGV plumbing system as they exist today.

The experiments were complemented by calculations of stationary points on the triplet hypersurface of the system. The scattering data snowed that the reaction proceeds by the formation of two intermediate complexes having different lifetimes: a long-lived statistical intermediate and a short-lived complex (mean lifetime about one period of an average rotation) with more energy in translation than the statistical complex. Comparison with theoretical calculations suggests that the long-lived complex leads the CDND+ isomer of the product ion, whereas the short-lived complex leads prevailingly to the CD2N- isomer. The product DCN+ results from further decomposition of the primary product D2CN-, whereas CD3- is formed both by a hydride-ion transfer and a long-lived complex decomposition. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Collision energies; Crossed beams; Hydride ion transfer; Hypersurface; Intermediate complex; Mean lifetime; Scattering data; Stationary points; Theoretical calculations; Theoretical study; Isomers; Reaction intermediates; Data storage equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77249121204

These batteries are cheaper than Li-ion cells and have a comparable specific energy (in watthours per kilogram), but one important limitation is their poor specific power (in watts per kilogram). The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate experimentally that the combination of ZEBRA batteries and ultracapacitors (UCAPs) can solve the lack of specific power, allowing an excellent performance in both acceleration and regenerative braking in an EV. The UCAP system was connected to the ZEBRA battery and to the traction inverter through a buckboost-type dcdc converter, which manages the energy flow with the help of DSP controllers. The vehicle uses a brushless dc motor with a nominal power of 32 kW and a peak power of 53 kW. The control system measures and stores the following parameters: battery voltage, car speed to adjust the energy stored in the UCAPs, instantaneous currents in both terminals (battery and UCAPs), and present voltage of the UCAP. The increase in range with UCAPs results in more than 16% in city tests, where the application of this type of vehicle is being oriented. The results also show that this alternative is cheaper than Li-ion powered electric cars. © 2006 IEEE.","Energy management; Energy storage; Road vehicle electric propulsion","Battery voltages; Buck-boost; Chloride batteries; DSP controller; Electric cars; Energy flow; Excellent performance; Instantaneous current; Li-Ion cells; Peak power; Regenerative braking; Road vehicle electric propulsion; Specific energy; Specific power; Ultracapacitors; Automobiles; Brushless DC motors; Capacitors; Chlorine compounds; DC motors; Electric propulsion; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Flywheels; Land vehicle propulsion; Lithium batteries; Roads and streets; Secondary batteries; Highway administration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76849086630

Syngas produced by gasification can be decarbonised using chemical looping methods in which an oxygen carrier (usually a metallic oxide) is recycled between the syngas oxidation reactor (fuel reactor) and the chemical agent oxidation reactor (steam reactor). In this way, the resulted carbon dioxide is inherently separated from the other products of combustion and the syngas energy is transferred to an almost pure hydrogen stream suitable to be used not only for power generation but also for transport sector (PEM fuel cells). This paper evaluates in details a chemical looping system, using iron oxides as an oxygen carrier, in conjunction with a co-gasification process of coal and biomass with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). The paper assesses from technical point of view the potential application of chemical looping technique for gasification process to generate decarbonised energy vectors (power, hydrogen). Investigated plant concepts with syngas based chemical looping method evaluated in the paper will produce a flexible ratio of power and hydrogen in the range of 400 MW net electricity and 0-200 MW hydrogen. The paper presents in details the plant concept and the methodology used to evaluate the plant performances using critical design factors like: gasifier feeding system (slurry feed vs. transport gas), selection of gasification reactor, heat and power integration analysis, potential ways to increase the overall plant energy efficiency (e.g. integration of air separation unit with gas turbine compressor, steam integration of chemical looping unit into the combined cycle), hydrogen and electricity flexibility analysis, hydrogen and carbon dioxide quality specifications considering the use of hydrogen in transport sector (fuel cells) and carbon dioxide storage in geological formation or using for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). © 2010 Professor T.

The bismuth oxide in MTA has been reported to have a deleterious effect on the physical and chemical properties of the hydrated material. This study aimed to investigate the hydration mechanism of calcium silicate cement loaded with different radiopacifiers for use as a root-end filling material. Methods: Calcium silicate cement loaded with barium sulfate, gold, or silver/tin alloy was hydrated, and paste microstructure was assessed after 30 days. In addition, atomic ratio plots of Al/Ca versus Si/Ca and S/Ca and Al/Ca were drawn, and X-ray energy dispersive analysis of the hydration products was performed to assess for inclusion of heavy metals. The leachate produced from the cements after storage of the cements in water for 28 days and the leaching of the radiopacifiers in an alkaline solution was assessed by using inductively coupled plasma. Results: The hydrated calcium silicate cement was composed of calcium silicate hydrate, calcium hydroxide, ettringite, and monosulfate. Unhydrated cement particles were few. No heavy metals were detected in the calcium silicate hydrate except for the bismuth in MTA. Calcium was leached out early in large quantities that reduced with time. The barium and bismuth were leached in increasing amounts. Copper was the most soluble in alkaline solution followed by bismuth and barium in smaller amounts. Conclusions: The bismuth oxide can be replaced by other radiopacifiers that do not affect the hydration mechanism of the resultant material. © 2010 American Association of Endodontists.","Calcium silicate cements; hydration; radiopacifiers; root-end filling materials","aluminum derivative; barium sulfate; bismuth; bismuth oxide; calcium derivative; contrast medium; dental alloy; gold; mineral trioxide aggregate; oxide; root canal filling material; silicate; silver derivative; tooth cement; article; chemistry; drug combination; human; radiography; tooth radiography; tooth root; wettability; Aluminum Compounds; Barium Sulfate; Bismuth; Calcium Compounds; Contrast Media; Dental Alloys; Dental Cements; Drug Combinations; Gold; Humans; Oxides; Radiography, Dental; Root Canal Filling Materials; Silicates; Silver Compounds; Tooth Apex; Wettability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76649097307

In this study we evaluate and compare national approaches towards the development of CCS in the United States, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands, and Australia. The analysis is done by applying the functions of innovation systems approach. This approach posits that new technology is developed, demonstrated and deployed in the context of a technological innovation system. The performance assessment of the CCS innovation system shows that the extensive knowledge base and knowledge networks, which have been accumulated over the past years, have not yet been utilized by entrepreneurs to explore the market for integrated CCS concepts linked to power generation. This indicates that the build-up of the innovation system has entered a critical phase that is decisive for a further thriving development of CCS. In order to move the CCS innovation system through this present difficult episode and deploy more advanced CCS concepts at a larger scale; it is necessary to direct policy initiatives at the identified weak system functions, i.e. entrepreneurial activity, market creation and the mobilization of resources. Moreover, in some specific countries it is needed to provide more regulatory guidance and improve the legitimacy for the technology. We discuss how policy makers and technology managers can use these insights to develop a coherent policy strategy that would accelerate the deployment of CCS. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is carried out with the aid of a techno-economic model (with the objective to minimize the total system cost) including a detailed description of the present stationary European electricity supply system (power plants) and potential CO2 storage sites as obtained from the Chalmers Energy Infrastructure databases. The ability of different EU Member States and regions to facilitate and to benefit from CCS will most likely depend on local conditions in terms of current energy mix, fuel supply chains and distance to suitable storage locations. Special emphasis is therefore put on analyzing turn-over in capital stock of the existing power plant infrastructure, timing of investments and the infrastructural implications of large scale introduction of CCS on a regional perspective. The paper discusses the role of and the requirements on CCS for meeting strict CO2 emission reduction targets of 85% reduction from power generation by 2050 relative 1990 emissions in three different scenarios. All analysed scenarios apply the same cap on CO2 emissions. The first scenario includes a continued growth in electricity demand (as presented in EU base-line projections). The second scenario includes stated EU targets for 2020 and indicative targets for 2050 with respect to increased energy efficiency, and thus, considers a lower growth in electricity demand compared to the base-line. The third scenario includes EU targets (to 2020 and indicative targets to 2050) on energy efficiency, equal to the second scenario, and EU targets of electricity from renewables. The results show that it is possible for the European electricity generation system to meet an 85% CO2 reduction target by 2050 with a potentially large contribution from CCS. Up to 50% of the electricity generation will come from plants with CCS with a peak capture estimated to 1.8 GtCO2 per year and cumulative CO2 capture of about 39 GtCO2 between 2020 and 2050 (it is assumed that CCS will be commercially available from 2020). As expected, countries which currently have high carbon intensity and which are located nearby suitable storage sites will benefit the most from CCS implementation. Hence, the results suggest that Italy has the largest demand for CCS with annual peak capture at around 0.5 GtCO2 in the base-line scenario. The model results indicate a steep ramp-up of CCS post-2020, which imposes challenges for timely investments in corresponding CCS infrastructure including transportation and storage. A continued growth in electricity demand can lead to demand for CCS to such extent (in the base-line capacity build up is about 300 GW of CCS between 2020 and 2050) that the actual penetration level could be limited by fuel markets and power industries' ability to supply fuel and CCS power plants. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Consistent consumption of diets high in saturated fat or simple carbohydrates combined with low physical activity are the main causes of obesity and its comorbidities. However, the contribution of dietary protein and, in particular, the contribution due to the type of dietary protein, to the process of obesity and its metabolic consequences are less well-understood. In this review, we showed that the type of dietary protein has a significant contribution to the process of lipotoxicity through the modulation of insulin secretion and the regulation of adipocyte metabolic function. Consumption of soy protein stimulates insulin secretion to a lower extent than casein despite the fact that both are high-quality proteins. The amino acid profiles of soy protein and its isoflavones are responsible for the reduced insulin secretion. Also, soy protein increases insulin sensitivity, whereas casein has the opposite effect. Consequently, soy protein reduces SREBP-1 expression in the liver leading to low accumulation of hepatic triglycerides, despite the consumption of a high-fat diet. Furthermore, soy protein reduces adipocyte hypertrophy, hyperleptinemia, and free fatty acid concentration. Thus, the influx of FA into the liver decreases, and hepatic oxidation of FA increases. These metabolic changes result in a decrease in lipid depots and ceramide which reduce hepatic lipotoxicity, whereas casein produces the opposite effect.

Reduced mitochondrial capacity will contribute to the accumulation of lipid intermediates, desensitizing insulin signaling and leading to insulin resistance. Why mitochondrial function is reduced in the (pre-)diabetic state is, however, so far unknown. Although it is tempting to suggest that skeletal muscle insulin resistance may result from an inherited or acquired reduction in mitochondrial function in the pre-diabetic state, it cannot be excluded that mitochondrial dysfunction may in fact be the consequence of the insulin-resistant/diabetic state. Lipotoxicity, the deleterious effects of accumulating fatty acids in skeletal muscle cells, may lie at the basis of mitochondrial dysfunction: next to producing energy, mitochondria are also the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Fatty acids accumulating in the vicinity of mitochondria are vulnerable to ROS-induced lipid peroxidation. Subsequently, these lipid peroxides could have lipotoxic effects on mtDNA, RNA and proteins of the mitochondrial machinery, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Indeed, increased lipid peroxidation has been reported in insulin resistant skeletal muscle and the mitochondrial uncoupling protein-3, which has been suggested to prevent lipid-induced mitochondrial damage, is reduced in subjects with an impaired glucose tolerance and in type 2 diabetic patients. These findings support the hypothesis that fat accumulation in skeletal muscle may precede the reduction in mitochondrial function that is observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The variability of wind power production was handled by varying the hydropower production and the production on CHP plants using biomass, by power transmission, by varying the heat production in heat pumps and electric heat boilers, and by varying the production of hydrogen in electrolysis plants in combination with hydrogen storage. Investment in hydrogen storage capacity corresponded to 1.2% of annual wind power production in the scenarios without a hydrogen demand from the transport sector, and approximately 4% in the scenarios with a hydrogen demand from the transport sector. Even the scenarios without a demand for hydrogen from the transport sector saw investments in hydrogen storage due to the need for flexibility provided by the ability to store hydrogen.

In this paper, an empirical model has been used to estimate the emissions to the environment from landfilling of individual waste fractions. By means of the LCA-model EASEWASTE, the emissions estimated have been used to quantify how much of the overall impact potential for each impact category is to be attributed to the individual waste fractions. Impact potentials are estimated for 1 tonne of mixed waste disposed off in a conventional landfill with bottom liner, leachate collection and treatment and gas collection and utilization for electricity generation. All the environmental aspects are accounted for 100 years after disposal and several impact categories have been considered, including standard categories, toxicity-related categories and groundwater contamination. Amongst the standard and toxicity-related categories, the highest potential impact is estimated for human toxicity via soil (HTs; 12 mPE/tonne). This is mostly caused by leaching of heavy metals from ashes (e.g. residues from roads cleaning and vacuum cleaning bags), batteries, paper and metals. On the other hand, substantial net environmental savings are estimated for the categories Global Warming (GW; -31 mPE/tonne) and Eco-Toxicity in water chronic (ETwc; -53 mPE/tonne). These savings are mostly determined by the waste fractions characterized by a high content of biogenic carbon (paper, organics, other combustible waste). These savings are due to emissions from energy generation avoided by landfill gas utilization, and by the storage of biogenic carbon in the landfill due to incomplete waste degradation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Does the new version supersede the previous version?: No. Nature of problem: Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a technique for epitaxial growth via the interaction of one or several molecular or atomic beams that occurs on a surface of a heated crystalline substrate. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) is an important in situ analysis technique, which is capable of giving quantitative information about the growth process of thin films and its control. The analysis of RHEED intensity oscillations has two purposes. One is to control the film growth, and the other is to understand the mechanism of the film growth using the MBE through the analysis of surface morphology as a function of time. Such control allows the development of structures where the electrons can be confined in space, giving quantum wells or even quantum dots. Such layers are now a critical part of 3 many modern semiconductor devices, semiconductor lasers, light-emitting diodes and new devices for the magnetic storage industry. Solution method: The present paper reports a practical and pragmatic approach for MDD technology [1] that has been used during design of the Growth09 program. Growth09 is a numerical model that uses multithreaded and partially nested transactions for simulation of epitaxial growth of thin films. Reasons for new version: Responding to user feedback the program has been upgraded to a standard that allows a slave process, carrying out computations of the RHEED intensities for a disordered surface, to be run. Also, functionality and documentation of the program have been improved. Summary of revisions:1.The MDD technology has been used to design a computer model that allows the user to carry out numerical calculations layers coverage during the growth of thin epitaxial films, surface roughness, and the RHEED intensities for a disordered surface. This computer model can be applied to interpret the experimental data in real time [2].2.The logical structure of the Platform-Specific Model of the Growth06_v2 program has been modified according to the scheme shown in Fig. 1*. The class diagram in Fig. 1* is a static view of the main platform-specific elements of the Growth09 application architecture. Fig. 2* provides a dynamic view by showing the creation and destruction simplistic sequence diagram. Fig. 3* presents the Growth09 use case model.3.As can be seen in Figs. 1-3* the Growth09 has been designed as a master program for the slave RHEED1DProcess (see A. Daniluk, Model-Driven Development for scientific computing. Computations of RHEED intensities for a disordered surface. Part I).4.The slave RHEED1DProcess can be run as separate thread of the Growth09. Fig. 4* depicts the Platform-Specific Model for the development elements of the new distribution. *The figures mentioned can be downloaded, see ""Supplementary material"" below. Unusual features: The program is distributed in the form of main project Growth09.dproj, with associated files, and should be compiled using Embarcadero RAD Studio 2010 along with Together visual modelling platform. The program should be compiled with English/USA regional and language options. Additional comments: This version of the GROWTH program is designed to run in conjunction with the RHEED1DProcess (ADUY_v4_0) program. It does not replace the previous, stand alone, GROWTH06-v2 (ADVL_v2_1) version. Running time: The typical running time is machine and user-parameters dependent.

By activating the thermal mass of the building using pipes embedded in the floor, peak loads can be reduced. On-site measurements were performed to obtain the required cooling power of an entire building as well as individual zones. Beside this, the internal climate conditions of rooms and surface temperatures of the TABS were measured. The measured data were used to analyze the predictive performance of a simulation model. In order to acquire general guidelines for the required cooling capacity of a standard office building, simulations of an entire building were used to determine the impact of variable internal heat gains and different sized windows. The required cooling capacity was compared to the cooling capacity of a system without energy buffering (e.g. chilled ceiling panels). It was found that reductions up to 50% of the cooling capacity for a chiller can be achieved using TABS.

The inverse additive perturbation model is applied to represent system uncertainties such as several generating and loading conditions, variation of system parameters, wind power fluctuations, etc. The structure of active and reactive power controllers of SMES is the first-order lead-lag compensator. To tune the controller parameters, the optimization problem is formulated based on the enhancement of additive stability margin. The genetic algorithm is used to solve the problem and achieve the controller parameters.

WMSNs introduce several new research challenges, mainly related to mechanisms to deliver application-level Quality-of-Service (e.g., latency minimization). Such issues have almost completely been ignored in traditional WSNs, where the research focused on energy consumption minimization. Towards achieving this goal, the technique of cooperative caching multimedia content in sensor nodes can efficiently address the resource constraints, the variable channel capacity and the in-network processing challenges associated with WMSNs. The technological advances in gigabyte-storage flash memories make sensor caching to be the ideal solution for latency minimization. Though, with caching comes the issue of maintaining the freshness of cached contents. This article proposes a new cache consistency and replacement policy, called NICC, to address the cache consistency issues in a WMSN. The proposed policies recognize and exploit the mediator nodes that relay on the most ""central"" points in the sensor network so that they can forward messages with small latency. With the utilization of mediator nodes that lie between the source node and cache nodes, both push-based and pull-based strategies can be applied in order to minimize the query latency and the communication overhead. Simulation results attest that NICC outperforms the state-of-the-art cache consistency policy for MANETs. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Photovoltaics (PV) and small wind turbines (WTs) can be install on buildings, in case of sufficient wind potential, providing the building with electricity. PVs can be combined with thermal collectors to form the hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) systems. The PVs (or the PV/Ts) and WT subsystems can supplement each other to cover building electrical load. In case of using PV/T collectors, the surplus of electricity, if not used or stored in batteries, can increase the temperature of the thermal storage tank of the solar thermal unit. The description of the experimental set-up of the suggested PV/T/WT system and experimental results are presented. In PV/T/WT systems the output from the solar part depends on the sunshine time and the output of the wind turbine part depends on the wind speed and is obtained any time of day or night. The use of the three subsystems can cover a great part of building energy load, contributing to conventional energy saving and environment protection. The PV/T/WT systems are considered suitable in rural and remote areas with electricity supply from stand-alone units or mini-grid connection.

The lifetime of dark excitons are determined by spin-flip processes that transfer dark excitons into radiative bright excitons. We employ time-resolved spontaneous emission measurements in a modified local density of optical states to unambiguously record the spin-flip rate. Pronounced variations in the spin-flip rate with the quantum dot emission energy are observed demonstrating that the exciton storage time can be extended by controlling the quantum dot size. The energy dependence is compared to a recent model from the literature, in which the spin flip is due to the combined action of short-range exchange interaction and acoustic phonons. We furthermore observe a pronounced enhancement of the spin-flip rate close to semiconductor-air interfaces, which illustrates the important role of interfaces for quantum dot based nanophotonic structures. © 2010 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954876427

Difficulty in determining thermocline thickness arises for the case of discrete temperature data, since the profile formed could not be used to estimate the thermocline thickness. This paper discusses a practical method for formulation of thermocline thickness of stratified thermal energy storage. Curve fitting by iterative method was adopted to identify the functions which could represent the S-curve of temperature distribution. Based on the functions, thermocline thickness was formulated using functional relationship of temperature profile. Results identified two functions which could represent S-curve of temperature distribution, namely sigmoid dose response (SDR) and four parameter sigmoid (FPS) functions. Both functions were observed to well fit the temperature distributions having coefficient determination more than 0.99. Based on evaluations the formulations were capable to be utilized for evaluation of thermocline thickness of the stratified TES.

Various mechanisms, such as the inherently chiral metallic cluster core, the dissymmetric field effect, and the chiral footprint model, have been proposed as possible explanations of the nonzero circular dichroism (CD) spectra found for these nanoscale materials. This communication presents a first-principles theoretical study of the CD spectrum of the [Au25(SR)18]- cluster that was undertaken to gain insight into the physicochemical origin of the optical activity measured for the glutathione-protected [Au 25(SG)18]- cluster. The calculated CD spectrum of the cysteine-protected cluster, with Rcys = C βH2-CαH(NH2)-COOH, shows good agreement with the experimental data obtained for the glutathione-protected cluster. Analysis of the calculated CD spectra of the peculiar two-shell metallic core and the two distinct thiolate-Au binding modes existing in the [Au25(SRcys)18]- cluster showed that the weak CD signal due to the slight distortion of cluster core is enhanced by the dissymmetric location of the ligands forming the Au-S binding modes. This result shows that the mechanisms proposed to explain the optical activity of chiral-ligand-protected metallic clusters cannot be differentiated but are acting concurrently. It is also predicted that the CD line shape should be highly sensitive to the orientation of the thiolate ligands forming the cluster protecting layer and to the stability of the thiolate-Au binding modes. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Binding modes; CD signals; CD spectra; Chiral molecule; Circular dichroism spectra; Cluster cores; Experimental data; Field effects; First-principles; Gain insight; Glutathiones; Highly sensitive; Line shape; Metallic clusters; Metallic cores; Metallic nanoclusters; Nano-scale materials; Optical activity; Protecting layer; Protecting units; Theoretical study; Thiolate ligands; Thiolates; Binding energy; Data storage equipment; Dichroism; Gold; Optical materials; Ligands; ligand; metal derivative; nanoparticle; article; chirality; circular dichroism; density functional theory; nanoanalysis; optical rotation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76149108433

The amplitude(s) is(are) calculated in the Regge approach. We compare our results with measured cross sections for the Intersecting Storage Ring and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory experiments. We make predictions for future experiments at the anti-Proton ANnihilation at DArmstadt (PANDA), Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, Tevatron, and LHC energies. Differential distributions in invariant two-pion mass, pion rapidities and transverse momenta of pions are presented. The two-dimensional distribution in (yπ+,yπ-) is particularly interesting. The higher the incident energy, the higher preference for the same-hemisphere emission of pions. The processes considered constitute a sizeable contribution to the total nucleon-nucleon cross section as well as to pion inclusive cross section. © 2010 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77749330733

This simplification, proposed by Arvanitidis and Rosing (IEEE Trans Power Appar Syst 89(2):319-325, 1970), imputes a potential energy equivalent reservoir with energy inflows and outflows. The hydroelectric system is also modelled for power maximization considering individual reservoir characteristics without simplifications. Both optimization models employed MINOS package for solution of the non-linear programming problems. A comparison between total optimized power generation over the planning horizon by the two methods shows that the equivalent reservoir is capable of producing satisfactory power estimates with less than 6% underestimation. The generation and total reservoir storage trajectories along the planning horizon obtained by equivalent reservoir method, however, presented significant discrepancies as compared to those found in the detailed modelling. This study is motivated by the fact that Brazilian generation system operations are based on the equivalent reservoir method as part of the power dispatch procedures.

Investments in energy storage mitigate the associated financial risks and allow for decoupling the timing of supply and delivery. This paper introduces a model of the optimal bidding strategy for a hybrid system of renewable power generation and energy storage. We formulate the problem as a continuous-state Markov decision process and present a solution based on approximate dynamic programming. We propose an algorithm that combines approximate policy iteration with Least Squares Policy Evaluation (LSPE) which is used to estimate the weights of a polynomial value function approximation. We find that the approximate policies produce significantly better results for the continuous state space than an optimal discrete policy obtained by linear programming. A numerical analysis of the response surface of rewards on model parameters reveals that supply uncertainty, imbalance costs and a negative correlation of market price and supplies are the main drivers for investments in energy storage. Supply and price autocorrelation, on the other hand, have a negative effect on the value of storage. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Approximate dynamic programming; Day-ahead market; Energy storage; Optimal bidding strategy; Renewable energies","Approximate dynamic programming; Continuous State Space; Day ahead market; Financial risks; Least Square; Market price; Markov Decision Processes; Model parameters; Negative correlation; Optimal bidding strategy; Policy evaluation; Policy iteration; Power producer; Price uncertainty; Renewable energies; Renewable power generation; Response surface; Supply and delivery; Supply uncertainty; Value function approximation; Approximation algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Electric power generation; Energy storage; Flywheels; Hybrid systems; Investments; Lead acid batteries; Least squares approximations; Linear programming; Markov processes; Optimization; Polynomial approximation; Renewable energy resources; Uncertainty analysis; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952360158

The vast majority of the work developed so far has focused on short-term horizons and may be viewed as successful approaches for systems whose operation is generally deterministic. In the case of price-maker hydro plants with significant storage capacity, however, the solution of the strategic bidding problem is more subtle. The reason is that hydro reservoirs allow the bidder to postpone energy production if future prices are expected to be higher than the current price. This demands the management of an energy-constrained resource and determines a time-coupling characteristic to the problem, implying that the bidding strategy should ideally take into account the following stages and consider the stochasticity of inflows. These aspects characterise the strategic bidding for price-maker hydro agents as a multi-stage stochastic programming problem, with significant computational challenges. The objective of this work is to present a new methodology for the strategic bidding problem of a price-maker hydropower-based company, taking into account several hydro plants, time-coupling and stochastic inflow scenarios. The proposed approach considers a deterministic residual demand curve and is based on stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP), which has been successfully applied to the least-cost hydrothermal scheduling problem. Since the technique requires the problem to be concave, a piecewise linear approximation of the expected future benefit function is proposed. The application of the methodology is exemplified with a real case study based on the hydrothermal system of El Salvador. © 2010 © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Bidding strategy; Competitive markets; Computational challenges; Coupling characteristic; El Salvador; Energy producers; Energy productions; Energy-constrained; Future benefits; Hydro generation; Hydro plants; Hydrothermal scheduling problems; Hydrothermal system; Latest development; Liberalisation; Multi-stage; Optimal allocation; Optimal bidding; Piecewise linear approximations; Power industry; Residual demand; Stochastic dual dynamic programming; Stochastic inflows; Stochasticity; Storage capacity; Strategic bidding; Costs; Optimization; Piecewise linear techniques; Stochastic systems; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953394380

Two main seasonal pulses of prey are available to herring: (1) the parent generation of C. finmarchicus, with peak abundance in March-April, which appear too early to cause the main increase in herring condition; and (2) the abundant offspring generation of C. finmarchicus, with peak abundance in June-July, too late to explain the main increase in body condition. However, a mechanistic model of ingestion rate, including both solar irradiance and prey abundance, predicted seasonal food intake in good accordance with observed herring body condition. This suggests that the seasonality in herring foraging and energy storage is closely linked to the return of longer days in spring, and less dependent on a match or mismatch with seasonal peaks in abundance of their zooplankton prey. Consequently, light related constraints on foraging may make visually searching predators at high latitudes resilient to changes and fluctuations in prey phenology and abundance, but vulnerable to changes in the light regime, such as water clarity. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Annual routine; Climate change; Encounter rate; Fish migration; Holling type II model; Lipid storage; Match-mismatch hypothesis; Pelagic ecology; Photoperiod; Predator-prey interactions","body condition; climate change; clupeoid; crustacean; food intake; ingestion rate; irradiance; light effect; lipid; migratory population; pelagic ecosystem; phenology; photoperiod; predator-prey interaction; seasonality; animal; article; ecosystem; feeding behavior; fish; light; photoperiodicity; physiology; plankton; population dynamics; season; Animals; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Fishes; Light; Photoperiod; Plankton; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Calanus finmarchicus; Clupea harengus; Clupeidae; Copepoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949303417

The effect of clay loading on the rheological and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites is systematically investigated. The intercalated nanocomposites showed a dependence of the properties on the amount of clay loading. Increasing the amount of clay resulted in an improvement in tensile strength and elongation at break. In addition the EVA/clay nanocomposites displayed an enhancement of both storage modulus, E′, and loss modulus, E″, at low frequencies. Addition of clay decreased the flow activation energy, thereby enhancing the polymer melt flow.

A variety of new applications with different service requirements demand fairness to the service provision and classification, and reliability in an end-to-end manner. High-priority packets are delivered within a hard time delay bound whereas improper power management in wireless networks can substantially degrade the throughput and increase the overall energy consumed. In this work a new scheme is being proposed and evaluated in real time using a state-based layered oriented architecture for energy conservation (EC). The proposed scheme uses the node's self-tuning scheme, where each node is assigned with a dissimilar sleep and wake time, based on traffic that is destined for each node. This approach is based on stream's characteristics with respect to different caching behavioral and storage- capacity characteristics, and considers a model concerning the layered connectivity characteristics for enabling the EC mechanism. EC characteristics are modeled and through the designed tiered architecture the estimated metrics of the scheme can be bounded and tuned into certain regulated values. The real-time evaluation results were extracted by using dynamically moving and statically located sensor nodes. A performance comparison is done with respect to different data traffic priority classifications following a real-time asymmetrical transmission channel. Results have shown the scheme's efficiency in conserving energy while the topology configuration changes with time.

Four different weights - including medium, large, extra large and jumbo - were used. Physical properties of chicken egg - such as size, geometric mean diameter, sphericity, volume, surface area, packaging coefficient of eggs, shape index, shell thickness and static coefficient of friction on various surfaces - were determined. The mechanical properties of chicken egg to compression as effected by egg weight were determined in terms of average rupture force, specific deformation and rupture energy along x- and z-axes at different compression speeds. The length, width, geometric mean diameter, unit mass, surface area, egg volume and packaging coefficient increased as the egg weight increased. The average shape index and shell thickness values ranged from 78.37 to 79.56, and 0.400 to 0.387 mm for the eggs tested, respectively. The static coefficients of friction on various surfaces, namely, glass, plywood, galvanized metal, rubber and chipboard, increased linearly with increasing egg weight tested. The rubber surface presented the maximum friction followed by plywood, chipboard, galvanized metal and glass. The force required to initiate egg rupture on the z-axis decreased as egg weight increased from medium to jumbo. The specific deformation and rupture energy values observed for chicken eggs compressed along the z-axis were higher than the values obtained when testing eggs in the x-back and x-front orientations. The results indicated that the rupture force along all three axes is highly dependent on the egg weight over the compression speed ranges investigated. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The mechanical and physical properties of animal and plant materials are necessary considerations in the design and effective utilization of the equipment used in the transportation, processing, packaging and storage of agricultural products. Several factors - such as age, breed and weight of chicken - influence the size of an egg. Eggs are available in different sizes according to weight, including peewee, small, medium, large, extra large and jumbo. Even a slight shift in egg weight influences size classification which is one of the factors considered when eggs are priced. Egg size and the eggshell thickness are strongly related to each other. A chicken egg is a packaged food and an important quality aspect of the packaged egg material is the mechanical strength of the eggshell. Eggshell quality depends on egg size and weight. Egg properties such as shape index and shell thickness affect the proportion of damaged eggs during handling and transport. Eggshell strength has been described using various variables such as thickness of eggshell, shell stiffness and rupture force. Eggshells must be strong enough to prevent cracking in order to preserve the embryo until hatching. Shell strength is necessary to prevent damage from handling and to preserve eggs during transport from farm to market. As egg weight increases during the production period, eggshell thickness and breaking strength usually decrease. The rupture force of chicken eggs depend on various egg properties such as egg specific gravity, egg mass, egg volume, egg surface area, egg thickness, shell weight and compression speed. For this reason, egg production, processing and packaging systems must be designed while taking these criteria into consideration such as physical properties of eggs and their resistance to damage through mechanical shock. © 2008, Blackwell Publishing.",,"Breaking strength; Coefficient of frictions; Coefficients of friction; Compression speed; Different sizes; Egg production; Egg size; Geometric mean; Mechanical and physical properties; Mechanical behavior; Mechanical shock; Mechanical strength; Packaged food; Packaging system; Plant material; Quality aspects; Rupture energy; Rupture forces; Shape indices; Shell strength; Shell thickness; Size classification; Specific gravity; Surface area; Three axes; Agricultural products; Computational fluid dynamics; Deformation; Friction; Galvanized metal; Galvanizing; Glass; Gravitation; Meats; Mechanical engineering; Packaging; Packaging materials; Particle board; Physical properties; Plywood; Rubber; Shells (structures); Surface chemistry; Surfaces; Tools; Tribology; Weighing; Mechanical properties; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76349091145

Harbour porpoises and Commerson's dolphins terminated growth and development of all investigated traits sooner than white-beaked dolphins, leading to lesser degrees of fusion of skeletal elements and less postnatal allometric development. The latter occurred even though shape in the two paedomorphic species developed at twice the rate relative to the size of white-beaked dolphins. These observations imply that progenetic evolution has occurred convergently in phocoenid and Cephalorhynchus ancestors. The truncated ontogenies allow sexual maturity to be attained earlier and provide a greater reproductive potential. Both species inhabit similar temperate productive habitats and, hence, ecological factors are proposed to have supplied the selection pressures leading to progenesis. Constant prey availability must be a prerequisite for the observed phenomena because frequent food-intake is necessitated by the limited capacity for energy storage and high heat-loss entailed by the resulting small body sizes. Progenesis has rarely been proposed in mammal species. This may reflect rarity or that mammalian expressions of progenesis are less obvious. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.","Commerson's dolphin; Evolution; Habitat; Harbour porpoise; Life history; Ontogeny; Progenesis; Reproduction; White-beaked dolphin","allometry; body size; convergent evolution; food intake; life history trait; ontogeny; pedomorphosis; prey availability; reproductive potential; selection; sexual maturity; whale; Cephalorhynchus; Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus; Mammalia; Odontoceti; Phocoenidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75649128738

Our main sources of fructose are sucrose from beet or cane, high fructose corn syrup, fruits, and honey. Fructose has the same chemical formula as glucose (C6H 12O6), but its metabolism differs markedly from that of glucose due to its almost complete hepatic extraction and rapid hepatic conversion into glucose, glycogen, lactate, and fat. Fructose was initially thought to be advisable for patients with diabetes due to its low glycemic index. However, chronically high consumption of fructose in rodents leads to hepatic and extrahepatic insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and high blood pressure. The evidence is less compelling in humans, but high fructose intake has indeed been shown to cause dyslipidemia and to impair hepatic insulin sensitivity. Hepatic de novo lipogenesis and lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and hyperuricemia have all been proposed as mechanisms responsible for these adverse metabolic effects of fructose. Although there is compelling evidence that very high fructose intake can have deleterious metabolic effects in humans as in rodents, the role of fructose in the development of the current epidemic of metabolic disorders remains controversial. Epidemiological studies show growing evidence that consumption of sweetened beverages (containing either sucrose or a mixture of glucose and fructose) is associated with a high energy intake, increased body weight, and the occurrence of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. There is, however, no unequivocal evidence that fructose intake at moderate doses is directly related with adverse metabolic effects. There has also been much concern that consumption of free fructose, as provided in high fructose corn syrup, may cause more adverse effects than consumption of fructose consumed with sucrose. There is, however, no direct evidence for more serious metabolic consequences of high fructose corn syrup versus sucrose consumption.

RECENT FINDINGS: Both GLP-1 and GIP stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and are thus classified as incretins. Beyond glucose-dependent insulin secretion, the peptides have common actions on islet β cells, leading β-cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. However, the action of GLP-1 and GIP is not limited to the islet cells; they have regulatory functions in many organs. Recent evidence has suggested that GLP-1 has important beneficial effects in the cardiovascular system and central nervous system. GIP may play a role in promoting energy storage in humans, enhances bone formation via stimulation of osteoblast proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis and may play a role in central nervous system function.

A systematic design approach is proposed that enables the simultaneous consideration of synergies developed among numerous sub-systems within an integrated power generation system and the uncertainty involved in the system operation. The Stochastic Annealing optimization algorithm is utilized to handle the increased combinatorial complexity and to enable the consideration of different types of uncertainty in the performed optimization. A parallel adaptation of this algorithm is proposed to address the associated computational requirements through execution in a Grid computing environment. The proposed developments are implemented in a system that consists of photovoltaic panels, wind generators, accumulators, an electrolyzer, storage tanks, a compressor, a fuel cell and a diesel generator. Numerous design and operating parameters are considered as decision variables, while uncertain parameters are associated with weather fluctuations and operating efficiency of the employed sub-systems. The obtained results indicate robust performance under realizable system designs, in response to external or internal operating variations. © 2009 Professor T.

This particular SAHPS was developed within the EU project ENDOHOUSING, by predominantly using components and techniques that are available on the market. The analysis primarily focuses on system performance, with emphasis on Heat Pump (HP) and total system Seasonal Performance Factor (SPF), based on long-term and full-scale operation. Analysis shows that despite unfavourable building conditions, for low energy use and utilisation of a SAHPS, the system was successfully in full operation (for about 2 years) fulfilling heating requirements. Data processing of the series representing the full year period of 2007(February)-2008(February), presented a HP and total SAHPS performance of: SPFHP = 2.85 and SPFSAHPS = 2.09. The authors argue that with an optimised SAHPS control and operation strategy, additional use of circulation pumps and energy (electricity) could be vastly reduced, hence attaining a SPFSAHPS value that is in parity with the SPFHP. As the Nordic (Swedish) Endohousing SAHPS has not yet been properly optimised/designed and installed in an appropriate house, the SPFHP = 2.85 is considered satisfactory. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

When temperature decreases, the composition of membrane lipids (phospholipid fatty acids) is expected to become more unsaturated to be able to maintain homeoviscosity. Although different in function, storage lipids (triacylglycerol fatty acids) are expected to respond to temperature changes in a similar way. Age-specific differences, however, could influence this temperature response between different life stages. Here, we investigate if fatty acid composition of membrane and storage lipids responds similarly to temperature changes for two different life stages of Orchesella cincta. Juveniles and adults were cold acclimated (15 °C → 5 °C) for 28 days and then re-acclimated (5 °C → 15 °C) for another 28 days. We found adult membranes had a more unsaturated fatty acid composition than juveniles. Membrane lipids became more unsaturated during cold acclimation, and a reversed response occurred during warm acclimation. Membrane lipids, however, showed no warm acclimation, possibly due to the moderate temperature change. The ability to adjust storage lipid composition to moderate changes in ambient temperature may be an underestimated fitness component of temperature adaptation because fluidity of storage lipids permits accessibility of enzymes to energy reserves. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Adsorption energies of H atom and H2 molecule on Fe and Ti terminated (001) and (111) and FeTi (110) surfaces are calculated on high symmetry adsorption sites. It is shown that, top site is the most stable site for horizontal H2 molecule adsorption on (001) and (111) surfaces for both terminations. The most favorable site for H atom adsorption on these surfaces however, is the bridge site. In (110) surface, the 3-fold hollow site which is composed of a long Ti-Ti bridge and an Fe atom, (Ti-Ti)L-Fe, and again a 3-fold hollow site this time composed of a short Ti-Ti bridge and an Fe atom, (Ti-Ti)S-Fe, are the most stable sites for H2 and H adsorption, respectively. With the analysis of the above favorable adsorption sites, probable dissociation paths for H2 molecule over these surfaces are proposed. Activation energies of these dissociations are also determined with the use of the dynamics of the H2 relaxation and climbing image nudged elastic band method. It is found that H2 dissociation on (110) and Fe terminated (111) surfaces has no activation energy barrier. On other surfaces however, activation energies are calculated to be 0.178 and 0.190 eV per H2 molecule for Fe and Ti terminated (001) surfaces respectively, and 1.164 eV for Ti terminated (111) surface. © 2009 Professor T.

The study focuses first on the theoretical foundation of the method, based on the analysis of the evolution of the main energy quantities during a daily cycle, with emphasis on the energetically most important phase of the pseudo-steady state. By integrating the instantaneous energy balances over the entire duration of this phase, analytical expressions for the coefficients of the characteristic I/O equation arise, as a function of the main characteristics of the solar system.

A flexible packed stretched media installed in the bottom of the basin to increase the efficiency of the still is applied. The flexible packed media is formed from stretched helical coiled copper wires, which are considered as a good media for heat absorbing and transferring and as a simple thermal storage system. Also, a vibrator (resonator) is installed in the middle of the system structure. The target of using the vibrator is to generate forced vibration to excite the flexible packed media to break the boundary layer and surface tension of the saline water and improve convective heat transfer, and also to excite the condensed polycarbonate glass cover to assist the condensed droplets to slide down before it becomes bigger and possibly falls down in the basin, thus increasing the water vaporization and condensation. Experimental and theoretical analysis including system dynamic modeling coupled with the exciting vibrator is presented and the condition of maximum excitation of the absorbing added media is determined. The performance is compared with the conventional solar stills (CSS). The governing equations including the flexible packed media, the harmonic vibratory excitation, and the energy storage are presented. The vibratory excitation effect is accounted by two new parameters the 'vibratory performance gain and the 'vibratory power effect'. The productivity due to added backed helical wires is found to be 3.4l/m2day, with an efficiency of about 35%, and the productivity with vibration is increased to be 5.8l/m2day and the average daily efficiency is about 60%.

Diversion of the river resulted in loss of water sports (for high-income groups both local and remote), loss of historical monuments (for remote high-income groups) and recreation losses (for local poor). Removal of forest cover leads to loss of non-timber products (for local poor) and carbon storage (for remote high- and low-income groups). Loss of home garden productivity was borne by local poor groups. Benefit of the project, generation of 145 GWh annually, was a gain for the grid connected groups. The impacts were valued using various valuation methods. The base case of the cost benefit analysis resulted in NPV of US$ 11,335,730. When distributional weights are applied for different income groups, both the sign and magnitude of net benefits change. In order to be viable, the project needs diversion of at least 9% of generated electricity to the poorest households in the country.

Chronic food restriction is known to induce reduction in body energy expenditure, as an adaptive mechanism to save energy. Our purpose was to examine whether obesity can alter the mechanism of energy conservation in food-restricted animals. Newborn female Wistar rats were injected either MSG (obese) or saline (control). At the age of 90 days, the animals were fed daily ad libitum (control and MSG) or restricted (50%) (control-restricted and MSG-restricted). After 30 days the animals were sacrificed and the energy balance was determined by calorimetric analysis. Some parameters of energy balance and body composition were affected by MSG treatment as well as food restriction. The percent reduction of the energy expenditure and fat content in MSG-restricted animals was lower than control-restricted animals, when compared with their respective ad libitum groups. These results indicate that all food-restricted animals were able to develop the mechanism of energy conservation, regardless of the obesity, but it was less efficient in MSG-obese animals. © 2010 S.

However, threatening in the said report is that 80% of the total generation in 2030 would be produced from fossil fuels. This global dependence on fossil fuels is dangerous to our environment in terms of their emissions unless specific policies and measures are put in place. Nevertheless, recent research reveals that a reduction in the emissions of these gases is possible with widespread adoption of distributed generation (DG) technologies that feed on renewable energy sources, in the generation of electric power. This paper gives a detailed overview of distributed energy resources technologies, and also discusses the devastating impacts of the conventional power plants feeding on fossil fuels to our environment. The study finally justifies how DG technologies could substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions when fully adopted; hence, reducing the public concerns over human health risks caused by the conventional method of electricity generation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Iraklio, Greece","Air conditioning of buildings is responsible for a large percentage of the greenhouse and ozone depletion effect, as refrigerant harmful gases are released into the atmosphere from conventional cooling systems. The need to implement advanced new concepts in building air conditioning systems is more crucial than ever today. Solar cooling systems (SCS) have the advantage of using absolutely harmless working fluids such as water, or solutions of certain salts. They are energy efficient and environmentally safe. They can be used, either as stand-alone systems or with conventional AC, to improve the indoor air quality of all types of buildings. The main goal is to utilize ""zero emissions"" technologies to reduce energy consumption and reduce CO2 emissions. Amongst cooling technologies, absorption cooling seems to have a promising market potential. In this paper, the performance and economic evaluation of a solar heating and cooling system of a hospital in Crete, is studied using the transient simulation program (TRNSYS). The meteorological year file exploited the hourly weather data where produced by 30-year statistical process. The required data were obtained by Hellenic National Meteorological Service. The objective of this study is to simulate a complete system comprised of a solar collector, a storage tank, a backup heat source, a water cooling tower and a LiBr-H2O absorption chiller. The exploitation of the results of the simulation provided the optimum sizing of the system. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One such solution is a heating system using residential thermal stations (RTS). The advantages of a heating system with RTS, as compared with hot water storage vessels, include stabilizing heat costs, saving energy and a decrease in heat transfer losses. This paper presents the results of an experiment investigating heat consumption in a residential building using RTS. The building, located in Lublin, Poland, was supplied by the local district heating network. The energy consumption was monitored from April 2007 to April 2009. The efficiency of this system was 71.4% during the period when heat was required (winter) and 61.5% during the summer; an annual average efficiency of 67.1%. The energy consumption of the space heating system varied from 0.03 to 0.53 GJ m-2 of the flat's surface area, with the average value being 0.22 GJ m-2. The influences of the location of the flat within the building and the surface area of the flat on the quantity of heat required for space heating were analysed. Specific attention was paid to the occurrence of local heat flows between flats. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In humans, RIP140 is lower expressed in visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese versus lean subjects. We investigated the role of RIP140 in human subcutaneous WAT, which is the major fat depot of the body.Methods: Messenger RNA levels of RIP140 were measured in samples of subcutaneous WAT from women with a wide variation in BMI and in different human WAT preparations. RIP140 mRNA was knocked down with siRNA in in vitro differentiated adipocytes and the impact on glucose transport and mRNA levels of target genes determined.Results: RIP140 mRNA levels in subcutaneous WAT were decreased among obese compared to lean women and increased by weight-loss, but did not associate with mitochondrial DNA copy number. RIP140 expression increased during adipocyte differentiation in vitro and was higher in isolated adipocytes compared to corresponding pieces of WAT. Knock down of RIP140 increased basal glucose transport and mRNA levels of glucose transporter 4 and uncoupling protein-1.Conclusions: Human RIP140 inhibits glucose uptake and the expression of genes promoting energy expenditure in the same fashion as the murine orthologue. Increased levels of human RIP140 in subcutaneous WAT of lean subjects may contribute to economize on energy stores. By contrast, the function and expression pattern does not support that RIP140 regulate human obesity. © 2010 Mejhert et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"glucose; glucose transporter 4; messenger RNA; mitochondrial DNA; receptor interacting protein 140; small interfering RNA; uncoupling protein 1; adipocyte; adult; article; bariatric surgery; behavior modification; body mass; cell differentiation; controlled study; female; gene number; gene targeting; glucose transport; human; human cell; in vitro study; lean body weight; lipid storage; obesity; protein expression; protein function; subcutaneous fat; white adipose tissue",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77349087363

These metal sites are available for a specific interaction with guest species. To shed light on the H2 interaction with these metal sites, H2 adsorption isotherms in Ni3-xMnx[Co(CN)6]2, Ni 3-xCox[Co(CN)6]2, Ni 3-xCdx[Co-(CN)6]2, and Co 3-xMnx[Co(CN)6]2 were recorded and evaluated. According to the obtained data for the adsorption heat values, the strongest H2-metal interaction was found for Ni. The same evidence is obtained from the fitting of the isotherms using the osmotic model, where the value for the osmotic parameter (g) senses the strength for the guest-host interaction. The probable origin of that stronger interaction for the Ni atom is discussed. The information derived from these mixed series was complemented with an analogue study for T3[Co(CN)6]2 and T3[Ir(CN)6]2, with T = Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Cu, and Cd. The strength for the guest-host interaction in these two simple series follows the order: Ni &gt; Cu &gt; Co ̃ Cd &gt;Mn ̃ Zn. For the series T3[Co(CN)6]2, H2 adsorption isotherms up to 7600 Torr were recorded, confirming that the strongest H 2-metal interaction corresponds to Ni and Cu.

Exposures to ionized hydrogen are shown to have a pronounced effect on the carbon buffer (interface) layer. Exposures to atomic hydrogen are shown to actually convert/transform the monolayer graphene plus carbon buffer layer to bi-layer graphene, i.e. to produce carbon buffer layer free bi-layer graphene on SiC(0 0 0 1). This process is shown to be reversible, so the initial monolayer graphene plus carbon buffer layer situation is recreated after heating to a temperature of about 950 °C. A tentative model of hydrogen intercalation is suggested to explain this single to bi-layer graphene transformation mechanism.

Measurements in winter of sensible heat (H) for the small and shallow reservoir of Midmar Dam, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa were made using the surface renewal (SR) method, a renewal model method that uses the average cubic air temperature structure function and eddy covariance (EC). The small magnitude of H during winter makes it difficult to test the reliability of the H estimates obtained using instruments and sensors mounted above the water surface using the SR, renewal model and EC methods. Latent energy flux was estimated as a residual of the energy balance using additional measurements of net irradiance Rn above the water surface and the water-stored heat flux. The SR sensible heat flux (HSR) was estimated for heights of 1.0, 1.3, 1.9 and 2.5 m above the water surface using two air temperature time lags r of 0.4 and 0.8 s of the 10-Hz measurements. The SR method depends on a weighting factor α which represents the capability of the atmospheric turbulence to mix the scalar, within the air parcel to be renewed. The factor α was determined for each measurement height and time lag from the slope of a linear regression relationship forced through the origin of measured EC sensible heat flux (HEC) values on the y-axis vs. HSR or renewal model H on the x-axis. All α values obtained using the renewal model method were not statistically different from that obtained using the SR method for z = 1.0 m for both time lags. Using a calibration dataset, an average α value for the 1.0- and 1.3-m heights of 0.198 for r = 0.4 s and 0.245 for r = 0.8 s for the SR and renewal model methods was obtained. The 30-min HSR, renewal model and HEC estimates were often the smallest component of the energy balance (generally -40 to 40 W m-2) and compared reasonably well for the validation dataset. The heat storage flux G was larger in magnitude (0-200 W m-2) compared to the sensible heat flux. The SR, renewal model and EC latent energy fluxes, each calculated as residuals of the energy balance, were almost the same in magnitude as the available energy flux Rn - G due to the relatively small magnitude of the sensible heat flux during the winter measurement period. The daily evaporation ranged between 1.0 and 3.9 mm. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

On the basis of lifetime measurements, action spectra were obtained from 210 to 360 nm. These reveal that whereas [GW + H]+ absorbs maximally at ∼220 nm, the absorption maximum is &lt;210 nm for [WG + H]+, which is in good accordance with density functional theory calculations that predict band maxima at 221 and 212 nm, respectively. This difference in absorption is ascribed to the ammonium group interacting with the indole ring in the case of GW, thereby lowering the energy of the excited state more than that of the ground state. A broad band at higher wavelengths is observed for WG but not for GW, which again may be linked to differences in conformational structures between the two ions. Absorption spectra for the two CE tagged ions are very similar to each other: The high-energy band is now &lt; 210 nm for both peptide ions, and they display an absorption band with a maximum at 270 nm. The crown ether targets the ammonium protons, preventing an interaction between ammonium and indole, and the photophysics of the two complexes is therefore similar. The complexes have significantly longer lifetimes with respect to dissociation than the bare ions. Finally, we report product ion mass spectra at two different excitation wavelengths, 210 and 270 nm.

The device was then suspended in a porous polymer hydrogel that stabilizes the system and prevents it from clumping. This ensures the light is efficiently captured and directed down the virus wire. Using the virus to self-assemble the components makes their assembly four times more efficient at producing oxygen than alternative techniques which use solar-generated electricity to split water. At present, the system splits hydrogen atoms into their component protons and electrons.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117871494

By 2050, overall consumption will rise to 32.2 tcf, an increase of 40% compared with 2009. Demand has stagnated in recent years, largely as a result of the slow-down in the US economy. In 2009, consumption was just beneath 23 tcf, the lowest figure since 2006. The discovery of large volumes of unconventional gas resources in the US in recent years has transformed the outlook for the country's gas sector. Unconventional gas production now meets > 50% of US demand. However, government must work to drive the shift. New legislation should encourage the use of cleaner-burning natural gas, which emits around 50% the carbon of coal. Most importantly, a carbon price must be introduced for all fuels, to force power generators to switch from coal to gas. With a price for carbon, MIT predicts coal use will be phased out completely from power generation by 2035, from a 52% share today, while gas use for electricity generation will rise to around 50%, from 12% today. MIT's recommendations also include increased support for gas-fired combined-cycle power generation; the removal of policy barriers to the development of natural gas as a transport fuel; additions to the existing processing, delivery and storage facilities needed to handle greater volumes; and new distribution routes.

Due to the uncertainty of the stringency of climate-change policy and the viability and cost competitiveness of carbon capture and storage, there is the possibility that new gas-fired power plants may not run for their intended life spans. Indeed, achieving the 2050 target will require non-carbon-emitting technologies, including nuclear and renewable power generation, as well as significant advances in CCS. Meanwhile, the transport sector's ability to consume more natural gas is also limited, according to Yergin. There is some potential for increasing the number of natural gas vehicles in use in the US. However, natural gas would be competing not just with oil, but also with policy driven increases in fuel efficiency, electric vehicles, and biofuels. However, shale-gas drilling is unlikely to be stopped for environmental reasons. IHS Cera does not think that there will be much impact. With thick layers of impermeable rock in between, there is little risk that the process would contaminate drinking water as long as the well is drilled properly. A bigger risk is the disposal and treatment of produced water, but this process is standard in many petroleum operations and is also highly regulated.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117433296

The pneumatic hybrid powertrain has been modeled in GT-Power and validated against experimental data. The GT-Power engine model has been linked with a MATLAB/simulink vehicle model. The engine in question is a single-cylinder Scania D12 diesel engine, which has been converted to work as a pneumatic hybrid. The base engine model, provided by Scania, is made in GT-power and it is based on the same engine configuration as the one used in real engine testing. During pneumatic hybrid operation the engine can be used as a 2-stroke compressor for generation of compressed air during vehicle deceleration and during vehicle acceleration the engine can be operated as a 2-stroke air-motor driven by the previously stored pressurized air. There is also a possibility to use the stored pressurized air in order to supercharge the engine when there is a need for high torque, like for instance at take off after a standstill or during a overtake maneuver. Previous experimental studies have shown that the pneumatic hybrid is a promising concept with great possibility for fuel consumption reduction during city-driving conditions. Earlier studies have shown a great reduction in fuel consumption whit the pneumatic hybrid compared to conventional vehicles of today. However, most of these studies have been completely of theoretical nature. In this paper, the engine model is based on and verified against experimental data, and therefore more realistic results can be expected. The intent with the vehicle driving cycle simulation is to investigate the potential of the pneumatic hybrid regarding reduction in fuel consumption (FC) compared to a traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) powered vehicle. The results show that a reduction in fuel economy of up to about 30% is possible for a pneumatic hybrid bus on the Braunschweig duty cycle. The main part of this reduction comes from the stop/start functionality of the system, while regenerative braking only contributes with 8.4 % to the reduction in FC. The results also show that an amazing 87% of the braking power can be absorbed and converted to compressed air. However, only a small portion of this energy, about 20%, can be converted to positive work.

These concepts are ranging from ""Micro-Hybrid"" over ""Full-Hybrid"" up to cars powered by an electric machine. Integration of those new powertrain-concepts into passenger vehicles leads to new demands on the acoustic development. The acoustic development process as many other processes in vehicle engineering follows the so called ""V-Model"". Coming from overall subjective and objective N&V-targets, which have to be defined at the very beginning of a vehicle development project, it is essential to break down these targets to system (and even component) level in order to be able to handle the work split between complete vehicle responsibility and suppliers. In the development process these defined targets have to be reached and validated coming from system level to full vehicle level. Following this ""V-Model"" the new demands on N&V-development can be made visible. While for ""conventional"" propulsion systems a lot of experience and benchmarks are available to guide the target setting process, these experiences and benchmarks only exist partly and are strongly dependent on the chosen concept for electrical drives. For an efficient and strongly simulation-driven (that means simulation with software tools and test-bench) development, a collection of objective benchmark-data is needed to be able to generate the right decisions during the engineering phase. Control system strategies - developed for energy-efficiency - have to be considered early enough during N&V-development to make sure that eventual target conflicts can be sorted out early enough. Furthermore the emphasis in simulation will change from lower to higher frequency-ranges and stronger emphasis will have to be put on ambient noise like wind and rolling noise.

From the actual point of view the most promising concepts for future passenger cars are based on the conversion of electrical into mechanical energy. In-wheel motors are an interesting concept towards vehicle electrification that provides also high potentials to improve vehicle dynamics and handling. Nevertheless in-wheel motors increase the unsprung mass worsening vehicle comfort and safety. The paper analyses potentials and limitations of innovative passive concepts as well as of new mechatronic suspension systems in order to assure appropriate levels of vehicle comfort and safety when using in-wheel motors with different torque requirements. To reach the mentioned objective, the weight of synchronous and asynchronous electric motors is computed for different torque requirements. The calculation is done by a computer program designed in the frame of an interdisciplinary research project concerning electrical drives for vehicle applications. Furthermore, an overview of the different magnitudes and parameters proposed in international standards to assess safety and comfort (e.g. ISO 2631-1997 and BS 6841-1987) is presented and possible excitation signals to be used are analyzed. The selection of reasonable evaluation parameters is based on measured data of a vehicle with increased unsprung masses and on simulation models. Afterwards, selected innovative passive systems as well as new mechatronic systems with different complexity levels are compared. The comfort and safety characteristics of a vehicle with conventional power train serve as reference. The comparison is made without considering changes on axle kinematics. The paper aims at getting a relation between the different analyzed systems and the torque requirements of in-wheel motors.

The object monitors the lighting conditions and thereby detects and tracks the sunrise and sunset times. By the means of a simple celestial model an estimate of the geographical position of the object can be made. An intelligent light sampling method is proposed allowing the object to sleep most of the time and hence save battery power. The strategy is energy efficient and the speed of convergence can be adjusted as a function of the energy consumed. Objects employing the method can therefore operate for long times without recharging their batteries.

Large, industrial sources of CO2, such as electricity-generating plants, are likely initial candidates for CCS because they are predominantly stationary, single-point sources. Electricity generation contributes over 40% of U.S. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. Congressional interest has grown in CCS as part of legislative strategies to address climate change. On February 13, 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5), which included $3.4 billion for projects and programs related to CCS. Of that amount, $1.52 billion would be made available for a competitive solicitation for industrial carbon capture and energy efficiency improvement projects, $1 billion for the renewal of FutureGen, and $800 million for U.S. Department of Energy Clean Coal Power Initiative Round III solicitations, which specifically target coalbased systems that capture and sequester, or reuse, CO2 emissions. The $3.4 billion contained in ARRA greatly exceeds the federal government’s cumulative outlays for CCS research and development since 1997. The large and rapid influx of funding for industrial-scale CCS projects may accelerate development and deployment of CO2 capture technologies. Currently, U.S. power plants do not capture large volumes of CO2 for CCS, even though technology is available that can potentially remove 80%-95% of CO2 from a point source. This is due, in part, to the absence of either an economic incentive (i.e., a price for captured CO2) or a regulatory requirement to curtail CO2 emissions. In addition, DOE estimates that CCS costs between $100 and $300 per metric ton (2,200 pounds) of carbon emissions avoided using current technologies. Those additional costs mean that power plants with CCS would require more fuel, and costs per kilowatt-hour would be higher than for plants without CCS. After CO2 is captured from the source and compressed into a liquid, pipelines or ships would likely convey the captured CO2 to storage sites to be injected underground. Three main types of geological formations are being considered for storing large amounts of CO2 as a liquid: oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline reservoirs, and unmineable coal seams. The deep ocean also has a huge potential to store carbon; however, direct injection of CO2 into the deep ocean is still experimental, and environmental concerns have forestalled planned experiments in the open ocean. Mineral carbonation—reacting minerals with a stream of concentrated CO2 to form a solid carbonate—is well understood, but it also is still an experimental process for storing large quantities of CO2. The increase in funding for CCS provided for in ARRA and by other economic incentives may lead to less expensive and more effective technologies for capturing large quantities of CO2. Without a carbon price or a regulatory requirement to cap CO2 emissions, however, it will be difficult to predict or evaluate how the technology would be deployed throughout the U.S. energy sector. By comparison, transporting, injecting, and storing CO2 underground may be less daunting. A large pipeline infrastructure for transporting CO2 could be very costly, however, and considerable uncertainty remains over how large quantities of injected CO2 would be permanently stored underground. To help resolve these uncertainties, DOE has initiated large-scale CO2 injection tests in a variety of geologic reservoirs that are to take place over the next several years. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This approach may require the transporting of captured carbon dioxide via pipeline to an underground storage reservoir with the intent of keeping it out of the atmosphere. Congress has begun to address this issue. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140) contains measures to promote research and development of CCS technology, to assess sequestration capacity, and to clarify the framework for issuance of CO2 pipeline rights-of-way on public land. Other legislative proposals have also sought to encourage the development of CO2 sequestration, capture, and transportation technology. Further, measures were introduced in the 110th Congress, including the Carbon Dioxide Pipeline Study Act of 2007 (S. 2144), which would have required the Secretary of Energy to study the feasibility of constructing and operating a network of CO2 pipelines for CCS. Such a network could develop in the future with or without legislative action. If these pipelines were to cross state lines, it could raise important issues concerning regulatory jurisdiction over siting and pricing. This chapter discusses federal jurisdictional uncertainty over CO2 pipelines under existing law, as well as potential legislative activity to address any possible regulatory \gap in jurisdiction. It should be noted that such a potential gap does not necessarily demand federal legislative resolution. Nevertheless, some analysts, drawing on the history of oil and natural gas pipeline development, anticipate a potential need for better defined federal legislative/regulatory authority over an interstate CO2 pipeline network. Accordingly, Congress may be called upon to consider whether existing federal jurisdictional disclaimers and the state-by-state regulatory structure for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) pipelines is an appropriate regulatory scheme for a possible interstate CO2 pipeline network in support of CCS. Congress could amend existing statutes, such as those related to the interstate pipeline jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or the Surface Transportation Board (STB) to provide for definitive CO2 pipeline rate jurisdiction by the federal government if it does not favor the existing regulatory scheme. Alternatively, Congress could establish another federal regulator of CO2 pipelines or possibly other legislation to amend the existing regulatory scheme. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

That title would call for large-scale testing of carbon dioxide (CO2) storage in geological formations, establish competitive funding awards, direct that a national storage capacity assessment be conducted, and require that the Department of Energy (DOE) demonstrate the use of large-scale capture technologies at industrial facilities. This chapter summarizes S. 1321, the Energy Savings Act of 2007. S. 1321 has three titles: Title I, Biofuels for Energy Security and Transportation Act; Title II, Energy Efficiency Promotion Act; and Title III, Carbon Capture and Storage Research, Development, and Demonstration Act. The bill includes language from four other bills: S. 987 (biofuels), S. 1115 (energy efficiency), S. 962 (carbon storage), and S. 731 (carbon storage). S. 1321 was introduced May 7, 2007.1 The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources approved the bill by a vote of 20 to 3, and reported it on May 7, 2007.2 On May 17, 2007, the omnibus energy policy bill S. 1419 was introduced. The three titles of S. 1321 were incorporated into S. 1419 as Title I, Title II, and Title III. S. 1419 was read twice on the floor, and ordered to be placed on the Senate legislative calendar under general orders, as item 156. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

One approach is carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) — capturing CO2 at its source (e.g., a power plant) and storing it indefinitely (e.g., underground) to avoid its release to the atmosphere. A common requirement among the various techniques for CCS is a dedicated pipeline network for transporting CO2 from capture sites to storage sites. In the 110th Congress, there has been considerable debate on the capture and sequestration aspects of carbon sequestration, while there has been relatively less focus on transportation. Nonetheless, there is increasing understanding in Congress that a national CCS program could require the construction of a substantial network of interstate CO2 pipelines. S. 2144 and S. 2191 would require the Secretary of Energy to study the feasibility of constructing and operating such a network of pipelines. S. 2323 would require carbon sequestration projects to evaluate the most cost-efficient ways to integrate CO2 sequestration, capture, and transportation. S. 2149 would allow seven-year accelerated depreciation for qualifying CO2 pipelines. P.L. 110-140, signed by President Bush on December 19, 2007, requires the Secretary of the Interior to recommend legislation to clarify the issuance of CO2 pipeline rights-of-way on public land. That CCS and related legislation have been more focused on the capture and storage of CO2 than on its transportation, reflects a perception that transporting CO2 via pipelines does not present a significant barrier to implementing large-scale CCS. Notwithstanding this perception, and even though regional CO2 pipeline networks already operate in the United States for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), developing a more expansive national CO2 pipeline network for CCS could pose numerous new regulatory and economic challenges. There are important unanswered questions about pipeline network requirements, economic regulation, utility cost recovery, regulatory classification of CO2 itself, and pipeline safety. Furthermore, because CO2 pipelines for EOR are already in use today, policy decisions affecting CO2 pipelines take on an urgency that is, perhaps, unrecognized by many. Federal classification of CO2 as both a commodity (by the Bureau of Land Management) and as a pollutant (by the Environmental Protection Agency) could potentially create an immediate conflict which may need to be addressed not only for the sake of future CCS implementation, but also to ensure consistency of future CCS with CO2 pipeline operations today. In addition to these issues, Congress may examine how CO2 pipelines fit into the nation’s overall strategies for energy supply and environmental protection. If policy makers encourage continued consumption of fossil fuels under CCS, then the need to foster the other energy options may be diminished — and vice versa. Thus decisions about CO2 pipeline infrastructure could have consequences for a broader array of energy and environmental policies. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The annual program has grown from $400 million in the DOD budget to over $1 billion per year across three agencies-DOD, DOE, and the State Department. It has also evolved from an emergency response to impending chaos in the Soviet Union, to a more comprehensive threat reduction and nonproliferation effort, to a broader program seeking to keep nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons from leaking out of the former Soviet Union and into the hands of rogue nations or terrorist groups, to a global program to address the threat of weapons of mass destruction. The Department of Defense manages the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program, which provides Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan with assistance in transporting, storing, and dismantling nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. U.S. assistance has helped these nations eliminate the delivery systems for nuclear weapons under the START Treaty, secure weapons storage areas, construct a storage facility for nuclear materials removed from weapons, construct a destruction facility for chemical weapons, and secure biological weapons materials. The State Department manages the International Science and Technology Centers in Moscow and Kiev. These centers provide research grants to scientists and engineers so that they will not sell their knowledge to other nations or terrorist groups. The State Department has also provided assistance with export and border control programs in the former Soviet states. The Department of Energy manages programs that seek to improve the security of nuclear warheads in storage and nuclear materials at civilian, naval, and nuclear weapons complex facilities. It also funds programs that help nuclear scientists and engineers find employment in commercial enterprises. DOE is also helping Russia dispose of plutonium removed from nuclear weapons and shut-down its remaining plutonium-producing reactors by replacing them with fossil-fuel plants. Analysts have debated numerous issues related to U.S. nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance. These include questions about the coordination of and priority given to these programs in the U.S. government, questions about Russia’s willingness to provide the United States with access to its weapons facilities, questions about the President’s ability to waive certification requirements so that the programs can go forward, and questions about the need to expand the efforts into a global program that receives funding from numerous nations and possibly extends assistance to others outside the former Soviet Union. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029927968

Coal use in the future, along with other fossil fuels, threatens to wreak havoc in the earth’s climate system. This book looks at “clean coal” technologies such as coal gasification and carbon capture. Coal gasification, when done in conjunction with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one technology option that offers our nation an attractive approach to utilize our indigenous fossil energy resources in a more efficient and environmentally sound manner for producing clean, affordable power from coal with dramatically reduced carbon emissions. Coal gasification with CCS can also reduce the carbon impact of using coal to produce ultra-clean fuels for the transportation sector, substitute natural gas (SNG) to heat our homes and fuel our industrial sector, fertilizers to ensure an abundant food supply, and chemicals that play an integral part in our every day lives. Another coal gasification concept explored in this book that could further reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emission is co-feeding coal and biomass into gasifiers to produce electricity or conventional transportation fuels. In addition to these technologies, this book also describes ways at improving or optimizing the performance of coal-fired power plants, in addition to tools that can be used and are available to cut global warming emissions.

In order to provide efficient numeric calculations, the information systems have to be developed for management, pre-processing, post-processing and visualization. In spite of that many software tools contain sophisticated subsystems for data management and implement advanced numerical algorithms, there is still need to standardize data inputs/outputs, wide used data analyses, and case oriented computational tools under one roof. Thus, the geographic information system (GIS) is used to satisfy all the requirements. As an example, the case study focused on dust dispersion above the surface coal mine documents the GIS ability to solve all the tasks. The input data are represented by terrain measurements of meteorological conditions and by estimates of the emission rates of potential surface dust sources. Remote sensing helps to identify and classify the coal mine surface in order to map erosion sites and other surface objects. GPS is used to improve the accuracy of the erosion site boundaries and to locate other point emission sources such as excavators, storage sites, and line emission sources such as conveyors and roads. The 3D mine surface for modeling of wind flows and dust dispersion is based on GPS measurements and laser scanning. All data inputs are integrated together with simulation outputs in the spatial database in the framework of the GIS project. In case of dispersion modeling, a few ways can be used to provide numeric calculations together with GIS analyses. The traditionally used way represents using of standalone simulation tools and the input/output data linkage through shared data files. The more advanced way is the implementation of dispersion models in the GIS environment. The methods are demonstrated by using U.S. EPA modeling tools and by linking standalone numerical calculations in the GIS environment with using case oriented programming libraries and GIS development tools. © 2010 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Often extensive heating, ventilating, and air conditioning is installed to provide these stable indoor conditions. The resultant significant energy and maintenance costs are currently motivating a paradigm change: passive control, via the thermal and hygric inertia of the building, is gaining foothold in the museum conservation and building physical community. In this paper we report a hygrothermal performance optimization of a museum storage building related to an existing storage in Vejle (Denmark). The current building design already incorporates passive control concepts: thermal inertia is provided by the thick walls, the ground floor, and its underlying soil volume, and hygric inertia is provided by the thick walls of light-weight concrete. The design promise was that after a few years of dehumidification, the moisture contained in the fresh constructions would be brought down to a level corresponding with the desired interior climate, after which the passive control would eliminate the need for dehumidification. Four years after completing the construction, however, continuous dehumidification is necessary to maintain acceptable humidity levels in the storage rooms. This paper presents an analysis of this contradiction and shows that such complete passive conditioning is an illusion. The general levels of humidity of the exterior environment are too high, which leads to unfavorable conditions for the interior environment. Continuous dehumidification is required, and a new concept for optimization of the building's thermal insulation and infiltration behavior in relation to the required dehumidification load is invented. The investigation shows that the impact of thermal improvements is minor, while any intervention in the airtightness has a considerable effect. The combination of the two brings the dehumidification needs down by 79%, with a minor price to be paid in the form of an increased potential for mechanical and chemical decay. © 2010 ASHRAE.",,"Air conditioning; Architectural design; Buildings; Floors; Historic preservation; Humidity control; Light weight concrete; Maintenance; Museums; Thermal insulation; Walls (structural partitions); Heating , Ventilating , and Air-Conditioning; Hygrothermal performance; Indoor conditions; Interior environments; Maintenance cost; Storage building; Temperature and relative humidity; Underlying soils; Structural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926522407

Such systems function well and can cover about 50 % of the total hot-water demand for a residential building having a heat store with a capacity sufficient for a couple of days. The weakness of such systems is that they can deliver the most heat during warm sunny days, when the need for heating is at its lowest. The energy from the solar panels is normally stored in an accumulator tank with a finite storage capacity, which gives very few options for dealing with the surplus. This paper presents measurements from a new residential building in Sweden-Villa Gustafson-where the major part of the heating is produced by solar collectors operating in combination with a ground heat pump. The surplus from the solar collectors during warm sunny days is stored in the ground beneath the building. During cold weather, this stored heat heats up the building via the heat pump. The system improves the operating conditions of both the solar collectors and the heat pump. The house was built and the solar system started during the summer of 2008. The paper presents measurements of the system for the first year. The different temperatures to and from the system, as well as the temperature in the heat store beneath the building, were measured, as was energy use. The measured values for the first year (2009), with an average outdoor temperature of 6.7°C (44.1°F), indicate that annual energy use for space heating and domestic hot-water production should not exceed 14 kWh/m2 (4.4 kBtu/ft2) per year. © 2010 ASHRAE.",,"Energy utilization; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating equipment; Housing; Pumps; Solar collectors; Solar system; Space heating; Water; Ground heat pumps; Heating of buildings; Hot-water production; Low-energy house; Operating condition; Outdoor temperature; Residential building; Storage capacity; Solar heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926516599

This leads to significant overexpenditure of the cold, especially at humid climate conditions, because almost half of the produced cold is spent for moisture condensation. Developed system enables to separate this processes, i.e. perform cooling of preliminary dehumidified air. Air dehumidification is implemented with the help of secondary and solar heat. This process runs at the following scenario: moister is absorbed by active sorbent from induced and return air flows; later, used sorbent restores its capability after vaporization. Thus, air-conditioning processes becomes at least twice less energy-intensive. For dry and hot climate regions air moistening is vital. Proposed study describes the process of initial cooling of recycled dry air followed by mixing with moisturized incoming air supplied by refrigerating system after evapo-ration of condensed water. In such systems, it is reasonable to apply solar driven generators of cold, especially ejector refrigerating systems (ERS). These installations serve for simultaneous generation of low-grade cold for food storage and deep freezing. Solar air-conditioning demands accumulation of cold and heat, with desirable usage of phase transition. The last is more preferred because COP is quite always less than 1 and the capacity of accumulator of cold could be less than accumulator of heat. As a retaining fluid it is reasonable to use an agent which evaporates at ambient pressure and set temperatures, or to use heavy alkenes for liquid-solid phase transaction.

Rotating spindles are often subject to synchronous vibrations due to the presence of unbalanced mass. The effect of such an unbalanced mass can be modelled as sinusoidal disturbances acting on the spindle. AMBs can be effectively used to control/suppress these disturbances. Feedback controllers based on H∞ methods have been predominantly used in the AMB literature. Such controllers essentially aid in suppressing disturbances at a fixed operating point / rotational speed. An AMBspindle operating over a range of rotational speeds exhibits dynamics that depend on the rotational speed. This is modelled by means of a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) system wherein the system dynamics depend on the rotational speed. It is desirable to design controllers that can also adapt based on the rotational speed measurement.

The means of thermal storage differ in the amount of heat that can be stored and incorporation of the storage medium in building structures. For common structures can be calculated for provision of thermal comfort in summer season only with sensible heat storage. But light-weight materials that are used for building structures of the attics have low thermal storage capacity due to their low own weight. Therefore the overheating of indoor space is serious problem. Overheating causes the discomfort for occupants.

A complementary solution, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), incorporates range-extender devices. ETV Motors is developing advanced electrical automotive powertrain technologies: (a) High-energy, high-voltage Lithium Ion battery; (b) Ultra-low emission, highly efficient, high-power-density on-board charger. The Li-ion cell provides 4.7V per cell (cf 3.2-3.7V state-of-Art Li-ion systems), with specific energy of 250-400Wh/kg. The cell chemistry incorporates novel Nickel Manganese spinel cathode material with inherent safety advantages and low-cost materials. High voltage requires new materials and treatments.

This is only one of many reasons why alternative drive concepts, especially electric mobility, have never been more in focus than today. A future change from combustion engines to electric drives leads to additional loads, which gives rise to the necessity to take corrective measures in the energy supply sector. In order to be able to scrutinize the impacts on the power grid, a model has been developed with the help of the software MATLAB to generate stochastic load profiles for electric vehicles. The model exclusively deals with electric vehicles with lithium ion batteries. All parameters originate from the transport statistics of the motorized individual traffic in Austria. In the end the calculated outcome of a driving profile mix for 100 battery powered electric vehicles is consolidated into a total load profile. The resulting implications of some uncontrolled and controlled charging scenarios are discussed. As a consequence of the assumption that most charging processes take place in residential areas, a comparison of the overall load profiles with standardized load profiles for regular households is carried out. The underlying scenario comprises 200 households. If the charging processes are started immediately after the respective arrivals at home without being controlled, this will result in a rise of the evening load peak. It is shown that by means of several load cycles per day - provided the expansion of the charging infrastructure - This negative effect is limited. Anyway, the overall goal is a well controlled consumer-oriented charging process in order to shift the energy consumption to the night load depression. For this purpose several scenarios are elaborated and its advantages and drawbacks are described. Finally various approaches for the implementation of the highlighted scenarios are presented.","Battery powered electric vehicle; Charging infrastructure; Controlled consumer- oriented charging process; Household scenario; Stochastic load profile","Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Electric drives; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Global warming; MATLAB; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Battery-powered electric vehicles; Charging infrastructures; Charging process; Household scenarios; Stochastic load profiles; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907407715

Furthermore, in order to improve the power density and life cycle of the battery, the ultracapacitor (UC) has been proposed to hybridize with the battery to form a hybrid energy storage system. In this paper, a multi-hybrid energy system is proposed for HEVs, which incorporates the advantages of the TE-PV hybrid subsystem and the ultracapacitor-battery (UC-B) hybrid subsystem. On the one side, the TE-PV hybrid subsystem can provide the higher fuel economy due to the increase of onboard renewable energy, the better energy security due to the use of multiple energy sources, and the higher control flexibility due to the coordination for charging the same pack of batteries. On the other side, the UC-B hybrid subsystem can provide faster transient power, higher power density and longer battery lifetime.

The energy consumption depends on the efficiency of air-conditioning systems that are used for provision of thermal comfort. The design and use of building structures with phase change materials can increase thermal storage capacity of the envelope and reduce the energy consumption for operating of a building. The paper deals with the results of practical monitoring of the influence of building structures with integrated phase change materials on the thermal comfort. The storage medium, e.g. in the walls and ceiling, absorbs thermal energy during the day. But for the repeated use on the next day it is necessary to provide discharging of stored energy. Paper shows the results from measurement with different air change rates in the special testing room. It seems to be necessary to use mechanical night ventilation for activation of latent heat storage medium during the off-peak time.","Building structures; Passive cooling; Phase change materials; Thermal comfort","Energy utilization; Heat storage; Intelligent buildings; Phase change materials; Sustainable development; Thermal comfort; Air change rates; Building structure; Design of buildings; Night ventilation; Passive cooling; Storage medium; Stored energy; Thermal storage; Energy conservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902441528

The objective here is to show experimentally and through a computer simulation that PCM impregnated in building materials can provide thermal energy storage benefits. Paraffin (RT20) has been used as the PCM because of its desirable thermal and physical attributes including its melting temperature of 200-22. °C, which is close to human comfort temperature. The PCM was impregnated into gypsum wallboards to produce an efficient thermal storage medium (PCMGW), which consists of 26%-wt PCM impregnated in gypsum boards. This PCM-gypsum wallboard structure was tested in-situ in an office size building. In parallel, a thermal building simulation code (SUNREL) was used to simulate the performance of the office size rooms. Measured and simulated results in summer showed that the use of PCMGW effectively reduced diurnal daily fluctuations of indoor air temperatures and maintained the indoor temperature at the desired comfort level for a longer period of time. A major benefit of thermal energy storage in winter is to reduce electricity demand charges by limiting the need to run electrically operated heating and air-conditioning devices during peak load periods. This study reveals that this application of PCM storage in buildings can lead to healthier interior spaces, and more efficient energy use in terms of demand charge reduction and use of favourable off-peak rates. © 2010 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.","Comfort in buildings; Gypsum wallboard; Paraffin wax; PCM; Peak load","Building materials; Buildings; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Gypsum; Heat storage; Paraffin waxes; Paraffins; Pulse code modulation; Storage (materials); Thermal comfort; Thermal energy; Walls (structural partitions); Air conditioning device; Electricity demands; Gypsum wallboards; Heating and cooling; In-buildings; Indoor air temperature; Peak load; Thermal building simulation; Phase change materials",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902223344

To this aim, the Switched Power Junction formalism is used to manage the switching between the different modes, along with a residual-sink-like concept to avoid derivative causality when constraints among energy storages appear, and conservation principles of generalized momentum and charge to re-initialize the state variables when mode switching induces state discontinuities.

At the same time, there was greater public awareness of the environmental problems created by carbon-based energy systems. National policies were put in place to promote new “clean” energy systems, such as solar, wind, wave, and bio-energy. Policy instruments varied between subsidies – such as “feed-in tariffs” or subsidized prices to owners of wind or solar energy production infrastructure when they sell electricity to the public grid in countries such as Japan or Germany – tax relief (as in the USA), and government funding for R&D investments. During the 1970s and 1980s, these national R&D efforts were supported by NGOs and reinforced by industrial entrepreneurs and suppliers of technology. These national technological systems of innovation developed green technologies and made the new energy systems more efficient and hence more competitive with carbon-based energies (Jakobsson et al. 2002). Such developments were endorsed and encouraged by a number of transnational institutions. In the course of the 1970s, there was a rift between the “green” movement, promoting “clean and green” technology solutions that at the time were inefficient and seemed to be of little economic significance, and “industrial interests,” promoting economic growth while generating pollution. At the time, only a minority saw the possibility of a compromise between these positions. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896491733

As a result, many works have been devoted to modeling and predicting the transient response of both sensible and latent heat storage units, over a variety of geometry. Phase change units have some advantages over sensible heat units, due to its higher storage capacity (per unit volume) and lower average chiller operation, which impacts the system performance as a whole. Accordingly, the present work is dedicated to the development and solution of a simple mathematical model for the heat transfer phenomena within a latent heat storage unit, consisting of a tank containing phase change material (PCM) enclosed within spherical capsules. Several assumptions are made with a view to maintain the model as simple as possible, without disregarding a careful reflection about its accuracy and impact on the reliability of the solution. In particular, a simulation is carried out for small values of the Stefan number (Ste), which allows the solidification to be predicted by a quasi-stationary model. The model results in a system consisting of a partial differential parabolic equation, which describes the temperature field along the channel, and an integral equation, which is to represent the phase change evolution within a spherical capsule. The model is solved using a fully implicit finite-volume discretization technique. To obtain more general results, all the physical variables are arranged in non-dimensional groups, the influence of which on the response of the storage unit is evaluated.","Packed beds; Phase change; Thermal storage","Environmental impact; Heat storage; Latent heat; Mathematical models; Optimization; Packed beds; Phase change materials; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamics; Electrical utilities; Finite time thermodynamics; Latent heat storage units; Parabolic Equations; Partial differential; Phase Change; Thermal storage; Transfer phenomenon; Computer simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896140137

However, the intermittence of most renewable energies can create problems to the local electricity grids. To deal with this issue, energy storage systems are often used, but they are usually an expensive solution, and might not be implementable. One of the solutions being discussed to face the issue of renewable intermittence is the use of demand side management strategies, which can have the double effect of reducing electricity consumption and allowing greater flexibility in electricity production by doing load shifting. This work analyzes the impact of using demand side management strategies in the evolution of the electricity mix in Flores. Flores is a small island in the Azores which is known for its high penetration of renewable energy. The potential for renewable energies and the small scale of the system make it an interesting case study for testing innovative solutions. TIMES is used here to model the electricity system and optimize the installation and use of wind and hydro plants up until 2020 based on different scenarios for electricity consumption growth, deployment of demand response technologies in the domestic sector and promotion of energy efficiency plans to eliminate standby power.","Demand side management; Dynamic demand response; Energy planning; TIMES modeling","Costs; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Lead acid batteries; Optimization; Demand side managements; Dynamic demand response; Electricity production; Electricity-consumption; Energy planning; Energy storage systems; Renewable electricity; TIMES modeling; Electricity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896136143

The questions are: how environmentally friendly and sustainable are the available alternatives and which of them will ensure a major improvement in environmental quality at lowest economic cost To answer some of these questions, the present work proposes a method where a sustainability indicator based on exergy life cycle data complemented with concepts from classical monetary investment assessment. This approach allows for the determination of an investment hierarchy by comparing alternative energy conversion routes in terms of their concerned environmental contribution and their natural resource indirect cost. The aim of this work is to highlight the convenience of a quite different exergy indicator, based on indirect exergetic cost and environmental exergetic cost. Four approaches are at the base of this investigation: the cumulative exergy consumption (CExC) from Szargut [1] and its implementation as a Life Cycle Assessment (LCIA) on the Ecoinvent database; the zero-exergy emission approach from Cornelissen [2] also used by Sciubba's Extended Exergy Accounting [3]; the renewability concept from Dewulf [4-5] and Ocana [6]; and the indirect exergy concept, defined as the additional exergy needed from the technosphere to drive a transformation energy route as proposed by Wall [7]. Important concepts that were followed in this paper are the concept of energy route or energy path, and the philosophy behind a System Perturbation Analysis from Bram [8]. A case study is presented using data from the Ecoinvent database (v2.01 2007) to investigate the alternatives for petrol driven cars. The alternative energy routes assessed were methanol from biomass synthetic gas and biogas. All three energy routes for personal transport were compared to find out the most sustainable route with the lowest indirect exergy cost.","ELCA; Energy route; Energy sustainability; Energy system; LCA","Costs; Digital storage; Economics; Energy conversion; Environmental impact; Exergy; Life cycle; Natural resources; Optimization; Sustainable development; Thermodynamics; Transportation routes; ELCA; Energy route; Energy sustainability; Energy systems; LCA; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896097064

An exergy and economic analysis is performed. The results show that it is possible to add a system to capture CO2 from flue gas using absorption with monoethanolamine (MEA). The case considered is the absorption of 90% carbon dioxide from the exhaust gases. The paper focuses on the impact of the inclusion of CCS in the power plant and the performance and emissions from the plant. The addition of this system reduces the emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but increases the specific production of CO2/kWh. It also causes a substantial reduction in net exergy efficiency of the power plant, reduces electricity production and increases costs. As regards to the economics, the feasibility of CCS assembly depends on the price of CO2 emissions in the global market. It certainly must not be forgotten that there is a drastic reduction in carbon dioxide with the addition of the CCS unit. However, the benefits coming from this action are offset by the increase in fuel consumption. Also, the storage technologies available, raise questions about their reliability over time, in other words, the time horizon for safe storage of carbon dioxide without ultimately getting back to the atmosphere. It is concluded that the technologies to capture the CO2, as the one considered in this work, and others developed so far, are not attractive and valuable solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to achieve the environmental goals set by international agreements.","Carbon sequestration; Greece; Lignite power plant; Monoethanolamine absorption (MEA)","Carbon capture; Costs; Economic analysis; Efficiency; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; EthanolamineS; Exergy; Flue gases; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Lignite; Optimization; Power plants; Carbon sequestration; Electricity production; Exergy efficiencies; Greece; Greek energy system; Monoethanolamine; Performance and emissions; Substantial reduction; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896068408

Agriculture is also a ""sink"" for sequestering carbon, which might offset GHG emissions by capturing and storing carbon in agricultural soils. The two key types of GHG emissions associated with agricultural activities are methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Agricultural sources of CH4 emissions mostly occur as part of the natural digestive process of animals and manure management at livestock operations; sources of N2O emissions are associated with soil management and fertilizer use on croplands. This report describes these emissions on a carbonequivalent basis to illustrate agriculture's contribution to total national GHG emissions and to contrast emissions against estimates of sequestered carbon. Emissions from agricultural activities account for 6%-8% of all GHG emissions in the United States. Carbon captured and stored in U.S. agricultural soils partially offsets these emissions, sequestering about one-tenth of the emissions generated by the agriculture sector, but less than 1% of all U.S. emissions annually. Emissions and sinks discussed in this report are those associated with agricultural production only. Emissions associated with on-farm energy use or with food processing or distribution, and carbon uptake on forested lands or open areas that might be affiliated with the farming sector, are outside the scope of this report. Most land management and farm conservation practices can help reduce GHG emissions and/or sequester carbon, including land retirement, conservation tillage, soil management, and manure and animal feed management, among other practices. Many of these practices are encouraged under most existing voluntary federal and state agricultural programs that provide cost-sharing and technical assistance to farmers, predominantly for other production or environmental purposes. However, uncertainties are associated with implementingthese types of practices depending on site-specific conditions, the type of practice, how well it is implemented, the length of time a practice is undertaken, and available funding, among other factors. Despite these considerations, the potential to reduce emissions and sequester carbon on agricultural lands is reportedly much greater than current rates. Congress is considering a range of climate change policy options, including GHG emission reduction programs that would either mandate or authorize a cap-and-trade program to reduce GHG emissions. In general, the current legislative proposals would not require emission reductions in the agriculture and forestry sectors. Many GHG proposals, however, would allow farmers and landowners to receive emissions allowances (or credits) and/or generate carbon offsets, which could be sold to facilities covered by a cap-and-trade program. In addition, the enacted 2008 farm bill includes provisions that could expand the scope of existing land-based conservation and other farm bill programs by providing incentives to encourage farmers and landowners to sequester carbon and reduce emissions associated with climate change, adopt energy efficiency measures, produce renewable energy feedstocks, and participate in markets for carbon storage. The debate in Congress over whether and how to address possible future climate change is intensifying. Often, the role of the U.S. agriculture sector is invoked in this debate. Agriculture is a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which many scientists agree are contributing to observed climate change. Agriculture is also a ""sink"" for sequestering carbon, which partly offsets these emissions. Carbon sequestration (the capture and storage of carbon) in agricultural soils can be an important component of a climate change mitigation strategy, limiting the release of carbon from the soil to the atmosphere. Congress is considering a range of climate change policy options, including GHG emission reduction programs that would either mandate or authorize a cap-and-trade program to reduce GHG emissions. In general, the current legislative proposals would not require emission reductions in the agriculture and forestry sectors. However, some of these proposals would allow farmers and landowners to generate offsets in support of a cap-and-trade program. Other proposals would give farmers and landowners a share of available allowances (or credits) for sequestration and/or emission reduction activities. These offsets and allowances could be sold to facilities (e.g., power plants) covered by a cap-and-trade program. Some bills also specify that the proceeds from auctioned allowances be used to promote certain activities, including farmland conservation and developing bioenergy technologies. In addition, the omnibus 2008 farm bill (Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, P.L. 110-246) could expand the scope of existing farm and forestry conservation programs in ways that could more broadly encompass certain aspects of these climate change initiatives. The bill provides incentives to encourage farmers and landowners to sequester carbon and reduce emissions associated with climate change, as well as produce renewable energy feedstocks. The bill also contains a new provision that will facilitate the participation of the agriculture and forestry sectors in emerging environmental services markets, focusing first on carbon storage. This report is organized in three parts. First, it discusses the extent of GHG emissions associated with the U.S. agriculture sector, and cites current and potential estimates for U.S. agricultural soils to sequester carbon and partly offset national GHG emissions. Second, the report describes the types of land management and farm conservation practices that can reduce GHG emissions and/or sequester carbon in agricultural soils, highlighting those practices that are currently promoted under existing voluntary federal agricultural programs. The Appendix provides a summary primer of the key background information presented in these first two sections. Finally, the report describes ongoing legislative action within both the climate change and farm bill debates, and discusses the types of questions that may be raised regarding the roleof theU.S. agriculturesector in the broader climate change debate. This report does not address the potential effects of global climate change on U.S. agricultural production. Such effects may arise because of increased climate variability and incidence of global environmental hazards, such as drought and/or flooding, pests, weeds, and diseases, or temperature and precipitation changes that might cause locational shifts in where and how agricultural crops are produced 1.This report also does not address how ongoing or anticipated initiatives to promote U.S. bioenergy production may effect efforts to reduce GHG emissions and/or sequester carbon, such as by promoting more intensive feedstock production and by encouraging fewer crop rotations and planting area setbacks, which could both raise emissions and reduce carbon uptake 2. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Agriculture; Agronomy; Animals; Biohazards; Carbon capture; Climatology; Commerce; Conservation; Cost effectiveness; Crops; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Environmental protection; Feedstocks; Fertilizers; Food processing; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Laws and legislation; Manures; Nitrogen oxides; Reduction; Soil conservation; Soils; Timber; Agricultural activities; Agricultural productions; Background information; Climate change mitigation; Climate change policies; Conservation practices; Environmental services; Global climate changes; Climate change",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895261376

The proposed heat sink consists of a PCM filled enclosure heated by substrate-mounted protruding heat sources (micro processors). PCMs, characterized by high energy storage density and small transition temperature interval, are able to store a high amount of generated heat; which provides a passive cooling of microprocessors. The advantage of this cooling strategy is that the phase change materials are able to absorb a high amount of generated heat without energizing the fan. The proposed strategy is suitable and efficient for situations where the cooling by air convection is not practical (thermal control of recent multiprocessors computers, for example). The problem is modelled as, two dimensional, time dependent and convection-dominated phenomena. A finite volume numerical approach is developed and used to simulate the physical details of the problem. This approach is based on the enthalpy method which is traditionally used to track the motion of the liquid/solid front and obtain the temperature and velocity profiles in the liquid phase. The study gives an instruction on the presentation of PCM heat sink used for cooling management of recent computers. Numerical investigations have been conducted in order to examine the impact of several parameters on the thermal behaviour and efficiency of the proposed PCM-based heat sink. Correlation for the secured operating time (time required by the heat sink before reaching the critical temperature, Ter) is developed.","Latent heat of fusion; Passive cooling; Phase change material; Protruding electronic component","Cooling; Electronic cooling; Heat sinks; Heat storage; Reservoir management; Temperature; Thermal variables control; Convection-dominated; Critical temperatures; Electronic component; High energy storage densities; Latent heat of fusion; Numerical investigations; Passive cooling; Thermal management systems; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890455729

In the future, biomass has the potential to provide a cost-effective and sustainable supply of energy. Renewable energy is a promising alternative solution because it is clean and environmentally safe. The promise of renewable energy is that it offers a solution to many of the environmental and social problems associated with fossil and nuclear fuels. Biomass feedstocks include forest products wastes, agricultural residues, organic fractions of municipal solid wastes, paper, cardboard, plastic, food waste, green waste, and other waste. Biomass is a sustainable feedstock for chemicals and energy products. Biomass feedstocks are more evenly distributed in the world. As an energy source that is highly productive, renewable, carbon neutral, and easy to store and transport, biomass has drawn worldwide attention recently. There are some barriers to the development of biofuel production. They are technological, economical, supply, storage, safety, and policy barriers. Reducing these barriers is one of the driving factors in the government's involvement in biofuel research and development. Production costs are uncertain and vary with the feedstock available. The production of biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks can be achieved through two very different processing routes: biochemical and thermochemical. As of now, there seems to be no clear candidate for ""best technology pathway"" between the competing biochemical and thermochemical routes.

It features closely spaced, roof mounted photovoltaic modules, which collect the solar energy driving the whole energy system. During the day time, the modules form an elevated horizontal surface above the roof, shielding it from direct solar radiation. After sunset, the photovoltaic modules are flipped vertically upwards to expose the roof to the sky, thus enhancing night-time cooling. Two methods of energy storage are proposed and compared, one using solely battery storage of electrical output, and the other employing a combination of cold water storage and battery storage. The analysis is based on detailed dynamic heat transfer calculations for the entire building envelope, coupled with a solar radiation model, and followed by energy balances.

The heat generation system comprises a water-to-water heat pump, and a ground heat exchanger. The electricity generation system comprises the photovoltaic (PV) system. The PV system generates electricity that either may drive the compressor of the heat pump or may feed-in the electricity grid. A simulation is carried out by using EnergyPlus software with additional theoretical approach. Two cases are investigated for a design of the PV system. In case A, the electricity distribution network is used for electricity storage. The PV system would yearly produce the exact amount of electricity that the compressor needs. The case B refers to design of the PV system that would produce the exact amount of electricity that the compressor needs in the month with its highest electricity consumption. Then, the PV system would directly satisfy all compressor needs for electrical energy during all other months of year, and rest of electricity would be feed-in to the electricity grid.

For the both cases, this article will also report the payback time as a function of the feed-in tariff of generated electricity. It is found that the feed-in tariffs for the generation of electricity in Serbia are not large enough and should be corrected if the electricity production from solar energy will be promoted.","Energy consumption; Heat pump; Photovoltaic system","Compressors; Computer software; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Heat generation; Heat pump systems; Heating equipment; Photovoltaic cells; Pumps; Solar energy; Space heating; Electricity distribution networks; Electricity production; Electricity storages; Electricity-consumption; Electricity-generation system; Ground heat exchangers; Heat pumps; Photovoltaic systems; Electric power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862065088

Energy safety is especially important for the states located in the geographic areas where it is cold during long periods. Enesrgy safety of Poland is not only a continuous supply to our factories and homes of electricity and heat, but also widely understood means of transport, which also, and perhaps mainly, absorb enormous amount of energy. Explicit defining of the concept of energy security is difficult to formulate, because a fundamental question must be first answered: in what regard the amount of partial generally understood energy delivered to keep the needs of Poland is yet sufficient, though minimal, but assuring Poland's safety - to the level of so-called appropriate balance that is complete. For today a conventional definition of energy safety in Poland may be used: three independent lines of oil and gas supplies assure energy safety. At present it is impossible to assure the energy safety of Poland as an independent safety, dependent only on own energy raw materials, so-called classic (gas, oil, coal) assisted with non-conventional sources like wind energy, water, solar energy and energy from biomass. Poland has to base its energy safety on community of European Countries clustered in the European Union as a future, single, big European Country of different nations, a kind of United States of Europe. It must be assumed that depleting of the Polish gas, oil and coal deposits, is proportional to depleting these raw materials in the world, but of course it can never be ruled out that still new deposits will be found, economically for their exploitation. Poland as a member of the European Union has to build first nuclear power plant until 2023, which will relieve the decreasing capacity of existing coal-fired and gas power plants. The second nuclear power plant Poland must build no later than 2037, and a third one to 2090. At the same time, it is crucial to start immediately research programs concerning development of as cheap as possible (although it will always be expensive) technology for hydrogen production and storage, so that gradually from about 2025 in Poland next to gas stations, hydrogen stations were established for gradually appearing greater numbers of cars on hydrogen. During next decade (2010-2020) Poland should also, as far as resources permit, build at least two hydroelectric plants on the right bank of the Vistula river, assuming that the electricity from hydroelectric plants will always be approximately in the range of about 10% of power needed by Poland. Construction of small and medium-sized hydroelectric power plants should also ber promoted from the local authorities and private funds. It is also essential to promote non-conventional energy sources such as wind energy and solar energy, but keeping in mind that in the Polish climate zone you cannot count on the full continuity and stability of supply from these sources. Such source can make up a supplement electricity supply for rural, less populated, less exploited areas, such as certain areas of Pomerania or areas of North-East where the climate is more continental. It might be predicted that, from such sources, Poland will not receive more than 3.5% (4%) of the required energy in the energy balance. It appears to be questionable, planning in any strategic aspect of energy from widely understood biomass, but in rural, low urban areas having wastelands can make use of energy crops (willow), but only as an ad hoc solution. Relatively low calorific value of such plants and huge problems with the cultivation, care, collection and re-sowing, allow to conclude that willow will not be the fuel of the future. Sewage sludge are also low in energy and give a particularly harmful emissions into the atmosphere and smell. However production of so-called biofuel from rape should be further developed, so that rape oil could at least partially complement the lack of oil, which will be in the near future, the most scarce resource of classical energy.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857429630

These receptors form a subgroup of ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the nuclear hormone receptor family. This review discusses a selection of novel PPAR functions identified during the last few years. The PPARs regulate processes that are essential for the maintenance of pregnancy and embryonic development. Newly found hepatic functions of PPARα are the mediation of female-specific gene repression and the protection of the liver from oestrogen induced toxicity. PPARα also controls lipid catabolism and is the target of hypolipidaemic drugs, whereas PPARγ controls adipocyte differentiation and regulates lipid storage; it is the target for the insulin sensitising thiazolidinediones used to treat type 2 diabetes. Activation of PPARβ/δ increases lipid catabolism in skeletal muscle, the heart and adipose tissue. In addition, PPARβ/δ ligands prevent weight gain and suppress macrophage derived inflammation. In fact, therapeutic benefits of PPAR ligands have been confirmed in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as encephalomyelitis and inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, PPARs promote skin wound repair. PPARα favours skin healing during the inflammatory phase that follows injury, whilst PPARβ/δ enhances keratinocyte survival and migration. Due to their collective functions in skin, PPARs represent a major research target for our understanding of many skin diseases. Taken altogether, these functions suggest that PPARs serve as physiological sensors in different stress situations and remain valuable targets for innovative therapies.","Inflammation; Metabolic syndrome; PPARs; Sexual dimorphism; Skin wound healing","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; antilipemic agent; chemokine receptor CCR2; chorionic gonadotropin; clofibrate; cytochrome P450; endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1; estrogen; fatty acid; gamma interferon; gemfibrozil; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; intercellular adhesion molecule 1 antibody; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; mitogen activated protein kinase; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; monocyte chemotactic protein 3; monocyte chemotactic protein 5; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; protein bcl 6; steroid; tumor necrosis factor alpha; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; adipophilin; antilipemic agent; ciglitazone; clofibrate; fenofibrate; gemfibrozil; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha agonist; progesterone; toll like receptor; troglitazone; abortion; adipocyte; bone density; bone mass; cell differentiation; cell migration; cell survival; cholesterol transport; cytokine production; embryo development; encephalomyelitis; energy metabolism; enteritis; enzyme metabolism; extramedullary hematopoiesis; gene expression; gene repression; gene targeting; inflammation; keratinocyte; lipid storage; lipolysis; lipophilicity; liver protection; liver toxicity; metabolic disorder; newborn mortality; osteoclast; phenotype; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; review; risk factor; sex difference; skin injury; Th2 cell; tissue injury; wound healing; adipose tissue; antiinflammatory activity; atherosclerosis; cell level; cell proliferation; dendritic cell; drug targeting; encephalomyelitis; enteritis; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid transport; fatty liver; fetus development; glucose homeostasis; homeostasis; hormone release; human; hypertriglyceridemia; insulin sensitivity; liver function; liver toxicity; macrophage; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; physical stress; physiological stress; placenta development; postnatal development; psoriasis; rheumatoid arthritis; skeletal muscle; sumoylation; T lymphocyte; Th1 cell; weight gain",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856008795

The effect on sheet properties as well as on paper machine forming conditions was evaluated on a pilot scale. A considerable increase in fibre curl was obtained as a result of the agitated storage. The effect was timedependant and most sheet properties were affected. In many respects the action was opposite to that of LC-refining. Both sheet-structure-related properties and mechanical properties were influenced. After 1 hour storage about 5 % of the tensile index was lost and after storage overnight about 15 % of the tensile index was lost. This loss was due both to a decrease in density and to a less efficient activation of the fibres during drying. The dewatering characteristics on the paper machine were improved in relation to the lower density. To reach the same tensile index, 60 Nm/g, if agitated storage were a part of the stock approach system, the refining energy would need to be increased from 45 k\Vh/t to 85 kWh/t to compensate for 1 hour storage and to 185 kWh/t to compensate for storage overnight. At the same time, the dryness after wet pressing would be reduced from 42,7 % to 39,5 %. The tear-tensile relationship was not affected, neither was the sheet uniformity. Classification of fibre shape using a light microscope indicated that the increase in fibre curl was due to a development of fibre twist to include a change in the direction of the fibre axis, which reduced the effective fibre length in the sheet and opened up the fibre network. The mechanism is believed to be that the modest mechanical treatment activates the inherent potential of the fibres to twist.","Fiber curl; Paper properties; Pulp storage; Refining; Runnability","Bleaching; Cleaning; Fibers; Kraft pulp; Paper products; Papermaking; Papermaking machinery; Refining; Softwoods; Bleached kraft pulps; Bleached softwood kraft pulp; Fiber curl; Mechanical treatments; Paper properties; Pulp storage; Runnability; Stock approach systems; Pulp refining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855556067

Thus, some nano-composite materials were prepared by mixing a PCM with large latent heats with epoxy resin and Al powder. Some polyethylene glycols of different molecular weights (1000, 1500, and 2000) were used as PCMs. Subsequently these PCM-epoxy composites were thermo-physically characterized by DSC measurements and found to be suitable for building applications due to their large latent heat, appropriate phase change temperature and good performance stability.

A number of proven CSP technologies were identified and a technology screening was performed to identify suitable technologies for possible implementation, for a reference output of 120 kW(e). From these, a number of systems were chosen for more detailed evaluation and the hourly energy production of these systems was analysed, using local weather data. The Compound Linear Fresnel Reflector system (CLFR) proved to be most suitable because of the space and cost benefits it offers. Systems that integrate organic Rankine cycles (ORC) as well as thermal storage and hybridisation were also investigated. The levelised cost of electricity (LEC) was predicted to be between R4.31 and R3.18 per kWh. Currently these technologies cannot compete financially with the price of local, fossil produced electricity, but with the increase in electricity tariffs and demand for clean reliable power CSP technologies, may become competitive in distributed generation systems in urban areas.","Concentrating solar power; Distributed generation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053088594

This paper compares the use of electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) to that of NiMH-batteries in a 24 m long bi-articulated serial hybrid electric bus for public transportation in terms of fuel economy of the two systems. In order to analyze the influence of buffer size, the buffer-power ratio (ratio of maximum power of buffer and generator) is varied, while the overall power-to-weight ratio of the vehicle is held constant. As a reference, a diesel engine powered bus is simulated on the same driving mission. The vehicle designs are compared based on their optimal fuel economy, which is evaluated using dynamic programming. The results show that EDLCs outperform batteries for buffer-power ratios above 40%. This indicates that for the serial configuration, high buffer efficiency and specific power are more important than high energy density. In order to achieve better fuel economy than conventional, the hybrid is required to have a minimum buffer-power ratio, which is about 20% for urban driving, and 30% for mixed driving. The maximum fuel saving potential compared to conventional is about 16% for urban, and 8% for mixed driving. © 2010 IFAC.","Component sizing; Dynamic programming; Fuel optimal control; Hybrid vehicles","Buses; Diesel engines; Dynamic programming; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Electric traction; Fuel economy; Fuels; Nickel metal hydride batteries; Component sizing; Energy storage systems; Engine generator set; Fuel optimal; High energy densities; Hybrid electric bus; Power-to-weight ratios; Public transportation; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051908146

Besides the conventional cooling circuit for the engine, hybrid vehicles need cooling for the electrical drives and for the energy storage systems as well. The development of appropriate cooling systems has the consequence that the number of auxiliary components involved, the weight and above all the energy consumption is increased. Therefore in order to minimize the energy consumption an optimal strategy for the operation of the cooling aggregates is required. In this paper an approach for finding the optimal control strategy of the electric auxiliaries over an apriori defined driving cycle is introduced. An energy minimization problem with constraints given by the maximum allowed temperature of the components is stated. This problem is based on a nonlinear mathematical model of the cooling system. It is shown how the nonlinear continuous time model can be equivalently replaced by a suitable linear discrete time model where some of the variables are confined to take integer values. This allows us to cast the optimization problem as a mixed integer linear program. The proposed approach is demonstrated by an example. For this purpose a cooling system is considered where an electrically driven water pump and an electric cooling fan are involved. As a result the optimal interaction of the water pump and the fan is computed such that the energy consumption of these components is minimized subject to given temperature constraints. © 2010 IFAC.","Cooling systems; Efficiency enhancement; Energy minimization; Mixed-integer linear programming; Optimal control","Automobile cooling systems; Continuous time systems; Cooling; Cooling systems; Energy utilization; Fuel economy; Hybrid vehicles; Optimal control systems; Thermoelectric equipment; Efficiency enhancement; Energy minimization; Energy minimization problem; Mixed integer linear program; Mixed integer linear programming; Nonlinear mathematical model; Optimal control strategy; Optimal controls; Integer programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051891067

In this paper effect of distributed generation (DG) unit converter's fault behavior to low voltage (LV) microgrid protection during island operation is studied in some specific cases through simulation studies with PSCAD simulation software. When protection of islanded microgrid is designed one of the most important questions is how converter based DG units will contribute to the fault current feeding.

Starch represents the major plant storage carbohydrate providing energy during the times of heterotrophic growth. Starch metabolism has been studied extensively, leading to a good knowledge of the numerous enzymes involved. In contrast, understanding of the regulation of starch metabolism is fragmentary. This review summarises briefly the known steps in starch metabolism, highlighting recent discoveries. We also focus on evidence for potential regulatory mechanisms of the enzymes involved. These mechanisms include allosteric regulation by metabolites, redox regulation, protein-protein interactions and reversible protein phosphorylation. Modern systems biology and bioinformatic approaches are uncovering evidence for extensive posttranslational protein modifications that may underlie enzyme regulation and identify novel proteins which may be involved in starch metabolism. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

One way of reducing CO2 emissions is to replace conventional (hydrocarbon fuels) energy sources for heating buildings by geothermal energy. Recently it was suggested to co-inject carbon dioxide with cold water for simultaneous geothermal energy production and subsurface carbon dioxide storage. Our data correspond to a geothermal energy project proposed for heating the buildings of the Technical University of Delft. After injection of the water/CO2 mixture a complex interaction between physical transport and the phase redistribution of the components, i.e., water and CO2, occurs. This redistribution is usually described in terms of local thermodynamic equilibrium. There are no published complete analytical solutions for 1-D problems involving complex thermodynamics that include CO2 and heat effects in the flow. We take into account the heat effects related to the cold fluid injection and related to the dissolution of CO2. We give an analytical solution for the model equations for the temperature and for the flow of CO2, vapor and water after combined injection of a cold carbon dioxide-water mixture in a geothermal reservoir. Due to high pressures and temperatures, CO2 is in a supercritical state and it is necessary to determine the phase equilibrium for non-ideal gases. We used a modification of the Peng-Robinson equation of state and an activity coefficient based mixing rule for the thermodynamic calculations. A volume shift procedure is applied to obtain an accurate liquid density. The structure of the solution depends strongly on the injection and initial reservoir conditions. The application of the work is in the effective recovery of heat from geothermal reservoirs with simultaneous CO2 storage. Moreover, the theory provides fundamental understanding of non-isothermal flow of mixtures undergoing mass transfer between phases. The advantage of the analytical model is that it provides a simple methodology to screen injection conditions for optimal geothermal recovery or maximal storage of carbon dioxide.

On the other hand, the ever increasing need of energy; necessary for economic growth, and the expected strategical reliance on fossil fuels and coal as a major energy source in the foreseeable future, will definitely lead to a dramatic increase in carbon generation. Eventually, an effective mitigating action can only be achieved by capturing the carbon release, or emission, to atmosphere rather than by cutting-down carbon generation. Even though the full scale deployment of integrated CCS facilities is still immature, yet it is very promising. The technical feasibility of the component technologies has been proven successful. Applications such as Carbon Capture in large ammonia plants, CO2 transportation via pipelines and transport ships and Carbon injection for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) are already in operation. The real challenge for constructing &amp; operating CCS facilities is financial &amp; political rather than technical. Huge investments are required globally on a large scale and need to be economically and socially justified. It is estimated that building an associated Carbon Capturing facility along with a Power Generation plant may double the capital cost and increase the running cost up to 1.5 times, as a consequence it is thought that the price of electric power to be paid by the end-users will increase by at least 50%. This economic ""penalty"", sensed at the short term, will raise serious public concerns. Thus there is an urgent need to find feasible financial models for deploying CCS technology with the minimum cost possible. Such a task requires the design optimization of CCS facilities based on techno-economic models. Techno-economic models based on mathematical formulation for the partial components of CCS facilities are readily available in the literature, but still there is a necessity to integrate these component models together in a one analytical model to view the picture as a whole, after all, the complete CCS train will be operating synchronously as one train entity. Once such an integrated model is available, an optimization problem can be formulated, and a technically feasible and financially attractive solution can be found to achieve the minimum total cost with the optimum design variables. Cutting down costs will be enhanced with time, following the trend of the learning curve in this field. This paper presents a methodology for implementing design optimization of CCS facilities at the conceptual level by simulating various combinatory scenarios, for finding the most economically attractive &amp; technically feasible solution.

Optimum incident energy of carbon ions, C+, is up to 100 eV while the typical ion current densities during the film formation are in the mA/cm2 range.

Efficient oil production technologies Chain-drive pumping systems with 3-m and 6-m stroke length have been implemented in TATNEFT assets since 2002, and by the end of 2009, their number totaled to 1113, The systems show maximum efficiency in heavy oil wells and wells with emulsion-related problems, reducing specific energy consumption by up to 60%. Dual-completion systems find wide application in the development of new targets in marginal wells. This paper presents modified dual-completion systems deployed in 533 wells. Incremental oil production due to these systems has exceeded 1 million tons. A dual-injection technology was developed in 2007, and to date dual-injection systems have been deployed in 128 injectors. The new technology yielded 170 200 tons of cumulative incremental oil production. The overall operational benefit is the reduction of specific energy consumption per 1 ton of produced oil. In 2009 it made 119 kwh/ton, which is 4.7% lower as compared to 1998.

The plethora of endocrine and metabolic disturbances that hallmark critical illness may play a key role. The major part of our research performed during the period 2004-2009 focused on the disturbed glucose metabolism that commonly develops during critical illness. The onset of this research interest was the landmark randomized clinical study on strict blood glucose control (80-110 mg/ dl) with intensive insulin therapy performed by Prof. Van den Berghe and our clinical team members. This study, published in 2001 in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed reduced morbidity and improved survival with intensive insulin therapy versus toleration of hyperglycemia up to 215 mg/dl. This review summarizes our findings in both patients and animal models on mechanisms contributing to the clinical benefits of strict blood glucose control. Intensive insulin therapy appeared to lower blood glucose levels by ameliorating insulin sensitivity and stimulation of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, whereas hepatic insulin resistance was not affected. The therapy also improved the lipid profile and the immune response and attenuated inflammation. Maintenance of strict normoglycemia appeared essentially most important, rather than elevating insulin levels. Avoiding hyperglycemia protected the endothelium and the mitochondria. In our animal model, nutritional interventions counteracted the hypercatabolic state of critical illness and insulin improved myocardial contractility, but only when normoglycemia was maintained. Interestingly, we identified the adipose tissue as a functional storage depot for toxic metabolites during critical illness.",,"insulin; animal; blood; critical illness; disease model; energy metabolism; glucose blood level; human; hyperglycemia; intensive care; metabolism; methodology; mortality; multiple organ failure; physiology; review; survival; treatment outcome; Animals; Blood Glucose; Critical Care; Critical Illness; Disease Models, Animal; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Insulin; Multiple Organ Failure; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952111565

Box 2250, Haifa 31021, Israel","Starting of turbine engines is often required under ambient temperature and pressure that are far from their design values. Under such conditions, less air enters the combustion chamber, precluding more fuel to be burned, and making it difficult to produce sufficient energy to accelerate the engine up to idle speed. Common solutions introduce additional oxygen into the combustion chamber to enable more fuel to burn and improve the combustion efficiency, thus providing more energy to the hot gas driving the turbine to accelerate the rotor. Adding oxygen also enables faster and more reliable starting of turbine engines, even under adverse ambient conditions. Conventional oxygen-addition units require storage and supply systems, which pose a great problem for small turbine engines, where space and weight requirements are typically tight, and reliable starting is often needed. The novel approach presented in this paper uses an external module that supplies hot oxygen-rich gas to the combustion chamber, thus providing both oxygen enrichment and ignition of the air-fuel mixture. Consequently, the starting capability of the engine is enhanced. The module's exterior location enables easy replacement and/or retrofit. Several modes of implementation and their combination are considered. One implementation may use the hot discharge from a pyrotechnic igniter to thermally decompose a solid oxidizer grain, which releases hot oxygen-rich gaseous products. Another implementation may utilize a uniform oxygen-rich solid-propellant grain, releasing hot oxygen-rich combustion products. Preliminary tests with GAP/KP/AP-based oxygen-rich propellant compositions were conducted. © 2010 by Begell House, Inc.","Gas turbine; Igniter; Propellant; Solid oxidizer","Combustion chambers; Diesel engines; Electric generators; Engines; Fuels; Gas generators; Gas turbines; Ignition; Oxygen; Propellants; Solid propellants; Ambient conditions; Combustion efficiencies; Igniter; Oxygen enrichment; Pyrotechnic igniters; Solid oxidizers; Solid propellant grains; Temperature and pressures; Oxygen supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651537962

In a conventional IGCC design without carbon capture, the syngas is purified for dust and hydrogen sulphide removal and then sent to a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) for power production. Carbon capture technology is expected to play a significant role in the coming decades for curbing the greenhouse gas emissions. IGCC is one of the power generation technologies having the highest potential to capture carbon dioxide with the low penalties in term of efficiency and cost. In a modified IGCC design for carbon capture, the syngas is catalytically shifted to maximize the hydrogen level in the syngas and to concentrate the carbon species in the form of carbon dioxide that can be later capture in a pre-combustion arrangement. After carbon dioxide capture, the hydrogen-rich syngas can be either purified in a Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) unit and exported to the external customers (e.g. PEM fuel cells) or used in a CCGT for power generation. This paper investigates the most important energy integration issues for hydrogen and electricity co-production scheme based on coal gasification process with carbon capture and storage (CCS).

The proposed design methodology involves the development of a power management strategy to determine all the feasible ways of dispatching power among the employed sub-systems. This is used in conjunction with an optimization method that considers design variables in the form of structural and operating parameters, as they directly affect the system performance. To emulate realistic operating conditions, the proposed design methodology is coupled with a systematic method to enable the efficient incorporation of uncertainties stemming from frequent external and internal system variations. Such uncertainties involve the fluctuating solar radiation and wind speed as well as the efficiency of the various energy conversion subsystems.

Little is known about the way patients with schizophrenia use the Internet when it comes to issues related to their illness. Data on their specific needs, difficulties, and the consequences related to Internet use are lacking. Objective: Our objective was to investigate the nature and subjective consequences of health-related Internet use among patients with schizophrenia. Methods: In all, 26 individual semistructured interviews were conducted and analyzed qualitatively in groups of 4 until theoretical saturation was achieved. Results: Study results suggest that the Internet is an influential source of illness-related information for patients with schizophrenia. Many aspects of their behavior around the Internet resemble those of individuals not afflicted by mental illness. Importantly, problems specific to patients with schizophrenia were stimulus overflow, an inability to deal with the abundance of information, difficulties with concentration, lack of energy, paranoid ideas, symptom provocation, and the need to distance themselves from illness-related topics as part of the recovery process. Internet information was subjectively perceived as having the potential to significantly change patients' attitudes toward medication and their relationships with doctors. Conclusions: These findings provide insight into how individuals with schizophrenia handle illness-related Internet information. The data could contribute to the continuous development of Internet-based interventions and offer novel approaches to optimizing traditional treatment options.","Attitudes; Behaviors; Internet; Psychosis; Schizophrenia","article; computer assisted therapy; consumer; health care delivery; human; information dissemination; information retrieval; information seeking; Internet; methodology; schizophrenia; social support; statistics; utilization review; Consumer Satisfaction; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Information Dissemination; Information Seeking Behavior; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; Schizophrenia; Social Support; Therapy, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651290688

The specimens with different pre-strain directions were prepared and the ratio of the stored energy increment to plastic work increment, called energy storage rate, as a function of plastic strain was experimentally determined. At the initial stage of plastic deformation of annealed materials this quantity vs. plastic strain has a maximum. It has been shown that for specimens strained in the same direction as pre-strain the energy storage rate decreases monotonically with deformation while for specimens where strain path was changed, the maximum of the energy storage rate is observed (as in case of annealed material). The study of slip and microstructure evolution at meso- and micro-scales have shown that the change in pre-strain direction leads to the redistribution of internal stresses generated by incompatible slip in neighbouring grains of different orientation. Just after change in strain direction the accommodation of these stresses takes place not only by generation of geometrically necessary dislocations but also by micro-shear banding. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Austenite; Austenitic steel; Energy storage; Microstructure; Plastic deformation; Storage (materials); Annealed materials; Geometrically necessary dislocations; Micro-structure evolutions; Plastic work; Shear banding; Stored energy; Strain paths; Uniaxial tensions; Strain rate",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651102562

It was found that surface relief gratings (SRG) can be recorded by red light. Usually shorter wavelengths are used to induce the trans-cis photo-isomerization in organic materials. SRG with 2 μm period and an amplitude of 130 nm have been recorded with 0.88 W/cm 2 light in about 20 minutes in amorphous films of 3-(4-(bis(2-(trityloxy)ethyl)amino)phenyl)-2-(4-(2-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)diazenyl) phenyl)acrylonitrile spin-coated on glass substrates. Self-diffraction efficiency up to 17.4% and specific recording energy down to 114 J/(cm 2%) were measured. The recorded SRG were stable as proved by subsequent AFM measurements. The photo-induced changes in absorption spectra did not reveal noticeable signs of trans-cis transformations. Rather, spectrally uniform bleaching of the films took place. We conclude that a photothermally stimulated photo-destruction of chromophores is responsible for the SRG recording. The recording of stable SRG in the stilbene azobenzene derivatives we studied is accompanied by the recording of relaxing volume-phase gratings due to the photo-orientation of chromophores by the linearly polarized recording light. It should also be noted that holographic recording efficiency in stilbene azobenzene derivatives exhibit an unusual non-monotonic sample storage-time dependence presumably caused by the peculiarities of structural relaxation of the films. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Azobenzene; Chromophores; Diffraction gratings; Holography; Spin glass; Substrates; Azobenzene derivatives; Holographic recordings; Linearly polarized; Organic materials; Photoinduced change; Shorter wavelength; Surface relief gratings; Uniform bleaching; Amorphous films",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651089499

Radiation induced chemical reactions take place in the material creating and/or enhancing absorption bands in the visible and/or ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. The response of most films used in routine dosimetry is usually influenced by the environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, ligth), dose rate and post irradiation storage. Several film dosimeters are commercially available for the absorbed dose measurements, in this work the effects of dose rate changes in optical density (OD) of film dosimeters (polymethylmetacrylate - PMMA and polycarbonate - PC) were investigated and compared. Polycarbonates has been investigated as a new dosimetric material for industrial radiation processing aiming low cost, easy handle, fast and accurate response. PMMA dosimeters has been used routinely in dosimetry. The dose rate (kGy h-1) may influence the dosimeter response and appropriate corrections are necessary. The dosimeters were irradiated with 60Co gamma-radiation at dose rate in the range 0.26 - 2.6 kGy h-1 and with electrons from accelerator with maximum energy of 1.5 MeV and dose rate between 4.19 and 33.59 kGy s-1 to absorbed doses of 5 and 15 kGy, respectively. The irradiated dosimeters were measured using Shimadzu UV-2101PC spectrophotometer. It can be observed that the films shows moderate dose-rate dependence (about 10%) in the analised range. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Dosimeters; Dosimetry; Polycarbonates; Radiation chemistry; Spectrophotometers; Accurate response; Comparative studies; Dose rate dependence; Environmental conditions; Polymethylmetacrylate; Radiation processing; Radiation-induced; Ultraviolet region; Polymethyl methacrylates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651082054

The stored energy is the change in internal energy due to plastic deformation after specimen unloading. Hence, this energy describes the state of the cold-worked material. Whereas, the ratio of the stored energy increment to the appropriate increment of plastic work is the measure of energy conversion process. This ratio is called the energy storage rate. Experimental results show that the energy storage rate is dependent on plastic strain. This dependence is influenced by different microscopic deformation mechanisms. It has been shown that the energy storage rate can be presented as a sum of particular components. Each of them is related to the separate internal microscopic mechanism. Two of the components are identified. One of them is the storage rate of statistically stored dislocation energy related to uniform deformation. Another one is connected with non-uniform deformation at the grain level. It is the storage rate of the long range stresses energy and geometrically necessary dislocation energy. The maximum of energy storage rate, that appeared at initial stage of plastic deformation is discussed in terms of internal micro-stresses. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Energy conversion; Energy storage; Plastic deformation; Single crystals; Unloading; Cold-worked materials; Experimental approaches; Geometrically necessary dislocations; Microscopic deformations; Microscopic mechanisms; Non-uniform deformation; Statistically stored dislocations; Uniform deformation; Storage (materials)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651076424

The needed rapid field variations of these high energy magnets require large energy bursts. If these bursts are taken from and fed back to the utility grid, its voltage is distorted and the quality of the electricity degrades. In addition, these bursts may decrease operation life time of generators and extra arrangements may be required by the electricity producers. Thus, an energy storage is an essential component for a cost-effective particle accelerator.

The integration of multiple features on devices with limited resources requires careful and exhaustive exploration of the design search space in order to efficiently map modern applications to an embedded multi-processor platform. The MNEMEE project [1] addresses this challenge by offering a unique integrated tool flow that performs source-to-source transformations to automatically optimize the original source code and map it on the target platform. The optimizations aim at reducing the number of memory accesses and the required memory storage of both dynamically and statically allocated data. Furthermore, the MNEMEE tool flow performs optimal assignment of all data on the memory hierarchy of the target platform. Overall, the MNEMEE techniques embedded in it will lead to more cost efficient systems that offer a better performance and lower energy consumption. This tutorial gives an overview of the MNEMEE tool flow. The objective of the tutorial is to familiarize the audience with the tool framework and the optimizations used in the individual tools. The tutorial also features a demonstration of the tool flow. This demonstration shows that the tools developed in the MNEMEE project provide a user-friendly and efficient framework for MPSoC programming and memory management.","Automatic parallelization; Embedded software; Memory management; MPSoc design","Digital storage; Embedded software; Energy utilization; Integrated circuit design; Memory architecture; Multiprocessing systems; System-on-chip; Systems analysis; Automatic Parallelization; Memory management; Modern applications; MPSoC designs; Multi-processor platforms; Multiple features; Optimal assignment; Source-to-source transformations; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650630845

The market participants are modelled as price-elastic units, price-inelastic units, and storage operators. The distributed control algorithm determines prices over a time horizon through a negotiation procedure in order to maximize social welfare while satisfying network constraints. A simple flow allocation method is used to assign responsibility for constraint violations on the network to individual units and a control rule is then used to adjust nodal prices accordingly. Such a framework is appropriate for the inclusion of aggregated household appliances or other 'virtual' market participants realized through smart grid infrastructure. Results are examined in detail for a 4-bus network and then success is demonstrated for a densely-populated 39-bus network. Formal convergence requirements are given under a restricted subset of the demonstrated conditions.

Also most of the distributed generation (DG) units that will be connected to the low voltage (LV) microgrid in the future are converter interfaced and have limited fault current feeding capabilities. This means that the traditional fuse protection of LV network alone is no longer applicable and new protection methods must be developed. In this paper new smart protection concept for LV microgrid is proposed in which for example LV feeders are protected in addition of traditional fuses with protective relays that have adaptive multi-criteria algorithms and fast standard IEC 61850 based communication capabilities. One of the most important issues is to ensure that the behavior that is required from DG units, including fault-ride-through (FRT) needs, during faults in microgrid during normal and island operation is compatible with the developed microgrid protection concept.

Different methods for improved integration - by increasing the direct use of the local generation - have been modeled and investigated. These are: the adaption of the generation profile, changing the shape of the demand due to the mixture of the usage of the building, and applying electrical storage.

The situation in Croatia is similar. In 2007 import dependence was 53.1%, while for 2030 it is predicted to reach 72%. Such import dependence leads to decreased security of energy supply, due to current geopolitical situation in which main sources of fossil fuels are in unstable regions and in which the competition for those resources from developing countries is growing. EU energy strategy, and a compatible Croatian strategy, is focused on policies and measures that will bring increase of share of renewable and distributed energy sources, increase in energy efficiency and energy savings and decrease in green house gas emissions. The results of previous research has shown that in order to increase efficiency and viability, there is need for energy storage, in the primary or secondary form, in order to transfer energy surplus form period of excess to the period when there is a lack. The problem of storage systems is that they increase the cost of already expensive distributed and renewable energy sources, making them, in market circumstances, even less economically viable. Although there are a number of storage technologies, as chemical, potential or heat energy, not all those technologies are optimal for each energy system.

Two gasoline samples with different hydrocarbons content were analyzed for this study. The effect of temperature, the influence of content and type of alcohol on the water tolerance has been determined. The experimental study was carried out at different temperatures between 268 K and 303 K. Several key factors have been taken into account regarding water tolerance: the chemical structure and alcohol content, the temperature, the characteristics of base gasoline. The reformulated gasoline with higher alcohols lead to lower aqueous phase separation in the storage or distribution fuel system compared with ethanol in case of temperature changes due to summer/winter or day/night period.

However, one of the biggest drawbacks to renewable energy generation, particularly wind-generated electricity is that it is an intermittent and a variable source of power. Even at the "" best"" sites wind varies dramatically from hour to hour and minute to minute. This leads to two main problems:. 1) When the wind drops below a lower limit or goes above a higher limit the turbine can shut down and electricity is not produced.2) Energy is not stored when there is an excess of electricity generated on site.Because of these problems wind power has a very low capacity credit and backup power is needed to handle the large fluctuation of production.This paper introduces the current energy system in Ireland and the targets that Irish operators are to achieve in the next decade. A review of energy storage options for Ireland is outlined including the use of hydrogen and fuel cell technology. It is concluded that a project similar to the Norwegian Utsira wind/hydrogen project could be piloted in Ireland and a site similar to Dundalk Institute of Technology could be used to demonstrate and test the system. Going forward to achieve high levels of renewable energy generation, similar distributed wind/hydrogen hybrid systems could reduce the need for curtailment of wind farms, save wasted energy, reduce backup power, reduce transmission losses, generate large revenue by selling power at peak times, ensure security of supply and reduce the need for costly interconnects to Europe. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Hydrogen; Ireland; PEM fuel cell; Renewable energy storage; Wind energy","Electric grounding; Electric utilities; Flywheels; Fuel storage; Hybrid computers; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Uninterruptible power systems; Wind power; Back-up power; Capacity credit; Current energy; Fuel cell technologies; Ireland; Lower limits; Peak time; PEM fuel cell; Power needs; Renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Security of supply; Shut down; Sustainable energy supply; Transmission loss; Wind energy; Wind farm; Wind resources; Electric generators; electricity generation; fuel cell; future prospect; hydrogen; natural resource; renewable resource; sustainable development; wind power; Ireland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649893093

They have an irreplaceable role in crop sequences and in preserving the cultural character of the countryside, above all due to the fact that they improve soil fertility and microbial life in the soil and that they have an excellent pre-produce value, and, at the same time, they are applied in various farming systems (both conventional and ecological) and in various climatic conditions, and agricultural businesses are well equipped for growing, harvesting and storing them. In the Czech Republic, the area of fodder crops grown on arable soil was decreased from 1,019.9 thousand hectares to mere 396.7 thousand hectares between 1980 and 2009, which is 15.6 % of the total area of arable soil whereas perennial fodder plants only take up 8.5 %. Fodder from clover crops and clover-grass growths on arable soil are one of the main resources of voluminous fodder for dairy cows. Most of this fodder is preserved through a fermentation process (silages, hay storage); a smaller part is fed as fresh fodder, or serves for production of hay. Silages made with perennial fodder plants are the most important source of both proteins and other nutrients for ruminants, especially for high-yielding milch cows. The basis of fodder production systems are the conservative elements of the landscape area (geomorphology) in combination with the progressive elements (weather conditions, plants and human labour) and relict ones, the representative of which is the soil. The fodder production systems in Europe are divided into five main fodder production zones. From this point of view, the areas where short-term clover-grass mixtures are grown on arable soil could be classed with Zone 4, i.e. intensive fodder production and cattle breeding. This characterisation corresponds with the Vysočina Region (the Czech Republic), which is the focus of our work even though extensive breeding can be found in this area on a smaller scale as well. Therefore, our aim was to verify the production and qualitative parameters of the fodder crops and mixtures included in the test in chosen agricultural businesses in the Vysočina Region and to recommend the most suitable variant for the given area. A statistically significant correlative relationship (P < 0.05) was proved between the net energy for lactation contents and the percentage of organic matter digestibility. The evaluation of the production parameters evidently shows the favourable influence of the grass component part or of intergeneric hybrids on the stability of dry matter yield per hectare as well as on the stability of individual nutrients.","Crude protein; Cutting frequency; Forage quality; Intergeneric hybrids; Legume-grass mixtures; Net energy for lactation; Organic matter digestibility","Animalia; Bos; Bovidae; Poaceae; Trifolium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649775147

The distributed energy system utilizes cleaning waste of a fish processing plant to produce biodiesel. The biodiesel is used to produce the locally needed cooling/freezing and heating energy. In addition, a power surplus is generated for the electricity network or local industrial use. The research contribution focuses on optimisation, simulation, validation and planning of piloted concepts. A energy integration auditing and optimisation tools are being developed to carry out feasibility studies for the fishery industry. The advanced CO2 based freezing/cooling system requires optimization and control system planning of special high-pressure equipments. The final biodiesel will be tested in appropriate engines. With a view to marketing possibilities the demonstration will take place in Vietnam. In the demonstration case, the main product of the fish processing plant is catfish filet (about 40 t/d). The fat content of 22 per cent in the fish cleaning waste results in a production of biodiesel of about 13 t/d. A part of the biodiesel is used to produce electricity for the locally needed cooling/freezing (0.3 MW) and heating (1,3 MW) energy. In addition, a power surplus (0,8 MW) is generated for the local industrial use. Fish farming and processing plants in Vietnam produce frozen fish fillet with capacity from some tonnes per day to dozens tonnes/day. One third of fresh fish is yielded as fillet and the rest of fish is treated as fish cleaning wastes. There are some alternatives for utilisation of fish cleaning wastes, one of them is biodiesel and energy production at the own factory. The energy demand at the fish processing factory is dominated by cooling and freezing facilities. 80 % of electricity consumed at the factory is supplied for cooling/freezing compressors, and the cold energy of low temperatures is needed in freezing and cold storage facilities of fillet. Cooling energy of about zero degrees is needed for space cooling of production halls. The specific electricity consumption is about 400 kWh per tonne fresh fish, or 1400 kWh per tonne fish fillet. The electricity load is typically very steady over a day and a year in the Vietnamese conditions. From the energy viewpoint the fish processing plant is energy self-sufficient, when the fish waste oil is processed in a biodiesel processor and further converted to electricity. In addition to this, a part of biodiesel can be sold to the fuel market. The fish processing factory producing fish fillet of 40 ton/day consumes electricity average at a power of 2 MW. 11 ton/day biodiesel is needed for that power production and a surplus biodiesel of 2 ton/day is available for fuel market. At the same time, diesel engine plant generates heat energy at a capacity of 2,6 MW, which is also available. The other end in possibilities of poly-generation is to generate all biodiesel, 13 ton/day, to the fuel market.In Vietnam, electricity and diesel fuel prices are very low being for electricity average 42,6 €/MWh for industry customers, and diesel fuel costs 400 €/ton. This results in shutdown of private electricity production (except during electricity blackout), even if cogeneration heat could be utilized. And the markets for biodiesel should be found outside Vietnam. According to the calculations and assumptions presented in this report, biodiesel production from fish cleaning wastes is profitable, and the payback period of the investment seems to be very short. However, more information on the technical and economical performances related to the operation and equipments are needed.",,"Biodiesel; Cleaning; Cold storage; Commerce; Cooling; Costs; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Electric power utilization; Fish; Fish products; Fisheries; Freezing; Investments; Planning; Plant shutdowns; Renewable energy resources; Thermal management (electronics); Cold-storage facilities; Distributed energy systems; Electricity networks; Electricity production; Electricity-consumption; High pressure equipment; Optimization and control; Renewable energy source; Electric power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649539355

Reliably operating solar-energy systems composing of solar arrays and their interfacing converters are of prime importance to maximize solar-energy harvesting. The main obstacle for the improvements in the reliability is turned out to be the lack of full understanding of the solar-generator interfacing. The paper investigates the interfacing in terms of voltage-fed maximum-power-point (MPP) tracking converters. The investigations confirm that there are two reasons for the observed problems of which the one is the violation of Kirchhoff 's current law governing the operation of a solar generator and the other is the phenomenon known as negative resistance oscillation (NRO) causing instability. In practice, this means that the voltage-fed converter can reliably operate only at the voltages higher than the maximum-power-point (MPP) voltage. Practical evidence is provided based on a coupledinductor superbuck converter supplied by a real solar panel and loaded with a storage battery.","Current source; Maximum power point; Solar generator; Stability; Voltage source; Voltage-fed converter","Climate change; Convergence of numerical methods; Electric generators; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy harvesting; Maximum power point trackers; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Current sources; Maximum power point; Solar generator; Voltage source; Voltage-fed converter; Power converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649510352

Two methods of control were considered: constant local blade momentum coefficient (oscillatory jet) and constant turbine momentum coefficient (steady jet). The net turbine power output was calculated by accounting for the pumping power required to drive the slot blowing system. The results show great potential for flow control by jet blowing using all methods and approaches. The best net performance increase, namely a factor of 3 in annual energy production, was achieved by means of pulsed blowing using a constant blade momentum coefficient, deployed on both sides of the blade. The simplest of all the methods, namely constant turbine momentum coefficient via a single slot, resulted in 60% increase in annual energy production. © 2010 by David Greenblatt and Binyamin Sasson.",,"Digital storage; Flow control; Momentum; Turbomachine blades; Annual energy productions; Blade-element theory; Momentum coefficient; Naca 0012; Pumping power; Steady jet; Turbine power; Vertical axis wind turbines; Wind turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649502515

In fact, the exploitation of the new well reserves engendered an important increase of the quantities of oil and gas to be treated. One of the major issues associated to this evolution was to optimise the process and to consider environmental impact. The purpose of this work consists on the application of the ejector technology in real case. The ejector is a pump-like device that uses the Venturi effect of a converging-diverging nozzle. It converts the pressure energy of a driver fluid to velocity energy. A low pressure zone is created and entrains a suction fluid. After passing through the throat of the injector, the mixed fluid expands and the velocity is reduced, thus recompressing the mixed fluids by converting velocity energy back into pressure energy. ENI Tunisia had previous experience using the ejector technology in Oued Zar plant. The Ejector design is specific. It's intended to suit an individual case requirement for maximum operating efficiency. Thus, for the conceptual phase, first step of the project, real field data (the gas outgoing of separator and the driver gas characteristics) are required. This information is obtained by CPG analyses and pressure measurement. Then, the performance of ejector is evaluated for different drive flow. The second step consists on field installation. The ejector started up in December 2006. The excellent results obtained during the test were confirmed. The ejector is still working with high performance and very low maintenance cost. This experience confirms the first field installation of ejector was successfully accomplished in the Oued Zar oilfield in 2006 and encourages using it for other similar projects. © 2010, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Digital storage; Environmental impact; Proven reserves; Conceptual phase; Converging-diverging nozzles; Ejector designs; Gas characteristics; Low maintenance; Low pressure zone; Operating efficiency; Pressure energies; Ejectors (pumps)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149371962

Nutritional, environmental and genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. This disease is considered a public health problem because of its potential to develop liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Many data support the evidence that oxidant stress may not only cause fat accumulation but also contribute to the progression of NAFLD to NASH (non alcoholic steatohetatitis). The pathogenesis of NAFLD is not totally understood, but the insulin resistance plays an important role. Mitochondria are organites of the eukaryotic cells which generate energy in the oxidative- phosphorylation system (the mitochondrial respiratory chain - MRC). The hepatocytes contain about 800 mitochondria and here is the primary site for the oxidation of free fatty acids (FFA) and for the oxidative phosphorylation. It is known that a decreased capacity to oxidize fatty acids, an increased delivery and transport of FFA into the liver and augmented hepatic synthesis, all play a significant role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Knowing the cellular mechanisms of producing and developing of NAFLD is very important and opens new perspectives in early diagnoses and prognoses of this disease.

The ghrelin receptor is characterized by an ability to signal even without any ligand present with approximately 50% of the maximally ghrelin-induced efficacy-a feature that may have important physiological implications. The high basal signaling can be modulated either by administration of specific ligands or by engineering of mutations in the receptor structure. [D-Arg 1 , D-Phe 5 , D-Trp 7,9 , Leu 11 ]-substance P was the first inverse agonist to be identified for the ghrelin receptor, and this peptide has been used as a starting point for identification of the structural requirements for inverse agonist properties in the ligand. The receptor binding core motif was identified as D-Trp-Phe-D-Trp-Leu-Leu, and elongation of this peptide in the amino-terminal end determined the efficacy. Attachment of a positively charged amino acid was responsible for full inverse agonism, whereas an alanin converted the peptide into a partial agonist. Importantly, by use of mutational mapping of the residues critical for the modified D-Trp-Phe-D-Trp-Leu-Leu peptides, it was found that space-generating mutations in the deeper part of the receptor improved inverse agonism, whereas similar mutations located in the more extracellular part improved agonism. Modulation of the basal signaling by mutations in the receptor structure is primarily obtained by substitutions in an aromatic cluster that keep TMs VI and VII in close proximity to TM III and thus stabilize the active conformation. Also, substitution of a Phe in TM V is crucial for the high basal activity of the receptor as this residue serves as a partner for Trp VI:13 in the active conformation. It is suggested that inverse agonist and antagonist against the ghrelin receptor provide an interesting possibility in the development of drugs for treatment of obesity and diabetes and that improved structural understanding of the receptor function facilitates the drug development. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",,"alanine; aspartic acid; calcium ion; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; diacylglycerol; ghrelin receptor; ghrelin receptor 1a; ghrelin receptor 1b; ghrelin receptor agonist; ghrelin receptor antagonist; glutamic acid; guanine nucleotide binding protein; hormone receptor blocking agent; hormone receptor stimulating agent; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate; inositol monophosphatase; inositol phosphate; lithium ion; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; monoamine; mutant protein; neurotensin receptor; phosphatase; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate; phospholipase C; substance P [1 dextro arginine 5 dextro phenylalanine 7,9 dextro tryptophan 11 leucine]; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; amino acid substitution; amino terminal sequence; appetite; book; dephosphorylation; diabetes mellitus; drug efficacy; drug potency; drug receptor binding; energy expenditure; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme phosphorylation; gene locus; gene mutation; genetic variability; growth hormone release; human; inverse agonism; lipid storage; molecular weight; mutagenesis; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein conformation; protein degradation; protein engineering; protein motif; protein structure; receptor binding; reporter gene; signal transduction",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049237699

Liver histology, and hematological, biochemical and ICP-AES analysis were performed. Results: Complete blood count and acid-base balance were not affected by short and long term boron administration. Decreases in hepatic fat infiltration and visceral fat amount in spite of body weight gain were considerable. The most pronounced findings were significant changes in hepatic TAG concentration and antioxidant status, and lipid profile. High boron doses have been tolerated at 96 h intervals. Conclusion: High boron doses can be tolerated for a long time at 96 h intervals. Boron seems to be effective on hepatic and visceral fat accumulation.

Aiming to do so, different control strategies were developed and tested: (1) a local control approach where no communication link is required and (2) a centralized charging control solution. The local control approach is based on the measuring of EV terminal voltage and frequency in order to define the charging or discharging rates of the batteries. The centralized control strategy allows balancing single-phase loads connected to the microgrid by adapting the charging rates of the EV storage devices.

The stored thermal energy is released through a system of tubes to warm up housing at night. The thermal properties of ten rock types that occur widely in the north and northeast of Thailand were determined in the laboratory. A scaled-down model, simulating the storage system and housing, was constructed to monitor the temperature changes of the various system components and the results were compared with the predictions of mathematical models. Buriram basalt was selected for testing as it has the highest thermal conductivity and specific heat. The results indicate that throughout the night the system can increase the housing temperature to 4-6 °C more than the surroundings, depending on the packing density, tube size, and surrounding temperature.

EVs due to the storage capacity provided by the batteries can supply or store electricity when parked. At the same time the electric power grid and light vehicle fleet can be exceptionally complementary as systems for managing energy and power. In the case of isolated systems, such as the islands, the introduction of EVs could be very beneficial not only environmentally since they are competing directly with the internal combustion engine vehicles but also economically and in the energy mixture of the local system. But to drive these vehicles, it is necessary to have a charged battery. To assure this, an infrastructure system is needed, connected to the grid, that can provide a parking charge (so that EVs can charge at homes, offices, public parks, etc) and an ongoing charge (so that travellers can refill their EV power in a fast process, like a fast charging station or a switching battery facility). Fast charging is mainly for commercial and public applications and is intended to perform similarly to a commercial gasoline service station, aiming to achieve a 50% charge in an EV's battery in 10 to 15 minutes.

Energy savings or efficient production in air conditioning system is, therefore, crucial. In recent years, trigeneration systems, which provide electricity, heating and cooling, and thermal storage systems, which temporarily store cooling energy to smooth its production pattern, are attracting more attentions. These systems with different operating principles are usually designed based on nominal or peak loadings. With altering seasonal or day/night cooling demands, the performance and overall economics of the design may deprive. This work focuses on the design of a flexible and economical thermal energy production system by integrating trigeneration and cold storage techniques. The capacity determination of the main equipment units, their interconnections and operating conditions during different demand periods and electricity costs are discussed. A case study is used to demonstrate the system's merits to improve the air conditioning efficiency with overall investment and operating cost reductions under demand uncertainties. As demonstrated, the economic attractiveness of a thermal energy production system is sensitive to the electricity tariff used. Although a high degree of flexibility in meeting demand changes is usually introduced with a trigeneration system, its expensive investment cost makes it less economically attractive under the discounted electricity tariff. A hybrid system which produces thermal energy via both electricity and town gas is introduced. This hybrid allows operation mode switching according to the energy cost variations and ensures the best economic return. The sole dependence on network electricity can also be avoided and the process's operability can be enhanced. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Today, CO2 is normally separated with alkanolamines in aqueous solutions. These absorption processes are energy intensive and costly. Increased environmental considerations and the significant footprints of many energy sources warrant the development of new gas separation techniques for the competitive implementation of carbon capture and storage technologies. Improved adsorbent-mediated separation processes are candidates for such new low-energy low-cost processes. In this study, porous silica-based adsorbents with amine-like motifs were synthesized. The temperature-and pressure-dependent adsorption of CO2 and CO2/H2O mixtures were determined and compared for these materials.

Some hard disk drives support acoustic modes, meaning they can be configured to reduce the acceleration and velocity of the disk head. This reduces instantaneous power consumption but sacrifices performance. As a result, input/output (I/O) operations run longer at reduced power. This is useful for power capping since it causes significant reduction in peak power consumption of the disks. We conducted experiments on several disk drives that support acoustic management. Most of these disk drives support only two modes - quiet and normal. We ran different I/O workloads, including SPC-1 to simulate a real-world online transaction processing workload. We found that the reduction in peak power can reach up to 23% when using quiet mode. We show that for some workloads this translates into a reduction of 12.5% in overall energy consumption. In other workloads we encountered the opposite phenomenon-an increase of more than 6% in the overall energy consumption.",,"Drives; Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Hard disk storage; Achieving it; Hard Disk Drive; Input/output operations; Instantaneous power; Online transaction processing; Power capping; Real-world; Side effect; Power management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957834869

It is beneficial for fuel consumption to optimize the velocity trajectory in two ways; i) to assist the driver in tracking an optimal velocity trajectory (e.g. input to an Adaptive Cruise Controller); ii) to estimate the future power request trajectory which can be used to optimize the hybrid components use. Taking advantage of satellite navigation, together with the vehicles current mass and road load parameters, an optimization problem is formulated, and solved for a driver defined time constraint.

It requires communication between the so-called metabolic organs, including the central nervous system (CNS), the pancreas, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the liver. For example, nutrients stimulate the pancreas and adipose tissue to secrete hormones such as insulin and leptin, respectively. The hypothalamus in the CNS in turn integrates hormonal and nutrient signals to control energy uptake (appetite), storage, and expenditure. As a nutrient, hormone and energy sensor active in all metabolic organs, mTOR plays a central role in mediating energy homeostasis.

This method causes a significant increase of the internal load and decreases the efficiency of the entire system. It is therefore necessary to look for new methods of carbon dioxide capture. The authors of the present paper propose the use of membrane separation. The paper reviews available membranes for use in IGCC systems, indicates, inter alia, possible places of their implementation in the system and the required operation parameters. Attention is drawn to the most important parameters of membranes (among other selectivity and permeability) influencing the cost and performance of the whole installation. Numerical model of a membrane was used, among others, to analyze the influence of the basic parameters of the selected membranes on the purity and recovery ratio of the obtained permeate, as well as to determine the energetic cost of the use of membranes for the CO2 separation in IGCC systems. The calculations were made within the environment of the commercial package Aspen Plus.

The calculation was made for a hypothetical plant located in Central Finland and the radius of the procurement area was 100 km via the existing road network. Cutting was done with conventional harvester head equipped with multi-tree-handling (MTH) accessories, with the logged trees being chipped at the roadside storage. The cost of delimbed stemwood chips at heating plant was 24% higher compared to the cost of whole tree chips. The availability analysis attested that delimbing lowered the regional cutting removal by 42% compared to the whole tree harvesting, when the minimum accumulation for the fuel fraction at the stand was set at 25 m3/ha. Delimbing diminishes the recovery rate at the site, resulting in a diminishing number of potential recovery sites meeting the threshold volume. However, the study showed that the forest energy potential is increased and procurement costs are reduced, if delimbed stemwood is harvested from stands where the whole tree harvesting is not acceptable due to nutrient loss or for other ecological reasons. Intelligent selection of cutting methods for different stands enables minimization of transport distance and control of procurement cost.","Biomass resources; Delimbed stemwood; Early thinnings; Finland; Forest chips; Multi-tree-handling; Whole trees","Forestry; Fuels; Harvesting; Wood products; Biomass resources; Early thinnings; Finland; Forest chips; Multi-tree-handling; Stemwoods; Whole trees; Costs; bioenergy; biofuel; clearcutting; cost-benefit analysis; diameter; forest resource; fuelwood; harvesting; logging (timber); nutrient loss; roadside environment; thinning; Biomass; Costs; Ecology; Finland; Forests; Harvesting; Roads; Thinnings; Transport; Trees; Wood Products; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956946432

Experts have projected that the CO2 emissions related to the energy sector will increase 130% by 2050 in the absence of new policies or supply constraints as a result of increased fossil fuel usage. To address this issue will require an energy technology revolution involving greater energy efficiency, increased renewable energies and nuclear power, and the near-decarbonisation of fossil fuel-based power generation. Nonetheless, fossil fuel usage is expected to continue to dominate global energy supply. The only technology available to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from large-scale fossil fuel usage is carbon capture and storage (CCS), an essential part of the portfolio of technologies that is needed to achieve deep global emission reductions. However, CCS technology faces numerous issues and challenges before it can be successfully deployed. With Malaysia has recently pledged a 40% carbon reduction by 2020 in the Copenhagen 2009 Climate Summit, CCS technology is seen as a viable option in order to achieve its target. Thus, this paper studies the potential and feasibility of coal-fired power plant with CCS technology in Malaysia which includes the choices of coal plants and types of capture technologies possible for implementation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is considerable less attention for the implications of indigenous resource depletion for the provision of seasonal flexibility. The traditionally largest source of seasonal flexibility in Europe is indigenous gas production, mainly based in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. With the depletion of indigenous sources the market increasingly needs to rely on other sources for seasonal flexibility, such as gas storage facilities. We investigate the future need for gas storage as a source for seasonal flexibility provision using a dynamic gas market model (GASTALE) in which different potential sources for seasonal flexibility - gas production, imports via pipeline, LNG imports and storage facilities - compete with each other in a market-based environment. The inclusion of seasonal flexibility properties in a gas market model allows a more complex analysis of seasonal flexibility issues than previously documented in literature. This is demonstrated in an analysis of the future demand for gas storage in northwestern Europe until 2030. Our results indicate that there is substantial need for additional gas storage facilities and thus supports current project proposals for new investment in gas storage facilities. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The initial application should be the capture of CO2 from flue gases of combined cycle natural gas (NGCC) power plants: the CO2 content ranges from 3-5%, with up to 12% of oxygen. Several challenges to deploy this process for a large-scale application are pointed out. Materials such as amine-modified resins or zeolites should be good candidates for this process (indirect ESA) because they exhibit good loadings at low partial pressures of CO2. The process design should take into account the temperature increase due to adiabatic operation, pushing the effective loadings to values around 20% of maximum loading. Several process operations are suggested in order to improve the CO2 purity and recovery and also to integrate the ESA process with other sources of heat, which may have an important impact in energy consumption. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

In the present work, we combine the high product yields and selectivities of CO2 absorption processes with the advantages of membrane technology in a membrane contactor for the separation of CO2 from CH4 using amino acid salt solutions as competitive absorption liquid to alkanol amine solutions. Amino acids, such as sarcosine, have the same functionality as alkanol amines (e.g., monoethanolamine=MEA), but in contrast, they exhibit a better oxidative stability and resistance to degradation. In addition, they can be made nonvolatile by adding a salt functionality, which significantly reduces the liquid loss due to evaporation at elevated temperatures in the desorber. Membrane contactor experiments using CO2/CH4 feed mixtures to evaluate the overall process performance, including a full absorption/desorption cycle show that even without a temperature difference between absorber and desorber, a CO2/CH4 selectivity of over 70 can be easily achieved with the sarcosine salt solution as absorption liquid. This selectivity reaches values of 120 at a temperature difference between absorber and desorber of 35°C, compared to a value of only 60 for MEA under the same conditions. Although CO2 permeance values are somewhat lower than the values obtained for MEA, the results clearly show the potential of amino acid salt solutions as competitive absorption liquids for the energy efficient removal of CO2. In addition, due to the low absorption of CH4 in sarcosine compared to MEA, the loss of CH4 is reduced and significantly higher CH4 product yields can be obtained. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

WAT produces physiologically active secretory proteins, including cytokines and complement factors. Furthermore, treatment of mammalian adipocytes with cytokines and inflammatory stimulators induces immune genes, suppresses regulators of adipocyte differentiation and activates lipolysis. Previously we reported up-regulation of immune genes in the course of in vitro development of Atlantic salmon white adipocytes. If WAT is immunoactive tissue in fish, excessive deposition of fat resulting from lipid-rich diets may imply risk for health of farmed fish. In this paper we investigated how lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affects immune activity in the adipose tissue-derived stromo-vascular fraction (aSVF) of Atlantic salmon. Experiments were performed with confluent cultures of proliferating preadipocytes. Exposure to LPS induced expression of immune genes, including TNFα and TNF-dependent genes, chemokines and receptors, NFkappaB related genes, matrix metalloproteinases and genes involved in eicosanoid metabolism. LPS decreased expression of adipocyte markers and genes involved in lipid metabolism, however, in parallel, it accelerated a number of transcriptional events that take place during the adipogenic differentiation of aSVF. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Adipogenesis; Atlantic salmon; Immunity; Microarray; Preadipocytes","Mammalia; Salmo salar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956269733

Among the renewable energy resources, especially, wind energy is of interest due to some advantages, such as being clean, environmental friendly etc. However, the intermittent nature of wind creates several problems to the power system operation and new approaches based on the combined use of wind power and energy storage technologies need to be developed. One of these combined systems is wind-hydro pumped storage systems. In this paper, hydropower and wind energy potential of Turkey are investigated in details. Besides, the importance and the necessity of wind-hydro pumped storage systems for Turkey are comprehensively examined and finally, the contribution of wind-hydro pumped storage systems is emphasized in meeting Turkey's electric energy demand.

What makes auctions attractive is that they are agnostic to utility functions of agents. Auctions involve a bidding method by agents-buyers, which is then mapped by a central controller to an allocation and a payment for each agent. In autonomic networks comprising self-interested nodes with different needs and utility functions, each entity possesses some resource and can engage in transactions with others to achieve its needs. In fact, efficient network operation relies on node synergy and multi-lateral resource trading. Nodes face the dilemma of devoting their limited resource to their own benefit versus acting altruistically and anticipating to be aided in the future. Wireless ad-hoc networks, peer-to-peer networks and disruptiontolerant networks are instances of autonomic networks where the challenges above arise and the traded resource is energy, bandwidth and storage space respectively. Clearly, the decentralized complex node interactions and the double node role as resource provider and consumer amidst resource constraints cannot be addressed by single-sided auctions and even more by mechanisms with a central controller. We introduce a double-sided auction market framework to address the challenges above. Each node announces one bid for buying and one for selling the resource.We prove that there exist bidding and charging strategies that maximize social welfare and we explicitly compute them. We generalize our result to a generic network objective. Nodes are induced to follow these strategies, otherwise they are isolated by the network. Furthermore, we propose a decentralized realization of the double-sided auction with lightweight network feedback. Finally, we introduce a pricing method which does not need a charging infrastructure. Simulation results verify the desirable properties of our approach. © 2010 IEEE.","Autonomous Networks; Double-sided Auctions; Resource Allocation","Auction markets; Auction mechanisms; Autonomic network; Autonomous networks; Charging strategies; Disruption tolerant networks; Double auction mechanism; Double-sided Auctions; Generic networks; Multiple agents; Network feedback; Network operations; Peer to peer; Pricing methods; Resource Constraint; Resource providers; Social welfare; Storage spaces; Utility functions; Autonomous agents; Commerce; Distributed computer systems; Economics; Resource allocation; Telecommunication networks; Wireless ad hoc networks; Peer to peer networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955887485

A hardened steel vial and three steel balls of 12.7 mm in diameter were used for milling. The ball to powder weight ratio was 10:1. A small amount of powder was removed at regular intervals to monitor the structural changes. All the steps were performed in a little lucite glove box under argon gas, this glove box was also constructed in our Institute. The structural evolution during milling was characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The hydrogen reaction was carried out in a micro-reactor under controlled conditions of pressure and temperature. The hydrogen storage properties of mechanically milled powders were evaluated by using a TGA system.

The system must be able to efficiently transport event-data with high reliability, while providing aggregated bandwidths larger than 5 GByte/s and coping with many thousands network connections. Nevertheless, routing and streaming capabilities and monitoring and data accounting functionalities are also fundamental requirements. During 2008, a few months of ATLAS cosmic data-taking and the first experience with the LHC beams provided an unprecedented test-bed for the evaluation of the performance of the ATLAS DataFlow, in terms of functionality, robustness and stability. Besides, operating the system far from its design specifications helped in exercising its flexibility and contributed in understanding its limitations. Moreover, the integration with the detector and the interfacing with the off-line data processing and management have been able to take advantage of this extended data taking-period as well.

This has a direct impact on requests for new resources. There are two different but strongly correlated aspects to be considered: while users are mostly interested in a good turn-around time for their jobs, resource providers are mostly interested in a high and efficient usage of their available resources. Both things, the box usage and the efficiency of individual user jobs, need to be closely monitored so that the sources of the inefficiencies can be identified. At CERN, the Lemon monitoring system is used for both purposes. Examples of such sources are poorly written user code, inefficient access to mass storage systems, and dedication of resources to specific user groups. As a first step for improvements CERN has launched a project to develop a scheduler add-on that allows careful overloading of worker nodes that run idle jobs. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Computing resource; Direct impact; Mass storage system; Monitoring system; Resource providers; User codes; User groups; Worker nodes; High energy physics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955411160

The CERN Advanced STORage system (CASTOR) is a hierarchical system developed at CERN, used to store physics production files and user files. CASTOR, as one of the essential software tools used by the LHC experiments, has to provide reliable services for storing and managing data. Monitoring of this complicated system is mandatory in order to assure its stable operation and improve its future performance. This paper presents the new monitoring system of CASTOR which provides operation and user request specific metrics. This system is build around a dedicated, optimized database schema. The schema is populated by PL/SQL procedures, which process a stream of incoming raw metadata from different CASTOR components, initially collected by the Distributed Logging Facility (DLF).

Given the fact that a considerable amount of existing software has been developed using serial methodology, and has existed in some cases for many years, implementation of parallelisation techniques at the framework level may offer a way of exploiting current multi-core technologies to maximize performance and reduce latencies without re-writing thousands/millions of lines of code. In the solution we have developed, the parallelization techniques are introduced to the high level Python scripts which configure and drive the applications, such that the core C++ application code requires no modification, and that end users need make only minimal changes to their scripts.

One of the most important aspects of the data analysis on the CAF is the speed with which it can be carried out. The system is particularly aimed at the prototyping phase of analyses that need a high number of iterations and thus require a short response time. Quasi-online quality assurance of data can be obtained. The paper describes the design principles of the PROOF framework and presents the current setup, performance tests and usage statistics. Subsets of selected data can be automatically staged in CAF from the Grid storage systems, therefore data distribution and staging techniques are described in depth.

These needs are described in the ATLAS Computing Model, which embraces Grid concepts. The output coming from the Event Filter will consist of three main streams: a primary stream, the express stream and the calibration stream. The calibration stream will be transferred to the Tier-0 facilities which will allow the prompt reconstruction of this stream with an admissible latency of 8 hours, producing calibration constants of sufficient quality to permit a first-pass processing. An independent calibration stream is developed and tested, which selects tracks at the level-2 trigger (LVL2) after the reconstruction. The stream is composed of raw data, in byte-stream format, and contains only information of the relevant parts of the detector, in particular the hit information of the selected tracks. This leads to a significantly improved bandwidth usage and storage capability. The stream will be used to derive and update the calibration and alignment constants if necessary every 24h. Processing is done using specialized algorithms running in Athena framework in dedicated Tier-0 resources, and the alignment constants will be stored and distributed using the COOL conditions database infrastructure. The work is addressing in particular the alignment requirements, the needs for track and hit selection, timing and bandwidth issues. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Alignment; Bandwidth; Calibration; High energy physics; Alignment data; ATLAS experiment; Bandwidth usage; Calibration constants; Computing model; Conditions database; Processing needs; Storage capability; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955366467

The contents of these tapes are regularly repacked from older, lower-density media to new-generation, higher-density media in order to free up physical space and ensure long term data integrity and availability. With the evolution of price decay and higher capacity of disk (and flash memory) based storage, our future vision for tape usage is to move away from serving on demand, random, per-file access to non-disk cached files, and to move towards loosely coupled, efficient bulk data transfers where large-volume data sets are stored and retrieved in aggregations, fully exploiting the stream-based nature of tape media. Mechanisms for grouped migration policies and priorities have been implemented, and an innovative tape format optimized for data aggregations is being developed. This new tape format will also allow for increasing the performance of repacking data from old to newer generation tape media with substantially reduced hardware costs.

The selected events are consolidated into files on an onsite storage and then sent to permanent storage for subsequent analysis on the Grid. For local and full-chain tests a method to exercise the data-flow through the High Level Trigger when there are no actual data is needed. In order to test the system as much as possible under identical conditions as for data-taking the solution is to inject data at the input of the HLT at a minimum rate of 2 kHz. This is done via a software implementation of the trigger system which sends data to the HLT. The application has to simulate that the data it sends come from real LHCb readout-boards. Both simulation data and previously recorded real data can be re-played through the system in this manner.

We report on the performance of the ARC middleware, as deployed for ATLAS, for realistic situations with concurrent MC production and physics analysis running on the same resources. Data access patterns for ATLAS MC and physics analysis grid jobs will be shown, together with the performance of various possible storage and file staging models. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Digital storage; Middleware; Monte Carlo methods; ATLAS experiment; Computing center; Computing grid; Computing resource; Data access patterns; GRID middleware; Physics analysis; Realistic conditions; High energy physics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955345550

Operations like checking configuration consistency, executing actions on nodes, moving them between clusters etc. are very frequent. These scaling challenges are the basis for CluMan, a new cluster management tool being designed and developed at CERN. High-density displays such as heat maps, grids or color maps are more and more commonly used in various applications like data visualization or monitoring systems. They allow humans to see, interpret and understand complex and detailed information at a glance.

This paper presents a comparative study of a gas turbine cycle with postcombustion CO3 separation using an amine-based absorption process with monoethanolamine. The study has been made for a triple pressure reheated 400 MWe natural gas-fuelled combined cycle with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to improve capture efficiency. Two different options for the energy supply to the solvent regeneration have been evaluated and compared concerning plant performance. In the first alternative heat is provided by steam extracted internally from the bottoming steam cycle, while in the second option an external biomass-fuelled boiler was utilized to generate the required heat. With this novel configuration the amount of CO3 captured can be even more than 100% if the exhaust gas from the biofuelled boiler is mixed and cleaned together with the main exhaust gas flow from the combined cycle. In order to make an unprejudiced comparison between the two alternatives, the reduced steam turbine efficiency has been taken into consideration and estimated, for the alternative with internal steam extraction. The cycles have been modeled in the commercial heat and mass balance program IPSEPRO™ using detailed component models. Utilizing EGR can double the CO3 content of the exhaust gases and reduce the energy need for the separation process by approximately 2% points. Using an external biomass-fuelled boiler as heat source for amine regeneration turns out to be an interesting option due to high CO3 capture effectiveness. However the electrical efficiency of the power plant is reduced compared with the option with internal steam extraction. Another drawback with the external boiler is the higher investment costs but nevertheless, it is flexibility due to the independency from the rest of the power generation system represents a major operational advantage. © 2010 by ASME.",,"Absorption process; Amine regeneration; Capture efficiency; Carbon capture and storage; Combined cycle; Comparative studies; Component model; Electrical efficiency; Energy needs; Energy supplies; Exhaust gas flow; Exhaust gas recirculation; Gas turbine cycles; Heat sources; Investment costs; IS flexibility; Mass balance; Monoethanolamine; Plant performance; Post-combustion; Power generation systems; Separation process; Steam cycles; Steam extraction; System integration; System integration and optimization; Turbine efficiency; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Exhaust gases; Investments; Marine engines; Organic compounds; Steam; Steam engineering; Steam power plants; Steam turbines; Boilers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955244105

The proposed analytical method is generally applicable and features highly accurate corrected fuel consumption results. It enables calculation of the corrected fuel consumption out of a single fuel consumption test run in a single analytic post-processing step. An additional fuel consumption test run might be needed to obtain highly accurate results if ratio of the energy content deviation of the electric storage devices to the energy used for vehicle propulsion over the test cycle is high. Proposed method enables consideration of non-linear energy flow changes and non-linear HEV component efficiency changes caused by the energy management strategy or by the component characteristics. The method therefore features highly accurate results out of the minimum number of fuel consumption test runs and thus optimizes workload for development or optimization of HEVs.

Despite the high wind potential encountered in many Greek island regions, the wind energy contribution to the electrification of these areas is significantly restricted due to imposed electrical grid limitations. In this context, the current work examines the economic viability of a wind-based PHS system (wind-hydro solution) which provides the local electrical grid of an Aegean Sea island, Lesbos, with guaranteed energy amounts during the peak load demand periods. Based on the maximization of the project's net present value, the optimum system configuration is proposed while many other feasible solutions are revealed.

The input data were derived from assessment of existing biogas systems, present knowledge on anaerobic digestion process management and technologies for biogas system operating conditions in Germany. The energy balance was evaluated as Primary Energy Input to Output (PEIO) ratio, to assess the process energy efficiency, hence, the potential sustainability. Results indicate that the PEIO correspond to 10.5-64.0% and 34.1-55.0% for single feedstock digestion and feedstock co-digestion, respectively. Energy balance was assessed to be negative for feedstock transportation distances in excess of 22. km and 425. km for cattle manure and for Municipal Solid Waste, respectively, which defines the operational limits for respective feedstock transportation. Energy input was highly influenced by the characteristics of feedstock used. For example, agricultural waste, in most part, did not require pre-treatment. Energy crop feedstock required the respect cultivation energy inputs, and processing of industrial waste streams included energy-demanding pre-treatment processes to meet stipulated hygiene standards. Energy balance depended on biogas yield, the utilization efficiency, and energy value of intended fossil fuel substitution. For example, obtained results suggests that, whereas the upgrading of biogas to biomethane for injection into natural gas network potentially increased the primary energy input for biogas utilization by up to 100%; the energy efficiency of the biogas system improved by up to 65% when natural gas was substituted instead of electricity. It was also found that, system energy efficiency could be further enhanced by 5.1-6.1% through recovery of residual biogas from enclosed digestate storage units. Overall, this study provides bases for more detailed assessment of environmental compatibility of energy efficiency pathways in biogas production and utilization, including management of spent digestate. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Biogas conversion pathway; Biogas project; Energy input output ratio; Energy performance; Primary energy input","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Crops; Cultivation; Digital storage; Energy balance; Feedstocks; Fertilizers; Fossil fuels; Industrial waste treatment; Information management; Manures; Municipal solid waste; Natural gas; Sustainable development; Waste management; Waste treatment; Biogas conversions; Biogas projects; Energy inputs; Energy performance; Primary energies; Energy efficiency; agricultural emission; alternative energy; anoxic conditions; biogas; energy crop; energy efficiency; municipal solid waste; Bos",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955174536

The physiological mechanisms involved in body weight regulation are complex and incompletely understood. Increasing evidence suggests that obesity is a multifactorial disease where many, if not all, organs of the body are involved. The adipose tissue was considered as a simple fat accumulation for a long period of time. However, nowadays it is fascinating to progressively discover its involvement in hormonal, inflammatory or immune system dysregulation. Adipokines and cytokines are involved in control and regulation of appetite and energy balance, glucose and lipid metabolism, neuroendocrine function, reproduction, immunity, and cardiovascular function. The inflammatory background associated with obesity is closely related to insulin resistance. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of endocannabinoids on the expression of adiponectin could be involved in insulin resistance. Gut microbiota related factor may be responsible for the development of diet-induced obesity and diabetes through metabolic endotoxemia which triggers the inflammatory tone.

The objective is to control, in a passive form, the longitudinal vibration transmissibility in specific and wide enough frequency ranges of interest. This is achieved by the separation of two adjacent eigenfrequencies. A relation between the modal analysis, the harmonic analysis and the Bloch wave theory is proposed, for which no reference was found in the searched literature. As shown, the selection of appropriate material pairs is essential to obtain useful frequency ranges. The use of pairs of steel and cork agglomerate is proposed, since it allows the design of attenuators at lower frequencies through a prediction based on finite element analysis (FEA).

In the transition period of a low voltage microgrid, from the connected mode of operation to the islanded mode of operation, the power unbalance can be partly covered by the inertia energy of the existing power sources. This paper proposes fuzzy local controllers exploiting the inertia of a Wind Turbine (WT) with a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG), if such a machine exists in the microgrid, in order to decrease the necessary storage devices and the drawbacks that arise. The proposed controllers are based in fuzzy logic due to the non linear and stochastic behavior of the system. Two cases are studied and compared during the transient period where the microgrid architecture and the DFIG controller differ. In the first case, the understudy microgrid includes a hybrid fuel cell system (FCS)-battery system and a WT with a DFIGURE. The DFIG local controller in this case is also based in fuzzy logic and follows the classical optimum power absorption scenario for the WT. The transition of the microgrid from the connected mode of operation to the islanded mode is evaluated and, especially, the battery contribution is estimated. In the second case, the battery is eliminated. The fuzzy controller of the DFIG during the transition provides primary frequency control and local bus voltage support exploiting the WT inertia. The response of the system is estimated in both cases using MATLAB/Simulink software package. © 2010 by the authors.","DFIG; Fuzzy logic; Microgrid","Computer circuits; Controllers; Electric batteries; Electric fault currents; Fuel cells; Fuzzy logic; MATLAB; Stochastic systems; Virtual storage; Wind turbines; DFIG; Doubly fed induction generators; Hybrid fuel cell system; Islanded mode of operations; Matlab/Simulink software; Micro grid; Microgrid architecture; Primary frequency control; Asynchronous generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954651725

Therefore, exercise in hot environments challenges not only to the cardiorespiratory and locomotive systems but also to the brain. However, exercise with superimposed hyperthermia is not only a challenge to the brain it also provides an excellent model for studying factors of importance for central fatigue. Excessive heat storage within the brain appears to be the primary cause for the central fatigue during exercise in the heat, but pharmacological manipulations provide evidence for involvement of the dopaminergic system and other monoamines. Thus, enhanced dopaminergic activity may counteract hyperthermia mediated central fatigue and improve performance in the heat, while noradrenaline reuptake inhibition appears to aggravate central fatigue and degrade exercise performance. Hyperthermia mediated central fatigue may include other cerebral perturbations such as reduced perfusion of the brain, accumulation of ammonia or depletion of neuronal energy stores, but further research is needed to elucidate their possible contributions.","Brain; Dopamine; Hyperthermia; Neurotransmiters; Review","caffeine; dopamine; noradrenalin; serotonin; central nervous system; drug effect; exercise; fatigue; fever; heat; human; metabolism; pathophysiology; physiology; psychomotor performance; review; Caffeine; Central Nervous System; Dopamine; Exercise; Fatigue; Fever; Hot Temperature; Humans; Norepinephrine; Psychomotor Performance; Serotonin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954504268

Thus, it will be of capital importance to evaluate the power and energy involved in braking and the fraction that has the possibility of being regenerated. The Series type Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (SPHEV), with electric traction and a small Internal Combustion Engine ICE) powering a generator, is likely to become a configuration winner. The first part of this work describes the model used for the quantification of the energy flows of a vehicle, following a particular route. Normalised driving-cycles used in Europe and USA and real routes and traffic conditions were tested. The results show that, in severe urban drivingcycles, the braking energy can represent more than 70% of the required useful motor-energy. This figure is reduced to 40% in suburban routes and to a much lower 18% on motorway conditions. The second part of the work consists on the integration of the main energy components of an S-PHEV into the mathematical model. Their performance and capacity characteristics are described and some simulation results presented. In the case of suburban driving, 90% of the electrical motor-energy is supplied by the battery and ultra-capacitors and 10% by the auxiliary ICE generator, while on motorway these we got 65% and 35%, respectively. The simulations also indicate an electric consumption of 120 W.h/km for a small 1 ton car on a suburban route. This value increases by 11% in the absence of ultra-capacitors and a further 28% without regenerative braking.

The experiments were conducted with granulated activated carbon and MOF adsorbents. The influence of the charge pressure and the gas flow rate on the temperature elevations and the amount of filled hydrogen gas was analyzed. The heat generated in the storage vessel originates from the released heat of adsorption, gas compression work and thermal energy transfer that takes place when high pressure gas at the ambient temperature is introduced to the tank. A typical average temperature increase observed during the charging of the test tank, filled with the activated carbon (NORIT R0.8 extra), to 2 MPa was about 21 K.

Large-scale environmental deg-radation in the form of sinkholes and widespread radioactive pollution exacerbate such fears. Based on an analysis of min-ing impacts and potential threats for post-mining developments provided in Part I, this 2nd paper in a 3-part series aims to stimulate thought, through the discussion of potential opportunities centred on the rich water resources of the area. This is in full recognition of a subsequent need to assess the economic and technical feasibility of identified opportunities in more detail. Many opportunities are based on the concept that perceived mining liabilities may have the potential to be turned into assets. Examples include the restoration of dewatered karst aquifers and their use for storing large volumes of water, protected from evaporation losses, combined with artificial groundwater recharge and harvesting as well as underground generation of hydropower. This could well be complemented by other water-based developments such as aquaculture, agriculture and different forms of tourism relating to water, karst and mining. Possibilities for using waste land such as sinkhole areas and slimes dams include the establishment of a large game reserve on donated land as well as using tailings for biofuel production and generating solar- and wind-based electricity. Lastly, the re-establishment of a uranium-related industry is explored; this could capitalise on existing infrastructure and former expertise and benefit from the envisaged development of uranium as a strategic resource in SA. In view of the current media attention given to negative environmental and health effects, it is, however, questionable whether such development would be acceptable to local residents.","Groundwater storage and harvesting; Karst; Post-mining development; Research opportunities; Subterranean hydro-energy generation; Tourism; Uranium industry; Wasteland transformation","Aquifers; Economic geology; Gold; Gold mines; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Landforms; Plant shutdowns; Pollution; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive wastes; Uranium; Water conservation; Water resources; Energy generations; Groundwater storage; Karst; Mining development; Research opportunities; Tourism; Wasteland transformation; Recharging (underground waters); agricultural practice; aquaculture; biofuel; cost-benefit analysis; dolomite; economic growth; environmental degradation; environmental impact; gold mine; health impact; hydraulics; hydroelectric power; karst hydrology; mining industry; radioactive pollution; recharge; restoration ecology; sinkhole; social impact; solar power; tailings; tourism; uranium; waste management; wasteland; water resource; wind power; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954231235

Moreover, the large scale burning of such fuels for the production of electrical energy or in industry/transport results in a significant rising of the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere and therefore a rising of global temperatures. Research and development regarding alternative energy sources such as e.g. nuclear fusion is proceeding but mankind also becomes more aware of the sun as being a giant fusion reactor, already at their free disposition and able to act as a lasting and sustainable energy source. The sun in fact delivers continuously about 89,000 TW of usable insolation (photons) power to our planet while the actual global power consumption is about 15 TW. From this point of view, the sun is thus able to provide about 6000 times the world's energy demand, thus highlighting the enormous potential of solar energy from such numbers in a very obvious way. A major disadvantage of insolation energy of course is its discontinuous and fluctuating availability during daytime. To circumvent such, a solution could eventually be found in the storage of solar power as osmotic energy in highly concentrated salt solutions. The development of salinity gradient power (SGP) based on reverse electrodialysis (SGP-RED) could therefore possibly become an important alternative approach. When combined with classic or solar power based seawater desalination technologies, the resulting hybrid system could well be a candidate for the simultaneous production of potable water and electrical energy. The concentration of the brine from the seawater desalination unit (SWDU) could be substantially increased by using solar energy while also producing additional sweet water (condensate). Electricity could then be produced from the mixing energy of the highly concentrated brine and seawater, by using the principle of reverse electrodialysis (RED). In this way the dis-advantageous brine waste situation in seawater desalination could eventually be converted into an opportunity regarding the production of a large amount of additional fresh water, a significant amount of electrical energy and an answer to the brine disposal environmental problem. The theoretical simulation results from SGP-RED stack modeling using highly concentrated brine and seawater (brackish water) point to the absolute need of the development of a battery oriented SGP-RED stack configuration, requiring thin ion conductive membranes and thin spacers as to minimize the internal battery resistance and maximize the electrical power output. © 2010 Desalination Publications.","Brine; Desalination; Energy; Evaporation; Fresh; Potable; Reverse electrodialysis; Salinity gradient power; Solar; Sustainable; Sweet",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954224896

A dedicated simulation tool that models a metro line with conventional or hybrid trains and stationary supercapacitor (SC)-based ESSs has been developed for this purpose. The model can simulate the energy exchange among simultaneously running vehicles of a conventional metro line and evaluate the effect of a stationary ESS when installed along the line. Different traffic scenarios are considered for the study: high, moderate, and low traffic volume as this element has a strong influence on the energy exchange among the running vehicles and therefore on the energy available for storage in the ESS. This will eventually determine the energy consumption reduction. This simulation tool is used to study the most convenient ESS alternative for the case of a Brussels metro line. When compared with a conventional metro line, the total energy consumption reduction achieved with stationary ESS varies in function of the traffic conditions, ESS size, and ESS distribution along the line. With efficient metro trains, values of energy savings up to 18.7, 25.1, and 36.4 per cent can be obtained at high, moderate, and low traffic volumes, respectively. In contrast, using onboard ESS on every vehicle, the maximum energy savings achieved vary between 27.3 and 36.3 per cent at high and low traffic volumes, respectively. Results show that even though the energy savings achieved are higher with onboard ESS, the amount of SC cells needed is lower when using stationary ESS. However, benefits such as peak power shaving, voltage drop reductions, and reduced line losses are better attained by onboard ESS.","energy storage; hybrid electric vehicles; light rail vehicles; modelling and simulation; supercapacitor","Brussels; DC voltage; Energy consumption; Energy exchanges; Energy saving; Energy storage systems; Hybrid electric vehicle; Light rail vehicle; Line loss; Metro lines; Metro networks; Metro train; Modelling and simulations; On-board energy storage; Peak power shaving; Simulation tool; Super capacitor; Supercapacitors; Total energy consumption; Traffic conditions; Traffic volumes; Voltage drop; Automobiles; Capacitors; Computer simulation; Data storage equipment; DC power transmission; Electric vehicles; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Flywheels; Fuzzy control; Light rail transit; Locomotives; Metropolitan area networks; Rail motor cars; Secondary batteries; Tools; Voltage control; Subways",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953765208

Hydrogen is an environmentally friendly and renewable energy source. It has been considered an ideal fuel for replacing fossil fuels. Currently, Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) system (with a density of 51 kg m-3 and 14 wt.%) is close to practical use. However, the cost of using LH2 as a transportation fuel is nearly twice that of Gaseous Hydrogen (GH2), due to the liquefaction process, increased fuel transportation costs and more complex manipulation of the fuel. If the intention is to use hydrogen on a large scale, storage is a key problem. Researchers have shown that hydrogen could be stored as: compressed gas, cryogenic hydrogen and metal hydrides. However, the number of alternative methods is growing, including the use of carbon novel materials, chemical hydrides and glass microspheres. This are also being considered.

The structure showed the formula unit Li4B4H10, and the analytical formula LiBH2.5, of which the Gibbs free energy of formation was -111.76 kJ mol-1. The lattice stability was confirmed by the phonon calculations, which revealed all positive normal modes. Comparatively, the formation of lithium dodecaborate(12) is presented and discussed.

The fossil fuels are expected to remain a major component of the world's energy supply in the near future, because of their inherent advantages. Therefore, various measures have to be considered to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Increasing the efficiency of energy usage and/or developing lower carbon or non-carbon energies to replace high carbon fuels may bring the result of the reduction of the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. The other alternative to reduce CO2 concentrations in atmosphere include gaseous storage in various deep geological formations, liquid storage in the ocean, and solid storage by reaction of CO2 with metal oxides to produce stable carbonates.

We first impose the constraint that no PV energy losses are permitted other than those due to storage inefficiency. This constraint leads to powerful linkages between the energy capacity and power capacity of storage, and PV system size, and their combined effect on grid penetration. Various strategies are then examined for enhancing grid penetration, based upon this newfound knowledge. Specific strategies examined include PV energy dumping and baseload rescheduling both on a seasonal basis and shorter time periods. We found, inter alia, that at high grid flexibilities (in the range ff=0.8-1), PV grid penetration levels could be possible in the range 60-90% of annual requirements. Moreover, with appropriately designed storage and accurate forecasting, a future grid could be operated at ff=1. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Grid penetration; Photovoltaics; Storage properties","Digital storage; Electric power plants; Energy dissipation; Photovoltaic cells; Combined effect; Energy capacity; Grid penetration; Penetration level; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; Power capacity; Storage properties; Electric power transmission networks; carbon sequestration; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; photovoltaic system; Israel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953409513

In this context, the current work presents a methodology for the sizing of PHS systems that exploit the excess wind energy amounts produced by local wind farms, otherwise rejected due to imposed electrical grid limitations. The methodology is accordingly applied to the Greek island of Lesbos. Initially, a calculation of the wind power penetration ability to the local grid is carried out and the corresponding curtailments of existing and future wind farms are determined. An integrated computational algorithm is then presented which simulates the operation of the system during an entire year and gives in detail the hourly operational status as well as the various energy losses of the system main components. Based on the application results obtained, the ability of the wind energy to remarkably contribute to the electrification of the remote islands becomes evident. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

That goal was achieved using a wing with a partial span Glauert-type airfoil, characterized by an upper-surface boundary-layer separation from the two-thirds chord location at all incidence angles. The flow over that region was proportionally controlled using zero-mass-flux unsteady excitation emanating from piezofluidic actuators. The control was applied to one wing at a time, resulting in gradual suppression of the boundary-layer separation, increased lift, and reduced drag, leading to a coordinated turning motion of the small electric drone. The extensive multidisciplinary study (starting from the actuator adaptation, the airfoil integration, and the twodimensional wind-tunnel tests) led to the selection of a configuration for the flight demonstrator. Further development of a lightweight wing and piezofluidic actuators, along with a compact, lightweight, energy-efficient electronic drive system, was followed by full-scale wind-tunnel tests and three successful flight tests. It was flightdemonstrated that active flow control can induce roll moments that are sufficient to control the vehicle flight path during cruise, as well as during landing. A linear model was used to predict the roll motion of the active-flowcontrolled drone, with reasonable agreement to the flight-test data. The current study resulted in several pioneering (to the best of our knowledge) achievements that should pave the way to further integration of active-flow-control methods in flight vehicles for hingeless flight attitude and flight-path control, as well as improved performance and increased reliability with lower observability.

This concern was traditionally addressed by the promotion of wind resource studies and acting in the supply side of energy and using energy storage technologies. However, in electric system planning, other options deserve to be evaluated, namely the options related with the energy demand. The most severe problems due to the wind power intermittence happen during the peak load hours. Thus, instead of trying to replace the lost capacity due to the intermittence, other option is to act in the energy demand side, with the aim of reducing the consumption in such hours. The demand-side management technologies are an option that must be considered to reduce and manage the wind power intermittence. The present paper analyzes the possible impact of demand-side management and demand response, with the aim of enabling the integration of the growing intermittent resources in Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional cooling production results in high demand for electrical power during peak hours, leading to high emissions for producing cooling, and potential power shortages in electric grids. With a cold storage, the peak power demand is effectively managed and enables free-cooling. This paper examines one concept using phase change materials (PCM) for storing of cold, where the cold carrier (water) is in direct contact with the PCM. This is in order to enable high power for charging and discharging while providing a high storage capacity. A theoretical model highlights important design parameters for reaching large storage and power capacity. The capacity increases with the Packing Factor and temperature difference across the storage. For high power, the flow rate, temperature difference, and drop size is important parameters which is also verified in an experimental evaluation. The obtainable power is between 30 and 80 kW/m3 storage. Practical limitations of this concept are shown to be PCM-water bed expansion and non-uniform channeling due to asymmetric and unstable PCM shells. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Among newly developed biomass conversion technologies are biomass integrated gas combined cycle plants (BIGCC) as well as ethanol and methanol production based on woody biomass feedstock. Furthermore, bioenergy systems with carbon capture and storage (BECS) may allow negative CO2 emissions in the future. It is still not clear which woody biomass conversion technology reduces fossil CO2 emissions at least costs. This article presents a spatial explicit optimization model that assesses new biomass conversion technologies for fuel, heat and power production and compares them with woody pellets for heat production in Austria. The spatial distributions of biomass supply and energy demand have significant impact on the total supply costs of alternative bioenergy systems and are therefore included in the modeling process. Many model parameters that describe new bioenergy technologies are uncertain, because some of the technologies are not commercially developed yet. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to analyze model parameter uncertainty. Model results show that heat production with pellets is to be preferred over BIGCC at low carbon prices while BECS is cost-effective to reduce CO2 emissions at higher carbon prices. Fuel production - methanol as well as ethanol - reduces less CO2 emissions and is therefore less cost-effective in reducing CO2 emissions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been found that rubber industries consume a substantial amount of energy. Excessive use of energy is usually associated with many industrial plants worldwide, and rubber plants are no exception. This study is based on the realization that enormous potential exists for cost-effective improvements in the existing energy-using equipment. Through the method of a walkthrough energy audit, power rating, operation time of energy-consuming equipment/machineries and power factor were collected. The data were then analyzed to investigate the breakdown of end-use equipment/machineries energy use. The results of the energy audit in the Malaysian rubber and rubber producing industries showed that the electric motor accounts for a major fraction of total energy consumption followed by pumps, heaters, cooling systems and lighting. Since the electric motor takes up a substantial amount of the total energy used in rubber industries, energy-savings strategies such as the use of high efficient motors, and variable speed drive (VSD) have been used to reduce energy consumption of motors used in rubber industries. Energy-savings strategies for compressed-air systems, boilers, and chillers have also been applied to estimate energy and cost savings. It has been found that significant amount of energy and; utility bills can be saved along with the reduction of emission by applying the foretold strategies for energy using machineries in the rubber industries. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This allows redesigning the memory tier as a configurable product to be used in multiple system designs. Previously proposed dynamic re-configurable solutions demonstrate strong dependence between read latency and dimensions of the mapped memory, leading to potential performance limitations. In this paper we propose a one-time configurable memory tier designed to minimize the performances overhead due to the commodity. Flexible configuration is enabled by smart memory macros and I/Os organization and a customizable redistribution layer routing .

Objective: We compared body fat distribution measurements and their contribution to anovulation in obese ovulatory and anovulatory infertile women. Design: Seventeen ovulatory and 40 anovulatory women (age, 30 ± 4 yr; body mass index, 37.7 ± 6.1 kg/m2) participated. Body fat distribution was measured by anthropometrics, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and single-sliced abdominal computed tomography scan. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to determine which fat compartments significantly contributed to anovulation. Results: Anovulatory women had a higher waist circumference (113 ± 11 vs. 104 ± 9 cm; P &lt; 0.01) and significantly more trunk fat (23.0 ± 5.3 vs. 19.1 ± 4.2 kg; P &lt; 0.01) and abdominal fat (4.4 ± 1.3 kg vs. 3.5 ± 0.9 kg; P &lt; 0.05) on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan than ovulatory women despite similar body mass index. The volume of intraabdominal fat on single-sliced abdominal computed tomography scan was not significantly different between the two groups (203 ± 56 vs. 195 ± 71 cm3; P = 0.65), but anovulatory women had significantly more sc abdominal fat (SAF) (992 ± 198 vs. 864 ± 146 cm3; P &lt; 0.05). After multiple logistic regression analysis, only trunk fat, abdominal fat, and SAF were associated with anovulation. Conclusions: Abdominal fat is increased in anovulatory women due to a significant increase in SAF and not in intraabdominal fat. SAF and especially abdominal and trunk fat accumulation are associated with anovulation.

They have higher efficiency and lower emissions compared with the internal combustion engine vehicles. The fuel cell has a high energy storage capability, thus enhancing the range of operation for automobile and is a cleaner source of energy. However, the fuel cell has a slow dynamic response, so an auxiliary power source is needed during start up and transient conditions. Ultracapacitor usually used as secondary power source for improving the performance and efficiency of the overall system. Several methods have been devised to connect ultracapacitor to the fuel cell system. If the ultracapacitor is connected in parallel directly with the dc bus, its charge and discharge current cannot be controlled. Once the load changes significantly, the rush current would destroy the ultracapacitor. Therefore, a bidirectional converter needs to be inserted between the dc bus and the ultracapacitor to control the charge and discharge current. This paper proposes a novel control strategy of bidirectional dc-dc converter for interfacing ultracapacitor energy storage to fuel cell electric vehicles system. The controller of bidirectional dc-dc converter system was designed and implemented based on dynamic evolution control. Performance of the proposed dynamic evolution control is tested through simulation and experiment. © 2010 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","Bidirectional dc-dc converter; Dynamic evolution control; Electric vehicle; Fuel cell; Ultracapacitor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952317875

A light-sensitive TiO 2 layer has been formed by means of anodizing Ti electrode in the solution of 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 . A layer of RuO 2 , exhibiting the properties of electrochemical capacitor, has been formed by means of thermal decomposition of RuOHCl 3 also on Ti substrate. The photocharging capability of RuO 2 has been studied by means of short-circuiting Ti/RuO 2 electrode with Ti/TiO 2 photoelectrode in deaerated solution of 0.1 M KOH. It has been shown that the intensity of photocurrent flowing from Ti/TiO 2 to Ti/RuO 2 electrode depends mainly on the potential of the latter.

Among them, prolonged female cycles, asynchrony between sexes in receptivity, and sperm storage in males, were described. Asynchrony in the reproductive timing between males and females is a consequence of different energy requirements for gametogenesis, and often imply the existence of cellular mechanisms to enhance fertilization, such as the asynchronic steroid synthesis between testicular compartments, allowing gametogenesis independently of mating. In the present study ultrastructural and hormone assays were combined for the first time in liolaemids. Specifically, morphological features of steroid activity in Leydig and Sertoli cells, and serum testosterone concentrations have been studied in the lizard Phymaturus antofagastensis. Leydig and Sertoli cells presented morphological features characteristic of steroid synthesis during the spermatogenesis, and evident asynchronic steroid production between testicular compartments. Active Sertoli cells and inactive Leydig cells were observed in spring and autumn, while in mid-summer their steroid activity was synchronic in coincidence with maximal abundance of spermatozoa in epididymis. Serum testosterone concentration was at its maximum in mid-summer (126-230ngml-1), and minimum in late spring (4-24ngml-1) and early autumn (2-17ngml-1).

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of films of both types are the same and consist of two bands originating from the recombination of carriers through the surface defect states. It is found that the thermal annealing at 350-480 K during 10 min results in both the enhancement of the PL intensity and a shift of the PL bands to the low-energy spectral region. At a long annealing time (more than 1 h), a decrease of the PL intensity is observed. All the effects relax during the storage (ageing) of samples at room temperature in air and appear after the repeated annealing. A shift of the PL bands to the low-energy region is explained by an increase of the density of surface defects which act as the centers of radiative recombination and tentatively arise due to the break of the bonds of cadmium surface atoms with functional groups of gelatine molecules. The enhancement of the PL intensity is supposed to result from an increase of the potential barrier height for the carrier transition from quantum dots to the centers of nonradiative recombination. Another possible reason of the PL enhancement can be a decrease in the nonradiative defect density. The mechanism of a reduction of the PL intensity at a long annealing time is not yet clear. © 2010.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951752677

Multi-bank memory architecture is commonly applied in 8-bit microcontrollers to increase the size of memory without extending address buses. To switch among different memory banks, a special instruction, Bank Selection, is used. How to minimize the number of bank selection instructions inserted is important to reduce code size for embedded systems. In this paper, we consider how to insert the minimum number of bank selection instructions in a program to achieve feasibility. A program can be represented by a control flow graph (CFG). We prove that it is NP-Hard to insert the minimum number of bank selection instructions if all the variables are pre-assigned to memory banks. Therefore, we introduce a 2-approximation algorithm using a rounding method. When the CFG is a tree or the out-degree of each node in the CFG is at most two, we show that we can insert the bank selection instructions optimally in polynomial time. We then consider the case when there are some nodes that do not access any memory bank and design a dynamic programming method to compute the optimal insertion strategy when the CFG is a tree. Experimental result shows the proposed techniques can reduce bank selection instructions significantly on partitioned memory architecture.

In the past decade, many papers have been devoted to the compounds responsible for aged-beer off-flavors, mainly trans-2-nonenal, methional, and dimethyltrisulfide. Due to their huge antioxidant activity, polyphenols have often been described as key com-pounds for limiting beer staling. Yet phenolic structures also evolve through storage. Low-molecular-weight phenols like 4-vinylsyringol can impart off-flavors in aged beer, whilst flavonoids strongly influence astringency, haze, and color. The instability of stilbenes, prenylchalcones, and derived flavanones could also modify their health potential through storage.

The objective function is to minimize the overall energy charge for a prescribed water consumption while several constraints are considered, such as storage and source limitations, pump setting bounds, nodal mass balances, and the power demand charge. In this study a neutral search technique with genetic algorithms (GAs) is proposed to solve the least-cost pump schedule problem where neutrality is achieved through objective-fitness mapping instead of representational redundancy. We introduce a fitness assignment technique for groups of individuals where grouping is based on objective similarity. As a consequence two different individuals can be equally fit (belonging to the same group) which implies the neutrality. We compare the neutral search technique to two conventional GA approaches on a hypothetical water distribution system. © 2010 ASCE.",,"Fitness assignment; Mass balance; Objective functions; Operating points; Power demands; Schedule problems; Search technique; Water consumption; Information analysis; Local area networks; Water distribution systems; Water supply; Pumps; genetic algorithm; mapping method; planning method; pump; water planning; water storage; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950998331

The methodology makes use of the source-sink framework derived from the analogies with resource conservation networks used in process integration. Two variants of the modeling approach are developed for some of the important technologies for carbon emissions abatement: liquid biofuels in transportation, and carbon dioxide capture and storage in power generation. Despite the positive impact on environment, widespread use of these technologies has certain disadvantages. In case of biofuels, their production may strain agricultural resources, that are needed also for satisfying food demands. At the same time, carbon capture and storage is rather expensive technology and its practical implementation in power facilities must be carefully considered and planned. Optimum utilization of both technologies is identified with flexible and expandable mathematical modeling framework.

The processes were analyzed in the thermodynamic process simulation tool DNA. The syngas used for the catalytic methanol production was produced by gasification of biomass, electrolysis of water, CO2 from post-combustion capture and autothermal reforming of natural gas or biogas. Underground gas storage of hydrogen and oxygen was used in connection with the electrolysis to enable the electrolyser to follow the variations in the power produced by renewables. Six plant configurations, each with a different syngas production method, were compared. The plants achieve methanol exergy efficiencies of 59-72%, the best from a configuration incorporating autothermal reforming of biogas and electrolysis of water for syngas production. The different processes in the plants are highly heat integrated, and the low-temperature waste heat is used for district heat production. This results in high total energy efficiencies (∼90%) for the plants. The specific methanol costs for the six plants are in the range 11.8-25.3 €/GJexergy.

Serum level in man is strongly correlated to the intake of red meat and dairy products and the concentration in these products is strongly correlated to the chlorophyll content in the feed of the cattle. Available data suggest that phytanic acid is a natural agonist for RXR at physiological concentrations, while it is more likely that it is the metabolite pristanic acid, rather than phytanic acid itself, that acts as PPAR-α agonist. Animal studies show increased expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, after intake of phytol, the metabolic precursor of phytanic acid, but it is at present not possible to deduce whether phytanic acid is useful in the prevention of ectopic lipid deposition. Phytanic acid is an efficient inducer of the expression of uncoupler protein 1 (UCP1). UCP1 is expressed in human skeletal muscles, were it might be important for the total energy balance. Therefore, phytanic acid may be able to stimulate energy dissipation in skeletal muscles. Phytanic acid levels in serum are associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer, but the available data do not support a general causal link between circulating phytanic acid and prostate cancer risk. However, certain individuals, with specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene for the enzyme alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, might be susceptible to raised phytanic acid levels. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.","Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; Phytanic acid; Phytol; Pristanic acid; Prostate cancer; Retinoid X receptor; Uncoupler protein 1","2 methylacyl coenzyme A racemase; cell protein; chlorophyll; fatty acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha agonist; phytanic acid; retinoid X receptor; unclassified drug; uncoupler protein 1; adipocyte; cancer risk; cattle; cell differentiation; conference paper; dairy product; energy balance; fatty acid oxidation; gene expression; glucose metabolism; human; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; meat; prostate cancer; protein expression; single nucleotide polymorphism; Animalia; Bos",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950274760

The structure of the glow curves, including the number of peaks, was found to be dose-dependent. A low-temperature glow peak that at 160°C shifts to higher temperatures was also observed with increasing storage time at room temperature. This result suggests that this TL glow peak is actually made up of two or more overlapping peaks. These we have attributed to the glow peaks at lower temperatures, which decay faster than the ones at higher temperatures with storage time. The thermal fading of the window glass sample at room temperature showed a relatively sharp decay of about 60% occurring over a period of 28 days, after which the decay rate is small for a measured period of 250 days. In order to the improve the post-irradiation stability of the glow curve, the glass samples were heated after irradiation. To remove the unstable TL peaks responsible for the initial rapid fading, post-irradiation heating at 160160°CC for 10min was found to be the most suitable procedure. The dosimetric characteristics of the post-irradiation heated window glass examined in this study include fading, gamma photon dose-response, reproducibility, batch sensitivity, humidity influence, a dose-rate effect and photon energy response. Dose-response was found to be appropriate for dosimetry in the range 5Gy to 10kGy. The post-irradiation heating procedure did not affect the main dosimetric characteristics of the window glass samples. The results in this work suggest that the materials could, by using the TL technique, be a suitable candidate for alternative dose measurements in radiation processing, provided that a judicious choice of the post-irradiation heat temperature is made to minimize fading.","Gamma rays; Glass dosimeter; Thermoluminescence; Window glass","Decay rate; Dose measurement; Dose response; Dose-dependent; Dose-rate effects; Dosimetric properties; Gamma photons; Glass dosimeter; Glass samples; Glow curve; Glow peaks; Higher temperatures; Low temperatures; Overlapping peaks; Photon energy; Postirradiation; Radiation processing; Rapid fading; Reproducibilities; Room temperature; Storage time; Thermal fading; Turkishs; Window glass; Decay (organic); Dosimeters; Electron beam pumping; Gamma rays; Glass; Heating; Irradiation; Photons; Radiation; Thermoluminescence; Dosimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949630788

In the present work, the spectroscopic and kinetic features of the radicals induced in gamma-irradiated solid albendazole samples is investigated at different temperatures in the dose range of 3-34kGy by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Irradiation with gamma radiation produced two different radical species in albendazole. They were fairly stable at room temperature but relatively unstable above room temperature, giving rise to an unresolved ESR spectrum consisting of three resonance peaks centered at g=2.0057. Decay activation energies of the contributing radical species were calculated to be 47.8 (±13.5) and 50.5 (±9.7)kJ/mol using the signal intensity decay data derived from annealing studies performed at high temperatures. A linear function of the applied dose was found to best describe the experimental dose-response data. Albendazole does not present the characteristics of good dosimetric materials. However, the discrimination of irradiated albendazole from its unirradiated form was possible even 6 months after storage in normal conditions. Based on these findings, it is concluded that albendazole and albendazole-containing drugs can be safely sterilized by gamma radiation and that ESR spectroscopy could be successfully used as a potential technique for monitoring their radiosterilization.","Albendazole; ESR; Radiation sterilization; Radical","Albendazole; Dose range; Dose response; Electron spin resonance; ESR spectra; ESR spectroscopy; Gamma radiation; High temperature; Kinetic features; Linear functions; Normal condition; Potential techniques; Radiation sterilization; Radical species; Radiosterilization; Resonance peak; Room temperature; Signal intensities; Activation energy; Electroslag remelting; Gamma rays; Radiation; Resonance; Spin dynamics; Sterilization (cleaning); Electron spin resonance spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949617982

The ISSC is characterised by an absorber matrix made up of a thin cement concrete slab which performs the function of both absorbing and storing of the solar thermal energy. Inside the concrete absorber was embedded a cooper pipe network. Outdoor experiments were carried out under varied environmental conditions for several days during three consecutive months (from November 2007 to February 2008). The experiments were carried out by measuring the climatic variables, temperatures in different parts of the collectors, and mass flow rates of water, during the test days. Based on these measurements, the behavior of the systems was analyzed by comparing exit temperatures, heat losses, and delivered useful energy. A detailed energy and exergy analysis was carried out for evaluating the thermal and optical performance, exergy losses as well as exergetic efficiency for ISSC under given operating conditions. Results shows that the integrated solar storage collector, having energetic and exergetic efficiencies of 32% and 23.5% respectively, provides acceptable stored thermal heat rate by supplying approximately 80% in domestic hot water requirements for a family composed of 5-6 persons. An economic evaluation was made considering the investment time recovery through the system. The results obtained from the ISSC system were compared with the results obtained from a high quality thermosyphon solar system composed of a flat-plate collector (with a total aperture area of 2 m2) and its corresponding insulated storage tank (200 l), tested at the same time. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that stringent mitigation targets can be met under many technology scenarios, but major technological change is needed, highlighting important roles for R&D and learning-by-doing. The analysis explores the impact of limiting the set of available technology options (to account for technical uncertainties and issues of public acceptance) and identifies important influences on energy system development and economic costs under low stabilization. Biomass availability is seen to have a major influence on the characteristics of the energy system. Carbon capture and storage technologies also prove to be potentially critical for both electricity and fuel synthesis, particularly when combined with biomass to produce net negative emissions. Additionally, the availability of fast breeders provides a competitive zeroemissions option. Energy efficiency and large-scale application of renewables are also critical to realising low stabilization scenarios. Copyright © 2010 by the IAEE.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77749249628

However, recalcitrant plant cell structures represent a barrier in the fermentative biodegradation process in single- and two-stage reactors. Therefore, approaches concerning a more efficient de-polymerisation of cellulose and hemicellulose to monomeric sugars are required amongst others in order to optimise the fermentation efficiency and to increase methane yields. Here we show a new strategy for the enhancement of biogas production from hemicellulose-rich substrates. Hemicellulolytic populations from a common biogas fermenter consortium were successively enriched in batch-cultures using a synthetic medium containing xylan powder as single carbon source under anaerobic mesophilic conditions. Enriched hemicellulolytic bacteria were immobilised on trace metal activated zeolite to ensure a stable storage and easy application. Xylanase activity increased continuously during subsequent enrichment cycles by up to 162%. In batch-culture experiments we were able to observe an increase of methane by 53% compared to controls without additionally introduced microorganisms immobilised on zeolite. Specific enrichment of hemicellulolytic bacteria during the process was confirmed by using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis based on amplification of the eubacterial 16S rDNA fragments. Using sequence analysis conspicuous bands from SSCP patterns could be identified as belonging to the groups Bacteroides sp., Azospira oryzae (Dechlorosoma sp.) as well as to a wide spectrum of diverse species within the order of Clostridiales (Firmicutes). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Drying is an essential procedure for safe storage of corn. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the effects of infrared (IR), hot air (HA) and infrared-hot air combined (IR-HA) drying on some properties of corn and to offer an alternative drying procedure with low energy costs. Crude protein, total carotenoid, phenolic acid composition, color parameters (L, a+, b+, chroma, Hue angle, ΔE) and energy expenses of the drying techniques in terms of specific energy consumption (SEC) for unit evaporated water were evaluated. Dent corn samples were hand harvested at regular intervals of fortnight at maturity and the initial moisture contents were 24, 16 and 15%, respectively. Preparation was included kernel manual trimming and granulating. Kernels were dried until the moisture content comes down to 13% with IR, HA and IR-HA combination techniques except for control. All drying treatments were conducted at 45°C. It was observed that IR radiation did not cause any negative impact on the stated properties of corn in noted conditions. Besides, IR and IR-HA drying methods dramatically reduced the drying time. Specific energy consumption values showed that IR and IR-HA combined systems are more effective and economic when the initial moisture content of corn is above 16%. Evaporation of unit water took 12 and 40% less energy in IR drying of corn samples with the initial moisture content of 24 and 16%, respectively, as compared to HA drying alone. Hence, IR drying is considered to be a promising alternative for corn drying.","Color; Corn; Crude protein; Drying; Hot air; HPLC; Infrared; Phenolic acids; Specific energy consumption; Total carotenoid","carotenoid; phenol; article; energy consumption; energy cost; food color; food drying; food preservation; food storage; harvest; infrared radiation; maize; moisture; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76649096685

The estimated heat flux in the sample trees and data on biomass distributions were used to scale up to stand level biomass heat fluxes. The rate of change of sensible and latent heat storage in the air layer below the level of the flux measurements was estimated from air temperature and humidity profile measurements and soil heat flux was estimated from heat flux plates and soil temperature measurements. The fluxes of sensible and latent heat from the forest were measured with an eddy covariance system in a tower. The analysis was made for a two-month period in summer of 1995. The tree biomass heat flux was the largest of the estimated storage components and varied between 40 and -35 W m-2 on summer days with nice weather. Averaged over two months the diurnal maximum of total heat storage was 45 W m-2 and the minimum was -35 W m-2. The soil heat flux and the sensible heat storage in air were out of phase with the biomass flux and they reached maximum values that were about 75% of the maximum of the tree biomass heat storage. The energy balance closure improved significantly when the total heat storage was added to the turbulent fluxes. The slope of a regression line with sum of fluxes and storage as independent and net radiation as dependent variable, increased from 0.86 to 0.95 for half-hourly data and the scatter was also reduced. The most significant finding was, however, that during nights with strongly stable conditions when the sensible heat flux dropped to nearly zero, the total storage matched the net radiation very well. Another interesting result was that the mean energy imbalance started to increase when the Richardson number became more negative than ca. -0.1. In fact, the largest energy deficit occurred at maximum instability. Our conclusion is that eddy covariance measurements can function well during stable conditions but that the functioning under strong instabilities might be a so far unforeseen problem.",,"biomass allocation; closure; coniferous tree; diurnal variation; eddy covariance; energy balance; forest ecosystem; grass; humidity; latent heat flux; radiation balance; scale effect; soil temperature; Sweden; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76249119108

This poses the questions of how wind power might change optimal investments in other forms of power production and what kind of means could be used to increase power system flexibility in order to incorporate the variable power production from wind power in a cost-effective manner. We have analysed possible effects using an investment model that combines heat and power production and simulates electric vehicles. The model runs in an hourly time scale in order to accommodate the impact of variable power production from wind power. Electric vehicles store electricity for later use and can thus serve to increase the flexibility of the power system. Flexibility can also be upgraded by using heat storages with heat from heat pumps, electric heat boilers and combined heat and power (CHP) plants. Results show that there is great potential for additional power system flexibility in the production and use of heat. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The design of such CAES plants requires knowledge of the reservoir air pressure distribution during both the charging and discharging phases. Also, it must assure air/water interface stability to prevent water suction during discharge. An approximate analytical solution for the pressure variations within the anisotropic reservoir porous space was developed, subject to the Darcy equation and for conditions of partially penetrating wells. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify the dominant parameters affecting the well pressure and the critical flow rate (water suction threshold). It is demonstrated that water coning is a factor that could severely limit the discharge air flow rate. A significant diminishment of that limitation and reduction of the pressure fluctuation can be achieved by enlargement of the air layer height and discharge period. Likewise, aquifers with larger horizontal permeability impose less restrictive critical flows.

With high energy input, full transformation to the equilibrium phase, FeTi, is achieved. In contrast, for low levels of energy input, the process is akin to mixing without any phase transformation even for extended milling periods. In the present work, nanostructured FeTi powders were produced by mechanical alloying, avoiding the unfavourable agglomeration problem, by using a relatively low level of energy (e.g. 300 rpm) to mill the pure metallic constituents, Fe and Ti, followed by subsequent heat treatment at 800°C. A major achievement of this research was to show that, by modulating the milling intensity and total milling time, the high temperature synthesis reaction of FeTi (1100°C) can be partially or totally suppressed, reverting instead to a metastable reaction path at low temperature (650°C). The mechanical ""activation"" modifies the reactivity of the system, producing a very thin Ti /Fe layers. That in conjunction with a high level of defects induced mechanically may be responsible for the metastability.

A further aim was to determine whether the extra fat deposition from different energy sources, and its distribution in the body, depends on feeding level. A total of fifty-eight individually housed pigs (48 (sd 4) kg) were used in a 32 factorial design study, with three energy sources (02MJ digestible energy (DE)/kg075 per d of fNSP, dStarch and dUFA added to a control diet) at two feeding levels. Ten pigs were slaughtered at 48 (sd 4) kg body weight and treatment pigs at 106 (sd 3) kg body weight. Bodies were dissected and the chemical composition of each body fraction was determined. The effect of energy sources on fat and protein deposition was expressed relative to the control treatments within both energy intake levels based on a total of thirty-two observations in six treatments, and these marginal differences were subsequently treated as dependent variables. Results showed that preferential deposition of the supplemental energy intake in various fat depots did not depend on the energy source, and the extra fat deposition was similar at each feeding level. The marginal energetic transformation (energy retention; ER) of fNSP, dStarch and dUFA for fat retention (ERfat:DE) was 44, 52 and 49% (P&gt;005), respectively. Feeding level affected fat distribution, but source of energy did not change the relative partitioning of fat deposition.

The chemical and thermal characterization of the microPCMs were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). The diameters of microPCMs were found in the narrow range (0.14-0.40 μm) under the stirring speed of 2000 rpm. The spherical surfaces of microPCMs were smooth and compact. The DSC results show that microPCMs have good energy storage capacity. Thermal cycling test showed that the microPCMs have good thermal reliability with respect to the changes in their thermal properties after repeated 5000 thermal cycling.

However, in spite of the advantages associated with ANG over other storage modes, there are some issues that need be properly addressed in order to ensure a viable employment of such alternative. One major problem is that the thermal effects associated with the sorption phenomena tend to diminish the storage capacity, thereby resulting in poorer performance. Hence, in order to design commercially viable storage vessels, the heat and mass transfer mechanisms that occur in these devices must be carefully understood and controlled. With the purpose of improving the understanding of mass and energy transport within ANG vessels, dimensionless groups associated with this problem have been developed in this study, resulting in an innovation to the ANG literature. Along with the dimensionless groups, a lumped-capacitance formulation has been also proposed. Although this type of formulation is limited compared to the multi-dimensional formulations present in the literature, its computational solution is remarkably faster. Numerical solution results using the proposed lumped formulation are compared with those of a previous study, suggesting that the simpler model can be applied to larger process times. The process of charging and discharging ANG vessels was then simulated employing the proposed formulation for different combinations of the developed dimensionless groups. In order to properly assess charge and discharge processes, a performance coefficient was employed. The results show that increasing the heat capacity ratio and dimensionless heat transfer coefficient tend to augment the performance coefficient, whereas an increase in the dimensionless heat of sorption worsens performance. The proposed normalization scheme is applicable to both multi-dimensional and spatially-lumped formulations, thereby facilitating the analysis of heat transfer enhancement in these storage vessels. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

According to Derek Henderson, Senior Energy Partner for Deloitte, 2010 will be a challenging year for the energy industry and it is likely mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity will begin to rebound in middle of 2010. Companies across sectors will need to think about how to ensure they make the most of future M&A opportunities. As global competition increases so will M&A's role as a vital strategic tool for gaining much needed access to resources and opportunities. Both international oil companies and national oil companies are expected to face a particularly difficult set of issues in the year ahead. M&A activity is likely to begin to rebound in middle of 2010 and attain prerecession levels by 2011. Power and utilities companies will be likely to face their own set of issues. The most important of these is the continued rise of the ""smart grid"", which has the potential to revolutionize the power sector by reducing energy consumption by ≤ 30% and decreasing the need to construct new power plants. Renewable energy production is likely to heat up in 2 places synonymous with fossil fuels, i.e., the Middle East and North Africa. Carbon capture and storage may be the answer, yet this technology is costly and yet to be proved on a global scale. Many nations, particularly emerging ones, will forge ahead with building new fleets of coal-fired plants in the coming years, regardless of the emissions consequences.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74849114612

Phytoremediation represents an effective low-cost approach for removing pollutants from contaminated soils, and a crop with significant phytoremediation potential is flax. However, significant differences in Cd accumulation and tolerance were previously found among commercial flax cultivars. Notably, cv. Jitka showed substantially higher tolerance to elevated Cd levels in soil and plant tissues than cv. Tábor. Here, significant changes in the expression of 14 proteins (related to disease/defense, metabolism, protein destination and storage, signal transduction, energy and cell structure) were detected by image and mass spectrometric analysis of two-dimensionally separated proteins extracted from Cd-treated cell suspension cultures derived from these contrasting cultivars. Further, two proteins, ferritin and glutamine synthetase (a key enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis), were only up-regulated by Cd in cv. Jitka, indicating that Cd tolerance mechanisms in this cultivar may include maintenance of low Cd levels at sensitive sites by ferritin and low-molecular weight thiol peptides binding Cd. The identified changes could facilitate marker-assisted breeding for Cd tolerance and the development of transgenic flax lines with enhanced Cd tolerance and accumulation capacities for phytoremediating Cd-contaminated soils. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A common situation is that cooling demands of the processes are satisfied without any deeper analysis of the overall impact of the cooling systems on the plant's economy or the environment. If cooling water is available it is used as much as needed and then pumped back to the river, some degrees warmer. An optimisation model was developed for integration of cooling and heating systems to tackle the problem. An industrial cooling system is a complex energy system comprising different options of producing cooling, distribution pipelines for cold media and cooling storages. Integration of power generation and heating systems to the cooling systems was included in the model. An illustrative example is presented in the paper. 10 process streams with cooling demand and 10 streams with heating demand were chosen, situated at different locations at the plant site. The optimal matches between the streams were found together with the sizes of the heat exchangers and the demands of hot and cold utilities. The costs of pipelines and the pumping costs of the streams are included in the model. The model can be used in the design of greenfield and retrofit investments and in versatile what-if analyses of the plant design or operation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The expansion is driven by the much higher production levels that are achieved in greenhouses compared to open fields. This provides increased income for farmers and a positive effect on rural development. Intensification is driven by the demand for better control of the production process resulting in higher yield but, more importantly, higher product quality. As a result products can meet the standards of the fast expanding consumer market for high quality fresh products, driven by the booming new economies. However greenhouse horticulture also faces major problems. In northern countries, with cold winter climates, greenhouses have to be heated for optimal growing conditions so energy supply is an important issue. In the southern countries with the combination of high global radiation and high outdoor temperatures during summer, cooling of greenhouses is needed during this period. Solutions for energy supply in winter and cooling in summer can be combined applying seasonal storage of excess solar energy and exploiting this for heating in winter. The advantage of this system is cheaper cooling, and energy savings of about 35% compared to heating by furnace. The disadvantage is that the excess solar energy is converted to low grade thermal energy which is stored at a temperature level of about 18 °C. This can only be exploited for heating in winter by a heat pump, driven by high grade energy such as electricity. Here, the feasibility of a novel approach is investigated of a greenhouse design combining cooling with energy supply in such a way that excess solar energy is directly converted to high grade electric energy. A prototype greenhouse according to this design is under construction. In a following paper the experimental results of this prototype greenhouse will be presented. © 2009 IAgrE.",,"Agriculture; Atmospheric radiation; Economic analysis; Energy conservation; Regional planning; Solar energy; Electric energies; Energy productions; Feasibility studies; Growing conditions; Outdoor temperature; Production process; Rural development; Temperature level; Greenhouses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74149094599

Here, we tested the hypothesis that expression of activated calcineurin in skeletal muscle influences body composition, energy homeostasis, and exercise performance. Using transgenic mice expressing activated calcineurin (CnA*) in skeletal muscle (MCK-CnA* transgenic mice), we determined whether skeletal muscle reprogramming by calcineurin activation affects exercise performance and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Body weight and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) skeletal muscle weight were reduced 10% in MCK-CnA* mice compared with wild-type littermates. Basal oxygen consumption, food intake, and voluntary exercise behavior were unchanged between MCK-CnA* and wild-type mice. However, when total energy expenditure was normalized by fat-free mass, energy expenditure was increased in MCK-CnA* mice. An endurance performance treadmill running test revealed MCK-CnA* mice are fatigue resistant and run 50% farther before exhaustion. After a standardized exercise bout, glycogen and triglyceride content in EDL muscle was higher in MCK-CnA* vs. wild-type mice. Mitochondrial respiratory capacity was increased 35% in EDL muscle from resting MCK-CnA* mice. In conclusion, our results provide evidence to support the hypothesis that calcineurin activation in skeletal muscle increases mitochondrial oxidative function and energy substrate storage, which contributes to enhanced endurance exercise performance. These adaptive changes occur as a consequence of a lifelong expression of a constitutively active calcineurin and mimic the response to chronic endurance training.

It is applied from reservoir discovery to its abandonment, with the objective of achieving maximum profitability by using a recovery process with minimum capital investments and operation costs. The goals of modern system-engineer' approach to hydrocarbon reservoir management are: managing efficiency; adequate and on time decision making; increasing reserves, and oil and gas recovery factor; production increment; risk reduction; investment efficiency; minimizing costs and environmental protection. The gas reservoir ""M"" is the gas reservoir discovered in central part of Serbia. It was not put in production yet, so it is important to apply reservoir management concepts from the beginning of the production process. Based on production characteristics, this reservoir belongs to a group of smaller gas reservoirs that characterizes most often the Serbian exploitation area. Also, this reservoir fullfils most of criteria for using it as an underground gas storage reservoir. Thus, the analysis of possibilities for conversion into the underground gas storage after certain production period was also considered. The management of gas reservoir ""M"" has been analyzed by two different approaches. The first one refers to the management of the reservoir as a gas producer during the whole reservoir life. The second management approach considers gas production for a certain period of time, followed by underground gas storage (UGS). In this paper, economic and financial evaluation results are given for the presented options of gas reservoir management. A decision analysis has been applied to select an optimized gas reservoir management approach. Adequate management of this gas reservoir would contribute to further development and reform of Serbia's gas energy sector that is characterized by great dependence on natural gas imports, and a lack of underground gas storage. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Seed number and potential individual seed weight are established at a similar timing, around the flowering period, and seed weight at maturity is highly correlated with the potential established earlier. It is known that, within a species, available resources during the seed set period are distributed between both yield components, resulting in a trade-off between seed number and seed weight. Here we tested if this concept could apply for interspecific comparisons, where combinations of numbers and size across species could be related to the total available resources being either allocated to more seed or larger potential individual seed weight during the seed set period. Based on this, species differences in seed weight should be related to resource availability per seed around the period when seed number is determined. Resource availability per seed was estimated as the rate of increase in aboveground biomass per seed around the period of seed set. Data from 15 crop species differing in plant growth, seed number, seed weight and seed composition were analysed from available literature. Because species differed in seed composition, seed weight was analysed following an energy requirement approach. There was an interspecific trade-off relationship between seed number per unit of land area and seed weight (r = 0.92; F(1, 13) = 32.9; n = 15; P &lt; 0.001). Seed weight of different species was positively correlated (r = 0.90; F(1, 13) = 52.9; n = 15; P &lt; 0.001) with resource availability per seed around the seed set period. This correlation included contrasting species like quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa; ∼100000 seeds m-2, ∼4 mg equivalent-glucose seed -1) or peanut (Arachis hypogaea; ∼800 seeds m-2, ∼1000 mg equivalent-glucose seed-1). Seed number and individual seed weight combinations across species were related and could be explained considering resource availability when plants are adjusting their seed number to the growth environment and seeds are establishing their storage capacity. Available resources around the seed set period are proportionally allocated to produce either many small seeds or few larger seeds depending on the particular species. © 2009 Association of Applied Biologists.","Cereals; Grain weight; Leguminoses; Quinoa; Rape; Sunflower; Yield components","aboveground biomass; cereal; growth rate; herb; interspecific variation; legume; resource allocation; resource availability; seed set; trade-off; Arachis hypogaea; Chenopodium quinoa; Helianthus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72149089598

Research over the last decades has identified an additional role of lipids in cellular signaling, membrane microdomain organization and dynamics, and membrane trafficking. These properties make lipids an attractive target for pathogens to modulate host cell processes in order to allow their survival and replication. In this review we will summarize the often ingenious strategies of pathogens to modify the lipid homeostasis of host cells, allowing them to divert cellular processes. To this end pathogens take full advantage of the complexity of the lipidome. The examples are categorized in generalized and emerging principles describing the involvement of lipids in host-pathogen interactions. Several pathogens are described that simultaneously induce multiple changes in the host cell signaling and trafficking mechanisms. Elucidation of these pathogen-induced changes may have important implications for drug development. The emergence of high-throughput lipidomic techniques will allow the description of changes of the host cell lipidome at the level of individual molecular lipid species and the identification of lipid biomarkers. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The thermal storage medium is a metallic substance, Zinc-Tin alloy, which serves as the phase change material (PCM). A high-temperature heat transfer fluid (HTF) is added to the storage medium in order to enhance heat exchange within the storage system, which comprises PCM units and the associated heat exchangers serving for charging and discharging the storage. The applied heat transfer mechanism is based on the HTF reflux created by a combined evaporation-condensation process. It was shown that a PCM with a fraction of 70 wt.% Zn in the alloy (Zn70Sn30) is optimal to attain a storage temperature of 370 °C, provided the heat source such as solar-produced steam or solar-heated synthetic oil has a temperature of about 400 °C (typical for the parabolic troughs technology). This PCM melts gradually between temperatures 200 and 370 °C preserving the latent heat of fusion, mainly of the Zn-component, that later, at the stage of heat discharge, will be available for producing steam. The thermal storage concept was experimentally studied using a lab scale apparatus that enabled investigating of storage materials (the PCM-HTF system) simultaneously with carrying out thermal performance measurements and observing heat transfer effects occurring in the system. The tests produced satisfactory results in terms of thermal stability and compatibility of the utilized storage materials, alloy Zn70Sn30 and the eutectic mixture of biphenyl and diphenyl oxide, up to a working temperature of 400 °C. Optional schemes for integrating the developed thermal storage into a solar thermal electric plant are discussed and evaluated considering a pilot scale solar plant with thermal power output of 12 MW. The storage should enable uninterrupted operation of solar thermal electric systems during additional hours daily when normal solar radiation is not sufficient. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, autonomous electrical networks are subject to strict constraints posing serious limitations on the absorption of RES-based electricity generation. To by-pass these constraints and also secure a more sustainable electricity supply status, the concept of combining photovoltaic power stations and energy storage systems comprises a promising solution for small scaled autonomous electrical networks, increasing the reliability of the local network as well. In this context, the present study is devoted to develop a complete methodology, able to define the dimensions of an autonomous electricity generation system based on the maximum available solar potential exploitation at minimum electricity generation cost. In addition special emphasis is given in order to select the most cost-efficient energy storage configuration available. According to the calculation results obtained, one may clearly state that an optimum sizing combination of a PV generator along with an appropriate energy storage system may significantly contribute on reducing the electricity generation cost in several island electrical systems, providing also abundant and high quality electricity without the environmental and macroeconomic impacts of the oil-based thermal power stations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that at concentrations of the two semiconductors x<0.06% the emission spectra are due to annihilation of free (internal) excitons in quantum states. The mean size of the quantum dots for a given concentration of ZnSe and CdS is calculated and found to be in good agreement with the X-ray data, and the exciton binding energy is calculated with allowance for the dielectric mismatch between the semiconductor and matrix. It is proposed that this mismatch may be the cause giving rise to the exciton percolation level that is observed in QD arrays for both systems at x>0.06%. The emission from the surface level of CdS QDs in the region ~2.7 eV, formed by the outer atoms with dangling bonds, is observed for the first time, as is the emission band from surface localized states. The relation between the position of the maximum of this band and the energy of the 1S state of the free exciton is established.

The question of load redistribution for better energetic usage is of vital importance since these new renewable energy sources are often intermittent. Therefore, new systems must be proposed which ally energy storage with renewable energy generators for reestablishment of grid reliability. This work presents a review of energy storage and redistribution associated with photovoltaic energy, proposing a distributed micro-generation complex connected to the electrical power grid using energy storage systems, with an emphasis placed on the use of NaS batteries. These systems aim to improve the load factor, considering supply side management, and the offer of backup energy, in the case of demand side management. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous types of solar dryers have been designed and developed in various parts of the world, yielding varying degrees of technical performance. Basically, there are four types of solar dryers; (1) direct solar dryers, (2) indirect solar dryers, (3) mixed-mode dryers and (4) hybrid solar dryers. This paper is a review of these types of solar dryers with aspect to the product being dried, technical and economical aspects. The technical directions in the development of solar-assisted drying systems for agricultural produce are compact collector design, high efficiency, integrated storage, and long-life drying system. Air-based solar collectors are not the only available systems. Water-based collectors can also be used whereby water to air heat exchanger can be used. The hot air for drying of agricultural produce can be forced to flow in the water to air heat exchanger. The hot water tank acts as heat storage of the solar drying system. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Two distinct fuels and related power-production technologies are compared as a case study, in terms of economic efficiency: the biomass of cotton stalks and the natural gas. The carbon capture and storage option are also investigated for power plants based on both fuel types. The model used in this study investigates important economic aspects using a ""real options"" method instead of traditional Discounted Cash Flow techniques, as it might handle in a more effective way the problems arising from the stochastic nature of significant cash flow contributors' evolution like electricity, fuel and CO2 allowance prices. The capital costs have also a functional relationship with time, thus providing an additional reason for implementing ""real options"" as well as the learning-curves technique. The methodology as well as the results presented in this work, may lead to interesting conclusions and affect potential private investment strategies and future decision making. This study indicates that both technologies lead to positive investment yields, with the natural gas being more profitable for the case study examined, while the carbon capture and storage does not seem to be cost efficient with the current CO2 allowance prices. Furthermore, low interest rates might encourage potential investors to wait before actualising their business plans while higher interest rates favor immediate investment decisions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The project comprised of wind, solar and lead-acid battery energy storage technologies that were implemented as a mini-hybrid off-grid electrification system for the village. The sustainability assessment methodology predicts the outcomes of such interventions by way of a learning model using discipline experts in the fields of economics, sociology, ecosystem sustainability, institutional governance, and the physics and chemistry of energy conversion processes. The comparison of the project's outcomes with a South African sustainable development framework shows that the specific village renewable off-grid electrification system is not viable. The main reason is that charges for electricity supply costs in village grids are too high for available subsidies; the economies of scale for renewable energy supply technologies favour national grids. The failure of the integrated system may also be attributable to the complexity of the social-institutional sub-system, which resulted in uncertainty for project planners and system designers, and the lack of resilience of the technological system to demands from the socio-economic and institutional sub-systems. Policy-related recommendations are made accordingly. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Applying right timing can maximize the performance of the supply. The optimal operation of a wind turbine, a solar unit, a fuel cell and a storage battery is searched by a mixed-integer linear programming implemented in General Algebraic Modeling Systems (GAMS). A Virtual Power Producer (VPP) can optimal operate the generation units, assured the good functioning of equipment, including the maintenance, operation cost and the generation measurement and control. A central control at system allows a VPP to manage the optimal generation and their load control.
