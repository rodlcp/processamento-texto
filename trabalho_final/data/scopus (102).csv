A critical issue is the need for practical systems for hydrogen storage, a problem that remains unresolved after several decades of exploration. In this context, the possibility of storing hydrogen in advanced carbon materials has generated considerable interest. But confirmation and a mechanistic understanding of the hydrogen-storage capabilities of these materials still require much work1-5. Our previously published work on hydrogen uptake by alkali-doped carbon nanotubes cannot be reproduced by others6-8. It was realized by us and also demonstrated by Pinkerton et al.8 that most of the weight gain was due to moisture, which the alkali oxide picked up from the atmosphere. Here we describe a different material system, lithium nitride, which shows potential as a hydrogen storage medium. Lithium nitride is usually employed as an electrode, or as a starting material for the synthesis of binary or ternary nitrides9, 10. Using a variety of techniques, we demonstrate that this compound can also reversibly take up large amounts of hydrogen. Although the temperature required to release the hydrogen at usable pressures is too high for practical application of the present material, we suggest that more investigations are needed, as the metal-N-H system could prove to be a promising route to reversible hydrogen storage.",,"Carbon nanotubes; Electrodes; Environmental engineering; Hydrogen; Storage systems; Nitrides; alkali; carbon; hydrogen; imide; lithium; metal; nanoparticle; nitrogen derivative; energy; hydrogen; lithium; nitride; storage; article; electrode; energy resource; materials; mechanics; moisture; molecular interaction; priority journal; proton transport; storage; temperature; thermogravimetry; weight gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037153131

M5G 2C4, Canada","The primary genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors responsible for causing insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell failure and the precise sequence of events leading to the development of type 2 diabetes are not yet fully understood. Abnormalities of triglyceride storage and lipolysis in insulin-sensitive tissues are an early manifestation of conditions characterized by insulin resistance and are detectable before the development of postprandial or fasting hyperglycemia. Increased free fatty acid (FFA) flux from adipose tissue to nonadipose tissue, resulting from abnormalities of fat metabolism, participates in and amplifies many of the fundamental metabolic derangements that are characteristic of the insulin resistance syndrome and type 2 diabetes. It is also likely to play an important role in the progression from normal glucose tolerance to fasting hyperglycemia and conversion to frank type 2 diabetes in insulin resistant individuals. Adverse metabolic consequences of increased FFA flux, to be discussed in this review, are extremely wide ranging and include, but are not limited to: 1) dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis, 2) impaired glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver, 3) diminished insulin clearance, aggravating peripheral tissue hyperinsulinemia, and 4) impaired pancreatic β-cell function. The precise biochemical mechanisms whereby fatty acids and cytosolic triglycerides exert their effects remain poorly understood. Recent studies, however, suggest that the sequence of events may be the following: in states of positive net energy balance, triglyceride accumulation in ""fat-buffering"" adipose tissue is limited by the development of adipose tissue insulin resistance. This results in diversion of energy substrates to nonadipose tissue, which in turn leads to a complex array of metabolic abnormalities characteristic of insulin-resistant states and type 2 diabetes. Recent evidence suggests that some of the biochemical mechanisms whereby glucose and fat exert adverse effects in insulin-sensitive and insulin-producing tissues are shared, thus implicating a diabetogenic role for energy excess as a whole. Although there is now evidence that weight loss through reduction of caloric intake and increase in physical activity can prevent the development of diabetes, it remains an open question as to whether specific modulation of fat metabolism will result in improvement in some or all of the above metabolic derangements or will prevent progression from insulin resistance syndrome to type 2 diabetes.",,"fatty acid; glucose; insulin; adipose tissue; caloric intake; cell function; controlled study; diabetogenesis; disease course; dyslipidemia; energy balance; environmental factor; fatty acid transport; fatty liver; glucose metabolism; glucose tolerance test; heredity; human; human tissue; hyperinsulinemia; hypertriglyceridemia; insulin clearance; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipidosis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas islet beta cell; pathogenesis; physical activity; postprandial state; priority journal; review; sequence analysis; tissue distribution",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036217052

It is shown that for these applications the electrochemical properties of multiwalled (MWNTs) and single walled (SWNTs) nanotubes are essentially dominated by their mesoporous character. During lithium insertion into nanotubular materials a high irreversible capacity Cirr (from 460 to 1080 mAh/g) has been observed after the first cycle with a tendency to further decomposition of electrolyte with cycling. Penetration of solvated lithium ions in the accessible mesopores is at the origin of this phenomenon; an almost linear dependence has been found between the mesopore volume and Cirr. Reversible capacity for lithium insertion Crev ranged between 220 and 780 mAh/g; however, a great divergence (hysteresis) between insertion and extraction characteristics was observed independently on the kind of nanotubes and oxygen content. Amount of lithium stored by electrostatic attraction is negligible in comparison to real redox reactions which for thermodynamic reasons present linear variation of potential, especially during deinsertion (pseudocapacitive effects). During positive polarization, i.e., removal of lithium, resistivity of the electrode also gradually increases. Due to the open network of mesopores formed by the nanotubes entanglement, and consequently an easily accessible electrode-electrolyte interface, nanotubular materials are quite adapted for supercapacitor electrodes in various electrolytic solutions. High values of capacitance (80 F/g) have been obtained in 6 M KOH for materials with a surface area of only ca. 430 m2/g. Capacitance values have been enhanced either by additional oxygenated functionalisation of nanotubes (130 F/g) or by conducting polypyrrole (PPy) electrodeposition where the maximum values reached 170 F/g. The next domain of energy storage in the carbon nanostructures is the accumulation of hydrogen by the electrochemical decomposition of aqueous alkaline medium on a negatively polarized carbon electrode in ambient conditions. For SWNTs only moderate values (below 0.5 wt.% of H2) have been found, while for activated carbons with highly developed surface area of 1500 m2/g, the amount of reversibly sorbed hydrogen was ca. 2 wt.%, noticeably larger than under dihydrogen pressure (only 0.4 wt.% for the same material at 70 bar and 273 K). The enhancement observed for the activated carbon is interpreted by the formation of nascent hydrogen during water reduction which penetrates easily in the available carbon nanopores. The values obtained by this method are comparable to those of metallic alloys, such as LaNi5 for example. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.","A. Activated carbon; Carbon nanotubes; D.

Both lean and obese subjects eventually reach energy balance and their body weight regulation implies that the adipose tissue mass is ""sensed"", leading to appropriate responses of energy intake and energy expenditure. The cloning of the ob gene and the identification of its encoded protein, leptin, have provided a system signaling the amount of adipose energy stores to the brain. Leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells, acts in rodents via hypothalamic receptors to inhibit feeding and increase thermogenesis. A feedback regulatory loop with three distinct steps has been identified: (1) a sensor (leptin production by adipose cells) monitors the size of the adipose tissue mass; (2) hypothalamic centers receive and integrate the intensity of the leptin signal through leptin receptors (LRb); (3) effector systems, including the sympathetic nervous system, control the two main determinants of energy balance - energy intake and energy expenditure. While this feedback regulatory loop is well established in rodents, there are many unsolved questions about its applicability to body weight regulation in humans. The rate of leptin production is related to adiposity, but a large portion of the interindividual variability in plasma leptin concentration is independent of body fatness. Gender is an important factor determining plasma leptin, with women having markedly higher leptin concentrations than men for any given degree of fat mass. The ob mRNA expression is also upregulated by glucocorticoids, whereas stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system results in its inhibition. Furthermore, leptin is not a satiety factor in humans because changes in food intake do not induce short-term increases in plasma leptin levels. After its binding to LRb in the hypothalamus, leptin stimulates a specific signaling cascade that results in the inhibition of several orexigenic neuropeptides, while stimulating several anorexigenic peptides. The orexigenic neuropeptides that are downregulated by leptin are NPY (neuropeptide Y), MCH (melanin-concentrating hormone), orexins, and AGRP (agouti-related peptide). The anorexigenic neuropeptides that are upregulated by leptin are α-MSH (α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone), which acts on MC4R (melanocortin-4 receptor); CART (cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript); and CRH (corticotropin-releasing-hormone). Obese humans have high plasma leptin concentrations related to the size of adipose tissue, but this elevated leptin signal does not induce the expected responses (i.e., a reduction in food intake and an increase in energy expenditure). This suggests that obese humans are resistant to the effects of endogenous leptin. This resistance is also shown by the lack of effect of exogenous leptin administration to induce weight loss in obese patients. The mechanisms that may account for leptin resistance in human obesity include a limitation of the blood-brain-barrier transport system for leptin and an inhibition of the leptin signaling pathways in leptin-responsive hypothalamic neurons. During periods of energy deficit, the fall in leptin plasma levels exceeds the rate at which fat stores are decreased. Reduction of the leptin signal induces several neuroendocrine responses that tend to limit weight loss, such as hunger, food-seeking behavior, and suppression of plasma thyroid hormone levels. Conversely, it is unlikely that leptin has evolved to prevent obesity when plenty of palatable foods are available because the elevated plasma leptin levels resulting from the increased adipose tissue mass do not prevent the development of obesity. In conclusion, in humans, the leptin signaling system appears to be mainly involved in maintenance of adequate energy stores for survival during periods of energy deficit. Its role in the etiology of human obesity is only demonstrated in the very rare situations of absence of the leptin signal (mutations of the leptin gene or of the leptin receptor gene), which produces an internal perception of starvation and results in a chronic stimulation of excessive food intake.","Body weight; Energy expenditure; Food intake; Obesity; Starvation","agouti related protein; alpha intermedin; cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide; corticotropin releasing factor; glucocorticoid; leptin; leptin receptor; melanin concentrating hormone; messenger RNA; neuropeptide Y; orexin; body weight; conference paper; energy balance; energy expenditure; food intake; gene expression regulation; hormonal regulation; human; lipid storage; neuroendocrinology; obesity; signal transduction; starvation; weight reduction; Agouti; Rodentia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036293591

Elastic implies the property of elasticity, or the ability to deform reversibly without loss of energy; so elastic proteins should have high resilience. Another meaning for elastic is 'stretchy', or the ability to be deformed to large strains with little force. Thus, elastic proteins should have low stiffness. The combination of high resilience, large strains and low stiffness is characteristic of rubber-like proteins (e.g. resilin and elastin) that function in the storage of elastic-strain energy. Other elastic proteins play very different roles and have very different properties. Collagen fibres provide exceptional energy storage capacity but are not very stretchy. Mussel byssus threads and spider dragline silks are also elastic proteins because, in spite of their considerable strength and stiffness, they are remarkably stretchy. The combination of strength and extensibility, together with low resilience, gives these materials an impressive resistance to fracture (i.e. toughness), a property that allows mussels to survive crashing waves and spiders to build exquisite aerial filters. Given this range of properties and functions, it is probable that elastic proteins will provide a wealth of chemical structures and elastic mechanisms that can be exploited in novel structural materials through biotechnology.","Byssal fibres; Collagen; Elastic proteins; Elastin; Mechanical design; Spider silks","protein; Araneae; collagen; elastin; insect protein; scleroprotein; animal; biomechanics; bivalve; chemistry; elasticity; review; silk; spider; tendon; Animals; Biomechanics; Bivalvia; Collagen; Elasticity; Elastin; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Insect Proteins; Silk; Spiders; Tendons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037185940

It is a challenge to fill their unique tubular structure with metals and gases. Especially, the absorption of hydrogen in single wall nanotubes has attracted many research groups worldwide. The values published for the quantity of hydrogen absorbed in nanostructured carbon materials varies between 0.4 and 67 mass%. With the assumption that the hydrogen condenses in the cavity of the nanotube or forms an adsorbed monolayer of hydrogen at the surface of the tube, the potential of nanotubes as a host material for hydrogen storage can be estimated. The hydrogen storage density due to condensed hydrogen in the cavity of the tube depends linearly on the tube diameter and starts at 1.5 mass% for a 0.671 nm single wall carbon nanotube. The surface adsorption of a monolayer of hydrogen leads to a maximum storage capacity of 3.3 mass%. We have investigated a large number of nanostructured carbon samples, i.e. high surface area graphite, single wall and multiwall nanotubes, by means of volumetric gas adsorption, galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments and temperature programmed desorption spectroscopy. The reversible hydrogen capacity of the carbon samples measured in an electrochemical half-cell at room temperature correlates with the specific surface area (BET) of the sample and is 1.5 mass%/1000 m2/g. © 2001 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

V, Eupener Strasse 33, 30519 Hannover, Germany","The viscoelastic properties of (mostly carbon black) filled elastomers are reviewed with emphasis on the strain-dependence of the complex dynamic modulus (Payne effect). Considerable progress has been made in the past in relating the typical dynamical behavior at low strain amplitudes to a cyclic breakdown and reagglomeration of physical filler-filler bonds in typical clusters of varying size, including the infinite filler network. Common features between the phenomenological agglomeration/deagglomeration Kraus approach and very recent semi-microscopical networking approaches (two aggregate VTG model, links-nodes-blobs model, kinetical cluster-cluster aggregation) are discussed. All semi-microscopical models contain the assumption of geometrical arrangements of sub-units (aggregates) in particular filler network structures, resulting for example from percolation or kinetical cluster-cluster aggregation. These concepts predict some features of the Payne effect that are independent of the specific types of filler. These features are in good agreement with experimental studies. For example, the shape exponent m of the storage modulus, G', drop with increasing deformation is determined by the structure of the cluster network. Another example is a scaling relation predicting a specific power law behavior of the elastic modulus as a function of the filler volume fraction. The exponent reflects the characteristic structure of the fractal filler clusters and of the corresponding filler network. The existing concepts of the filler network breakdown and reformation appear to be adequate in describing the deformation-dependence of dynamic mechanical properties of filled rubbers. The different approaches suggest in a common manner that there is a change of filler structure with increasing dynamic strain. However, in all cases additional assumptions are made about the accompanying energy dissipation process, imparting higher hysteresis to the filled rubber. This process may be slippage of entanglements (slip-links) in the transition layer between bound rubber layer and mobile rubber phase, and/or partially release of elastically 'dead' immobilized rubber trapped within the filler network or agglomerates. The theoretical understanding of filled elastomers has been improved to the extent that now a connection can be made between the filler structures on larger length scales and the viscoelastic properties of rubbery materials. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.","Elastomers; Filler networking; Fractal filler structures; Payne effect; Viscoelasticity","elastomer; rubber; chemical reaction kinetics; chemical structure; energy transfer; hysteresis; immobilization; molecular dynamics; particle size; phenomenology; physical stress; review; theoretical model; viscoelasticity; young modulus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036263724

From in vitro assays, HSL is known to hydrolyze TG, diglycerides (DG), cholesteryl esters, and retinyl esters. In the current study we have generated HSL knock-out mice and demonstrate three lines of evidence that HSL is instrumental in the catabolism of DG in vivo. First, HSL deficiency in mice causes the accumulation of DG in white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and testis. Second, when tissue extracts were used in an in vitro lipase assay, a reduced FFA release and the accumulation of DG was observed in HSL knock-out mice which did not occur when tissue extracts from control mice were used. Third, in vitro lipolysis experiments with HSL-deficient fat pads demonstrated that the isoproterenol-stimulated release of FFA was decreased and DG accumulated intracellularly resulting in the essential absence of the isoproterenol-stimulated glycerol formation typically observed in control fat pads. Additionally, the absence of HSL in white adipose tissue caused a shift of the fatty acid composition of the TG moiety toward increased long chain fatty acids implying a substrate specificity of the enzyme in vivo. From these in vivo results we conclude that HSL is the rate-limiting enzyme for the cellular catabolism of DG in adipose tissue and muscle.",,"Biological organs; Enzymes; Esters; Fatty acids; Glycerol; Muscle; Substrates; Lipolysis; Biochemistry; cholesterol ester; diacylglycerol; fatty acid; isoprenaline; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; adipose tissue; animal cell; article; catabolism; chemical composition; controlled study; energy; enzyme deficiency; enzyme specificity; enzyme substrate; hormone sensitivity; hydrolysis; knockout mouse; lipid storage; lipolysis; mouse; muscle; nonhuman; priority journal; protein function; testis; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Blotting, Southern; Cholesterol Esterase; Chromatography, Thin Layer; Diglycerides; DNA; DNA, Complementary; Fatty Acids; Genetic Vectors; Isoproterenol; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Inbred CBA; Mice, Knockout; Models, Genetic; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscles; Myocardium; Recombination, Genetic; RNA; Sodium Chloride; Testis; Time Factors; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037085450

Experiments have shown similar electron occupation of the quantized energy levels in semiconductor quantum dots-often described as artificial atoms. But unlike real atoms, the confinement potential of quantum dots is anisotropic, and the electrons can easily couple with phonons of the material. Here we report electrical pump-and-probe experiments that probe the allowed and 'forbidden' transitions between energy levels under phonon emission in quantum dots with one or two electrons (artificial hydrogen and helium atoms). The forbidden transitions are in fact allowed by higher-order processes where electrons flip their spin. We find that the relaxation time is about 200 μs for forbidden transitions, 4 to 5 orders of magnitude longer than for allowed transitions. This indicates that the spin degree of freedom is well separated from the orbital degree of freedom, and that the total spin in the quantum dots is an excellent quantum number. This is an encouraging result for potential applications of quantum dots as basic entities for spin-based quantum information storage. © 2002 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Electron transitions; Electrons; Phonons; Semiconductor quantum dots; Electrical pumps; Atoms; helium; hydrogen; helium; hydrogen; article; electron; energy; magnetic field; molecular interaction; priority journal; quantum mechanics; spectroscopy; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037136515

The numerous advantages of BS have prompted applications not only in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries but in environmental protection and energy-saving technology as well. Glycolipid BS are the most promising, due to high productivity from renewable resources and versatile biochemical properties. Mannosylerythritol lipids (MEL), which are glycolipid BS produced by a yeast Candida antarctrica, exhibit not only excellent interfacial properties but also remarkable differentiation-inducing activities against human leukemia cells. MEL also show a potential anti-agglomeration effect on ice particles in ice slurry used for cold thermal storage. Recently, the cationic liposome bearing MEL has been demonstrated to increase dramatically the efficiency of gene transfection into mammalian cells. These features of BS should broaden its applications in new advanced technologies.

Among other chores in energy metabolism, the talents of carbohydrates to establish a high-density coding system give reason for a paradigmatic shift. The sequence complexity of glycans and glycan-processing enzymes (glycosyltransferases, glycosidases and enzymes introducing substituents such as sulfotransferases), the growing evidence for the importance of glycans from transgenic and knock-out animal models and the correlation of defects in glycosylation with diseases are substantial assets to portray oligosaccharides as code words in their own right. Matching the pace of progress in the work on glycoconjugates, the increasing level of refinement of our knowledge about lectins (definition of this term: carbohydrate-binding proteins, excluding sugar-specific antibodies, receptors of free mono- or disaccharides for transport or chemotaxis and enzymes modifying the bound carbohydrate) epitomizes the sphere of action of the sugar code (functional lectinomics). It encompasses, among other activities, intra- and intercellular transport processes, sensor branches of innate immunity, regulation of cell-cell (matrix) adhesion or migration and positive/negative growth control with implications for differentiation and malignancy. The Q & A approach taken in this review lists a series of arguments in a stepwise manner to make the reader wonder why it is only a rather recent process that the concept of the sugar code has taken root in deciphering the mechanistic versatility of biological information storage and transfer. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Adjusting the rotor speed makes the machine either release the kinetic energy to the power system or absorb it from the utility grid. Thus, the machine has the capability of achieving not only reactive-power control, but also active-power control based on the flywheel effect of the rotating parts. This paper proposes a new control strategy for a doubly-fed induction machine intended as a flywheel energy storage system, which is characterized by the combination of vector control and decoupling control. The control strategy enables the induction machine to perform active-power control independent of reactive-power control even in transient states. The validity of the theory developed in this paper, along with the effectiveness and viability of the control strategy, is confirmed by computer simulation. In addition, this paper discusses a transient behavior of a magnetizing current in the induction machine.","Decoupling control; Doubly-fed induction machine; Flywheel energy storage system; Vector control","Flywheel energy storage system; Computer simulation; Control system synthesis; Electric energy storage; Electric inverters; Flywheels; Kinetic energy; Pulse width modulation; Rotors (windings); Vectors; Asynchronous machinery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036223151

Animal and human studies have shown that the fast rate of oxidation of MCFA leads to greater energy expenditure (EE). Most animal studies have also demonstrated that the greater EE with MCFA relative to long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) results in less body weight gain and decreased size of fat depots after several months of consumption. Furthermore, both animal and human trials suggest a greater satiating effect of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) compared with long-chain triglycerides (LCT). The aim of this review is to evaluate existing data describing the effects of MCT on EE and satiety and determine their potential efficacy as agents in the treatment of human obesity. Animal studies are summarized and human trials more systematically evaluated because the primary focus of this article is to examine the effects of MCT on human energy metabolism and satiety.

The synthesis of the malonyl-coenzyme A that is required for acyl-chain elongation requires the import of metabolites from the cytosol and their subsequent metabolism. Early studies had implicated acetate as the carbon source for plastidial fatty acid synthesis but more recent experiments have provided data that argue against this. A range of cytosolic metabolites including glucose 6-phosphate, malate, phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate support high rates of fatty acid synthesis by isolated plastids, the relative utilisation of which depends upon the plant species and the organ from which the plastids are isolated. The import of these metabolites occurs via specific transporters on the plastid envelope and recent advances in the understanding of the role of these transporters are discussed. Chloroplasts are able to generate the reducing power and ATP required for fatty acid synthesis by capture of light energy in the reactions of photosynthetic electron transport. Regulation of chloroplast fatty acid synthesis is mediated by the response of acetyl-CoA carboxylase to the redox state of the plastid, which ensures that the carbon metabolism is linked to the energy status. The regulation of fatty acid synthesis in plastids of heterotrophic cells is much less well understood and is of particular interest in the tissues that accumulate large amounts of the storage oil, triacylglycerol. In these heterotrophic cells the plastids import ATP and oxidise imported carbon sources to produce the required reducing power. The sequencing of the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana has now enabled a number of aspects of plant fatty acid synthesis to be re-addressed, particularly those areas in which in vitro biochemical analysis had provided equivocal answers. Examples of such aspects and future opportunities for our understanding of plant fatty acid synthesis are presented and discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Angelo (PE), Italy","Virgin olive oil quality depends on different factors such as olive cultivar, olive tree cultivation and the operations of olive picking, storage and processing. Many investigations concerning these factors were carried out and, in particular, the influence of technological operations of olive processing on oil yields and quality was examined. Leaf-removal and olive washing are important operations for the mechanical safety of the olive extracting equipment which operates at high speed and for the organoleptic quality of olive oil. The leaves mixed with olives may increase, in fact, the organoleptic attributes of 'fresh-cut' grass or 'green', especially if metallic crushers are used to prepare olive paste. Olive crushing has an important influence on organoleptic and nutritional qualities of virgin olive oil. When mill stones are used, the obtained oils have a lower intensity of bitterness and pungency because this crushing method helps to produce oil with a lower content of phenolic substances. When metallic crushers are used oils have, due to the violent action, a higher content of phenolic compounds and are more bitter and pungent. Olive paste malaxation influences the oil yields and also the antioxidant content of oil. With prolonged malaxation oil yields, generally, increase while the phenol content of oils decreases. When 'difficult' olive pastes are processed, it is possible to increase oil yields by using technological co-adjuvants such as talc and enzymatic products during the malaxation. The separation of oil from solid and liquid phases of olive paste is performed by using either pressure, percolation or centrifugation systems. All systems may provide good-quality oil if olive fruits are sound and at the correct ripeness, but the centrifugation system helps to avoid or reduce the risk of an organoleptic contamination. The new centrifugal decanters, operating without adding water (or only a minimal amount of water) to olive paste, save heat energy and the oils obtained are more fruity and have a higher content of natural phenolic antioxidants.","Olive processing; Virgin olive oil; Virgin olive oil quality","antioxidant; olive oil; phenol derivative; talc; water; cultivar; energy; extraction; food processing; food quality; heat; nutritional value; olive; plant leaf; review; tree; Oleaceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036428272

For the power-conversion circuit, which is necessary to compensate the voltage variations of the supercapacitors during charge and discharge, a high-efficiency converter topology is proposed, which allows the bidirectionnal energy flow under soft-commutation conditions. Additionally it offers a good flexibility for the optimal sizing of the supercapacitor voltage level.

The point of departure is a general internal variable formulation that determines the inelastic response of the constituents of a typical micro-structure as a generalized standard medium in terms of an energy storage and a dissipation function. Consistent with this type of inelasticity we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the local constitutive response where a quasi-hyperelastic micro-stress potential is obtained from a local minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this local minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for finite increments of time. We specify the local variational formulation for a setting of smooth single-surface inelasticity and discuss its numerical solution based on a time discretization of the internal variables. The existence of the quasi-hyperelastic stress potential allows the extension of homogenization approaches of elasticity to the incremental setting of inelasticity. Focusing on macro-strain-driven micro-structures, we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the global homogenization problem where a quasi-hyperelastic macro-stress potential is obtained from a global minimization problem with respect to the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. It is shown that this global minimization problem determines the state of the micro-structure for finite increments of time. We consider three different settings of the global variational problem for prescribed linear displacements, periodic fluctuations and constant stresses on the boundary of the micro-structure and discuss their numerical solutions based on a spatial discretization of the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. The performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated for the model problem of von Mises-type elasto-visco-plasticity of the constituents and applied to a comparative study of micro-to-macro transitions of inelastic composites. © 2002 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Elastic-plastic composites; Micro-structures; Two-scale homogenization analysis; Variational formulation of homogenization; Variational formulation of inelasticity","Computational methods; Elasticity; Microstructure; Numerical analysis; Strain; Viscoplasticity; Time dicretizations; Composite materials; composite; microstructure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037146840

The aim of the present studies was to investigate the effects of changing type and amount of dietary fats on energy balance, fat deposition, leptin, and leptin-related neural peptides: leptin receptor, neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), and proopiomelanocortin (POMC), in C57B1/6J mice. One week of feeding with a highly saturated fat diet resulted in ∼50 and 20% reduction in hypothalamic arcuate NPY and AgRP mRNA levels, respectively, compared with a low-fat or an n-3 or n-6 polyunsaturated high-fat (PUFA) diet without change in energy intake, fat mass, plasma leptin levels, and leptin receptor or POMC mRNA. Similar neuropeptide results were seen at 7 wk, but by then epididymal fat mass and plasma leptin levels were significantly elevated in the saturated fat group compared with low-fat controls. In contrast, fat and leptin levels were reduced in the n-3 PUFA group compared with all other groups. At 7 wk, changing the saturated fat group to n-3 PUFA for 4 wk completely reversed the hyperleptinemia and increased adiposity and neuropeptide changes induced by saturated fat. Changing to a low-fat diet was much less effective. In summary, a highly saturated fat diet induces obesity without hyperphagia. A regulatory reduction in NPY and AgRP mRNA levels is unable to effectively counteract this obesogenic drive. Equally high fat diets emphasizing PUFAs may even protect against obesity.","Hypothalamus; Leptin; n-3 polyunsaturated fat; n-6 polyunsaturated fat; Saturated fat","agouti related protein; leptin; leptin receptor; messenger RNA; neuropeptide; neuropeptide Y; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; peptide; proopiomelanocortin; saturated fatty acid; animal experiment; animal tissue; arcuate nucleus; article; body fat; controlled study; energy balance; epididymis fat; fat intake; hyperphagia; hypothalamus; lipid diet; lipid storage; low fat diet; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein expression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036088134

The influence of the molecular weight of PEG on its melting point and enthalpy of fusion is evaluated; from the DSC data the degree of crystallinity is calculated-it is found that there is an increased tendency of higher-molecular-weight PEGs towards the formation of crystalline phase owing to their lower segmental mobility and more convenient geometrical alignment. During the freezing cycle, an increase in the molecular weight of PEG causes an increase in the solidification temperature and heat of crystallization. Thermal transition data are supplemented by optical microscopy-numerous small sphere-shaped crystalline structures are observed to join together and impinge on their neighbours, forming eventually a multilayered lamellar texture. By implementing second polymeric component the polydispersity of the system increases, thus lowering the crystallization degree during preparation phase. It influences also the course of solidification by lowering the crystallization temperature, Tc. An additional effect observed in the case of the blend's freezing is associated with larger supercooling, probably due to morphological constraints and entanglements in interlamellar regions. The possible advantage of using PEG blends to replace pure components is connected with the possibility of changing the temperature range and heat associated with melting/freezing.

Transport of siderophores is an energy-dependent process and is stereoselective, depending on recognition of the metal ion coordination geometry. In addition to transporting iron, siderophores have other functions and effects, including enhancing pathogenicity, acting as intracellular iron storage compounds and suppressing growth of other microorganisms. Siderophores can complex other metals apart from iron, in particular the actinides.

However, the reduction of WO3 requires cation intercalation for charge neutralization. Thus, behavior of the TiO2-WO3 composite on an ITO electrode was examined in nonelectrolytic media. When the TiO2 and WO3 were close to each other (less than 1 mm), WO3 could be reduced even in pure water or humid air (relative humidity ≥ 25%), by irradiating the composite with UV light. In dry air, WO3 was not reduced efficiently, even if the TiO2 and WO3 nanoparticles were mixed well.

The mechanism of desiccation tolerance relies on phospholipid bilayers which are stabilized during water stress by sugars, especially by trehalose. Unsaturation of fatty acids also counteracts water or salt stress. Hydrogen atoms adjacent to olefinic bonds are susceptible to oxidative attack. Lipids are rich in these bonds and are a primary target for oxidative reactions. Lipid oxidation is problematic as enzymes do not control many oxidative chemical reactions and some of the products of the attack are highly reactive species that modify proteins and DNA.

Heat and cold stores can basically be divided in two groups. In sensible heat stores the temperature of the storage material is increased significantly. Latent heat stores, on the contrary, use a storage material that undergoes a phase change (PCM) and a small temperature rise is sufficient to store heat or cold. The major advantages of the phase change stores are their large heat storage capacity and their isothermal behavior during the charging and discharging process. However, while unloading a latent heat storage, the solid-liquid interface moves away from the heat transfer surface and the heat flux decreases due to the increasing thermal resistance of the growing layer of the molten/solidified medium. This effect can be reduced using techniques to increase heat transfer. In this paper, three methods to enhance the heat transfer in a cold storage working with water/ice as PCM are compared: addition of stainless steel pieces, copper pieces (both have been proposed before) and a new PCM-graphite composite material. The PCM-graphite composite material showed an increase in heat flux bigger than with any of the other techniques. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We approached this by analyzing two forest soil profiles, a Haplic Podzol and a Dystric Cambisol, for the depth distribution of OC, its distribution among density and particle-size fractions, and the extractability of OC after destruction of the mineral phase by treatment with hydrofluoric acid (HF). The results were related to indicators of the soil mineralogy and the specific surface area. Finally, scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) was used to visualize the location of OC at mineral surfaces and associations with elements of mineral phases. The subsoils (B and C horizons) contained 40-50% of the soil OC including the organic forest floor layers. With increasing depth of soil profiles (1) the radiocarbon ages increased, and (2) increasing portions of OC were either HF-soluble, or located in the density fraction d &gt; 1.6 g cm -3, or in the clay fraction. The proportions of OC in the density fraction d &gt; 1.6 g cm-3 were closely correlated to the contents of oxalate and dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate-extractable Fe (r2 = 0.93 and 0.88, P &lt;0.001). SEM-EDX analyses suggested associations of OC with aluminum whereas silicon-enriched regions were poor in OC. The specific surface area and the microporosity of the soil mineral matrix after destruction of organic matter were less closely correlated to OC than the extractable iron fractions. This is possibly due to variable surface loadings, depending on different OC inputs with depth. Our results imply that subsoils are important for the storage of OC in terrestrial ecosystems because of intimate association of organic matter with secondary hydrous aluminum and iron phases leading to stabilization against biological degradation.","Density separates; Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy; Microporosity; Mineralogy; Radiocarbon; Scanning electron microscopy; Soil organic matter; Surface area",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012392430

The point of departure is a general internal variable formulation that determines the inelastic response of the constituents of a typical micro-structure as a generalized standard medium in terms of an energy storage and a dissipation function. Consistent with this type of finite inelasticity we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the local constitutive response, where a quasi-hyperelastic micro-stress potential is obtained from a local minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this local minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for finite increments of time. We specify the local variational formulation for a distinct setting of multi-surface inelasticity and develop a numerical solution technique based on a time discretization of the internal variables. The existence of the quasi-hyperelastic stress potential allows the extension of homogenization approaches of finite elasticity to the incremental setting of finite inelasticity. Focussing on macro-deformation-driven micro-structures, we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the global homogenization problem for generalized standard materials at finite strains, where a quasi-hyperelastic macro-stress potential is obtained from a global minimization problem with respect to the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. It is shown that this global minimization problem determines the state of the micro-structure for finite increments of time. We consider three different settings of the global variational problem for prescribed displacements, non-trivial periodic displacements and prescribed stresses on the boundary of the micro-structure and develop numerical solution methods based on a spatial discretization of the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. Representative applications of the proposed minimization principles are demonstrated for a constitutive model of crystal plasticity and the homogenization problem of texture analysis in polycrystalline aggregates. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

For a wide range of power and energy capacity, membrane fuel cells are an attractive alternative to conventional batteries. The main advantages are, the flexibility with respect to power and capacity achievable with different devices for energy conversion and energy storage, the long lifetime and long service life, the good ecological balance, very low self-discharge. Therefore, the development of fuel cell systems for portable electronic devices is an attractive, although also a challenging, goal. The fuel for a membrane fuel cell might be hydrogen from a hydride storage system or methanol/water as a liquid alternative. The main differences between the two systems are, the much higher power density for hydrogen fuel cells, the higher energy density per weight for the liquid fuel, safety aspects and infrastructure for fuel supply for hydride materials. For different applications, different system designs are required. High power cells are required for portable computers, low power methanol fuel cells required for mobile phones in hybrid systems with batteries and micro-fuel cells are required, e.g. for hand held PCs in the sub-Watt range.

The protein status appears to be a major determinant of honeybee lifespan, and the lipoprotein vitellogenin seems to play a crucial role. Here, we give a review of the role of the vitellogenin in honeybee workers, and present a data-driven mathematical model describing the dynamics of this representative protein in the individual bee as a function of its task profile under various regimes. The results support the hypothesis that vitellogenin is a true storage protein that is utilized for various metabolic purposes including the synthesis of brood food. Except for workers having been foragers for many days, they also suggest that the previous life histories of workers do not constrain them from becoming winter bees as long as they get ample food and time to build up their protein reserves before wintering. The results also indicate that it may not be necessary to introduce the ovary as a storage organ for vitellogenin in order to generate normal winter bees. The insights gained from these results are then discussed in a broader gerontological and life history context. Remarkably similar features concerning regulation of ageing in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and honeybees are pointed out and discussed. Furthermore, we show that in contrast to the ""mutation accumulation"" and the ""antagonistic pleiotropy"" evolutionary theories of ageing, the ""disposable soma"" theory is capable of explaining the bimodal longevity distribution of honeybees when interpreted in a group selection context. Finally, by showing that depletion of nutrient stores can be actively controlled by pathways connected to regulation of ageing, we strengthen the claim that age-based division of labour, with performance of risky tasks delayed until late in life by workers with depleted nutrient stores, may have evolved as an energy-saving mechanism in insect colonies. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Among the environmental influences, the percentage of fat energy of the everyday diet and the lack of physical activity are two important factors, which contribute to explain the rising prevalence of obesity. In this review, several lines of evidence are presented to illustrate why dietary fat does affect obesity development. There are four factors which support a link between dietary fat and obesity development:The thermic effect of nutrients, expressed as percentage of their energy content, is 2–3% for lipids, 6–8% for carbohydrates and 25–30% for proteins. This means that the efficiency of nutrient utilization (calculated as 100%—the thermic effect of the nutrient) is higher for fat than for carbohydrate or protein.Postingestive fuel selection favours the oxidation of dietary proteins and carbohydrates, whereas dietary fats are preferentially stored as triacylglycerol in adipose tissue. Alcohol, by inhibiting lipid oxidation, indirectly favours the storage of dietary fats.High-fat diet promotes excessive energy intake by passive overconsumption; the fat-induced appetite control signals are too weak or too delayed to prevent excessive energy intake from a fatty meal.The only proof that dietary fats contribute to weight gain is to test the long-term effect of ad libitum low-fat diets. Most studies on low-fat diets show that they induce a modest weight loss in obese individuals, but their long-term effect from a public health perspective is limited, probably due to a low compliance to the dietary advice. © 2001 Nature Publishing Group.","Body weight regulation; Leptin; Low-fat diets; Nutrient partitioning; Nutrient-induced satiety; Nutrient-induced thermogenesis","carbohydrate; fat; protein; appetite; behavior; body weight; carbohydrate metabolism; conference paper; DNA modification; energy consumption; environmental factor; fat intake; lipid metabolism; low fat diet; obesity; physical activity; prevalence; priority journal; protein metabolism; satiety; thermogenesis; Behavior; Body Weight; Diet; Dietary Fats; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Environment; Exercise; Humans; Life Style; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036736111

Before energy restriction, obese subjects had an increased contribution of hepatic lipogenesis to the circulating triglyceride pool (14.5 ± 1.3 vs. 7.5 ± 1.9%, P < 0.01) without enhancement of cholesterol synthesis. This increased hepatic lipogenesis represented an excess of 2-5 g/day of triglycerides, which would represent 0.7-1.8 kg on a yearly basis. The lipogenic capacity of adipose tissue appeared, on the contrary, decreased with lower FAS mRNA levels (P < 0.01) and a trend for decreased SREBP-1c mRNA (P = 0.06).

Photoacoustic spectroscopy and kinetic spectrophotometry were used to analyze cyclic PS I activity in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Petit Havana) leaf discs illuminated with far-red light. Only a very weak activity was measured in air with both techniques. When leaf discs were placed in anaerobiosis, a high and rapid cyclic PS I activity was measured. The maximal energy storage in far-red light increased to 30% to 50%, and the half-time of the P700 re-reduction in the dark decreased to around 400 ms; these values are comparable with those measured in cyanobacteria and C4 plant leaves in aerobiosis. The stimulatory effect of anaerobiosis was mimicked by infiltrating leaves with inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration or of the chlororespiratory oxidase, therefore, showing that changes in the redox state of intersystem electron carriers tightly control the rate of PS I-driven cyclic electron flow in vivo. Measurements of energy storage at different modulation frequencies of far-red light showed that anaerobiosis-induced cyclic PS I activity in leaves of a tobacco mutant deficient in the plastid Ndh complex was kinetically different from that of the wild type, the cycle being slower in the former leaves.

Until recently, only few plant species, mainly desiccation tolerant 'resurrection' plants, were considered to synthesise trehalose. Instead of trehalose, most other plants species accumulate sucrose as major transport sugar and during stress. The ability to synthesize sucrose has probably evolved from the cyanobacterial ancestors of plastids and may be linked to photosynthetic function. Although most plant species do not appear to accumulate easily detectable amounts of trehalose, the discovery of genes for trehalose biosynthesis in Arabidopsis and in a range of crop plants suggests that the ability to synthesise trehalose is widely distributed in the plant kingdom. The apparent lack of trehalose accumulation in these plants is probably due to the presence of trehalase activity. After inhibition of trehalase, trehalose synthesis can be detected in Arabidopsis. Since trehalose induces metabolic changes, such as an accumulation of storage carbohydrates, rapid degradation of trehalose may be required to prevent detrimental effects of trehalose on the regulation of plant metabolism. In addition, the precursor of trehalose, trehalose-6-phosphate, is probably involved in the regulation of developmental and metabolic processes in plants. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The answer to the question whether a hybrid photovoltaic-wind or a single photovoltaic or wind system is techno-economically better is also sought. Monthly analysis of 8 year long measured hourly weather data shows that solar and wind resources vary greatly from one month to the next. The monthly combinations of these resources lead to basically three types of months: solar-biased month, wind-biased month and even month. This, in turn, leads to energy systems in which the energy contributions from photovoltaic and wind generators vary greatly. The monthly and yearly system performances simulations for different types of months show that the system performances vary greatly for varying battery storage capacities and different fractions of photovoltaic and wind energy. As well as the system performance, the optimisation process of such hybrid systems should further consist of the system cost. Therefore, the system performance results are combined with system cost data. The total system cost and the unit cost of the produced electricity (for a 20 year system lifetime) are analysed with strict reference to the yearly system performance. It is shown that an optimum combination of the hybrid photovoltaic-wind energy system provides higher system performance than either of the single systems for the same system cost for every battery storage capacity analysed in the present study. It is also shown that the magnitude of the battery storage capacity has important bearings on the system performance of single photovoltaic and wind systems. The single photovoltaic system performs better than a single wind system for 2 day storage capacity, while the single wind system performs better for 1.25 day storage capacity for the same system cost. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, there is a critical diameter above which further improvement is not expected due to thermal resistance between the fibers and the tube surface.

In the experiments, three sets of copper-based catalysts with various compositions were tested: Cu/Zn/Al2O3, Cu/Cr/Al2O3 and Cu/Zr/Al2O3. The catalysts were characterized using temperature programmed reduction (TPR), temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), SEM-EDS, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The copper surface area was determined by pulse chemisorption using N2O. We found a correlation between the copper surface area and catalytic activity. The activity tests were performed in a fixed bed reactor with 15g of spherical catalyst pellets using a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 25,000. The results of the activity tests indicate that the choice of promoter and the catalyst composition greatly influence the activity as well as the selectivity for CO2 formation. The highest conversions were achieved for the zinc-containing catalysts (Cu/Zn/Al2O3) for both steam reforming and the combined reforming process. Complete conversion of methanol was only obtained for the zinc-containing catalysts when running the steam reforming process. The combined reforming process generally yielded a product stream containing lower carbon monoxide concentrations compared to steam reforming at the equivalent reactor temperature for all of the catalysts tested. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Three trials were carried out at three different biomass temperatures, obtained by airflow rate control (A=70 °C, B=60 °C and C=45 °C).Biodegradation and biodrying were inversely correlated: fast biodrying produced low biological stability and vice versa. The product obtained from process A was characterized by the highest degradation coefficient (166 g kg TS0-1; TS0-1=initial total solid content) and lowest water loss (409 g kg W0-1; W0=initial water content). Due to the high reduction of easily degradable volatile solid content and preservation of water, process A produced the highest biological stability (dynamic respiration index, DRI=141 mg O2 kg VS-1; VS=volatile solids) but the lowest energy content (EC=10,351 kJ kg w.w.-1). Conversely, process C which showed the highest water elimination (667 g kg W0-1), and lowest degradation rate (18 g kgTS0-1) was optimal for refuse-derived fuel (RDF) production having the highest energy content (EC=14,056 kJ kg w.w.-1). Nevertheless, the low biological stability reached, due to preservation of degradable volatile solids, at the end of the process (DRI=1055 mg O2kgVS-1), indicated that the RDF should be used immediately, without storage. Trial B showed substantial agreement between low moisture content (losses of 665 g kg W0-1), high energy content (EC=13,558 kJ kg w.w.-1) and good biological stability (DRI=166 mg O2kgVS-1), so that, in this case, the product could be used immediately for RDF or stored with minimum pollutant impact (odors, leaches and biogas production).

This newly discovered secretory function has shifted our view of WAT, which is no longer considered only an energy storage tissue but a major endocrine organ, at the heart of a complex network influencing energy homeostasis, glucose and lipid metabolism, vascular homeostasis, immune response and even reproduction. Virtually all known adipose secreted proteins are dysregulated when the WAT mass is markedly altered, either increased in the obese state or decreased in lipoatrophy. This strongly implicates adipose-secreted products in the ethiopathology and/or complications of both obesity and cachexia. This review discusses the physiological relevance of adipose secretion by focusing on protein and steroid hormones. Regulation of WAT secretion by the major regulatory factors impinging on the adipocytes, i.e. insulin, glucocorticoids, catecholamines and thiazolidinediones (TZD) will be addressed.

This study quantified carbon (C) emissions from energy consumption and C storage and uptake by greenspace for three cities in middle Korea: Chuncheon, Kangleung, and Seoul. Carbon emissions were estimated using C emission coefficients for fossil fuels consumed. Carbon storage and uptake by woody plants were computed applying biomass equations and radial growth rates. The soils in Chuncheon were cored to analyze organic C storage. Annual C emissions were 37.0 t/ha/yr in Kangleung, 47.2 t/ha/yr in Chuncheon, and 264.9 t/ha/yr in Seoul. Mean C storage by woody plants ranged from 26.0 to 60.1 t/ha for natural lands within the study cities, and from 4.7 to 7.2 t/ha for urban lands (all land use types except natural and agricultural lands). Mean annual C uptake by woody plants ranged from 1.60 to 3.91 t/ha/yr for natural lands within the cities, and from 0.53 to 0.80 t/ha/yr for urban lands. There were no significant differences (95% confidence level) between the cities in C storage and uptake per ha for urban lands. Organic C storage in Chuncheon soils (to a depth of 60 cm) averaged 31.6 t/ha for natural lands and 24.8 t/ha for urban lands. Woody plants stored an amount of C equivalent to 6.0-59.1% of total C emissions within the cities, and annually offset total C emissions by 0.5-2.2%. Carbon storage in soils was 1.2 times greater than that by woody plants in Chuncheon. The C reduction benefits of woody plants were greater in Chuncheon and Kangleung, where areal distribution of natural lands was larger and the population density lower than in Seoul.

Today, color TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) LCDs are common even is cost-effective equipments. An LCD display system is composed of an LCD panel, a frame buffer memory, an LCD and frame buffer controller, and a backlight inverter and lamp. All of them are heavy power consumers, and their portion becomes much more dominant when running interactive applications. This is because interactive applications are often triggered by human inputs and thus result in a lot of slack time in the CPU and memory system, which can be effectively used for dynamic power management. In this paper, we introduce low-power LCD display schemes as a system-level approach. We accurately characterize the energy consumption at the component level and minimize energy consumption of each component without appreciable display quality degradation. We develop several techniques such as variable-duty-ratio refresh, dynamic-color-depth control and backlight luminance dimming with brightness compensation or contrast enhancement. Each method exhibits power reduction of 260mW, 250mW and 480mW, respectively. The aggregate energy reduction ratio is 28% out of total energy consumption including the CPU and the main memory system when we execute a document viewer. We also demonstrate that we can extend the battery life about 38% and 20% for a text editor and an MPEG4 player, respectively.","Embedded systems; LCD; Low energy; Low power","Buffer storage; Electric lamps; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Service life; Thin film transistors; Color thin film transistor liquid crystal display; Hand-held embedded systems; Low energy; Low power; Liquid crystal displays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036964084

Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is the most general method for detailed modeling of scatter, but to date, fully three-dimensional (3-D) MCS-based statistical SPECT reconstruction approaches have not been realized, due to prohibitively long computation times and excessive computer memory requirements. MCS-based reconstruction has previously been restricted to two-dimensional approaches that are vastly inferior to fully 3-D reconstruction. Instead of MCS, scatter calculations based on simplified but less accurate models are sometimes incorporated in fully 3-D SPECT reconstruction algorithms. We developed a computationally efficient fully 3-D MCS-based reconstruction architecture by combining the following methods: 1) a dual matrix ordered subset (DM-OS) reconstruction algorithm to accelerate the reconstruction and avoid massive transition matrix precalculation and storage; 2) a stochastic photon transport calculation in MCS is combined with an analytic detector modeling step to reduce noise in the Monte Carlo (MC)-based reprojection after only a small number of photon histories have been tracked; and 3) the number of photon histories simulated is reduced by an order of magnitude in early iterations, or photon histories calculated in an early iteration are reused. For a 64 × 64 × 64 image array, the reconstruction time required for ten DM-OS iterations is approximately 30 min on a dual processor (AMD 1.4 GHz) PC, in which case the stochastic nature of MCS modeling is found to have a negligible effect on noise in reconstructions. Since MCS can calculate photon transport for any clinically used photon energy and patient attenuation distribution, the proposed methodology is expected to he useful for obtaining highly accurate quantitative SPECT images within clinically acceptable computation times.","Dual matrix reconstruction; Image reconstruction; Monte carlo methods; Scattering; Single photon emission computed tomography","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Image reconstruction; Light scattering; Medical imaging; Photons; Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); Computerized tomography; algorithm; article; comparative study; computer simulation; evaluation; image enhancement; methodology; Monte Carlo method; quality control; radiation scattering; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; single photon emission computer tomography; statistics; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Image Enhancement; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Monte Carlo Method; Quality Control; Reproducibility of Results; Scattering, Radiation; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stochastic Processes; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036668832

The authors examined the contribution made by the creatine transporter (CRT) at the blood-brain barrier in supplying creatine to the brain from blood. An in vivo intravenous administration study suggested that creatine is continuously transported from the blood to the brain against the creatine concentration gradient that exists between brain and blood. Conditionally immortalized mouse brain capillary endothelial cells (TM-BBB) exhibited creatine uptake, which is Na+ and Cl- dependent and inhibited by CRT inhibitors, such as β-guanidinopropionate and guanidinoacetate. Northern blot and immunoblot analyses demonstrated that CRT is expressed in TM-BBB cells and isolated mouse brain microvessels. Moreover, high expression of CRT was observed in the mouse brain capillaries by confocal immunofluorescent microscopy. These results suggest that CRT plays an important role in supplying creatine to the brain via the blood-brain barrier.","Blood-brain barrier; Brain capillary endothelial cell; Carrier-mediated transport; Creatine; Creatine transporter; Phosphate-bound energy sources","carrier protein; chloride ion; creatine; creatine transporter; guanidinoacetic acid; guanidinopropionic acid; sodium ion; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal tissue; article; blood brain barrier; brain capillary; capillary endothelium; cell immortalization; confocal microscopy; controlled study; immunoblotting; immunofluorescence microscopy; male; mouse; nonhuman; Northern blotting; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein expression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036843535

The proposed converter is realized using an isolated multicell topology where the total ac output of the system is formed by series connection of several full-bridge converter stages. The dc links of the full bridges are supplied by individual dc-dc isolation stages which are arranged in parallel concerning the dc input of the total system. Therefore, all switching cells of the proposed converter can be equipped with modern low-voltage high-current power MOSFETs, which results in an improved efficiency as compared to conventional isolated dc-ac converters. Furthermore, the cells are operated in an interleaved pulsewidth-modulation mode which, in connection with the low voltage level of each cell, significantly reduces the filtering effort on the ac output of the overall system.

Indeed, it is quite hard to make one that will not. However, the conversion of the slow, random, reversing energy flows with very high extreme values into phase-locked synchronous electricity with power quality acceptable to a utility network is very much harder. This paper describes a range of different control strategies of varying degrees of sophistication and then describes possible conversion equipment for high-pressure oil and water and low-pressure air. Like many renewable energy sources, waves would benefit from some form of energy storage, particularly if they are to be used in weak island networks. Flywheels, gas accumulators, submerged oil/vacuum accumulators, thermal stores and reversible fuel cells are discussed, with emphasis on the coupling hardware. This leads on to a description of a new type of hydraulic machine with digital control which has been specially designed for high efficiency and flexible control of multiple erratic sources. An explanation of the rather low performance of air turbines in the random air flows caused by sea waves suggests the need for a variable-pitch version of the Wells turbine and the design of a reciprocating-flow wind-tunnel with recirculating energy recovery in which it could be tested. © 2002, Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

Several studies have shown that obese patients have higher plasma concentrations of all pro-thrombotic factors (fibrinogen, vonWillebrand factor (vWF), and factor VII), as compared to non-obese controls, with a positive association with central fat. Similarly, plasma concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) have been shown to be higher in obese patients as compared to non-obese controls and to be directly correlated with visceral fat. Furthermore, obesity is characterized by higher plasma concentrations of anti-thrombotic factors, such as tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and protein C, as compared to non-obese controls, the increase in these factors being likely to represent a protective response partly counteracting the increase in pro-thrombotic factors. The issue of whether adipose tissue contributes directly to plasma PAI-1, its products stimulating other cells to produce PAI-1, or whether it primarily contributes indirectly has not yet been resolved. It has been proposed that the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by adipose tissue, combined with the actions of adipose tissue-expressed TNF-α in obesity, could underlie the association of insulin resistance with endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy, and coronary heart disease. The role of leptin in impairing haemostasis and promoting thrombosis has been recently reported. Finally, some hormonal abnormalities (androgen, F, catecholamines) associated with the accumulation of body fat may contribute to the impairment of coagulative pathway in obesity. As to intervention strategies, dietary (i.e., low-fat high-fiber diet) and lifestyle (i.e., physical activity) measures have been demonstrated to be effective in improving the obesity-associated pro-thrombotic risk profile. © 2002, Editrice Kurtis.","Abnormalities; Coagulation; Fibrinolysis; Obesity; Thrombosis","androgen; angiotensin; blood clotting factor 7; catecholamine; cytokine; dexamethasone; estrogen; fibrinogen; glucocorticoid; hydrocortisone; insulin; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; leptin; metformin; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; protein C; tissue plasminogen activator; transforming growth factor beta; troglitazone; tumor necrosis factor alpha; urokinase; von Willebrand factor; leptin; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; adipose tissue; artery thrombosis; blood clotting; blood clotting disorder; body fat; cell stimulation; comparative study; cytokine release; diabetes mellitus; diet restriction; disease association; drug effect; dyslipidemia; endocrine disease; endothelium injury; energy; fibrinogen defect; fibrinolysis; genetic polymorphism; hemostasis; high fiber diet; hormone release; human; hypertension; insulin resistance; ischemic heart disease; lifestyle; lipid storage; low fat diet; obesity; physical activity; protein blood level; review; risk factor; training; vein thrombosis; blood; endocrine gland; fibrinolysis; genetics; metabolism; obesity; physiology; thrombosis; Adipose Tissue; Blood Coagulation Disorders; Endocrine Glands; Fibrinolysis; Hemostasis; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Leptin; Obesity; Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1; Polymorphism, Genetic; Thrombosis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036862025

The performance and heat transfer characteristics of a simple tube-in-tube heat exchanger system were studied, and the obtained results were compared with other studies given in the literature. The present study included some parameters, such as transition times, temperature range and propagation of the solid-liquid interface, as well as the heat flow rate characteristics of the employed cylindrical tube storage system. The experimental results show that the melting front moves in the radial direction inward, as well as in the axial direction from the top toward the bottom of the PCM tube. It was observed that the convection heat transfer in the liquid phase plays an important role in the melting process. The flow rate and inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid to the PCM tube in the experimented range has an insignificant effect on the phase change processes. On the other hand, the melting and solidification times of the PCM can be reduced significantly by placing the tube containing the PCM in a horizontal position rather than a vertical one. The heat storage capacity of the PCM tube is not as good as we expected in this study, and the average heat storage efficiency (or heat exchanger effectiveness) is 53.3. It means that 46.7% of the heat actually is lost somewhere. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Experimentally determined heat and mass transfer coefficients were employed in the design and costing of an 11 kW cooling capacity solar driven absorption cooling machine which, from simulations, was found to have sufficient capacity to satisfy the cooling needs of a well insulated domestic dwelling. The system is modelled with the TRNSYS simulation program using appropriate equations predicting the performance of the unit. The final optimum system consists of 15 m2 compound parabolic collector tilted at 30° from horizontal and 600 l hot water storage tank. The total life cycle cost of a complete system, comprising the collector and the absorption unit, for a lifetime of 20 years will be of the order of C£ 13,380.

In all cases, the nanostructured electrode showed dramatically imporved rate capabilities relative to thin-film control electrodes composed of the same material. The rate capabilities are improved because the distance that Li+ must diffuse in the solid state (the current-and power-limiting step in Li-ion battery electrodes) is significantly smaller in the nanostructured electrode. For example, in a nanofiber-based electrode, the distance that Li+ must diffuse is restricted to the radius of the fiber, which may be as small as 50 nm.

The system consists of a flat plate solar air heater connected to a cabinet acting as a drying chamber. The air heater is designed to be able to insert various storage materials under the absorber plate in order to improve the drying process. Sand is used as the storage material. Drying experiments have been conducted with and without storage materials for different spherical fruits, such as seedless grapes, figs and apples, as well as vegetables, such as green peas, tomatoes and onions. The solar irradiance, temperature distribution in different parts of the system, ambient temperature and relative humidity of the inlet and outlet drying air have been recorded. The equilibrium moisture content Me for seedless grapes is reached after 60 and 72 h when the system is used with and without storage material, respectively. Therefore, the storage material reduces the drying process by 12 h. In order to accelerate the drying process, the drying products are divided into pieces and then chemically treated by dipping the samples into boiling water containing 0.4% olive oil and 0.3% NaOH for 60 s. However, the required time to achieve Me for the chemically treated seedless grapes, when the system is used with sa as a storage material, is drastically reduced to 8 h. Moreover, we found that the storage and chemical pretreatment have caused significant decreases of the drying time for all the investigated crops. The present system is capable of drying 10 kg of chemically treated grapes or green peas during 20 h of sunshine. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

During this first stage it could meet the basic requirements of the rapidly growing domestic SAXS user community, which has been carrying out measurements mainly on various polymer systems. The X-ray source is a bending magnet which produces white radiation with a critical energy of 5.5 keV. A synthetic double multilayer monochromator selects quasi-monochromatic radiation with a bandwidth of ca. 1.5%. This relatively low degree of monochromatization is sufficient for most SAXS measurements and allows a considerably higher flux at the sample as compared to monochromators using single crystals. Higher harmonics from the monochromator are rejected by reflection from a flat mirror, and a slit system is installed for collimation. A charge-coupled device (CCD) system, two one-dimensional photodiode arrays (PDA) and imaging plates (IP) are available as detectors. The overall performance of the beamline optics and of the detector systems has been checked using various standard samples. While the CCD and PDA detectors are well-suited for diffraction measurements, they give unsatisfactory data from weakly scattering samples, due to their high intrinsic noise. By using the IP system smooth scattering curves could be obtained in a wide dynamic range. In the second stage, starting from August 2001, the beamline will be upgraded with additional slits, focusing optics and gas-filled proportional detectors.","Beamline; Small-angle X-ray scattering; Synchrotron X-ray","latex; polymer; camera; collimator; diffraction; diode; dispersion; equipment design; intermethod comparison; laboratory; magnetism; radiation beam; radiation scattering; review; standardization; synchrotron; X ray analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002451764

In contrast to these individual transcription factors, the biological roles of CBP are poorly understood. CBP enhances transcriptional activities via histone acetylation and the recruitment of additional co-activators such as SRC (steroid coactivator)-1 (ref. 9). To identify its physiological functions using a loss-of-function mutant, we analyzed CBP-deficient mice10-12. As Crebbp null mice (Crebbp−/−) died during embryogenesis10-12, we used Crebbp+/− mice12. Unexpectedly, Crebbp+/− mice showed markedly reduced weight of white adipose tissue (WAT) but not of other tissues. Despite this lipodystrophy. Crebbp+/− mice showed increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and were completely protected from body weight gain induced by a high-fat (HF) diet. We observed increased leptin sensitivity and increased serum adiponectin levels in Crebbp+/− mice. These increased effects of insulin-sensitizing hormones secreted from WAT may explain, at least in part, the phenotypes of Crebbp+/− mice. This study demonstrates that CBP may function as a 'master-switch' between energy storage and expenditure.",,"cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein binding protein; insulin; STAT protein; transcription factor; adipose tissue; animal model; animal tissue; article; body mass; body weight; fibroblast culture; genetic transcription; glucose tolerance; immunoblotting; insulin sensitivity; lipodystrophy; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Animals; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; Cell Size; CREB-Binding Protein; Dietary Fats; DNA-Binding Proteins; Energy Metabolism; Heterozygote; Insulin Resistance; Lipodystrophy; Mice; Mice, Mutant Strains; Nuclear Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1; Trans-Activators; Transcription Factors; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036478904

For the present study, dispersions of monoolein-rich monoglycerides (MO), with or without purified soya phospholipids (PL), were prepared by equilibration of a MO/(PL)/water cubic phase, subsequent fragmentation with a poloxamer 407 (P407) solution, sonication and homogenization. This yielded systems of very different macroscopic appearance: Almost transparent dispersions, slightly turbid systems, opaque dispersions or milky emulsions. The mean z-average particle diameters ranged from 80 nm to well above 350 nm. Considerable particle growth could be detected in most systems during storage at room temperature. Storage at 5°C resulted in the formation of ointment-like gels, which may be attributed to the crystallization of MO. Freeze-fracture transmission electron micrographs of MO dispersions revealed predominantly spherical particles with a low fracturing tendency. Synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction indicated that high energy input during disintegration of the cubic phase leads to very complex systems in which particles with a cubic structure and MO/(PL) vesicles may coexist. The characteristic reflections of cubic systems were absent in the diffraction patterns of almost transparent or slightly turbid dispersions. The results indicate a strong dependence of ultrastructure of the dispersions on the preparation parameters. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

To accomplish this in the study of marine mammals, we have designed ""intelligent"" data logger/transmitters that provide context-driven data compression, data relay, and automated data base storage.

Both experiments and simulation were performed to evaluate the characteristics of encapsulated PCMs. Tests were conducted in a packed bed to determine the performance of the encapsulated PCM. In the preparation of encapsulated PCMs, the coacervation technique was used. The performance of the encapsulated PCM was evaluated in terms of encapsulation ratio, hydrophilicity, and energy storage capacity. The experiments were designed, based on surface response method, to optimize the processing conditions. It was found that a higher coating to paraffin ratio led to a higher paraffin encapsulation ratio. The hydrophilicity value of encapsulated paraffin depended mainly on the ratio of paraffin to coating. The higher the ratio, the lower was its product hydrophilicity. When the paraffin to coating ratio was constant, the higher concentration of HCHO led to a lower hydrophilicity of the product. The encapsulated paraffin has shown large energy storage and release capacity (20-90 J g-1) during its phase changes depending on different ratios of paraffin to coating. Thermal cyclic test showed that encapsulated paraffin kept its geometrical profile and energy storage capacity even after 1000 cycles of operation. In the experiments and simulation of fluid heating process in encapsulated PCM charged packed bed, results showed that Eulerian granular multiphase model in FLUENT 4.47 is suitable for simulation of such a system.

This study deals with three important subjects: The first one is to determine the eutectic composition ratio of the lauric acid (LA) and stearic acid (SA) binary system, and to measure its thermophysical properties by DSC. The second one is to establish the thermal characteristics of the mixture such as total melting and solidification times, the heat transfer modes in melted and solidified PCM, and the effect of Reynolds and Stefan numbers as inlet heat transfer fluid (HTF) conditions on the phase transition behaviors. The final one includes the calculations of the heat transfer coefficients between the outside wall of the HTF pipe and the PCM, and heat fractions during the melting and solidification processes of the mixture, and also the discussion of the effect of inlet HTF parameters on these characteristics. The LA-SA binary system in the mixture ratio of 75.5:24.5 wt % forms a eutectic, which melts at 37°C and has a latent heat of 182.7 J g-1, and, thus, these properties make it an attractive phase change material used for passive solar space heating applications such as building and greenhouse heating with respect to the climate conditions.

An energy and exergy modelling is presented for TES systems as a key component in the above-mentioned aspects. Illustrative examples are also given to practically demonstrate how exergy analysis provides a more realistic and meaningful assessment than the conventional energy analysis of the efficiency and performance of a sensible heat storage system.

Because silver eels fast when they leave the freshwater system, the transoceanic migration forces them to constitute energy reserves in the form of muscle lipids, that are needed for successful spawning. Using species biological data, toxicological and ecotoxicological information, hypotheses are given to assess the contribution of pollution from freshwater sources to the recorded decline in the American and European eels fisheries since the 1980s. This paper first describes the lipid storage problems and the relative migratory capacities. Then several studies on the accumulation of xenobiotics in various anatomical compartments, on the biological half-lives of these compounds, and on their sublethal toxicity, are reviewed. During migration, lipid mobilization returns persistent lipophilic pollutants back into circulation, these being concentrated particularly in gonads at the crucial time of gametogenesis. Extrapolation of toxicological analysis (individual physiology) to the population level (spawning success) suggests that the quality of future spawners leaving freshwaters is one of the prime factors for the conservation of this threatened species.","American and European eel population; Lipids; Migration; Pollution; Reproduction","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; aroclor 1248; aroclor 1254; chemical compound; chlorphenotane; dieldrin; lindane; lipid; mirex; organochlorine derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; lipid; chemical compound; eel; pollution exposure; population decline; sublethal effect; article; ecotoxicology; eel; freshwater environment; gametogenesis; life cycle; lipid storage; migration; muscle; nonhuman; pollutant; priority journal; spawning; water contamination; animal; growth, development and aging; physiology; reproduction; review; water pollutant; Animal; Eels; Emigration and Immigration; Lipids; Reproduction; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Animals; Emigration and Immigration; Lipids; Reproduction; Anguilla anguilla; Anguilla rostrata; Anguilliformes; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036667582

The non-reversion effect of θ changes caused by plasma in PE and PP suggests that the oxidation processes mainly decide about values in nonpolar polymers. The significantly greater θ changes in PE than those in PP indicate that the side groups present in the main chains impede oxidation of such a polymer by plasma. The reversion of θ changes in PET and in PMMA, and return of these values to almost the initial ones after 10 min storage proves that the main reason for θ changes in polar polymers is a certain alteration of the chain conformation. These changes, taking place after longer plasma treatment, suggest that the side ester groups in PMMA retard the above-mentioned conformational transformations. Then, in both kinds of polymers (polar and nonpolar) the structure of macrochain decides about the efficiency of reaction caused by plasma, and at the same time the side groups retard not only the oxidation processes but the conformational changes as well. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

LaAlO3 undergoes a cubic to rhombohedral phase transition below 550°C. The mechanical response in the low-temperature rhombohedral phase is shown to be dominated by the viscous motion of transformation twin domain walls, resulting in a factor of 10 decrease in the storage modulus relative to the high-temperature cubic phase (super-elastic softening) and a significant increase in attenuation. Super-elastic softening is observed down to 200 °C, below which the mobility of the domain walls decreases markedly, causing a rapid increase in storage modulus and a pronounced peak in attenuation (domain wall freezing). The frequency dependence of the storage modulus close to the freezing temperature is accurately described by a modified Burgers model with a Gaussian distribution of activation energies with mean value 84.1(1) kJ/mol and S.D. 10.3(1)kJ/mol. This activation energy suggests that domain walls are pinned predominantly by oxygen vacancies. Detailed analysis of the dynamic force-deflection curves reveals three distinct regimes of mechanical response. In the elastic regime, the domain walls are pinned and unable to move. The elastic response is linear with a slope determined by the intrinsic stiffness of the lattice, the initial susceptibility of the pinning potential and the bending of twin walls between the pinning sites. In the super-elastic regime, the domain walls unpin and displace by an amount determined by the balance between the applied and restoring forces. The value of the apparent super-elastic modulus is shown to be independent of the spontaneous strain and hence independent of temperature. At high values of the applied force, adjacent domain walls come into contact with each other and prevent further super-elastic deformation (saturation). The strain in the saturation regime scales with the spontaneous strain and the resulting modulus is strongly temperature dependent. The possible effects of domain wall motion on the seismic properties of minerals are discussed. It is concluded that, if these results are directly transferred to mantle-forming (Mg, Fe)(Si, Al)O3 perovskite, the strain amplitude of a typical seismic wave would be sufficient to cause super-elastic softening. However, pinning of domain walls by oxygen vacancies leads to very short relaxation times at mantle temperatures. If translated to (Mg, Fe)(Si, Al)O3 , these would be too short to amount to significant seismic attenuation. Increased pinning of ferroelastic domain walls by defects, impurities and grain boundaries in real mantle perovskite, or a significant positive activation volume for oxygen vacancy diffusion, would be sufficient to increase the relaxation time to values resulting in seismic wave attenuation, however. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The model includes effects due to variations in: (i) stacking fault energy, (ii) grain size, (iii) solid solution content, and (iv) particle size and volume fraction. The result is a work hardening model, which in principle is capable of providing the stress-strain behavior for a given metal or solid solution alloy under condition ranging from deformation in the ambient temperature range to high temperature creep.

Both the depletion of body reserves and the low survival of reproductive females translated into significant costs (decrements of lifetime reproductive success [LRS]). However, the cessation of growth during pregnancy had no detectable effect on LRS. Most females produced only a single litter during their lifetimes. A female's ""costs"" in energy terms were not negatively correlated with her future reproductive output, probably because female vipers vary considerably in the rate at which they can accumulate energy. This notion is supported by the observations that (1) females with higher initial body reserves expended more energy during reproduction, and (2) females that accumulated energy more rapidly after parturition were more likely to survive and to breed again. This kind of variation among females masks any underlying trade-off between current reproductive effort and probable future reproductive success. Despite this complication, a strong link between rates of survival and postreproductive mass recovery suggests that changes in body reserves govern reproductive effort in this species.","Breeding frequency; Capital breeders; Cost of reproduction; Energy storage; Lifetime reproductive success; Relative clutch mass; Reproductive effort; Semelparity; Snakes; Vipera aspis","reproductive cost; reproductive effort; reproductive success; snake; Amphibia; Animalia; Reptilia; Serpentes; Vertebrata; viper; Vipera aspis; Vipera aspis; Viperinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0006190251

This flexible model enables us to capture many complex features of conditional volatility within a relatively parsimonious set-up. We show that regime shifts are clearly present in the data and dominate GARCH effects. Within the high volatility state, a negative basis is more likely to increase regime persistence than a positive basis, a finding which is consistent with previous empirical research on the theory of storage, e.g. Fama and French (1988a,b) and Ng and Pirrong (1994). The volatility regimes identified by our model correlate well with major events affecting supply and demand for oil. Out-of-sample tests indicate that the regime switching model performs noticeably better than non-switching models regardless of evaluation criteria. We conclude that regime switching models provide a useful framework for the financial historian interested in studying factors behind the evolution of volatility and to oil futures traders interested short-term volatility forecasts. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We generalize the normal description of intercalation kinetics, based on diffusion of a lattice gas with mean field interactions, using an intercalation model system composed of different types of intercalation sites: a shallow site that allows diffusion of intercalated ions throughout the film, and deeper sites that trap the inserted charge for long times. The trapping is related to ion binding processes, like Li+ forming a bond to a bridging-type oxygen in a solid, or ion binding in micro-cavities of a polymer matrix. A complete classification of patterns of spectra for ion diffusion and trapping (complex impedance and complex capacitance) is provided, in terms of characteristic frequencies that depend on the steady state. We discuss the possible origin of the variation of the chemical diffusion coefficient with the composition. In a two state system the effective diffusion coefficient increases by several orders of magnitude as the chemical potential μ passes through the lower energy level, filling the trap states. We also show that when the interactions are treated correctly, the variations of diffusivity in a lattice gas are larger than previously expected. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

They consists of many core atoms with many electrons and therefore may have a quasicontinuous spectrum of electronic states in the band gap of silicon. A suitable way to describe this spectrum is by a density of states. It is still one of the great open problems of present-day defect physics to determine the density of states by measurements or by theoretical calculations. The analysis and interpretation of experimental data has turned out to be impeded by two main factors: (1) the many-electron nature of the dislocation and (2) its ubiquitous interactions with point defects. As will become clear in this chapter, most of the electrical and optical properties of dislocations are determined by the point defects at the dislocation or by the interplay of point defect levels and dislocation states. The most important results will be reviewed in this chapter as obtained by Hall effect, photo-conductivity, deep level transient spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, photo-luminescence, and by electron beam induced current technique as well as the basic concepts to deal with the atomic and electronic structure of dislocations in silicon and germanium, with their interaction with point defects and with the statistics relating defect parameters to measurable quantities. In addition a brief glance is thrown on how dislocations affect the performance of silicon electronic devices.

Today, approximately 50% of both the Danish electricity and heat demand are produced in CHP and more than 15% of the electricity demand is produced by wind turbines. Both technologies are essential for the implementation of Danish climate change response objectives, and both technologies are intended for further expansion in the coming decade. Meanwhile, the integration of CHP and wind power is subject to fluctuations in electricity production. Wind turbines depend on the wind, and CHP depends on the heat demand. This article discusses and analyses two different national strategies for solving this problem. One strategy, which is the current official government policy known as the export strategy, proposes to take advantage of the Nordic and European markets for selling and buying electricity. In this case, surplus electricity from wind power and CHP simply will be sold to neighbouring countries. Another strategy, the self-supply strategy, runs the CHP units to meet both demand and the fluctuations in the wind scheduling. In this case, investments in heat storages are necessary and heat pumps have to be added to the CHP units. Based on official Danish energy policy and energy plans, this article quantifies the problem for the year 2015 in terms of the amount of surplus electricity, and investments in heat pumps, etc. needed to solve the problem are calculated. Based on these results between the two different strategies, the conclusion is that the self-supply strategy is recommended over the official export strategy. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Several key factors influence the performance and long-term integrity of injection into deep saline formations. Accurate representations of the physical properties of carbon dioxide have compiled and use to determine the theoretical storage density at typical sub-surface conditions, and the amount of energy that would be expended in injecting the carbon dioxide (whether pure or mixed with other gases), leading to an estimate of the net reduction of emissions. Detailed computer simulations indicate that the distribution of the injected carbon dioxide is initially dominated by gravity segregation, relative permeability effects and the permeability anisotropy of the saline formation. Post-injection, important effects occur which are not taken into account in conventional petroleum reservoir simulation. Convective mixing is predicted to occur, which greatly accelerates the dissolution of carbon dioxide in the saline formation water. This unusual phenomenon arises from the increase in the density of brine when saturated with carbon dioxide. Complete dissolution of the injected carbon dioxide is predicted to occur over hundreds to thousands of years, depending significantly on the vertical permeability of the formation and the geometry of the top seal. Reactions between the carbonated water and the formation also increase the rate of dissolution. If the chosen site is not a structural trap but a gently dipping regionally extensive formation, then the carbon, dioxide can migrate up to tens of kilometres from the injection site, depending on the angle of dip and the horizontal permeability. However, convection and dissolution can still keep the carbon dioxide confined. This theoretical analysis has been developed as part of the Australian Petroleum CRC's GEODISC program, and is being used to assess the suitability of proposed sites for carbon dioxide sequestration.",,"Anisotropy; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Environmental protection; Greenhouse effect; Industrial emissions; Mechanical permeability; Petroleum geology; Saline water; Convective mixing; Geological sequestration; Petroleum reservoir engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642439979

MgH2 can be expressed as Mg1.91+ H0.26-, which is much weaker ionicity than the theoretical expectations. It also shows weak covalence between Mg and H.

A decrease in the intensity of the relaxation and an increase of the storage modulus is observed when cork is previously subjected to an annealing process above 60°C. This result is in agreement with previously reported dielectric data. Thermogravimetric experiments seem to confirm that such effect could be caused by the desorption of water molecules.

The chemical hydride can be used as a new fuel source in a fuel cell system. As a result, we have discovered that the electrochemical reaction rate is higher at a normal temperature compared with cells containing other hydrogen fuels where a hydrogen-releasing agent, NaBH4, is added to an aqueous alkaline solution of electrolyte as hydrogen fuel. That is, the fuel can be supplied very simply for the cell. If air is supplied to the oxygen cathode made of highly dispersed platinum particles supported in high-surface-area carbon paper, and the hydrogen releasing agent is fed to the alkaline solution of electrolyte at the side of metal hydride anode (ZrCr0.8Ni1.2 alloy), the cell can produce electric current continuously. Also it can be operated at a normal temperature and produce a large amount of energy due to its high energy density of 6,000 Ah/kg or more (for NaBH4 or KBH4). Therefore, the developed cell has higher electrochemical reaction rate and energy density than the conventional fuel cells using other hydrogen sources. © 2002 The Electrochemical Society.

At Heron Island, females lay multiple clutches over approximately 3 months. To investigate how females mobilise and store lipid during the breeding season we collected plasma, yolk, and fat tissue samples from females at a variety of stages during the nesting season. In breeding females, concentrations of plasma triglyceride increased seasonally. They reached peak concentrations during vitellogenesis and courtship, remained high throughout the nesting season, and then declined to a nadir after the last clutch. Plasma protein concentration increased throughout the breeding season, peaking following the last clutch for the season. Yolk lipids were highest during courtship and were similar throughout the nesting season, suggesting that uptake of lipid by ovarian follicles is completed prior to the beginning of the nesting season. Plasma triglyceride decreases in females with prolonged periods of unsuccessful nesting, and total lipid levels in adipose tissue and follicle yolks were significantly lower in atretic females. It appears that: “1” endogenous energy reserves can be reduced by stochastic environmental events “such as those reducing nesting success”, and “2” a metabolic shift signalling the end of the nesting season is characterised by a drop in plasma triglycerides and slight increase in total plasma protein.","Atresia; Green sea turtle; Lipid; Reproduction; Vitellogenesis","protein; adipose tissue; animal; article; egg yolk; feeding behavior; female; lipid metabolism; metabolism; nesting; physiology; transport at the cellular level; turtle; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Biological Transport; Egg Yolk; Feeding Behavior; Female; Lipid Metabolism; Nesting Behavior; Proteins; Turtles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036923363

Environmental factors, such as the increased availability of high caloric food or the decreased need for physical activity, contribute to its development and their influence is amplified by genetic predisposition. In recent years remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity. Although most of the insights into the regulation of energy balance have been obtained in rodent models, the rare clinical cases of monogenic obesity provided evidence for the importance of several of these mechanisms in humans. The identification of leptin as a factor originating from adipose tissue and informing the brain about the status of energy reserves firmly established the concept of long-term regulation of body fat stores. The disappointing therapeutic results with leptin in obese patients could be explained by the fact that during evolution this hormone developed rather as a starvation signal than as an adiposity signal. It is conceivable that the pharmacological interference with mechanisms downstream of leptin, for example with the melanocortin pathway, might be therapeutically more promising. The discovery of new molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the differentiation and proliferation of adipocytes and the elucidation of their paracrine and endocrine functions have changed the traditional view of adipose tissue as an inert depot for triglycerides. The identification of new uncoupling proteins could modify the current concepts of the regulation of thermogenesis in humans. The remarkable progress in the identification of novel targets involved in the regualtion of energy balance should have a positive impact on the search for new antiobesity agents. © 2001 Nature Publishing Group.","Adipocytes; Energy balance; Evolution; Genetics; Leptin; Melanocortin; Neuropeptide Y; Pathophysiology; Pharmacotherapy; Uncoupling protein","antiobesity agent; leptin; melanocortin; neuropeptide Y; uncoupling protein; adipocyte; caloric intake; conference paper; endocrine function; energy expenditure; environmental factor; evolution; genetic predisposition; human; lipid storage; nonhuman; obesity; paracrine signaling; pathophysiology; physical activity; priority journal; signal transduction; starvation; thermogenesis; Animals; Brain; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Environment; Evolution; Homeostasis; Humans; Leptin; Neuropeptide Y; Obesity; Rodentia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036736212

The initial discharge capacities of the Mg-Ni-Ti ternary alloys are inferior to the MgNi electrode capacity. However, an exception is observed with MgNi0.95Ti0.05, which has an initial discharge capacity of 575mAh/g compared to 522mAh/g for the MgNi electrode. The Mg-Ni-Ti ternary alloys show improved cycle life compared to Mg-Ni binary alloys with the same Mg/Ni atomic ratio. The best cycle life is observed with Mg0.5Ti0.5Ni electrode which retains 75% of initial capacity after 10 cycles in comparison to 39% for MgNi electrodes, in addition to improved high-rate dischargeability (HRD). According to the XPS analysis, the cycle life improvement of the Mg0.5Ti0.5Ni electrode can be related to the formation of TiO2 which limits Mg(OH)2 formation. The anodic polarization curve of Mg0.5Ti0.5Ni electrode shows that the current related to the active/passive transition is much less important and that the passive region is more extended than for the MgNi electrode but the corrosion of the electrode is still significant. This suggests that the cycle life improvement would be also associated with a decrease of the particle pulverization upon cycling. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The solar collector, which exhibited a net solar aperture area of 1.44 m2, consisted of two adjoining sections one filled with water and the other with a phase change material with a melting and freezing range of about 45-50°C, i.e. paraffin wax in this study. The phase change material functioned both as an energy storage material for the stabilisation, theoretically, of the water temperature and as an insulation material due to its low thermal conductivity value. The results of the study indicated that the water temperature exceeded 55°C during a typical day of high solar radiation and it was kept over 30°C during the whole night. Covering the collector surface with an insulation blanket at a time when the water temperature was at its maximum improved the energy conservation of the water significantly. The instantaneous thermal efficiency values were between about 22% and 80%. The present solar collector was much advantageous over the traditional solar hot water collectors in Turkey in terms of total system weight and the cost in particular. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this study, three important subjects were addressed. The first one is temperature distributions and temporal temperature variations in the radial and axial distances in the phase change material (PCM) during phase change processes. The second one is the thermal characteristics of the lauric acid, which include total melting and total solidification times, the nature of heat transfer in melted and solidified PCM and the effect of Reynolds and Stefan numbers as inlet heat transfer fluid (HTF) conditions on the phase transition parameters. The final one is to calculate the heat transfer coefficient and the heat flow rate and also discuss the role of Reynolds and Stefan numbers on the heat transfer parameters. The experimental results proved that the PCM melts and solidifies congruently, and the melting and solidification front moved from the outer wall of the HTF pipe (HTFP) to the inner wall of the PCM container in radial distances as the melting front moved from the top to the bottom of the PCM container in axial distances. However, it was difficult to establish the solidification proceeding at the axial distances in the PCM. Though natural convection in the liquid phase played a dominant role during the melting process due to buoyancy effects, the solidification process was controlled by conduction heat transfer, and it was slowed by the conduction thermal resistance through the solidified layer. The results also indicated that the average heat transfer coefficient and the heat flow rate were affected by varying the Reynolds and Stefan numbers more during the melting process than during the solidification process due to the natural convection effect during the melting process. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Methods and Results: Lactobacillus plantarum was treated with PEF in model beer (MB) to determine critical values of field strength and energy input for cell inactivation. Below critical values, metabolic activity and membrane integrity were initially reduced without loss of viability. Above critical values, however, irreversible cell damage occurred. Presence of nisin or hop extract, during PEF treatment, resulted in an additional reduction of cell viability by 1.5 log cycles. Also, addition of the hop extract resulted in an additional two log cycles of sublethal injury. Partial reversibility of membrane damage was observed using propidium iodide (PI) uptake and staining. Inoculated MB containing hops was stored after PEF to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment for beer preservation. Conclusion: Cells were inactivated only above critical values of 13 kV cm)1 and 64 kJ kg)1; below these values cell damage was reversible. Storage experiments revealed that surviving cells were killed after 15 h storage in MB containing hops. Significance and Impact of the Study: Both reversible and irreversible cell damage due to PEF treatment was detected, depending on specific treatment conditions.

One of the main current scientific challenges is the bottom-up construction of systems that represent nanosize analogues of switches, devices and motors. Our efforts in this area have focussed on the construction of devices based on sterically overcrowded alkenes. In this paper, we present our ongoing research on the construction of binary molecular switches, which has recently led to genuine molecular motors. The control of chirality in a molecular switching system allows interconversion between molecules of opposite helicity using different wavelengths of light. Such bistable chiral switches are of potential use in optical data storage and processing at the molecular level. The control of molecular chirality is even more subtle in the case of molecular motor systems. The exquisite control of chirality using light as an energy source has resulted in a controlled, repetitive 360° unidirectional rotation in two generations of molecular motor systems.",,"Motors; Nanostructured materials; Optical data storage; Optical switches; Rotation; Molecular switches; Molecular physics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036681132

The development of combinatorial carbohydrate libraries in this important arena has been slow, in contrast to the rapid development of combinatorial synthesis in the area of small-molecule libraries and biopolymers. This is largely as a result of the inherent difficulties presented by this class of polyfunctional compounds. Nevertheless, strategies to cope with these problems have been devised over the past seven years, and combinatorial carbohydrate libraries have appeared. The incorporation of an amino acid moiety into the carbohydrate scaffold generates glycosamino acids, which are attractive building blocks for the preparation of carbohydrate-based libraries because of the well-established automated peptide synthesis. Derivatization as well as homo- and heterooligomerization of glycosamino acids can be used to create novel structures with unique properties. Glycosamino acids are hybrid structures of carbohydrates and amino acids which can be utilized to generate potential glycomimetics and peptidomimetics. The incorporation of glycosamino acids into peptides allows the engineering of carbohydrate-binding sites into synthetic polypeptides, which may also influence the pharmacokinetic and dynamic properties of the peptides. Furthermore, sugar-amino acid hybrids offer a tremendous structural and functional diversity, which is largely unexplored and requires combinatorial strategies for efficient exploitation. This article provides an overview of previous work on glycosamino acids and discusses their use in combinatorial synthesis and drug discovery.","Combinatorial chemistry; Glycoconjugates; Glycomimetics peptidomimetics; Sugar amino acids","Bacteria; Carbohydrates; Cells; Drug products; Energy storage; Pharmacokinetics; Polypeptides; Proteins; Synthesis (chemical); Hybrid structures; Amino acids; amino acid; amino acid derivative; glycoconjugate; glycomimetic derivative; glycopeptide; glycosamino acid derivative; oligosaccharide; peptide; peptidomimetic derivative; polyol; sugar acid; synthetic peptide; unclassified drug; amino acid; peptide; sugar acid; binding site; carbohydrate analysis; chemistry; combinatorial chemistry; derivatization; drug design; hybrid; methodology; molecular mimicry; oligomerization; peptide synthesis; protein structure; review; Amino Acids; Carbohydrate Sequence; Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques; Drug Design; Molecular Mimicry; Oligosaccharides; Peptides; Sugar Acids",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037126832

Similar to energy generation for sustained locomotion in mammals, the work accomplished by non-stop flight activity is powered by oxidation of free fatty acids (FFA) derived from endogenous reserves of triacylglycerol. The transport form of the lipid, however, is diacylglycerot (DAG), which is delivered to the flight muscles associated with lipoproteins. In the insect system, the multifunctional lipoprotein, high-density lipophorin (HDLp) is loaded with DAG while additionally, multiple copies of the exchangeable apolipoprotein, apoLp-III, associate with the expanding particle. As a result, lipid-enriched low-density lipophorin (LDLp) is formed. At the flight muscles, LDLp-carried DAG is hydrolyzed and FFA are imported into the muscle cells for energy generation. The depletion of DAG from LDLp results in the recovery of both HDLp and apoLp-III, which are reutilized for another cycle of DAG transport. A receptor for HDLp, identified as a novel member of the vertebrate low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, does not seem to be involved in the lipophorin shuttle mechanism operative during flight activity. In addition, endocytosis of HDLp mediated by the insect receptor does not seem to follow the classical mammalian LDL pathway. Many structural elements of the lipid mobilization system in insects are similar to those in mammals. Domain structures of apoLp-I and apoLp-II, the non-exchangeable apolipoprotein components of HDLp, are related to apoB100. ApoLp-III is a bundle of five amphipathic α-helices that binds to a lipid surface very similar to the four-helix bundle of the N-terminal domain of human apoE. Despite these similarities, the functioning of the insect lipoprotein in energy transport during flight activity is intriguingly different, since the TAG-rich mammalian lipoproteins play no role as a carrier of mobilized lipids during exercise and besides, these lipoproteins are not functioning as a reusable shuttle for lipid transport. On the other hand, the deviant behavior of similar molecules in a different biological system may provide a useful alternative model for studying the molecular basis of processes related to human disorders and disease.","apoE; Apolipophorin III; Diacylglycerol; Exercise; Insect flight; Insect lipophorin receptor; Lipid transport; Lipophorin; Lipoprotein; Low-density lipoprotein receptor","adenine; amphophile; apolipoprotein E; carrier protein; diacylglycerol; fatty acid; guanine; high density lipoprotein; insect protein; lipid; lipophorin; lipoprotein; lipoprotein receptor; low density lipoprotein; thymine; triacylglycerol; apolipophorin iii; apolipoprotein; carrier protein; FABP7 protein, human; fatty acid binding protein; lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein receptor; tumor protein; tumor suppressor protein; alpha helix; amino terminal sequence; article; controlled study; endocytosis; energy metabolism; energy yield; fatty acid oxidation; flight; flight muscle; lipid membrane; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipid transport; nonhuman; nucleic acid structure; protein analysis; protein family; protein function; protein lipid interaction; protein structure; animal; cell line; chemistry; endocytosis; flying; human; insect; metabolism; physiology; protein conformation; review; Hexapoda; Insecta; Mammalia; Vertebrata; Animals; Apolipoproteins; Carrier Proteins; Cell Line; Endocytosis; Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins; Flight, Animal; Humans; Insects; Lipid Metabolism; Lipoproteins; Neoplasm Proteins; Protein Conformation; Receptors, LDL; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036813437

In plants and algae, peroxisomes connect biosynthetic and oxidative metabolic routes and compartmentalize potentially lethal steps of metabolism such as the formation of reactive oxygen species and glyoxylate, thus preventing poisoning of the cell and futile recycling. Peroxisomes exhibit properties resembling inside-out vesicles and possess special systems for the import of specific proteins, which form multi-enzyme complexes (metabolons) linking numerous reactions to flavin-dependent oxidation, coupled to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalase. Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide originating in peroxisomes are important mediators in signal transduction pathways, particularly those involving salicylic acid. By contributing to the synthesis of oxalate, formate and other organic acids, peroxisomes regulate major fluxes of primary and secondary metabolism. The evolutionary diversity of algae has led to the presence of a wide range of enzymes in the peroxisomes that are only similar to higher plants in their direct predecessors, the Charophyceac. The appearance of seed plants was connected to the acquirement by storage tissues, of a peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation function linked to the glyoxylate cycle, which is induced during seed germination and maturation. Rearrangement of the peroxisomal photorespiratory function between different tissues of higher plants led to the appearance of different types of photosynthetic metabolism. The peroxisome may therefore have played a key role in the evolutionary formation of metabolic networks, via establishing interconnections between different metabolic compartments. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Box 20423, Nicosia 2152, Cyprus","The thermal utilization of solar energy is usually confined to domestic hot water systems and somewhat to space heating at temperatures up to 60 °C. Industrial process heat has a considerable potential for solar energy utilization. Cyprus has a small isolated energy system, almost totally dependent on imported fuels to meet its energy demand. The abundance of solar radiation together with a good technological base, created favorable conditions for the exploitation of solar energy in the island. The number of units in operation today corresponds to one heater for every 3.7 people in the island, which is a world record. Despite this impressive record no solar industrial process heat system is in operation today. The main problem for this is the big expenditure required for such a system and the uncertainty of the benefits. The objective of this work was to investigate the viability of using parabolic trough collectors for industrial heat generation in Cyprus. The system is analyzed both thermally and economically with TRNSYS and the TMY for Nicosia, Cyprus, in order to show the magnitude of the expected benefits. The load is hot water delivered at 85 °C at a flow rate of 2000 kg/h for the first three quarters of each hour from 8:00-16:00 h, 5 days a week. The system consists of an array of parabolic trough collectors, hot water storage tank, piping and controls. The optimum collector area for the present application is 300 m2, the optimum collector flow rate is 54 kg/m2 h and the optimum storage tank size is 25 m3. The system covers 50% of the annual load of the system and gives life cycle savings of about C£6200 (ε10800). This amount represent the money saved from the use of the system against paying for fuel. The savings however refer to a nonsubsidized fuel price, which will be in effect from 2003. The optimum system can deliver a total of 896 GJ per year and avoids 208 tons of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. The effect of various design changes on the system performance was investigated. The E-W tracking system (collector axis aligned in N-S direction) was found to be superior to the N-S one. The required load temperature affects the performance of the system as for higher temperatures the auxiliary energy required is bigger. Also a number of variations in the load use pattern have been investigated and presented in this paper. It was found that the bigger the load (double shift, full hour use pattern) the bigger the collector area required, the greater the first year fuel savings and the greater the life cycle savings of the installation. This means that it is more viable to apply solar industrial process heat to higher energy consumption industries. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The function(s) of uncoupling protein-2 have not yet been definitively described. However, mounting evidence suggests that uncoupling protein-2 could act in multiple tissues as a regulator of lipid metabolism. A role as a modulator of reactive oxygen species as a defence against infection is also postulated. In this review, a brief overview of the general and specific properties of uncoupling protein-2 is given and evidence for metabolic and immune regulatory functions is summarized. Uncoupling protein-2 could have particular importance in the regulation of lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. In addition, its ability to inhibit insulin secretion could also promote fat utilization over storage. Inhibition by uncoupling protein-2 of reactive oxygen species formation in macrophages and other tissues could have implications for regulation of immune function. The possibility of functions of uncoupling protein-2 in other tissues such as the brain are beginning to emerge.","Energy balance; Metabolism; Mitochondria; Reactive oxygen species; Uncoupling protein","reactive oxygen metabolite; uncoupling protein 2; adipose tissue; brain; conference paper; human; immunoregulation; insulin release; lipid metabolism; macrophage; metabolic regulation; mitochondrial membrane; priority journal; protein analysis; skeletal muscle; Animals; Homeostasis; Humans; Ion Channels; Membrane Transport Proteins; Metabolic Diseases; Mitochondrial Proteins; Proteins; Uncoupling Agents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036192111

Three PPAR subtypes, PPARα, PPARδ (PPARβ) and PPARγ, have been described in mammals. The tissue distribution of PPARs is heterogeneous: PPARα is highly expressed in liver and skeletal muscle, PPARγ is preferentially expressed in adipose tissues, and PPARδ is expressed in most cell types with relative abundance. Unlike most receptors, PPARs show low ligand specificity, being activated by many long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, or by eicosanoids. PPARs are transcriptionally active as heterodimeric complexes with the retinoid X receptor and bind to specific recognition sequences in the regulatory region of target genes. Many PPAR-regulated genes encode proteins that regulate fatty acid oxidation and storage. Elucidation of the biological functions of PPARs has been aided by the development of PPAR-null mice and the identification of humans bearing PPAR mutations, together with the discovery of synthetic small-molecule ligands that selectively activate individual PPAR subtypes. Using these genetic and pharmacological approaches, it has been shown that PPARα predominantly regulates pathways of fatty acid oxidation, whereas PPARγ modifies fatty acid synthesis and storage in adipose tissues. By reducing systemic fatty acid availability, thiazolidinedione PPARγ activators regulate glucose metabolism and are now used clinically in the treatment of Type II diabetes. In summary, PPARs play a central role in the mechanisms that balance fatty acid oxidation and storage in the face of fluctuations of dietary fat intake and energy expenditure.","Adipocyte differentiation; Fatty acid oxidation; Lipogenesis","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; icosanoid; long chain fatty acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; saturated fatty acid; unsaturated fatty acid; adipose tissue; conference paper; energy expenditure; fat intake; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid synthesis; glucose metabolism; human; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; liver; mammal; metabolic regulation; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; priority journal; protein localization; receptor affinity; skeletal muscle; tissue distribution; Animals; Lipid Metabolism; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Tissue Distribution; Transcription Factors; Mammalia; Vertebrata",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036865166

In this study, bovine (n = 37) and human (n = 32) trabecular bone was investigated in vitro and in vivo to reveal relationships between mechanical properties, mineral density, and US parameters BUA and SOS. To fulfill these aims, clinical US and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) techniques, as well as dynamic and destructive mechanical testing, were utilized. BUA correlated positively and linearly with BMDareal only in human calcaneus of low or moderate density (r = 0.849, n = 32, p &lt; 0.01). When calcaneal areas with high BMDareal were included in the analysis, however, the in vivo study revealed that the BUA-BMDareal relationship could be described by a second-order polynomial fit (r2 = 0.618, n = 408). In high-density human or bovine bone, the BUA-bone density relationship was negative. In the in vitro assessment, BUA correlated linearly and negatively with volumetric BMD (BMDvol) (r = -0.540, n = 29, p &lt; 0.01) and with storage modulus, as measured at 1 Hz (r = -0.505, n = 28, p &lt; 0.01). A weak positive correlation was found between BUA and mechanical loss tangent (r = 0.322, n = 28, p &lt; 0.1). SOS correlated strongly positively with BMDvol (r = 0.888, n = 29, p &lt; 0.01), as well with storage modulus (r = 0.649, n = 28, p &lt; 0.01). In contrast, SOS correlated negatively with loss tangent (r = -0.417, n = 28, p &lt; 0.05). When tested dynamically in the frequency range of 0.01-22.7 Hz, bovine trabecular bone was only slightly viscoelastic. In summary, the most accurate parameters for measuring storage modulus and strength of bovine trabecular bone were SOS and BMDvol, respectively. BUA failed to predict the mechanical properties of high-density trabecular bone.

A life cycle assessment approach was used to identify life cycle activities with significant impact, the influence of different recycling rates and different time boundaries for emissions of landfilled metals. Excluding the user phase of the battery, 65% of the primary energy is used in the manufacture of batteries while 32% is used in the production of raw materials. Metal emissions from batteries to water originate (96-98%) from landfilling and incineration. The transportation distance for the collection of batteries has no significant influence on energy use and emissions. Batteries manufactured with recycled nickel and cadmium instead of virgin metals have 16% lower primary energy use. Recycled cadmium and nickel metal require 46 and 75% less primary energy, respectively, compared with extraction and refining of virgin metal. Considering an infinite time perspective, the potential metal emissions are 300-400 times greater than during the initial 100 years. From an environmental perspective, the optimum recycling rate for NiCd batteries tends to be close to 100%. It may be difficult to introduce effective incitements to increase the battery collection rate. Cadmium should be used in products that are likely to be collected at the end of their life, otherwise collection and subsequent safe storage in concentrated form seems to offer the best solution to avoid dissipative losses.

Careful monitoring together with adherence to established regimens using desferrioxamine (DFO) results in a 78% survival rate at 40 years of age at UCLH, with steadily improving survival as progressive cohorts receive chelation earlier in life. By contrast, survival is considerably below this in non-specialist centres. The prognostic significance of the measures being used in monitoring should be known so that decisions about chelation management are evidence-based. Serum ferritin measurement, although easy to perform frequently, is subject to variability and falsely high or falsely low values in relation to body iron are frequently obtained. However, there is evidence that persistently high ferritin values above 2500 μg/l have poor prognostic significance in patients treated with DFO. Liver iron predicts total body iron in a more predictable way than serum ferritin in thalassaemia. Liver iron concentrations of 15 mg/g dry weight appear to predict those patients who develop heart failure in subjects treated with DFO. The prognostic significance of this measurement or indeed other measurements of iron overload in patients treated with other chelation regimens is not known. Recent advances with MRI imaging have aroused interest in its use for monitoring patients with thalassaemia. A recent publication suggests a relationship between left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac T2*, the value of which shortens with increasing iron concentrations in the liver and hence by inference in the heart. The prognostic value of this technique has not yet been demonstrated in prospective studies and hence changes in therapy based on this measurement alone should be considered with caution at this time. The value of monitoring to decrease morbidity from iron overload is also discussed, particularly with reference to the estimation of iron deposition in the pituitary.","Cardiac function; Chelation therapy; Deferiprone monitoring tissue damage; Desferrioxamine; MRI; SQUID; Transfusional iron overload","alpha tocopherol; aminotransferase; antiarrhythmic agent; apolipoprotein E; ascorbic acid; beta 1 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; deferasirox; deferiprone; deferoxamine; dobutamine; estradiol; ferritin; follitropin; gonadorelin; hemoglobin; hemosiderin; hydrocortisone; hydroxypyridinone; iron; iron chelating agent; low density lipoprotein; luteinizing hormone; malonaldehyde; parathyroid hormone; pentetic acid; pyridone derivative; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; transferrin; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; iron; iron chelating agent; albumin; alpha tocopherol; apolipoprotein E4; ascorbic acid; calcium; citric acid; deferiprone; deferoxamine; glucose; iron; lycopene; pentetic acid; phosphate; thyrotropin; thyroxine; vitamin D; adenohypophysis; adolescent; adult; agranulocytosis; chelation therapy; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug excretion; drug megadose; drug potentiation; drug stability; evidence based medicine; eye toxicity; female; ferritin blood level; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; iron chelation; iron overload; iron storage; laboratory diagnosis; liver level; male; medical decision making; morbidity; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; ototoxicity; outcomes research; patient care; patient monitoring; prediction; priority journal; prognosis; review; skin manifestation; survival rate; thalassemia; chelation therapy; drug monitoring; iron overload; metabolism; methodology; standard; thalassemia; treatment outcome; Alzheimer disease; anaphylaxis; arthralgia; arthropathy; beta thalassemia; blood transfusion; body height; body weight; bone development; bone disease; bone marrow transplantation; bone metabolism; brain; computer assisted tomography; diabetes mellitus; DNA polymorphism; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; echocardiography; electrocardiogram; endocrine function; exercise test; fever; gastrointestinal absorption; glomerulus filtration rate; glucose tolerance test; glucose urine level; gonadorelin test; growth retardation; heart disease; heart function; heart muscle; hemoglobin determination; Huntington chorea; hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; hypoparathyroidism; hypophysis; hypothalamus hypophysis gonad system; hypothyroidism; hypoxia; infection risk; iron absorption; iron balance; iron metabolism; iron overload; kidney dysfunction; liver biopsy; lung disease; lung embolism; macrophage; myalgia; needle biopsy; neuroimaging; neurotoxicity; neutropenia; osteoporosis; oxidative stress; parathyroid function; Parkinson disease; patient compliance; patient monitoring; sexual development; skin manifestation; splenectomy; systemic lupus erythematosus; thalassemia major; thyroid function; thyroxine blood level; tissue injury; urinary excretion; zinc deficiency; Chelation Therapy; Drug Monitoring; Humans; Iron; Iron Chelating Agents; Iron Overload; Thalassemia; Treatment Outcome",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036431540

We have found that, while chemisorption of individual H atoms to the external surface of the fullerenes is observed, hydrogen atoms cannot be attached to the inner wall of the structures and can only exist in a molecular form inside the fullerenes. We further find that, as a function of the symmetry of the encapsulating cavity and a delicate balance between repulsive energies among H2 molecules inside the structures and those between H2 molecules and the fullerene walls, molecular (H2)N clusters of well defined shape are formed namely: linear configurations, two-dimensional zig-zag and triangular arrays, and three-dimensional structures such as octahedral and icosahedral clusters, as well as helicoidal cylindrical-shape assemblies. In the cylindrical configurations (C and BN tubes), hydrogen atoms are placed inside the structures up to a bond breakage of the fullerene network, which allow us to estimate the maximum storage capacities of the different configurations. Actually, in our closed nanotubes, we relate the bond breakage mechanism to the development of a nonuniform hydrogen accommodation along the tubes, driven by the both highly anisotropic H2-H2 and wall-H2 repulsive interactions. With increasing the number of stored H2, tubes are found to be mainly radially deformed, a fact that reduces (up to ∼ 13%) the energy difference between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals in the structures. Finally, saturation of the tube ends with molecular terminations results in stable compounds from which a density-controlled storage of hydrogen seems to be possible.",,"fullerene derivative; hydrogen; article; calculation; chemical analysis; chemical bond; chemical structure; density; energy; hydrogen bond; molecule",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347805881

Institute, Mysore - 570 013, India","Carbohydrates are biomolecules abundantly available in nature. They are found in bewildering types ranging from simple sugars through oligo- and polysaccharides to glycoconjugates and saccharide complexes, each exhibiting characteristic bio-physiological and/or nutritional functions both in in vivo and in vitro systems. For example, their presence or inclusion in food dictates the texture (body) and gives desirable customer appeal (satisfaction), or their inclusion in the diet offers beneficial effects of great therapeutic value. Thus, carbohydrates are integrally involved in a multitude of biological functions such as regulation of the immune system, cellular signaling (communication), cell malignancy, antiinfection responses, host-pathogen interactions, etc. If starch is considered the major energy storage carbohydrate, the gums/mucilages and other non-starch carbohydrates are of structural significance. The most investigated properties of starch are its gelatinization and melting behavior, especially during food processing. This has led to the development of the food polymer science approach, which has enabled a new interpretive and experimental frame work for the study of the plasticizing influence of simple molecules such as water, sugars, etc. on food systems that are kinetically constrained. Starch, although considered fully digestible, has been challenged, and starch is found to be partly indigestible in the GI tract of humans. This fraction of starch-resisting digestion in vivo is known as resistant starch (RS). The latter, due to its excellent fermentative capacity in the gut, especially yielding butyric acid is considered a new tool for the creation of fiber-rich foods, which are of nutraceutical importance. By a careful control of the processing conditions the content of RS, a man-made fiber, can be increased to as high as 30%. Arabinoxylans are the major endospermic cell wall polysaccharides of cereals. In wheat they are found complexed with ferulic acid esters, which after oxidative coupling in vivo mediated by H2O2 and peroxidases or even by photochemical means give cross linked diferuloyl derivatives. The latter confer strength and extensibility to the cell wall and offer resistance for digestibility by ruminants. They also help blocking of the ingress of pathogens. The ester bound ferulic acid after oxidation in vivo generates reactive oxygen species that contribute to the fragmentation of non-starch polysaccharides (hemicelluloses), and thereby reduces the product viscosity, a property seen during long-term storage of rice. In plant tissues, the arabinogalactans are implicated in such diverse functions as cell-cell adhesion, nutrition of growing pollen tubes, response to microbial infections, and also as markers of identity expressed in the terminal sequences of saccharide chains.",,"Cells; Digestive system; Nutrition; Starch; Sugars; Cellular signalling; Biotechnology; acetic acid; amylase; amylopectin; amylose; butyric acid; cellulose; hemicellulose; lignin; pectin; polysaccharide; propionic acid; short chain fatty acid; starch; carbohydrate analysis; dietary fiber; digestion; enzyme activity; fermentation; food analysis; nonhuman; priority journal; review; rice; Carbohydrates; Food Analysis; Structure-Activity Relationship; Triticum aestivum",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036218596

The optimum yield of formation of single phase Mg2FeH6 was achieved by hydrogen (∼10 atm.) milling of constituent elements at a speed of 400 rpm for various milling durations. The structural characterization of the ball-milled (2 Mg+Fe) powder was carried out using Philips X-ray diffractometer by taking samples from the attritor mill at regular intervals of time. It was found that the Mg2FeH6 phase starts forming at a milling duration of 14 h and the optimum Mg2FeH6 phase formation was obtained at 20 h. The proportion of this phase was estimated by employing Rietveld refinement analysis of the X-ray powder diffraction data and it was found to be 63%. This is the highest phase proportion reported so far for the Mg2FeH6 phase when formed from elemental Mg and Fe following the route of mechanical alloying. Together with the Mg2FeH6 phase, some quantity of Fe (about 37%) is also present. Fe, being a magnetic impurity, can be removed leaving the Mg2FeH6 content to be nearly 90-100%. However, such purification was not done in the present investigation. We also investigated synthesis of the material obtained by longer milling durations of 25, 28 and 30 h. The XRD patterns for the 25, 28 and 30 h ball-milled materials revealed that the intensity of Mg2FeH6 peaks is reduced in comparison to the Fe peaks. This implies that beyond 20 h, there is no further increase in the phase proportion and the amorphization starts taking place. The post-sintering process of these mechanically alloyed samples did not improve the Mg2FeH6 phase proportion and yield as evidenced by XRD. The X-ray structural characterizations revealed that the as-milled Mg2FeH6 material (milling duration of 20 h; under H2 pressure ∼10 atm., speed ∼400 rpm) corresponds to the known face centered cubic structure with lattice parameter a=0.6446(2) nm. The elemental (chemical) compositional analysis was carried out for the mechanically alloyed Mg2FeH6 materials using the EDAX technique. The results confirm the correct stoichiometric ratio of the initial mixture (2Mg+Fe). The surface morphologies of the (2Mg+Fe) mixture before and after mechanical alloying are performed using scanning electron microscopic technique. The SEM explorations reveal the spongy like feature of Mg2FeH6 agglomerates. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The motivation is a perceived economic advantage of the proposed system over single-tank systems in solar heating systems where the required total volume of water is rather large - say 2000 1 or more. In the proposed system, the individual tanks in the multi-tank system (each with a volume of about 200 1) are interconnected by means of two strings of immersed-coil heat exchangers: the first string serially connects exchangers that have been immersed at the bottoms of the tanks, the second connects exchangers that have been immersed at the tops of the tanks. The first string will be connected to the solar collector loop and the second in the load loop. The present work experimentally demonstrates the degree of effective stratification that the multi-tank system can achieve, as well as a thermodynamically advantageous 'thermal diode' effect. It also describes a model for a multi-tank system as well as experiments that validate the model. Part of the multi-tank model is a model for a single tank with immersed coil heat exchanger, and this model drew upon a 'reversion-elimination' algorithm from the recent literature. The validity of the reversion-elimination algorithm is supported by the present experiments. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

After ball milling the microstructure typically shows additive particles covered with a film of MgH2 as investigated by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis. Depending on the milling time and material used as additive, the desorption of hydrogen takes place at a far lower temperature than in pure MgH2 as studied by thermal desorption spectroscopy. In the next step we developed a new method to use only small volume fractions of additives in order to minimize the amount of additive material and maximize the percentage of hydrogen storage material. Therefore, MgH2 was sputter-deposited by palladium and successively ball milled to achieve a composite material with finely dispersed metallic additives. The desorption kinetics could be strongly improved even though only small amounts of palladium were added. The new method of ultra-fine dispersion may lead to MgH2 composite materials with a high storage capacity of hydrogen accessible at moderate temperatures. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Mya arenaria is well established in the fjord and potentially exposed to persistent sediment contamination as an endobenthic bivalve. From May to October 1997, clams energy storage and utilization in the gonad was shown to be closely linked with reproduction. Wherever the sampling site location in the fjord, a seasonal pattern is evident for lipid and glycogen levels in the gonad, this, reflecting the vitellogenic process. Nevertheless, in comparison with energy status and gametogenesis of clams collected on the north coast of the Saint-Lawrence Estuary, clams located in the fjord have to face limited nutritive conditions resulting in a single and shorter reproductive period. Although environmental factors could explain differences in physiological condition and reproductive status observed between clams from the fjord and the estuary, our results can discriminate clams from the upper part of the fjord, according to a delayed gametogenesis, concomitant with significant higher gonad glycogen concentrations observed in June 1996 and 1997. A persistent dysfunction of a vitellogenic process is suspected to be due to the exposure to anti-estrogenic contaminants. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

This system is suggested to involve at least one peripheral signalling compound, which signals to the brain the current size of body fat stores. In the brain the level of the signal is compared with a desirable target level, and food intake and energy expenditure are then regulated to effect changes in the size of body fat stores. There is considerable support for this theory at several different levels of investigation. Patterns of body-mass change in subjects forced into energy imbalance seem to demonstrate homeostasis, and long-term changes in body mass are minor compared with the potential changes that might result from energy imbalance. Molecular studies of signalling compounds have suggested a putative lipostatic signal (leptin) and a complex network of downstream processing events in the brain, polymorphisms of which lead to disruption of body-mass regulation. This network of neuropeptides provides a rich seam of potential pharmaceutical targets for the control of obesity. Despite this consistent explanation for the observed phenomena at several different levels of enquiry, there are alternative explanations. In the present paper we explore the possibility that the existence of lipostatic regulation of body fatness is an illusion generated by the links between body mass and energy expenditure and responses to energy imbalance that are independent of body mass. Using computer-based models of temporal patterns in energy balance we show that common patterns of change in body mass following perturbation can be adequately explained by this 'non-lipostatic' model. This model has some important implications for the interpretations that we place on the molecular events in the brain, and ultimately in the search for pharmaceutical agents for alleviation of obesity.","Body fatness; Energy homeostasis; Leptin; Lipostat; Set-point","leptin; body fat; body mass; brain size; computer model; conference paper; energy balance; energy expenditure; feedback system; food intake; homeostasis; human; lipid storage; obesity; peptide analysis; regulatory mechanism; signal transduction; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Composition; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Homeostasis; Humans; Leptin; Models, Biological; Neuropeptides; Obesity; Signal Transduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036870538

A very important part of the vehicle is its control system, which has to maximize the vehicle efficiency while keeping the emissions within predetermined limits. To attain this goal, it can act in two ways: 1) It can switch the electric generator ON or OFF, and 2) when in the ON state, it can impose a given power to be delivered. To choose the control actions to perform it needs a) an algorithm to understand the behavior of the battery (determine the state-of-charge, maximum power, losses and b) an algorithm to make some forecast of the system load (i.e., the power required in the future of the trip, as a function of time).

The hydrophilic property of the polymer substrate was necessary for obtaining current densities comparable to those at an ordinary Au electrode under similar conditions: aqueous KHCO3, ambient temperature and approximately one atmosphere pressure of CO2. At potentials more negative than the activation potential for CO2 reduction, -1.2 V versus SCE, the current density was of fractional order with respect to the CO2 pressure, indicating the involvement of an adsorbed reaction intermediate, possibly a radical anion complex (CO2)2·-.

The branch frequency and branch length of the copolymers were controlled by varying the stoichiometry and molecular weight of the EPR macromonomer, respectively. Long chain branch frequencies of up to 2.8 branches per chain were achieved, while the branch length was varied from 2500 to 17 000 g/mol. The effects of macromonomer concentration, macromonomer molecular weight, and reaction temperature on the copolymer chain properties were investigated. The rheological responses of the EPR-branched PP were determined. Branches below 7000 g/mol had little influence on the rheological behavior of the polymers. The zero shear viscosity, shear thinning property, and loss and storage moduli were found to be dependent on the branch length and branch frequency when the branch Mn was above 7000 g/mol. Elevated flow activation energies were observed with measured values of up to 51 kJ/mol.

So at BESSY II the electron beam energy is measured by two independent techniques one of which is described in this paper: the photons from a CO2-laser are scattered in a head-on collision with the stored electrons. From the spectrum of the backscattered photons that are detected by an energy-calibrated HPGe detector the electron beam energy can be determined.

The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes involved in brown and white preadipocyte development. Using representational difference analysis (cDNA RDA) and DNA microarray screening, we identified four genes with higher expression in white preadipocytes (three different complement factors and 8-6 fatty acid desaturase) and seven genes with higher expression levels in brown preadipocytes, of which three are structural genes implicated in cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization (fibronectin, α-actinin-4, metargidin) and four that might function in gene transcription and protein synthesis (vigilin, necdin, snRNP polypeptide A, and a homolog to human hepatocellular carcinoma-associated protein). The expression profile of these genes was analyzed during preadipocyte differentiation, upon β-adrenergic stimulation, and in WAT and BAT tissue in vivo compared with references genes such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), cytochrome c oxidase. adipocyte differentiation; thermogenesis; preadipocyte marker genes; uncoupling protein; cDNA representational-difference analysis; DNA microarray analysis.",,"beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; complementary DNA; insulin; isoprenaline; messenger RNA; adipocyte; animal; antibody specificity; article; brown adipose tissue; cell culture; cell differentiation; comparative study; cytology; DNA microarray; drug effect; enzymology; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene library; genetics; hamster; metabolism; Northern blotting; phenotype; Phodopus; reproducibility; stem cell; upregulation; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adrenergic beta-Agonists; Animals; Blotting, Northern; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Cricetinae; DNA, Complementary; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Library; Insulin; Isoproterenol; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Organ Specificity; Phenotype; Phodopus; Reproducibility of Results; RNA, Messenger; Stem Cells; Up-Regulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035841154

The temperature during the electrolysis of CO2 was decreased stepwise to 271 K. Methane and formic acid were obtained as the main products.

In whatever form the energy is stored, an alternative energy system usually requires a storage buffer between carrying energy input and the varying energy demand regime at the output end of the system. A method of energy storage is the use of the latent heat from Phase Change Materials (PCMs), for example salt hydrates. In this paper we tested the corrosion resistance of five commercial metals (aluminum, brass, copper, steel and stainless steel) in contact with two salt hydrates, commonly used as PCM, with a melting temperature in the range of 48 to 58 C°(sodium acetate trihydrate and sodium thiosulfate pentahy- drate) in experiments with a duration up to 70 days. The results demonstrated that brass and copper should be avoided when sodium acetate trihydrate is used in long term applications, but aluminum, steel and stainless steel can be used without problem. When the salt hydrate used is sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate, brass and copper should not be used in any case, aluminum and stainless steel can be used, and steel in contact with graphite should be monitored because corrosion could appear after some time of use. © 2002 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Examples of energy carriers, which should be delivered to the envisaged sustainable energy markets, are bio-fuels, produced from biomass residues, and hydrogen (or electricity), produced from renewable sources. In contrast to the readily available ancient sunlight stored in fossil fuels, the harvesting of incident sunlight will be intermittent, efficient electricity and hydrogen storage technologies need to be developed. Research to develop those energy chains is going on, but the actual transformation from current fossil fuel based to sustainable energy markets will take a considerable time. In the meantime the fossil fuel based energy markets have to be transformed to mitigate the impact of the use of fossil fuels.

It is found by X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectra analysis that all these alloys mainly consist of two phases, a C14 Laves phase with hexagonal structure and a V-based solid solution phase with body-centered cubic structure. The lattice parameters and thus the cell volumes of the two phases all decrease when x is increased. The electrochemical measurements indicate that the maximum discharge capacity, the discharge equilibrium potential, the high rate dischargeability, the cyclic stability, the exchange current density I0, and the limiting current density IL of the alloys all increase with increasing x from 2 to 5. When x reaches 6, the discharge equilibrium potential, the high rate dischargeability, and the cyclic stability are still increasing proportionately, while the maximum discharge capacity, the exchange current density I0, and the limiting current density IL all decrease. Furthermore, the alloy electrodes are activated with more difficulty for the alloys with higher stoichiometry x. Consequently, we believe that the superstoichiometry is an effective way to improve the overall electrochemical properties of the Ti-based Laves-phase hydrogen storage alloys used for the negative electrodes of the Ni-MH secondary batteries. © 2002 The Electrochemical Society.

Up to now, only the hydride batteries have reached the consumer level while for hydrides obtained by direct reaction between hydrogen gas and the parent solid phase, applications have not yet been successful suggesting that many problems remain to be solved. In this paper, we will be concerned with the factors influencing the absorption properties according to the type of application. It will also be shown that the dynamic behavior of these highly defective materials is difficult to control due to the hysteresis accompanying the formation-decomposition of the hydrides compounds.

Addition of appropriate alloying elements, such as Al and Ni, and a fine microstructure can ease the problems. In order to increase the solubility of Al into Mg and to refine the powder structure, a (Mg+10 at.% Al) mixture was investigated by mechanical alloying. It was noted that the amount of elemental Al decreases with increasing milling time. After 20 h of milling, an h.c.p. (Mg, Al) solid solution was obtained with a volume contraction of 1.2%. An energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirmed its formation and showed its chemical composition as (Mg+12 at.% Al). When 10 at.% Ni was further added to the (Mg, Al) solid solution as a catalytic element, a new Mg12Al17 phase was formed, in addition to a modified (Mg, Al, Ni) solution. When the (Mg+10 at.% Al) mixture milled for 2 h was annealed at 400 °C for 2 h, all the Al dissolved into Mg and formed a single (Mg, Al) solid solution.

We studied seasonal weight regulation of the species by following the plasma leptin, ghrelin, and growth hormone (GH) levels of farm-bred raccoon dogs (n = 32) for 6 months. In August, half of the raccoon dogs received continuous-release melatonin implants, and in November, half of the animals of both the sham-operated and melatonin-treated groups were fasted for 2 months. In the autumn, the plasma leptin and GH levels were low, but the ghrelin levels were relatively high and correlated positively with energy intake. This represents the period of energy storage. Leptin and GH levels peaked simultaneously in late October, and melatonin advanced the peaks by 1 week. Thereafter, the levels rapidly declined, representing the transition period from autumnal anabolism to wintertime catabolism. In the winter, the leptin and GH levels rose to high levels, but the ghrelin-leptin ratio was very low. This is the period of winter sleep, with fat accumulated in the autumn as the principal metabolic fuel. In the winter, leptin, ghrelin, and GH may work in synergy to increase lipolysis. GH may also induce winter sleep to the raccoon dog. Fasting had no effect on the hormone levels, unlike in humans and rodents. Instead of the amount of fat in the body, the main regulators of the levels of these hormones in the raccoon dog are presumably seasonal rhythms entrained bymelatonin.","Ghrelin; Growth hormone; Leptin; Melatonin; Nyctereutes procyonoides; Raccoon dog; Seasonality","ghrelin; growth hormone; leptin; melatonin; ghrelin; growth hormone; leptin; melatonin; peptide; peptide hormone; animal experiment; article; autumn; body weight; caloric intake; controlled study; correlation analysis; diet restriction; dog; female; hormone blood level; lipid storage; lipolysis; male; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; seasonal variation; winter; adipose tissue; animal; basal metabolic rate; blood; Carnivora; drug effect; drug implant; eating; energy metabolism; hibernation; photoperiodicity; physiology; season; Animalia; Canidae; Canis familiaris; Carnivora; Nyctereutes procyonoides; Procyon lotor; Rodentia; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Body Weight; Carnivora; Drug Implants; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Female; Growth Hormone; Hibernation; Leptin; Male; Melatonin; Peptide Hormones; Peptides; Photoperiod; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036551593

In this work, we propose an algorithm for the automatic partitioning of on-chip SRAMs into multiple banks. Starting from the dynamic execution profile of an embedded application running on a given processor core, we synthesize a multi-banked SRAM architecture optimally fitted to the execution profile. The algorithm computes an optimal solution to the problem under realistic assumptions on the power cost metrics, and with constraints on the number of memory banks. The partitioning algorithm is integrated with the physical design phase into a complete flow that allows the back annotation of layout information to drive the partitioning process.

Spray drying is one of the most convenient techniques for producing milk powders and for stabilizing milk constituents. Before spray drying, the milk undergoes several processes (such as heat treatment, cream separation, membrane processes, vacuum evaporation and homogenization). The chemical, physical, technological, nutritional, functional and microbiological properties of final products are influenced by a number of factors such as operating conditions, properties of the dairy products and storage conditions.

A comparative study of the protein profiles generated from analytical two-dimensional electrophoresis gels was performed, and changes in protein expression were analysed quantitatively by computer analysis. An average of 1,278 spots per gel was detected in 16 individuals (8 M. edulis and 8 M. galloprovincialis); however, not all spots were included in the study. Expression of 420 spots was compared, and significant differences in the intensity levels were detected in 37 protein spots (8.8%). Fifteen proteins showed higher expression in M. edulis, and 22 proteins, in M. galloprovincialis. The technique of peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation/time-of-flight) and/or nanoelectrospray double subfragmentation mass spectrometry enabled the unambiguous identification of 15 of these 37 differentially expressed proteins. Most of the identified proteins can be grouped basically into four broad functional classes: cytoskeletal and myofibrillar proteins, proteins associated with stress response, proteins associated with the storage or production of energy, and proteins related to rearrangement in the synthesis of native structures.

These cells are the major environmental interface for uptake of contaminants, particularly those associated with natural particulates that are filtered from seawater by mussels. Digestive cells show well characterised reactions to exposure to lipophilic xenobiotics, such as oil-derived aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs), which accumulate in these cells with minimal biotransformation. The simulation model is based on processes associated with the flux of carbon through the cell. Physiological parameters such as fluctuating food concentration, cell volume, respiration, secretion/excretion, storage of glycogen and lipid, protein/organelle turnover (autophagy/resynthesis) and export of carbon to other tissues of the mussel are all included in the model. The major response to AHs is induction of increased autophagy in these cells. Simulations indicate that the reactions to AHs and food deprivation correspond well with responses measured in vivo. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The specific molecules and metabolic pathways that mediate the actions of lipid-mobilizing factor are not known. The mitochondrial uncoupling proteins-1, -2 and -3 are suggested to play essential roles in energy dissipation and disposal of excess lipid. Here, we studied the effects of lipid-mobilizing factor on the expression of uncoupling proteins-1, -2 and -3 in normal mice. Lipid-mobilizing factor isolated from the urine of cancer patients was injected intravenously into mice over a 52-h period, while vehicle was similarly given to controls. Lipid-mobilizing factor caused significant reductions in body weight (-10%, P=0.03) and fat mass (-20%, P<0.01) accompanied by a marked decrease in plasma leptin (-59%, P<0.01) and heavy lipid deposition in the liver. In brown adipose tissue, uncoupling protein-1 mRNA levels were elevated in lipid-mobilizing factor-treated mice (+96%, P<0.01), as were uncoupling proteins-2 and -3 (+57% and +37%, both P<0.05). Lipid-mobilizing factor increased uncoupling protein-2 mRNA in both skeletal muscle (+146%, P<0.05) and liver (+142%, P=0.03). The protein levels of uncoupling protein-1 in brown adipose tissue and uncoupling protein-2 in liver were also increased with lipid-mobilizing factor administration (+49% and +67%, both P=0.02). Upregulation by lipid-mobilizing factor of uncoupling proteins-1, -2 and -3 in brown adipose tissue, and of uncoupling protein-2 in skeletal muscle and liver, suggests that these uncoupling proteins may serve to utilize excess lipid mobilized during fat catabolism in cancer cachexia. © 2002 Cancer Research UK.","Cancer cachexia; Lipid-mobilizing factor; Uncoupling proteins","cell protein; glycoprotein; lipid mobilizer hormone; messenger RNA; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 1; uncoupling protein 2; uncoupling protein 3; adenocarcinoma; animal tissue; article; body fat; brown adipose tissue; cachexia; carcinogenesis; controlled study; correlation analysis; fatty liver; human; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; urinalysis; weight reduction; Adenocarcinoma; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Animals; Blotting, Northern; Blotting, Western; Body Weight; Carrier Proteins; DNA Primers; Humans; Ion Channels; Leptin; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Membrane Proteins; Membrane Transport Proteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Mitochondrial Proteins; Muscle, Skeletal; Peptides; Proteins; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Up-Regulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037065968

We study the linearity and time dependence of the wake function and its variation with the size of the electron cloud.

For this purpose the representation of the Kerr effect in the complex rotation-ellipticity plane is introduced. A depth sensitivity function controlling the Kerr effect is defined and its dependence on the photon energy and angle of incidence is studied. A general way to determine the in-depth location of the FM layer, from which the Kerr signal originates, is proposed. In the case of a FM bilayer structure, previous proposed solutions are discussed within a unified formalism. For a system with three or more FM layers two approaches are proposed to extract selectively the magneto-optical signals originating at individual FM layers: the parallel Kerr vector and cascade numerical projection methods.

High etch rates, ranging from 45 to 130nm/min, were achieved. The etch rate strongly depended on both plasma density and ion energy. The main etching mechanism is interpreted as physical sputtering rather than as chemical reaction. A high selectivity of 6-16 was achieved by using hard masks of Ti or Ta. This is attributed to the hardening surface layer of the masks by nitradation, carbonization, or oxidation in CO/NH3 gas plasma. This etching process is named as hardening mask etching. This etching process was also applied for tunneling magneto-resistive (TMR) multi-layers that uses magnetic random access memory with a Ta mask. A high anisotropy of about 80° was obtained without residues, sidewall deposition, and corrosion. This process is potentially applicable to the etching of thin magnetic materials in TMR stacks, patterned media, and read/write head. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","CO/NH3 high-density helicon plasma; HM-etching; Magnetic materials; Magnetic random access memory (MRAM); NiFe; Ta; Ti; Tunneling magnet-resistive multi-layers (TMR)","Carbonization; Hardening; Ion beams; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetoresistance; Masks; Multilayers; Oxidation; Plasma density; Plasma etching; Plasma sources; Random access storage; Tunneling magneto-resistive (TMR) multilayers; Ferromagnetic materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037136178

However, fish are thought to regulate ingestion to meet their energy and nutrient intake requirements. Further, feeds with excessive fat content will lead to increased adiposity, which is thought to exert a negative feedback on feed intake via lipostatic regulation mechanisms. A test of the lipostatic model of feed intake regulation was carried out on juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. (c. 165 g) in which body fat content (5.6% and 9.4% body fat) had been manipulated by feeding feeds with different fat concentrations. Thereafter, the fish were offered the high- and low-fat feeds (15.6% and 26.5% dietary fat content) simultaneously, and our hypothesis was that feed preference and intake would reflect the state of fat storage. Thus, we predicted that, when given a choice of feeds, the lean fish would eat more, and that the body fat status of the groups would converge over time. The results indicated a general preference for the leaner feed irrespective of adiposity level, but leaner fish consumed more feed, grew faster and deposited more body fat than their fatter counterparts. Over time, body compositions converged among treatments, and differences in feed intake ablated. These findings seem to provide supportive evidence for a lipostatic regulation of feed intake in fish.","Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L.; Body composition; Feed preference; Lipid deposition; Lipostat","biochemical composition; fat; food preference; lipid; salmonid; Salmo; Salmo salar; Salmonidae; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037030559

In this paper, the usefulness of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is illustrated, as a tool for the prediction of the air flow pattern and of food temperature inside the cabinet. The numerical method is described: the airflow pattern and the load temperature are solved in sequence, in order to save computation time. The results of simulations performed both on a vertical and a horizontal cabinet are reported, as an example of the capabilities of the method. The influence of warm air infiltration on the energy balance of the cabinet is investigated and the results are validated by comparison with experimental tests.

An exciting property of carbon nanotubes is their ability to efficiently convert electrical energy into mechanical energy (actuation). Nanotube actuation is caused by the geometrical expansion of the carbon-carbon covalent bond caused by charge transfer into the nanotube [Abstract American Chemical Society 22 (1999); Abstract American Chemical Society 20 (2000)]. This ability to actuate, in addition to their high strength (∼1 TPa), makes macro-scale sheets of nanotubes termed 'bucky paper', ideal for artificial muscles [Science 284 (1999) 1340]. Carbon nanotube actuators based on bucky paper have been shown to generate an order of magnitude higher stresses than those observed for natural muscle. These promising results suggest that carbon nanotube actuators based on a single (or a few hundred) nanotubes will also lead to enhanced applications on the micro- or nano-scale in the biomedical or electronic fields. This paper provides an overview of carbon nanotube actuators, their exceptional properties, current research ideas and possibilities for future applications. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Leuven), Celestijnenlaan 300A, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium","The decision whether or not to install small cogeneration for residential purposes mainly depends on individual economic considerations, combined with ecological awareness. Since in most cases, the economic balance is still unfavourable, government grants are considered in order to bridge this economic barrier. It is however still unclear how these grants are best spent to obtain an optimal environmental benefit. In the case of cogeneration, mainly static and simplified methods are used, completely neglecting the dynamic interaction between the cogeneration systems and the central power system and the dynamic response of the cogeneration units themselves. In this paper, these issues are discussed in two parts. The first part clarifies how an actual cogeneration unit, if necessary in combination with a back-up boiler and heat storage, will respond to a certain demand. For this purpose, experiments were performed to establish the transient and stationary behaviour of the system. It is shown that the transient heating of the cogeneration engine is rather slow (e.g. half an hour after cold start, the engine only produced 65% of the heat it would have in stationary regime) where the electric transient behaviour is negligible. In the second part of the paper, dynamic simulations are performed to quantify the impact (primary energy saving and reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions) of the massive installation of cogeneration for residential heating. Two important parameters are isolated. First, the interaction with the expansion of the central power system is very important. If the installation of cogeneration prevents the commissioning of new power plants, the potential energy saving and (especially) emission reduction are reduced. The second parameter is the annual use of the cogeneration units. Here, the potential energy saving and emission reduction increase with increasing annual use.

Since intact groundwater can easily be obtained from the bottom of underground oil-storage cavities without contamination by surface water, studies on such oil-storage cavities are expected to provide valuable information to understand microbial ecology of subterranean oil fields. Results: DNA was extracted from the groundwater obtained from an oil-storage cavity situated at Kuji in Iwate, Japan, and 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA) fragments were amplified by PCR using combinations of universal and Bacteria-specific primers. The sequence analysis of 154 clones produced 31 different bacterial sequence types (a unique clone or group of clones with sequence similarity of > 98). Major sequence types were related to Desulfotomaculum, Acetobacterium, Desulfovibrio, Desulfobacula, Zoogloea and Thiomicrospira denitrificans. The abundance in the groundwater of bacterial populations represented by these major sequence types was assessed by quantitative competitive PCR using specific primers, showing that five rDNA types except for that related to Desulfobacula shared significant proportions (more than 1%) of the total bacterial rDNA. Conclusions: Bacteria inhabiting the oil-storage cavity were unexpectedly diverse. A phylogenetic affiliation of cloned 16S rDNA sequences suggests that bacteria exhibiting different types of energy metabolism coexist in the cavity.",,"bacterial DNA; DNA fragment; ground water; primer DNA; ribosome DNA; bacterial DNA; oil; RNA 16S; Acetobacter; article; bacterial flora; bacterium; controlled study; Desulfobacula; Desulfotomaculum; Desulfovibrio; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; gene amplification; microbial diversity; microbial population dynamics; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; sequence analysis; species differentiation; storage; Thiomicrospira denitrificans; unindexed sequence; Zoogloea; classification; ecology; fluorescence in situ hybridization; genetic variability; genetics; microbiology; phylogeny; Acetobacter; Acetobacterium; Bacteria (microorganisms); Desulfobacula; Desulfotomaculum; Desulfovibrio; Thiomicrospira; Thiomicrospira denitrificans; Zoogloea; Bacteria; DNA, Bacterial; Ecology; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Industrial Oils; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Variation (Genetics); Water Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19044366366

For both species, this was done by following 2 laboratory-reared cohorts, one reared at a high food concentration (Cohort H) and the other at a comparatively lower food concentration (Cohort L). The 2 cohorts of each species were maintained at a constant temperature (15°C for C. helgolandicus and ∼8°C for C. finmarchicus). The wax ester (WE) content was estimated in late CV and new moulted females, on the day when approximately 40 to 50% of the individuals of the cohort had moulted to adulthood. Copepodite Stage CV in Cohort H had accumulated much more WE than those in Cohort L (2.2 and 1.4 times more in the case of C. helgolandicus and C. finmarchicus, respectively). However, for both species, the amount of WE catabolized during the moulting of the CV stage from Cohort H is very similar to that of CV from Cohort L. In both cohorts, it is equivalent to ∼20 μgC for C, helgolandicus and ∼40 μgC for C. finmarchicus. Because of the difficulty of properly estimating the WE content at the end of CV, we consider that our values are underestimates, and a subsequent analysis, which considers the upper range of the WE content estimated at the end of CV, suggests values up to ∼30 μgC for C. helgolandicus and ∼70 μgC for C, finmarchicus. This WE catabolism is mainly due to gonad maturation, which occurred at this time, although part of it is also due to the loss of the exoskeleton and the energy required for the moulting process. We propose that the values obtained in this study can be used as a threshold to determine those animals that can descend for overwintering and those that have to remain at the surface, because the CVs with a WE storage below the threshold value will not be able to support the additional energetic costs linked to the overwintering strategy. Therefore, in the field, the percentage of copepods going into overwintering would be a consequence of the growth conditions. The WE threshold is likely to vary with temperature (with a lower value at higher temperature) since metabolism is more rapid at higher temperature.","Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus helgolandicus; Gonad; Lipid; Overwintering","energy; maturation; molt; overwintering; zooplankton; Animalia; Calanus; Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus helgolandicus; Calanus helgolandicus; Copepoda; Copepoda; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037047759

We identified à bout de souffle (bou), a new Arabidopsis mutation. Mutant plants stopped developing after germination and degraded storage lipids, but they did not proceed to autotrophic growth. Neither leaves nor roots developed in the mutant. However, externally added sugar or germination in the dark could bypass this developmental block and allowed mutant plants to develop. The mutated gene was cloned using the transposon Dissociation as a molecular tag. The gene coding sequence showed similarity to those of the mitochondrial carnitine acyl carriers (CACs) or CAC-like proteins. In animals and yeast, these transmembrane proteins are involved in the transport of lipid-derived molecules across mitochondrial membranes for energy and carbon supply. The data presented here suggest that BOU identifies a novel mitochondrial pathway that is necessary to seedling development in the light.

The proposed method is based on solution of a set of differential equations realized from transformation of an augmented lagrangian energy function. Here the objective function is to minimize the nonhydraulic power production expenses over the scheduling period. A multi-reservoir cascaded hydroelectric system with a nonlinear power generation function of water discharge rate and storage volume is taken into account for implementation. The water transportation delay between cascaded reservoirs is considered. Results concerning this method are compared with those achieved from successive solution of augmented lagrangian function utilizing familiar conjugate gradient method. It is shown that proposed solution approach with suitable selection of control parameters is capable of generating a good optimal solution. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","Hydro scheduling; Nonlinear generation function; Two-phase neural network","Differential equations; Electric power generation; Gradient methods; Hydroelectric power; Neural networks; Scheduling; Hydro scheduling; Two-phase neural networks; Electric power systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036778841

The interaction is based on van der Waals attractive forces (physisorption), or the overlap of the highest occupied molecular orbitals of carbon with the hydrogen electron, overcoming the activation-energy barrier for hydrogen dissociation (chemisorption). While the physisorption of hydrogen limits the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio to less than one hydrogen atom per two carbon atoms (i.e., 4.2 mass%), in chemisorption, a ratio of two hydrogen atoms per one carbon atom is realized (e.g., in polyethylene). However, the materials with large hydrogen-to-carbon ratios only liberate the hydrogen at elevated temperature. No evidence, apart from theoretical calculations, was found for a new hydrogen-adsorption phenomenon on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as compared with high-surface-area graphite. The curvature of CNTs and fullerenes increases the reactivity of these materials with hydrogen and leads more easily to the formation of hydrocarbons, as compared with graphite. Nanocrystalline or amorphous carbon exhibits an intermediate state for hydrogen between physisorption and chemisorption and absorbs up to one hydrogen atom per carbon atom. Nanostructured carbonaceous and metallic materials offer a large potential for hydrogen storage and must therefore be investigated in more detail.","Adsorption; Carbon nanotubes; Chemical reactivity; Hydrogen storage; Nanofibers","Activation energy; Amorphous materials; Atoms; Carbon; Chemisorption; Crystal lattices; Electric batteries; Gas adsorption; Molecular structure; Nanotubes; Transmission electron microscopy; Van der Waals forces; Amorphous carbon; High-surface-area graphite; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen storage; Molecular orbitals; Nanocrystalline carbon; Physisorption; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036742765

Red chilli puree was subjected to heat treatment at different temperatures in a well-stirred water bath. Test samples were removed from the bath at selected time intervals (0-20 min after come-up), cooled immediately and analysed for color using a Hunterlab colorimeter. Chilli paste was prepared by a standard formulation by adding common salt (8%) and the required volume of citric acid to bring the pH to 4.0. The paste was thermally processed at 85 °C for 15 min, filled into glass bottles and stored at selected temperatures for 6 mo. Red chilli color was expressed as a tristimulus combination value (L·a·b) as well as the total color difference (ΔE). The fraction conversion model adequately described the kinetic changes in both color values during thermal treatment of puree and storage of puree. The process activation energies were 24.2 and 24.8 kJ/mol, respectively, for ΔE and L·a·b during the thermal treatment, and during the storage the respective values were 24.1 and 25.0 kJ/mol.

The flywheel system relies on technology developed over more than 30 years for URENCO's high speed gas centrifuge and has itself undergone several further years of development. It is now the most advanced commercially available flywheel energy storage system. Its unique features, zero maintenance, 20 year life and high cyclic capability make it ideally suited to applications in rail power supplies. The flywheel system can resolve many of the problems encountered in traction supplies due to the 'peaky' nature of the loads caused by trains accelerating and braking. In addition, the UPT system can provide energy savings by improving the system's receptivity to energy from trains with regenerative braking. This paper describes how the system was applied to London Underground's Piccadilly line for a trial application and presents some of the data from these tests. This successful trial has now led to the first commercial application with the New York City Transit Authority. Finally, the paper reviews some of the possible developments which may lead to the application of this technology to higher voltage systems.",,"Braking; Electric energy storage; Electric loads; Electric power systems; Electric traction; Power control; Flywheel energy storage systems; Flywheels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036040577

Generally, one step of production process is the micronization of the drug particles in order to reduce the size for ordered mixing optimization. But this operation is known to partially create an amorphous surface. In this case, surrounding storage conditions, like relative humidity (RH), are able to modify the percentage of amorphous drug surface. The aim of this study was to investigate surface reactivity, surface energy and direct force measurements by atomic force microscopy (AFM) between lactose (carrier) and zanamivir (drug) crystals references in various conditions of RH. Secondly, an amorphization of the drug surface was induced by humidity relative treatment in order to evaluate the consequences of the transition from crystal to amorphous phase. The study demonstrated that the amorphization of drug surface induces an increase of drug affinity with the carrier surface. Ex situ and in situ amorphization of zanamivir tend to reach the affinity measured between raw materials: carrier and micronized drug particles. AFM allowed adhesion force discrimination between the different forms of the drug particles and demonstrated the potential for investigating adhesion properties in DPI formulation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Isobars of water sorption on these composites are measured at vapor pressure 6-81 mbar and temperature 30-145 °C. The type of sorption equilibrium for the two composites appears to be quite different. The isobars for SWS-2EG have a plateau corresponding to one molecule of H2O adsorbed by one molecule of LiBr, which indicates the formation of crystalline hydrate LiBr·H2O inside pores with a monovariant type of equilibrium. At lower temperatures, the equilibrium becomes divariant that is typical for LiBr-water solutions. On the contrary, the water sorption equilibrium for SWS-2C is divariant over the whole temperature and pressure range which means that no crystalline hydrates are formed inside Sibunit pores. In our opinion, this distinction results from differences in a pore structure of the host carbons. The composite sorption capacity can reach 0.6-1.1 g H2O per 1 g of the dry sorbent at relative humidity 70%. The advanced sorption capacity makes the sorbents promising for gas drying, thermal storage of energy and other applications. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

All strains were within the size range ingested by most filter feeders, i.e. 3-10 μm. Cellular growth rates of aerated 1.6-1 cultures ranged from 0.5-0.7 divisions·day-1 (Papiliocellulus simplex CS-431, Nitzschia cf paleacea CS-433) to 1.7-2.0 divisions·day-1 (Attheya septentrionalis CS-425, Entomoneis cf punctulata CS-426, Extubocellulus spinifera CS-428, Thalassiosira oceanica CS-427). The latter four strains were also rich in energy storage fractions (carbohydrate and/or lipid), especially as cultures progressed to stationary phase. Based on the initial screening, A. septentrionalis, E. cf punctulata, E. spinifera and T. oceanica were assessed as to their food value for juvenile Pacific oysters. The diatoms were fed as part of a mixed diet - each making up 70-83% of the total dry weight - together with an equal mixture of the haptophytes Pavlova lutheri and Isochrysis sp. (T. ISO) over a 21-day experiment. Diets containing A. septentrionalis and E. cf punctulata were the most effective, producing growth rates (k=0.050 day-1) marginally inferior to a similar (reference) diet containing a commonly used aquaculture diatom strain of high nutritional value, T. pseudonana CCMP 1335 (k=0.055 day-1). Regression analysis showed that oyster growth rate was correlated with the content of protein in the equal ration algal diets. We have shown A. septentrionalis and E. cf punctulata to be alternative Australian strains with good nutritional value that could be utilised by oyster hatcheries or nurseries. These strains, and others isolated in the study with different characteristics such as benthic growth or high protein levels, could also prove useful feed species for other animal species grown in aquaculture such as abalone and scallops. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The thin Li-ion batteries exhibited excellent discharge performance, long cycle life, and very low swelling under high-temperature storage. A 1.5 M solution of LiBF 4 in an ethylene carbonate (EC)/γ-butyrolactone (GBL) (1:3 by volume) mixed solvent is advantageous for use as the electrolyte in the laminated film bag because of its high flame point of 129°C, high boiling point of 216°C, low vapor pressure, and high conductivity of 2.1 mS/cm at -20°C. The B-MCF anode in the LiBF 4-EC/GBL electrolyte exhibited a high reversible capacity of 345 mAh/g, a high coulombic efficiency of 94% at the first cycle, and high rate capability. It was demonstrated that the thin Li-ion battery with a thickness of 3.6 mm has a high energy density of 172 Wh/kg, high rate capability between 0.2 and 3C rate discharge, a high capacity ratio of 50% at 1C rate discharge and -20°C, and a long cycle life of more than 500 cycles at 1C rate charge-discharge cycling. The B-MCF anode led to the high rate discharge performance and the long cycle life of the thin Li-ion batteries using the LiBF 4-EC/GBL electrolyte. The very low swelling and small evolution of gas under the high-temperature storage at 85°C were attributable to the stability of LiBF 4-EC/GBL electrolyte against the fully charged LiCoO 2 cathode material. © 2001 The Electrochemical Society.

The approximate Vardy-Brown model is more computationally efficient (i.e., requires one-sixth the execution time and much less memory storage) than the exact Vardy-Brown model. Both models are compared with measured data from different research groups and with numerical data produced by a two-dimensional turbulence waterhammer model.

This is not realistic in 'real life'. Numerical simulations with detailed simulation models have been carried out to investigate the influence on the thermal performance of different hot-water consumptions and consumption patterns. Two different small SDHW systems are taken into the calculation, a low-flow system where the heat storage consists of a mantle tank and a high flow system with an internal heat exchanger spiral in the heat storage. Two different domestic hot water (DHW)-load profiles have been taken into the calculation. One of the DHW-load profiles has three draw-offs at equal time, size and duration every day while the other DHW-load profile is a realistic profile for a Danish family where the hot-water consumption and consumption pattern vary from day to day and furthermore weekends and holidays are taken into account in this profile.

For years, intermetallic compounds or single-phase alloys have been studied as hydrogen-absorbing alloys. On the contrary, we have proposed a new approach to the alloy design related to multi-phase. Through this approach, we developed a new BCC alloy consisting of the microstructure that has a large hydrogen capacity and a good desorbing property. The hydrogen storage capacity of the newly developed alloy was over twice as that of conventional alloys. Further, we investigated the activating properties, these also being important for practical use, and we clarified that the activating properties and reaction rate of the BCC alloy were improved by the effect of the coexisting intermetallics phase.

Particular attention and effort were applied to adjusting the observed station precipitation data in order to minimize systematic measurement errors. Various geostatistical methods were applied to interpolate the station data onto a uniform grid. This resulted in datasets of 50-km grid square values for mean monthly temperature and monthly total precipitation for the years 1950 to 1997 inclusive. An independent estimate of basin evapotranspiration was derived using an empirical model (Morton, 1983) to generate similar grid square values of monthly total evapotranspiration for the years 1953 to 1996 inclusive. From the grid square datasets, we computed the mean annual basin temperature (T) to be –3.4°C, the mean annual basin precipitation (P) to be 421 mm and the mean annual basin evapotranspiration (E) to be 277 mm. A simple water balance was applied to test the consistency of the P and E fields with the observed basin discharge (Q). For the 24-year period 1972 to 1995, the mean annual residual (P-E-Q) for the water balance was –28.4 mm. This residual is a combination of errors in the three water balance components and the assumption of zero annual storage. It is within the estimation errors associated with the measurement and analysis methods used. Further analysis on the correlation of Q with the total basin net surface moisture supply (P-E) showed that P and (P-E) are most strongly correlated with Q with a 3-month lag, i.e., a discharge water-year of October–September corresponds best with a (P-E) year of July–June. In examining the seasonal correlation of T and E with Q, we found that summer T was significantly correlated with annual Q but there was no significant correlation between any seasonal E or annual Q. This suggests that although the Morton model estimates of E provided a reasonable magnitude for the long-term annual basin water balance, it cannot be considered reliable for year-to-year or shorter-term estimates of the basin evapotranspiration. In examining the 1994/95 water year, it was found to be the lowest discharge year (October–September) in the observed record. This is consistent with the 3-month lagged climate data year (July–June) which for 1994/95 has the largest (P-E) anomaly; it is also the driest year since 1950 having the warmest summer months on record and the third lowest precipitation on record. To demonstrate a practical application of the climate datasets generated by this study, we constructed a multilinear regression model for annual (October–September) discharge based on annual (July–June) basin precipitation and summer temperature. The resulting linear model estimated the annual discharge remarkably well, explaining 61% of the variance for this period. Using this model we were able to reconstruct an estimate of annual discharge back to 1950. © Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society.",,"evapotranspiration; geostatistics; modeling; precipitation (climatology); water budget; Canada; Mackenzie River Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036020876

The aim of this work was to identify a species-specific freezing protocol for sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) spermatozoa by optimising all the stages in the cryopreservation procedure. In the first stage of the experiments, the cryoprotectants and the relative concentrations that had the least toxic effect on motility at room temperature were selected. The capacity of the selected cryoprotectant substances was then assessed in freezing tests as follows: dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) 5% and 7%, ethylene glycol (EG) 7% and 10%, propylene glycol (PG) 7% and 10%. The cryoprotectant that gave the best results in this second stage of the experiments was EG 10%, and this was then used for the optimisation of the different stages in the freezing procedure: two different times of adaptation to the cryoprotectant were tested (15min and 6h), as well as the effects of adding an energy substrate (1.25mM sodium pyruvate) to assess its possible use as an energy source. Lastly, using the extender (diluent+Na-pyruvate+EG10%) and the adaptation procedure (6h at 0-2°C) that had given the best results in the preceding stages of the experiments, four cooling rates were tested: 10, 12, 15, 24°C/min. It was shown that the semen that was diluted immediately after collection in extender that contained the cryoprotectant (EG 10%), was equilibrated for 6h at 0-2°C and then cooled at a rate of 15°C/min, showed motility on thawing comparable to that of fresh semen (P=0.045). © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

It has an elongated body with slender hind legs that are some 2.5 times longer than the front and middle legs. A male with a body 67mm long and weighing 0.28g can jump 90cm with a take-off angle of 40° and velocity of 2.5ms-1, requiring an energy expenditure of 850μJ. The body is accelerated at 165ms-2 for only 30ms. The larger and heavier females (mean body length 104mm and weighing 1.5g) can jump on average a distance of 49cm. During jumping, the tibiae of the hind legs are extended in 30ms with maximum rotational velocities of 11.5° per ms, but during kicking, when there is no body weight to support, extension is complete in 7ms with rotational velocities as high as 48° per ms. The short time available to accelerate the body indicates that the movements are not powered by direct muscle contractions and that there must be storage of elastic energy in advance. The motor patterns responsible for generating the necessary forces in the hind legs for jumping and kicking are similar and consist of three phases; an initial flexion of the tibia is followed by a co-contraction of the small flexor and large extensor tibiae muscles lasting several hundred milliseconds while the tibia remains fully flexed. Finally, the flexor motor neurons stop spiking so that the tibia is able to extend rapidly. The small semi-lunar processes at the femoro-tibial joints are not distorted, so that they cannot act as energy stores. Some 7% of the energy is stored transiently by bending the thin tibiae during the initial acceleration phase of a jump and releasing it just before take-off. The jumping and kicking mechanisms of Prosarthria teretrirostris have features in common with those used by locusts but also have their own characteristics. The evolution of jumping in Orthoptera is discussed in this context.","False stick insect; Joint mechanics; Locust; Motor neuron; Motor pattern; Prosarthria teretrirostris","Animal; Biomechanics; Evolution; Extremities; Female; Grasshoppers; Male; Motor Neurons; Movement; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Animals; Biomechanics; Evolution; Extremities; Female; Male; Motor Neurons; animal; article; biomechanics; evolution; female; grasshopper; histology; limb; male; motoneuron; movement (physiology); physiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036022038

However, it has several potentially severe consequences, including a range of energetic costs that are believed to result from the depletion of caudal lipid reserves during tail loss. In this study we examined the possible effect of caudal autotomy on the energetic reserves of a small viviparous skink, Niveoscincus metallicus (O'Shaughnessy 1874). Animals of each sex were collected on three occasions to assess the distribution of lipid stores. In addition, the frequency and position of naturally occurring tail breaks were determined. Both abdominal and caudal lipid stores are present in N. metallicus; however, caudal fat bodies comprise the majority (55-78%) of these fat reserves. Temporal variation in fat body mass, both abdominal and caudal, was evident. There was a significant relationship between the two fat stores, which was distorted in pregnant females, when relatively more fat was stored in the tail. Examination of the distribution of caudal fat in the tail revealed that the majority (90-95%) occurs within the proximal third of the tail. The remainder is located in the middle portion of the tail, with no reserves in the most distal tail section. During late pregnancy, females store relatively more fat closer to the body. The frequency of tail loss in a natural population of N. metallicus was extremely high (78%). Tail breaks were normally distributed along the length of the tail (i.e. most near the middle and fewer distal and proximal breaks). Thus there was a relatively high chance of some lipid depletion as a result of tail loss, but because 76% of breaks occur in the middle and distal thirds of the tail, there is a high probability that tail loss results in only minimal (i.e. <10%) lipid depletion. This is the first instance where both the energetic 'value' of the tail and the likelihood of lipid depletion during tail loss have been determined in a lizard. Overall, the combination of the aggregation of caudal fat reserves and position of naturally occurring tail breaks may enable N. metallicus to combine caudal fat storage and tail autotomy with minimal conflict.","Autotomy; Cost of reproduction; Fat body; Niveoscincus metallicus; Predation; Reproduction; Scincidae; Tail loss","antipredator defense; autotomy; fat reserve; lizard; viviparity; Animalia; Niveoscincus metallicus; Scincidae; Squamata; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012467009

Calf ages investigated were 1, 4, 7, and 10 mo. The forage offered for ad libitum access consisted of hay for the calves and of a constant mixture of grass silage, meadow hay, and straw (1:0.7:0.3 on a DM basis) for the cows. Calves of 10 mo of age received an additional 2.6 kg DM/d of crushed barley. The animals were kept in groups of four cows and four calves except in the respiration chambers, where only one cow (tethered) and her calf (loose) were grouped together. Indicator techniques were applied to obtain individual data on feces and urine volumes during group housing. In the Simmental cows, heavier on average by 22 kg, voluntary DMI was higher than in the Angus cows (14.0 vs 12.3 kg/d). In calves, DMI from supplementary feeds was 1.6, 3.9, and 6.3 kg/d, on average, at 4, 7, and 10 mo of age, respectively. Dam breed had no significant effect on DMI and ADG of calves and on BW changes of cows. System retention of energy, N, and P showed a curvilinear development with calf age. System energy expenditure, which lin-early increased with calf age, was higher with Simmental than with Angus dams (11%), even when adjusted for metabolic BW (8%). Energy loss through methane linearly increased with NDF intake and, consequently, with calf age from 18 to 30 MJ/d (446 to 751 L/d) for cows and calves together. Similarly, fecal and urinary N excretion and fecal P excretion steadily increased with calf age. In calves, the easily volatile N percentage of manure N rapidly decreased from very high levels in young calves. The resulting changes in inclination to gaseous N loss during manure storage for 8 wk were more than compensated by alterations in N intake of the calves, resulting in an increased total system N loss with progressing lactation. Overall, the present results indicate a difference between Angus and Simmental in efficiency of nutrient and energy utilization that might be explained by the difference in amount of delivery of nutrients to the calves via milk vs forage. Suggestions are made as to how the emissions of N, P, and methane, which were excessive in relation to productivity, could be reduced by nutritional means. ©2002 American Society of Animal Science.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that high serum concentrations of adiponectin are associated with lower intramyocellular (IMCL) fat content by promoting lipid oxidation in humans. IMCL-content in predominantly non-oxidative tibialis anterior muscle and oxidative soleus was determined by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a cross- sectional study involving 63 healthy volunteers. In a second set of experiments, changes in IMCL in both muscles were measured after a three days dietary lipid challenge (n = 18) and after intravenous lipid challenge (n = 12) with suppressed lipid oxidation under hyperinsulinemia. Adiponectin serum concentrations were found to be negatively correlated with IMCL in the oxidative soleus muscle (IMCL [sol]) (r = - 0.46, p < 0.001) independent of measures of obesity, but not with IMCL in the non-oxidative tibialis anterior muscle (IMCL [tib]) (p = 0.40). Adiponectin serum concentrations. were negatively correlated with the observed increase in IMCL load after dietary lipid challenge in the tibialis (r = 0.53, p = 0.03) but not in the soleus muscle. During suppression of lipid oxidation by hyperinsulinemia, no effect of adiponectin on IMCL was observed in either soleus or tibialis muscle. Overall, the presented findings are consistent with the hypothesis that adiponectin promotes lipid oxidation in humans resulting in lower intracellular lipid content in human muscle. These results are consistent with animal data, where adiponectin could be shown to enhance lipid oxidation and reduce muscle triglycerides.","Adiponectin; Insulin Resistance; Intramyocellular Fat; Obesity; Type 2 Diabetes","adiponectin; insulin; triacylglycerol; adult; article; female; hormone blood level; human; human experiment; human tissue; insulin resistance; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; male; metabolic activation; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; normal human; obesity; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; soleus muscle; tibialis anterior muscle; Adiponectin; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Insulin; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Lipid Mobilization; Lipid Peroxidation; Male; Muscle Cells; Muscle Fibers, Slow-Twitch; Muscle, Skeletal; Proteins; Reference Values; Triglycerides; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036875149

In addition, the pulse-to-pulse and long-term XUV stability of the source can be assessed, as well as the contamination of multilayer XUV optics exposed to the source. This paper describes the full calibration procedure: all optical elements were calibrated at the wavelength of operation by Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt at the storage ring Bessy II, a full analysis of geometrical factors was done, and the influence of the spectral emissivity of the source on the calibration was analyzed in detail. The calibration was performed both for the centroid wavelength as for the full bandwidth of the diagnostic. The total uncertainty in the absolute calibration allowed measurement of source characteristics with an uncertainty of less than 5%, and a shot-to-shot repeatability to less than 2%. The uncertainty was mainly determined by external factors like background gas distribution and spectral source characteristics.

Its melting point of 18.0°C, however, is considered high for cooling application of thermal energy storage. The thermophysical and heat transfer characteristics of the C-L acid with some organic additives are investigated. Compatibility of C-L acid combinations with additives in different proportions and their melting characteristics are analyzed using the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Among the chemical additives, methyl salicylate, eugenol, and cineole presented the relevant melting characteristics. The individual heat transfer behavior and thermal storage performance of 0.1 mole fraction of these additives in the C-L acid mixture are evaluated. The radial and axial temperature distribution during charging and discharging at different concentratations of selected PCM combinations are experimentally determined employing a vertical cylindrical shell and tube heat exchanger. The methyl salicylate in theC-L acid provided the most effective additive in the C-L acid. It demonstrated the least melting band width aimed at lowering the melting point of the C-L acid with the highest heat of fusion value with relatively comparable rate of heat transfer. Furthermore, the thermal performance based on the total amount of transferred energy and their rates, established the PCM's latent heat storage capability. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Herein a more detailed investigation into the effect of sucrose phosphorylase expression on tuber metabolism, in order to understand why storage and growth are impaired is described. (1) Although the activity of the introduced sucrose phosphorylase was low and accounted for less than 10% of that of sucrose synthase its expression led to a decrease in the activities of enzymes of starch synthesis relative to enzymes of glycolysis and relative to total amylolytic activity. (2) Incubation of tuber discs in [14C]glucose revealed that the transformants display a two-fold increase of the unidirectional rate of sucrose breakdown. However this was largely compensated by a large stimulation of sucrose re-synthesis and therefore the net rate of sucrose breakdown was not greatly affected. Despite this fact major shifts in tuber metabolism, including depletion of sucrose to very low levels, higher rates of glycolysis, and larger pools of amino acids were observed in these lines. (3) Expression of sucrose phosphorylase led to a decrease of the cellular ATP/ADP ratio and energy charge in intact growing tubers. It was estimated that at least 30% of the ATP formed during respiration is consumed as a result of the large acceleration of the cycle of sucrose breakdown and re-synthesis in the transformants. Although the absolute rate of starch synthesis in short-term labelling experiments with discs rose, starch synthesis fell relative to other fluxes including respiration, and the overall starch content of the tubers was lower than in wild-type tubers. (4) External supply of amino acids to replace sucrose as an osmoticum led to a feed-back inhibition of glycolysis, but did not restore allocation to starch. (5) However, an external supply of the non-metabolizable sucrose analogue palatinose - but not sucrose itself - stimulated flux to starch in the transformants. (6) The results indicate that the impaired performance of sucrose phosphorylase-expressing tubers is attributable to decreased levels of sucrose and increased energy consumption during sucrose futile cycling, and imply that sucrose degradation via sucrose synthase is important to maintain a relatively large sucrose pool and to minimize the ATP consumption required for normal metabolic function in the wild type.","Energy; Glycolysis; Palatinose; Potato (Solanum tuberosum) starch synthesis; Sucrose degradation; Sucrose phosphorylase; Sucrose synthase; Tuber","metabolite; Solanum; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036787226

However, if high-temperature water is injected into and stored in the aquifer, large-scale natural convection could occur that might reduce the heat recovery rate. This study aims to clarify the universal quantitative condition under which natural convection appears and exerts an observable influence for a system with forced horizontal flow in the saturated porous medium. The authors investigated this using both experiments and computer simulations. A test section simulating an aquifer was made. Warm water was injected into the test section, which was filled with glass beads. The temperature distribution and the flow rate profile at the outlet were measured. The authors found that the limit condition at which natural convection influences the forced horizontal flow can be determined from the velocity profile and modified Rayleigh number Ra*. In addition, the heat transfer coefficients of the upper and the lower side of walls were estimated. A computer simulation was made for calculation of the temperature field and the velocity vector in the porous medium under natural convection and under forced convection. As calculated temperature fields and flow rate distributions at the outlet were similar to the experimental results, it is thought that this program can be applied to evaluation of the temperature and the velocity of aquifer thermal energy storage. In addition, an index expressing the degree of influence of natural convection on forced convection was proposed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Comparison of the all-trans and the 13-cis, 15-syn forms shows a shift in position of about 0.25 Å within the pocket of the protein. Comparing this to the 13-cis, 15-anti chromophore of the catalytic cycle M-intermediate structure, the 13-cis, 15-syn form demonstrates a less pronounced up-tilt of the retinal C12-C14 region, while leaving W182 and T178 essentially unchanged.

Thus, the change of the N-H dipole is considered primarily responsible for energy storage, conformation changes of the protein, and the deprotonation of the Schiff base.

The key components of the system are a rotary desiccant wheel and a solar adsorption collector. The former is used for dehumidification and the later acts as both an adsorption unit and a solar collector. The heating load from sunshine can thus be reduced to a greater extent since the solar adsorption collector is placed on the roof of the grain depot. Compared with the solid adsorption refrigeration system alone, the new hybrid system performs better. Under typical conditions, the coefficient of performance of the system is >0.4 and the outlet temperature is <20°C. It is believed that the system can be used widely in the regions with abundant solar resources due to such advantages as environmental protection, energy saving and low operation costs. Additionally, some parameters, for example, ambient conditions, the effectiveness of the heat exchanger and evaporative cooler, mass air-flow rate, etc., which affect system performance, are also analyzed. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A 13-year mark-recapture study of pythons (Liasis fuscus) in tropical Australia provides extensive data on these topics. Rates of food intake and growth were highest in small pythons, and decreased more rapidly with body size in males than in females. Allocation to storage (as measured by the snake's mass relative to its body length) showed a more complex pattern. Body condition was high at hatching, but dropped rapidly as energy was allocated to growth rather than storage. Condition then increased through juvenile life, was at a maximum close to maturation, and was higher in females than in conspecific males. Body condition thereafter decreased with increasing body length. These allocation 'decisions' reflect the relative advantages of growth versus energy storage at different body sizes. Hatchling snakes grow rapidly (and hence become thin) because greater body size enables the snake to ingest larger prey items. Adult females amass larger energy reserves than males, because they need reserves to produce the clutch. Large snakes become thinner because their feeding rates are low, and they cannot compensate with increased prey size because large-bodied mammalian prey are rare in our study area.","Energy allocation; Liasis fuscus; Life-history; Pythonidae; Snake","body condition; body shape; food intake; growth; resource allocation; snake; Australasia; Australia; Animalia; Liasis fuscus; Mammalia; Pythonidae; Serpentes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038672383

Stabilization/solidification (s/s) is currently used to immobilize heavy metals prior to storage of the solidified material as a heap. Our study aimed at assessing the long-term environmental stability of treated natrojarosite waste in the field situation. Flow-through leaching tests were carried out on monolithic samples in a modified triaxial cell and on crushed samples in packed columns. Tests with monolithic samples simulated natural infiltration through treated material containing few cracks and fractures, whereas, packed column tests were more representative of weathered material. The microstructure of leached and unleached materials was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDX). The results of flow-through leaching tests combined with microscopic characterization and geochemical equilibrium calculations provided valuable insights on the physical and chemical mechanisms influencing the long-term leaching behavior. This information was used to develop a mathematical model for alkalinity depletion in the treated waste. When infiltration of acid rain through the material was considered, the model predicted that the leachate would remain at high pH for many thousands of years in the field. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The aim of this experimental study was to compare the protective efficacy of the cardioplegic solutions Celsior and Custodiol. Canine hearts were examined with regard to energy metabolism and early postischemic recovery after 8 or 12 hours of ischemia at 5°C. Methods. Canine hearts were preserved with Celsior or Custodiol (each n = 19). Five hearts of each group were used to determine myocardial content of energy-rich phosphates immediately after preservation and after 8 and 12 hours of ischemia at 5°C; the remainder were reperfused after 8 and 12 hours of ischemia. Control variables during reperfusion were myocardial content of energy-rich phosphates, myocardial K+ uptake, left ventricular dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin, and incidence of arrhythmias in percentage of heart rate. Results. Custodiol-preserved hearts contained more ATP than Celsior-preserved hearts after 8 and 12 hours of ischemia (8 hours p = ns, 12 hours, p &lt; 0.05). During reperfusion after 8 hours of ischemia, dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin showed the same values for both solutions, after 12 hours values were significantly higher in Custodiol-preserved hearts (p &lt; 0.005). The incidence of reperfusion arrhythmias was higher in hearts of the Celsior group (8 hours p &lt; 0.01, 12 hours p = ns). Myocardial K+ uptake during reperfusion after 8 and 12 hours of ischemia was about twice as high in Celsior-preserved compared to Custodiol-preserved hearts (p &lt; 0.005). Conclusions. In the Langendorff model of the canine heart, cardioplegia with Celsior showed no advantage over cardioplegia with Custodiol. Differences were observed, however, which may be clinically important, especially in the case of long cold-storage times. © 2002 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",,"adenosine triphosphate; celsior; HTK solution; phosphate; potassium ion; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cardioplegia; controlled study; convalescence; energy metabolism; heart arrhythmia; heart muscle; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle metabolism; heart muscle perfusion; heart preservation; heart protection; heart rhythm; isolated heart; nonhuman; potassium transport; priority journal; Animals; Cardioplegic Solutions; Cold; Disaccharides; Dogs; Electrolytes; Energy Metabolism; Glutamates; Glutathione; Heart Arrest, Induced; Histidine; Ischemic Preconditioning, Myocardial; Mannitol; Myocardial Reperfusion; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036327080

In this study, a simple one-dimensional multi-node approach, taking into account of the axial heat conduction between nodes, has been used to theoretically analyze temperature stratification in the thermal storage tank. The results indicate that, for less collector area, the heat removal factor plays a major role in increasing the system performance, than the thermal stratification. Also, an optimum ratio of tank volume over collector area exists for a solar powered absorption air conditioning system.

Recent studies have revealed a remarkable parallel between the regulation of uptake of glucose and fatty acids by muscle, in that each is mediated by sarcolemmal transporters that are recruited from an intracellular storage site. The focus of this review is to describe newly obtained insights on the recruitment of fatty acid transporters and their malfunctioning in diabetes. Recent findings: The major fatty acid transporter involved is fatty acid translocase (CD36). Translocation of this protein to the membrane is triggered by muscle contraction and by insulin, and presumably occurs from distinct intracellular pools. This resembles the well documented exercise and insulin-induced recruitment of glucose transporter-4. Whether another transporter, plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein, is also subject to such recycling is not yet clear. In a rodent model of insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes, the increased rate of muscle fatty acid uptake could be associated with an increased total amount of fatty acid translocase (CD36). In a model of non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes, this increased rate could be associated with a permanent relocalization of fatty acid translocase to the sarcolemma. Summary: These findings indicate a pivotal role for the membrane transporter fatty acid translocase in the exercise and insulin-induced increases of muscle fatty acid uptake and utilization, and suggest that malfunctioning of the cellular recycling of fatty acid translocase is involved in the etiology of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. © 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36); Insulin resistance; Membrane transporter recycling; Plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein; Type 2 diabetic muscle","carrier protein; CD36 antigen; fatty acid; fatty acid binding protein; glucose; glucose transporter 4; insulin; long chain fatty acid; unclassified drug; carrier protein; CD36 antigen; FABP7 protein, human; Fabp7 protein, rat; fatty acid binding protein; insulin; membrane protein; nerve protein; organic anion transporter; tumor protein; tumor suppressor protein; exercise; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid transport; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin resistance; muscle metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; review; sarcolemma; animal; diabetes mellitus; disease model; metabolism; muscle; pathophysiology; physiology; rat; Rodentia; Animals; Antigens, CD36; Carrier Proteins; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease Models, Animal; Exercise; Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins; Fatty Acids; Humans; Insulin; Membrane Glycoproteins; Muscles; Neoplasm Proteins; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Organic Anion Transporters; Rats; Sarcolemma; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036631904

Exercise time to exhaustion was significantly reduced following both AH and PH compared to Cont [AH 47.8 (14.0) min, PH 39.6 (16.0) min, Cont 62.0 (8.8) min; P &lt; 0.05]. During exercise there were no significant differences in oxygen uptake, total sweat loss, mean skin temperature (Tsk) and the thermal gradient (T re-Tsk, where Tre is rectal temperature) following the three conditions. Serum prolactin, plasma catecholamine and plasma free fatty acid concentrations were also similar between all three trials. In contrast, Tre, mean body temperature, heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion were significantly greater during the initial 25 min of exercise following both AH and PH, compared with Cont (P &lt; 0.05). At exhaustion, there were no significant differences in the metabolic and thermoregulatory responses to exercise between the trials. The current findings demonstrate that AH and PH promote a reduction in prolonged submaximal endurance performance under moderate environmental temperatures compared with pre-exercise rest. Such observations appear likely to have been mediated through mechanisms associated with the earlier development of high internal body temperature which resulted in changes in the capacity for heat storage. © Springer-Verlag 2002.","Exhaustion; Heat storage; High internal body temperature","catecholamine; fatty acid; prolactin; adult; article; body temperature; catecholamine blood level; controlled study; environmental temperature; exercise; fatty acid blood level; heart rate; human; human experiment; humidity; male; metabolism; normal human; oxygen consumption; priority journal; prolactin blood level; rectum temperature; skin temperature; sweating; thermoregulation; treadmill exercise; warming; endurance; energy metabolism; exercise test; physiology; temperature; Adult; Body Temperature Regulation; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Exercise Test; Humans; Male; Physical Endurance; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036546732

In order to improve thermodynamic system efficiency, stratification should be promoted much more. To this scope, this article presents a numerical study of transient mixed convection. The study investigates the use of different fluids as a heat storage medium in cylindrical cavities with different aspect ratios. The effect of the fluids is made through the variation of physical properties represented through the Prandtl number. The system consists of a cavity with fluid injection at the top and fluid discharge at the bottom. Transient, two-dimensional, mixed convection flows in a thermal storage tank have been studied using finite volume method. The governing equations are the conservation equations for laminar natural convection flow based on the Boussinesq approximation. Forced convection flow is superimposed through the use of appropriate boundary conditions (inflow and outflow conditions). The study considers three representative fluids i.e. Torada oil, ethylene glycol and water. It considers also cavities with aspect ratios varying from 3 to 1/3. Flow analysis is made through typical transient temperature distributions for the three fluids and for different configurations. The performances of thermal energy storage using these fluids are analyzed through the transient thermal storage efficiency. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To date, little published research is available which identifies how much reclamation has occurred, its timing and the likely environmental implications. This paper addresses these questions on the basis of available cartographic and documentary data on land reclamation in this area. Identification of reclaimed land was based on the 2nd Edition Ordnance Survey of Ireland Map Series of 1924. These maps represent landscape features relating to reclamation, such as embankments, artificial arterial drainage channels and sluices. Using such indicators for the purpose of demarcation, the extent of the lands reclaimed has been mapped. Documentary information on reclamation schemes was acquired from the National Archives files on the Irish Quit Rent Office, including letters, memoranda, draft bills and Government Acts, legal documents and statements of account, and these support and supplement cartographic data. In total, approximately 6,500ha of the Shannon estuary lowlands were reclaimed for agriculture and other purposes. This has significantly altered the morphometric characteristics of the estuary, as embankments and revetments for flood protection have reduced the potential energy dissipation area and the water storage capacity of the estuarine wetlands. Reclamation has resulted in modification of the estuarine physical environment and its hydrodynamics, and altered the character of the wetland habitat in the estuary environs. © 2002 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc.","cartography; drainage; embankments; estuaries; historical evidence; land claim; reclamation; wetlands",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042137561

Lean spayed queens received a diet containing 40 (CL group, n = 7) or 1000 (CH group, n = 4) mg/kg of L-carnitine during obesity development. Plasma fatty acid, β-hydroxybutyrate and carnitine, and liver and muscle carnitine concentrations were measured during experimental induction of FHL and after treatment. In control cats (CL group), fasting and FHL increased the plasma concentrations of fatty acids two- to threefold (P < 0.0001) and β-hydroxybutyrate > 10-fold (from a basal 0.22 ± 0.03 to 1.70 ± 0.73 after 3 wk fasting and 3.13 ± 0.49 mmol/L during FHL). In carnitine-supplemented cats, these variables increased significantly (P < 0.0001) only during FHL (β-hydroxybutyrate, 1.42 ± 0.17 mmol/L). L-Carnitine supplementation significantly increased plasma, muscle and liver carnitine concentrations. Liver carnitine concentration increased dramatically from the obese state to FHL in nonsupplemented cats, but not in supplemented cats, which suggests de novo synthesis of carnitine from endogenous amino acids in control cats and reversible storage in supplemented cats. These results demonstrate the protective effect of a dietary L-carnitine supplement against fasting ketosis during obesity induction. Increasing the L-carnitine level of diets in cats with low energy requirements, such as after neutering, and a high risk of obesity could therefore be recommended.","Carnitine; Cats; Fatty acids; Hepatic lipidosis; β-hydroxybutyrate","3 hydroxybutyric acid; carnitine; fatty acid; animal experiment; article; cat; controlled study; diet supplementation; energy expenditure; fatty acid blood level; high risk population; ketoacidosis; lipidosis; nonhuman; obesity; synthesis; Animalia; Felidae; Felis catus; Trixis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036168292

Elevated serum transthyretin during renal insufficiency is secondary to the lack of retinol-binding protein degradation in renal tubules and to the subsequent increase in the fraction of transthyretin bound to retinol-binding protein. In both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, serum transthyretin was demonstrated to be a reliable marker of nutritional status, exhibiting significant relationships with energy and protein intakes as well as with fat stores and lean body mass. Serum transthyretin levels less than 300 mg/l were shown to be associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients. The predictive value of transthyretin was shown to be independent of serum albumin. Regular measurements of both serum albumin and transthyretin make it possible to detect patients whose prognosis is compromised by malnutrition and in whom an active nutritional therapy must be undertaken. Simultaneous measurements of inflammatory markers such as serum C-reactive protein are required to evaluate the role of inflammation in serum albumin and transthyretin variations. These low-cost protein parameters should be incorporated in the regular assessment of dialysis patients and measured every 1 to 3 months.","Dialysis; Hemodialysis; Malnutrition; Outcome; Protein status; Survival; Trnsthyretin","biological marker; C reactive protein; prealbumin; retinol binding protein; serum albumin; albumin blood level; caloric intake; chronic kidney failure; diet therapy; disease association; hemodialysis patient; human; inflammation; kidney tubule; lean body weight; lipid storage; malnutrition; medical assessment; morbidity; mortality; nutritional status; peritoneal dialysis; plasma protein binding; prediction; priority journal; prognosis; protein blood level; protein degradation; protein intake; protein metabolism; review; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Nutritional Status; Prealbumin; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Renal Dialysis; Serum Albumin",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036919187

The hourly varying solar radiation data are synthesised from the clearness index value for each month. The daily constant wind speed data are synthesised using the Weibull wind speed distribution model, on a monthly basis. Using two different synthetic weather data sets, the effect of number of synthetic days on the system performance estimation is studied. Different sequences of synthetic solar and wind days lead to 36 and 576 combinations for 3- and 4-day months, respectively.

Deamidation is the predominant degradation process in acid solution resulting in a desamido product. The current study examines whether the interaction of insulin with methyl-beta cyclodextrin (metβCD) improves its stability. Hydrolysis of insulin was monitored by an HPLC assay with ultraviolet detection. The stability constant of insulin-metβCD complex was calculated by Lineweaver-Burke linear equation. Furthermore, the complexation of insulin with metβCD was characterized by 1H NMR and Electrospray Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS). MetβCD had a stabilizing effect on insulin degradation according to the kinetic parameters, leading to a decreased chemical deterioration. Furthermore, the stability constant Kst and the activation energy Ea were calculated by fitting the kinetic results to Lineweaver-Burke and to Arrhenius linear equations, respectively. Finally, the complexation of insulin with metβCD was characterized in aqueous media by 1H NMR chemical shift displacements of assignable aromatic protons of specific amino acids upon the addition of the cyclodextrin, as well as by ESI-MS, since additional m/z peaks, which were attributed to insulin-metβCD complex, were detected. It is concluded that addition of metβCD resulted in a significant increase in the stability of complexed insulin compared with free insulin. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The as-deposited film showed a good hydrophilicity (water contact angle below 5°) that deteriorated after long time storage in a dark ambient air (water contact angle of 59°). By UV light irradiation, the film surface recovered its initial hydrophilicity. Atomic force microscopic measurements of tip-sample adhesion force showed homogeneous distribution on the film surface before and after UV light irradiation. We suppose that the OH groups have a strong effect on the film hydrophilicity. Measurements of dark and photo-excited currents suggested that the deposited films have high photo-efficiency and very long lifetime of photo-excited carriers. Hence, we refer to them as hydro-oxygenated amorphous TiOx (a-TiOx:OH) films in analogy with a-Si:H. Furthermore, it was observed that the conductivity of a-TiOx:OH films was sensitive to the surrounding gases, especially to electron-withdrawing oxygen. In ambient air, it is deduced that the photo-excited electrons diffuse toward the film surface and react with oxygen to generate ·O2-.

We set out to determine the reliability of using such samples for genotyping DNA markers in epidemiologic research. A source of DNA extracted from exfoliated nucleated cells in urine is provided by the DOM cohort, in which specimens were collected 15-25 years ago. We have examined the quality of the DNA in 48 of these samples by measuring the amount of DNA isolated and its ability to provide an adequate PCR template for amplicons of different lengths. MTHFR polymorphism was analyzed in 644 specimens to determine the inter- and intraobserver reproducibility. Although the DNA amount was variable, 26 to 89% of the samples, depending both on the length of the PCR amplicon and on PCR conditions, yielded a visible PCR product. The intra- and inter-observer agreements were comparable (κ 0.86 and 0.88, respectively). Our results demonstrate that frozen urine samples can be used for DNA typing studies in women after prolonged periods of storage, but with sometimes unpredictable results. Ultimately, the genotype success rate was 89.3%. Urine collection can be considered as a useful method of obtaining DNA in large cohort studies and other circumstances when blood samples cannot be obtained or have not been stored. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).","DNA isolation; PCR; Storage; Urine","DNA; Energy storage; Blood samples; Cohort studies; DNA isolation; Nucleated cells; Reproducibilities; Urine; Urine collection; Urine sample; Polymerase chain reaction; article; blood sampling; DNA isolation; DNA template; female; frozen section; genetic epidemiology; genotype; human; human cell; observer variation; polymerase chain reaction; population research; priority journal; quantitative assay; reliability; reproducibility; urinalysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18344371822

A small shift of the broadening amorphous peak due to Zr additions was observed. The equilibrium hydriding pressure increased continuously with hydrogen contents in the amorphous alloys, while there was an obvious plateau pressure of 10-4 MPa in the crystalline Mg2Ni phase. The Zr addition lowered the equilibrium hydriding pressure and increased the hydrogen solubility from 1.4 wt% for Mg-Ni to 2.2 wt% for Mg-Ni-Zr. Accompanied by amorphization, the hydrogen discharge capacity increased largely, and reached 580 mA h/g for Mg-Ni-Zr alloy. The chronopotentiometric experiments were performed to investigate the hydrogen diffusion in the alloy powder in the high over-potential range. The diffusivity of hydrogen in the Zr-contained alloy was lower than the Mg-Ni binary amorphous alloy or in Mg2Ni nanocrystalline alloy. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Amorphous alloys; Electrode properties; Hydrogen storage","Diffusion; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Hydrogen; Magnesium alloys; Mechanical alloying; Pressure effects; Solubility; Zirconium; Chronopotentiometric experiments; Electrochemical hydriding; Amorphous alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036525690

In agri chains, a product can be characterised by two types of states, namely appearance and quality states. Appearance states are influenced by handling actions. Quality states are influenced by processing, transportation and storage actions. The concept of chain optimisation by DP is elaborated. Chain optimisation refers to the construction of optimal routes defining which actors in the chain should perform which actions at which process conditions at minimum integral costs. Models describing quality development of a product as a function of the process conditions can be included into the DP methodology.

A parallel study by transmission electron microscopy further confirmed the increase in cellular lipid content, as evidenced by the accumulation of lipid droplets within diatom cells. A slight increase in carbohydrate (+37.8%) and decrease in chlorophyll a (-20.4%) and total chlorophyll c (-14.4%) were also found at 6.0 mg l-1 2,4-DCP. Although 2,4-DCP is known to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, our results show that energy production was not significantly inhibited at sublethal concentrations of 2,4-DCP. The observed growth inhibition in S. costatum caused by 2,4-DCP was associated with an increase in energy storage and inhibition of protein synthesis, as indicated by a reduction in RNA/DNA ratio. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In most of the cases the final storage product is a SiO 2 gel. Accumulation inside the cells presumes a membrane and cytoplasm passage, driven by unknown transporters. Beside this uptake into the cytoplasm, Si-accumulating species possess a mechanism that does not involve a membrane and cytoplasm passage. Unusual small invaginations comprising the two membranes, plasmalemma and tonoplast, which enclose a small border of cytoplasm, were observed. The same cells contained vacuolar vesicles surrounded by two membranes, obviously derived from the invaginations. By energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and electron spectroscopic imaging, Si was shown in the invaginations and vacuolar vesicles. This novel endocytotic process allows the uptake of condensed, higher-molecular-weight Si compounds. In Zn hyperaccumulators, frequently SiO 2 precipitates were found in different cell compartments. Such plants showed the same invaginations and vacuolar vesicles, but Zn, colocalized with Si, was detected in these structures. Electron energy loss spectra confirmed the assumption that Zn-silicate is present in the vesicles. In the vacuoles the unstable Zn-silicate is degraded, forming SiO 2 precipitates, while the released Zn is bound to an unknown partner.","Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Electron spectroscopic imaging; Nicotiana tabacum; Silene vulgaris; Silicon; Zinc","Embryophyta; Nicotiana; Nicotiana tabacum; Silene; Silene vulgaris; silicon; zinc; article; cell organelle; cell vacuole; cytoplasm vesicle; electron microscopy; endocytosis; intracellular membrane; metabolism; physiology; plant; spectroscopy; ultrastructure; Cytoplasmic Vesicles; Endocytosis; Intracellular Membranes; Microscopy, Electron; Organelles; Plants; Silicon; Spectrum Analysis; Vacuoles; Zinc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036807936

The total power system consists of a SOFC-HE power generation unit, a power storage (battery) system, a power management system and electric motors at the wheels. The sizes of the HE and the SOFC stack are to be matched by the start-up requirements. The use of micro tubes allows a very high power density of the stack. The thermodynamic calculation of the cycle gives the actual design values for the study and indicates further steps for system optimisation. The first SOFC-GT layout lead to an electric efficiency of 45% for the cycle used as a base for a design study [The Design of Stationary and Mobile SOFC-GT Systems, UECT, 2001]. The design study shows that the space available in a mid-class car allows the integration of such a system including space reserves. A further improvement of the system might allow an electric efficiency of more than 55%. The integration of a Stirling engine instead of the microturbine is a second possibility and the object of an ongoing study. This was motivated by interesting results from the development of solar powered Stirling engines. Generally, the analyses show that the optimal match of the SOFC and the HE will be a key issue for any engineering solution. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Our tests were performed on a device of the APEX family manufactured by Altera Corporation, featuring a SRAM-based configuration memory. The test methodology was based on the implementation of four shift registers (SRs), two of them using the triple-modular-redundant (TMR) technique. The functionality of this circuit was continuously checked during irradiation and every detected error was logged and time-stamped by a control system. Very few single event upsets have been detected in the SRs. On the contrary, we have recorded a large number of single event functional interrupts (SEFIs). SEFIs were induced by SEUs in the SRAM configuration memory. We observed a constant increase of the supply current during irradiation but this effect was not due to single event latch-ups, but to progressive SEU-induced driver contentions or cumulative micro latch-ups. The configuration memory cross section has been calculated from SEFI cross section. © 2002 IEEE.","Circuit testing; Control systems; Energy exchange; Error correction; Field programmable gate arrays; Ion beams; Manufacturing; Performance evaluation; Shift registers; Single event upset","Computer control systems; Control systems; Digital storage; Energy transfer; Error correction; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Flash memory; Heavy ions; Ion beams; Ion bombardment; Ion exchange; Irradiation; Logic gates; Manufacture; Radiation; Radiation hardening; Shift registers; Signal receivers; Static random access storage; Circuit testing; Configuration memory; Energy exchanges; Linear energy transfer; Performance evaluation; Single event effects; Single event upsets; Triple modular redundant; Radiation effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948768331

The increased relative intensities of the spectral satellites connected with ensembles of Nd ions in near-lattice sites at high Nd concentrations CNd is consistent with the predictions of the statistics of the random placement of these ions at the available lattice sites. The room-temperature transmission spectra show that the resonant pump in the emitting level 4F3/2, including the hot-band pump Z 2 → R1 and Z3 → R2, can be efficient at high CNd, with important effects in the reduction of the pump quantum defect and of the corresponding heat generation under the pump. The accelerated 4F3/2 emission decay at high C Nd is consistent with the increased efficiency of the energy transfer, including the contribution of migration-assisted transfer processes. The calculated emission quantum efficiency η and the figure of merit ηCNd indicate that the concentrated Nd:YAG components can be used for construction of efficient solid-state lasers in free-generation or low-storage regimes, and, coupled with the hot-band resonant pump in the emitting level, they could enable the scaling of Nd:YAG lasers to high powers. © 2002 Optical Society of America.",,"Ceramic materials; Crystals; Energy transfer; Light emission; Optical resolving power; Spectroscopic analysis; Thermal effects; Emission decay; Neodymium lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042248037

This study undertook effluent exposures of 2+ age rainbow trout that were approximately halfway through gonadal growth. Trout were exposed to a mixed thermomechanical/bleached kraft effluent in 12,000-L flow-through exposure tanks at an environmental research facility located at a pulp and paper mill in Kawerau, New Zealand. Trout were exposed to either upstream river water or 10% effluent in upstream river water and were maintained at a ration of 0.7% of body wet weight during the experiment. Results of the 2-month study indicated that trout survival was not significantly different between effluent-exposed tanks and reference tanks. There was extensive growth during the exposure but no differences were found due to effluent exposure. Gonadal development was not significantly different between treatments. Steroid hormone concentrations in males and females were not affected by effluent exposure. The effluent showed no potential to be estrogenic as indicated by a lack of vitellogenin induction in male trout. Other physiological indicators of energy storage and utilization also showed no significant differences. Modest induction of hepatic 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (2.5-fold) was the only detectable biological effect of the exposure. Biliary concentration of effluent-related compounds were typical of pulp mill effluent exposure and further suggested that the source of phytosterols was in fact dietary and not effluent-derived. © 2002 Elsevier Science.","BKME; Fish; Growth; Pulp and paper; Reproduction","phytosterol; river water; steroid hormone; vitellogenin; effluent; pollution effect; pulp and paper industry; reproduction; salmonid; article; controlled study; energy resource; environmental exposure; gonad development; New Zealand; nonhuman; paper industry; pulp processing; reproduction; stream (river); survival; trout; water contamination; water pollutant; Kawerau; New Zealand; North Island; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmonidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036151914

Indeed, reducing the layer of the scintillator improved considerably the spatial resolution while keeping a reasonable efficiency. Furthermore, a neutron velocity selector was temporarily added to the setup to perform radiography and tomography experiments with monochromatic neutron beams. Basic properties of transmitted beams were studied to assess the applicability of this device in neutron imaging. Of interest was the enhancement of the L/D-ratio by selecting neutron beams of short wavelengths.

The impurities considered were nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide in concentration of 0.53%, 0.43% and 1.96%, respectively. Each experiment consisted in performing 10 absorption/desorption cycles in pure hydrogen, switch to impure hydrogen for 50 cycles (only 10 cycles in the case of CO2) and then back to pure hydrogen for 10 cycles to verify the recovery of the absorption characteristics. In the case of nitrogen contamination, 50 cycles resulted in a loss of hydrogen capacity of about 20% and a reduction of hydrogen sorption kinetics. The loss of capacity was not recovered after cycling under pure hydrogen but the hydrogen sorption kinetics reverted back to their original values. Cycling 50 times under oxygen contaminated hydrogen produced a permanent loss of hydrogen capacity of 45% but had no effect on sorption kinetics. For CO2 contaminant, only 10 cycles resulted in a total loss of capacity.

In 75 patients referred for thoracic CT, digital chest radiographs were randomly obtained with either SPT at a standard dose (speed class S400, n=25), standard-dose FDT (S400, n=25) or FDT at a low dose (S800, n=25). Five radiologists evaluated the visibility of eight pulmonary and mediastinal anatomical structures using a five-point rating scale. To determine statistically significant differences between the three groups, the Mann-Whitney U-test was employed. No statistically significant differences were found in the depiction of eight criteria between SPT and standard-dose or low-dose FDT chest radiographs. The performance of FDT S400 was equal to SPT for most criteria and better for retrocardiac structures and soft tissue. FDT S800 was inferior to both SPT and FDT S400. Standard-dose FDT is equivalent to SPT in the depiction of relevant anatomical structures of the chest. Our results also indicate that a dose reduction of 50% with FDT may result in small but not significant decrease of image quality.","Comparative studies; Digital radiography; Flat-panel detector radiography; Storage-phosphor radiography; Thorax anatomy","cesium; phosphorus; silicon; cesium iodide; iodide; adult; aged; article; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; digital radiography; drug dose reduction; female; human; image quality; intermethod comparison; low energy radiation; major clinical study; male; medical technology; patient referral; priority journal; radiologist; rank sum test; scoring system; statistical significance; thorax radiography; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; image quality; methodology; middle aged; randomized controlled trial; X ray film; Cesium; Female; Humans; Iodides; Male; Middle Aged; Phosphorus; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Radiography, Thoracic; X-Ray Intensifying Screens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043244882

Various scenarios are being accessed for energy and water conservation in office buildings. The proposed retrofit actions focus in the areas of space heating and cooling, artificial and natural lighting, service hot water, office equipment, elevators and sanitary water. The resulting conservation and related costs are taken into account in order to help the auditor classify the retrofit actions for an audited building. The TOBUS methodology and tools have been implemented to study four Hellenic office buildings and two from Denmark in order to demonstrate the applicability of the overall approach. Energy conservation in Hellenic and Danish buildings range for space heating from 5 to 71 and 0.5 to 6%, for space cooling from 1 to 38 and 4 to 20%, for artificial lighting from 40 to 53 and 26 to 62%, for office equipment from 13 to 62 and 13 to 87% and for elevators at 35 and 23%, respectively.

A DSP is used to implement the power feedback control, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and unfalsified control for the PV system. A MPPT control with duty ratio versus PV module output power has been developed. The major difference between the proposed MPPT control and other methods is that the PV module output power is used to adjust the ratio of power converter. The proposed system has excellent tracking performance and high conversion efficiency. In this paper, parameter tuning and adaptation of real-time PI controller is accomplished based on unfalsified control theory. A plant model is not necessary with the proposed control law, and the selection of PI gain is possible by using measured data. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate excellent performance and robustness under atmospheric variations. © 2002 IEEE.","DSP; MPPT; PV module; unfalsified control","Control theory; Digital storage; Maximum power point trackers; Photovoltaic cells; Atmospheric variations; Direct power control; High conversion efficiency; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Photovoltaic energy; PV modules; Tracking performance; Unfalsified control; Power control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961725741

Metabolisable energy in experimental diets based on safflower oil, soybean oil or beef tallow was measured strictly (experiment 1). Male Wistar rats were then meal-fed an isoenergetic diet for 8 weeks (experiment 2). Each group of rats showed the same weight gain during the 8-week experimental period. Carcass fat content was greater in rats fed the beef tallow diet than in those fed the with the safflower or soybean oil diets, whereas the weight of abdominal adipose tissue was the same for all three dietary groups. Gene expression of UCP1 and the UCP content of the interscapular brown adipose tissue was lower in the beef tallow diet group than in the other dietary groups. A negative correlation was observed between carcass fat content and n-6 unsaturated fatty acid content in dietary fats. These results suggest that the greater body fat accumulation in rats fed the beef tallow diet results from lower expression of UCP1 mRNA and lower UCP content in brown adipose tissue. n-6 Polyunsaturated fatty acids may be the most effective fatty acids in limiting body fat.","Body fat; High-fat diet; Metabolisable energy; Rat; Uncoupling protein","fat; messenger RNA; polyunsaturated fatty acid; safflower oil; soybean oil; uncoupling protein; uncoupling protein 1; carrier protein; edible oil; fat; ion channel; membrane protein; mitochondrial protein; mitochondrial uncoupling protein; safflower oil; soybean oil; abdomen; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; beef cattle; body fat; brown adipose tissue; carcass; controlled study; correlation analysis; diet; energy metabolism; fat content; fat intake; feeding; gene expression; lipid storage; male; meal; nonhuman; rat; weight gain; adipose tissue; animal; body composition; brown adipose tissue; comparative study; drug effect; fat intake; metabolism; tallow; weight gain; Wistar rat; Animalia; Bos taurus; Carthamus tinctorius; Glycine max; Rattus norvegicus; Adipose Tissue; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Animals; Body Composition; Carrier Proteins; Dietary Fats; Dietary Fats, Unsaturated; Fats; Gene Expression; Ion Channels; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mitochondrial Proteins; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Safflower Oil; Soybean Oil; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842870031

If a CAM search can consume less than twice the energy of reading a tag RAM, it would probably be the preferred option for low-power applications. Based on memory traces - which usually cause tag mismatch within the lower four bits - a new serial CAM organisation is proposed which consumes just 45% more than a single tag RAM read and is only 25% slower than the conventional, parallel CAM. Furthermore, it can optionally be operated as a parallel CAM, at no speed penalty, and still reduce energy consumption.","Asynchronous circuits; Cache design; CAM; Low energy; Low power; VLSI","Cache memory; Computer architecture; Data structures; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Random access storage; Response time (computer systems); VLSI circuits; Asynchronous circuits; Cache blocks; Associative storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036949406

Irrespective of the efforts invested by researchers and companies, few products have reached a minimum level of effectiveness, and even fewer are available in medical practice. As a consequence of anti-obesity research, our knowledge of the bodyweight control system increased but, despite this, the pharmacological approaches to the treatment of obesity have not resulted yet in effective drugs. This review provides a panoramic of the multiple different approaches developed to obtain workable drugs. These approaches, however, rely in only four main lines of action: i) control of energy intake, mainly through modification of appetite; ii) control of energy expenditure, essentially through the increase of thermogenesis; iii) control of the availability of substrates to cells and tissues through hormonal and other metabolic factors controlling the fate of the available energy substrates; and iv) control of fat reserves through modulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis in white adipose tissue. A large proportion of current research is centred on neuropeptidic control of appetite, followed by the development of drugs controlling thermogenic mechanisms and analysis of the factors controlling adipocyte growth and fat storage. The adipocyte is also a fundamental source of metabolic signals, signals that can be intercepted, modulated and used to force the brain to adjust the mass of fat with the physiological means available. The large variety of different approaches used in the search for effective anti-obesity drugs show both the deep involvement of researchers on this field and the large amount of resources devoted to this problem by pharmaceutical companies. Future trends in anti-obesity drug research follow closely the approaches outlined; however, the increasing mass of information on the molecular basis of bodyweight control and obesity will in the end prevail in our search for effective and harmless anti-obesity drugs.",,"1 (2 cyanoethyl) 1,2,3,6 tetrahydro 4 (3 trifluoromethylphenyl)pyridine; 11 amino 8 chlorobenzo[b]bicyclo[3.3.1]nona 3,6a(10a) diene; 2 (6 chloro 5 fluoro 1 indolyl) 1 methylethylamine; 2 phenyl 5h pyrazolo[4,3 c]quinolin 3 one; 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 7,8 dihydroxy 1 phenyl 1h 3 benzazepine; 3 (3,4 dihydroxyphenyl) 2 [3 (4 fluorophenyl)propylamino] 3 hydroxypropionic acid pyrrolidine amide; 3 allyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1 phenyl 1h 3 benzazepine 7,8 diol; 3 allyl 6 chloro 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 7,8 dihydroxy 1 phenyl 1h 3 benzazepine; 4 (3 tert butylamino 2 hydroxypropoxy) 2 benzimidazolone; 4 [(4 bromo 2 cyanophenyl)carbamoyl]benzylphosphonic acid diethyl ester; 4 [2 [(2 hydroxy 2 phenylethyl)amino]ethoxy]phenylacetic acid; 4 [2 [(2 hydroxy 2 phenylethyl)amino]propyl]benzoic acid; 4 [2 [(2 hydroxy 2 phenylethyl)amino]propyl]benzoic acid methyl ester hydrogen maleate; 4 [2 [(2 hydroxy 3 phenoxypropyl)amino]ethoxy] n (2 methoxyethyl)phenoxyacetamide; 4 [2 [[2 (3 chlorophenyl) 2 hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]phenoxyacetic acid; 4 [2 [[2 (3 chlorophenyl) 2 hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]phenoxyacetic acid methyl ester; 4 amino 1 (6 bromo 2 pyridyl)piperidine; 4 amino 1 (6 chloro 2 pyridyl)piperidine; 5 [2 [[2 (3 chlorophenyl) 2 hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl] 1,3 benzodioxole 2,2 dicarboxylic acid; 5 methoxy 3 (1,2,3,6 tetrahydro 4 pyridyl) 1h indole; 5 propoxy 3 (1,2,5,6 tetrahydro 4 pyridyl)pyrrolo[3,2 b]pyridine; 6 [1 (5,6,7,8 tetrahydro 3,5,5,8,8 pentamethyl 2 naphthyl)cyclopropyl]nicotinic acid; 6 chloro 2 (1 piperazinyl)pyrazine; [[7 [[2 (3 chlorophenyl) 2 hydroxyethyl]amino] 5,6,7,8 tetrahydro 2 naphthyl]oxy]acetic acid ethyl ester; a 71375; acarbose; adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; AJ 9677; anorexigenic agent; antiobesity agent; aod 9401; arl 14294; arl 15849; bay 1442; bay d 7791; bay e 4609; bay n 2920; bay n 4605; bms 187257; bms 187413; bts 54254; c 7; c 75; calcitonin; ccp 71683a; cgs 10686b; cholecystokinin octapeptide[26 n acetylaspartic acid 28,31 norleucine]; chorionic gonadotropin; cp 114271; cp 331679; cyclohexyl[4 [2 [2 hydroxy 3 (4 hydroxyphenoxy)propylamino]ethyl]phenoxymethyl]phosphinic acid; cytokine; fr 149175; fr 165914; GABAergic receptor affecting agent; gi 264879a; glucocorticoid; gr 231118; ibutamoren; indalpine; indorenate; insulin; j 104870; j 11584; jcf 104; l 101; l 742791; l 749372; l 750355; l 755507; lep 116130; lg 100324; lg 100641; litoxetine; ly 377897; m 40; mazindol; mifepristone; miglitol; mpv 1743; msi 1436; n [1 [4 [[[[4 [(dimethylamino)methyl]cyclohexyl]methyl]amino]iminomethyl]benzyl] 2 oxo 2 (1 pyrrolidinyl)ethyl] alpha [(2 naphthalenylsulfonyl)amino]benzenepropanamide; n [4 [2 [[2 hydroxy 3 (4 hydroxyphenoxy)propyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]benzenesulfonamide; n methyl beta carboline 3 carboxamide; n tert butyloxycarbonyltryptophyl[nepsilon (2 methylphenylaminocarbonyl)lysyl]aspartyl n methylphenylalaninamide; n2 diphenylacetyl n (4 ureidomethylbenzyl)argininamide; nalpha (diphenylacetyl) n (4 hydroxybenzyl) dextro argininamide; neuropeptide; nt 69l; oxytocin; pd 160170; peptide; quinpirole; r 128q; rimonabant; ro 168714; ro 220645; ro 274680; ro 402148; ro 600332; rotigotine; satietin; sb 206606; serotonin agonist; somatostatin; sr 120562a; sr 59062a; steroid hormone; tetrahydrolipstatin; thionisoxetine; thyroid hormone; trg 2405252; ultg 307; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein; unindexed drug; vasopressin; voglibose; adipocyte; appetite; body weight; caloric intake; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; energy expenditure; hormonal regulation; incidence; lipogenesis; lipolysis; obesity; review; thermogenesis; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Appetite; Appetite Depressants; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Intestinal Absorption; Nutrition Physiology; Obesity; Thermogenesis; Weight Loss; Oxy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036234267

In recent years, one line of research has been the analysis of ammonia synthesis reactors. A two-dimensional numerical reactor model was previously validated with experimental results and was used in this study to compare maximum thermal output with maximum energy output of the reactor investigated. The generic concept of exergy analysis is explained and some thermodynamic background is given. This study shows that a different set of 'optimum' reactor conditions results if optimized for maximum energy output rather than maximum thermal output. Exergy analysis proved to be a useful technique for gathering information about the energy system investigated that would with an energy analysis purely based on first-law analysis not have been accomplished.

It is the fastest growing power source in the world, the technology is being developed rapidly and wind power is supplying significant shares of the energy in large regions. The integration of wind power in the power system is therefore now an issue in order to optimise the utilisation of the resource and in order to continue the high rate of installation of generating capacity, which is necessary in order to achieve the goals of sustainability and security of supply. This development of the wind power from just being a negative load to have power plant like features of course also bring with it large challenges. These challenges include connection of wind farms to weak grids, securing power quality, reduction or elimination of power fluctuations, prediction of power output and changes in operating strategies of conventional power plants. Many of these challenges can be faced by the application of power electronics in wind turbines or in wind farms, but many of them will also require other technologies to be developed such as fuel cells and energy storage. The key issues for success is the utilisation of power electronics and information technology.

PSi was prepared using electrochemical etching of n-type silicon in HF-ethanol solution. Porous areas were defined by a double-sided illumination arrangement: front-side porous areas were masked by a stencil mask, eliminating the need for standard photolithography, and backside illumination was used for the backside ohmic contact. Backside illumination improved the uniformity of the porosified areas. Porosification conditions, surface derivatizations and storage conditions were explored to optimize pSi area, pore size and pore depth. Chemical derivatization of the pSi surfaces improved the DIOS-MS performance providing better ionization efficiency and signal stability with lower laser energy. Droplet spreading and drying patterns on pSi were also examined. Pore sizes of 50-200 nm were found to be optimal for droplet evaporation and pore filling with the sample liquid, as measured by DIOS efficiency. With DIOS, significantly better detection sensitivity was obtained (e.g. 150 fmol for midazolam) than with desorption ionization from a standard MALDI steel plate without matrix addition (30 pmol for midazolam). Also the noise that disturbs the detection of low-molecular weight compounds at m/z < 500 with MALDI could be clearly reduced with DIOS. Low background MS spectra and good detection sensitivity at the 100-150 fmol level for pharmaceutical compounds were achieved with DIOS-MS.",,"silicon; article; desorption ionization on silicon mass spectrometry; drug industry; electrochemical analysis; illumination; ionization; mass spectrometry; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; molecular stability; molecular weight; porosity; priority journal; storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141886247

A maximum faradic efficiency of methane was 71.8% in LiClO4/methanol-based electrolyte at -3.0 V versus Ag/AgCl saturated KCl. In the lithium salts/methanol-based electrolyte system, except for the case of acetate, the efficiency of hydrogen formation, being a competitive reaction against CO2 reduction, was depressed below 12%.

Our results indicate that, despite its low proportion, carbon addition has a major deleterious effect on the electrode performance, i.e. the initial discharge capacity decreases exponentially from 522 to 332 mA h g-1 with carbon content increasing from 0 to 3.5 wt.%. This exponential decay cannot be only explained by a decrease in the H solubility due to the dissolution of C atoms in the hydrogen interstitial sites. The cycle life of the electrode is not influenced by the carbon content. The particle morphology and the amorphous structure of the material are unmodified by the carbon addition. In addition, our results indicate that the hydrogen diffusivity in MgNi is unchanged by carbon addition (DH/a2 = 3.2 × 10-5 s-1). In contrast, the exchange current density Io decreases from 92 to 62 mA g-1 with increasing carbon content in the alloy. This results indicate that carbon limits the charge-transfer reaction at the surface of the alloy, which must have an influence on the initial discharge capacity of the alloy. In addition, the electrochemical PCT curves reveal that the slopes of the isotherms become steep with C addition indicating a wider distribution of energy levels for hydrogen. This is considered as the major reason for the observed decrease in the initial discharge capacity of the MgNiCx alloys with increasing x. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This ligandin function has implicated GSTs in numerous ligand-uptake, -transport and -storage processes. The binding of non-substrate ligands to GSTs can inhibit catalysis. In the present study, the energetics of the binding of the non-substrate ligand 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulphonate (ANS) to wild-type human class Alpha GST with two type-1 subunits (hGSTA1-1) and its ΔPhe-222 deletion mutant were studied by isothermal titration calorimetry. The stoichiometry of binding to both proteins is one ANS molecule per GST subunit with a greater affinity for the wild-type (Kd = 65 μM) than for the ΔPhe-222 mutant (Kd = 105 μM). ANS binding to the wild-type protein is enthalpically driven and it is characterized by a large negative heat-capacity change, ΔCp. The negative ΔCp value for ANS binding indicates a specific interface with a significant hydrophobic component in the protein-ligand complex. The negatively charged sulphonate group of the anionic ligand is apparently not a major determinant of its binding. Phe-222 contributes to the binding affinity for ANS and the hydrophobicity of the binding site.","ANS; Isothermal titration calorimetry","Enzymes; Hydrophobicity; Physiology; Stoichiometry; Thermodynamics; Binding site; Biochemistry; glutathione transferase; ligandin; article; calorimetry; catalysis; conformational transition; crystallography; energy transfer; enzyme active site; enzyme substrate; hydrophobicity; ligand binding; nonhuman; priority journal; stoichiometry; thermodynamics; titrimetry; Anilino Naphthalenesulfonates; Anions; Binding Sites; Calorimetry; Energy Metabolism; Glutathione Transferase; Humans; Isoenzymes; Ligands; Phenylalanine; Protein Subunits; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Deletion; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037090701

Benn.) turions (overwintering buds) elongate in anaerobic conditions, whereas there is almost no elongation in air. The anaerobic elongation was accompanied by a decrease in dry weights of stem segments, mainly due to consumption of storage starch in the amyloplasts of stem cells. On the other hand, total contents of amino acids increased in stem segments, in which contents of alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine increased, but contents of asparatic acid decreased. Moreover, contents of lactate in stem tissues increased at an early stage of anaerobic incubation. In tracer experiments with 14C-glucose, 14C incorporation into stem tissues in anoxia was only half of that in normoxia. However, conversion of 14C to ethanol occurred exclusively in anoxia. 14C-labelled metabolites were analysed by two-dimensional cellulose thin-layer chromatography. 14C incorporation into sucrose and alanine was significantly increased in anoxia. The activity of alanine aminotransferase was enhanced by anoxia, suggesting that pyruvate is a precursor of alanine synthesis. The results suggest that pond-weed turions produce energy necessary for anaerobic elongation by activating conversion of storage starch in the amyloplasts to ethanol, alanine and lactate.","Alanine; Amyloplast; Anoxia; Elongation; Ethanol; Fermentation; Glycolysis; Lactate; Potamogeton distinctus A.

The problem for any scavenger inhabiting the seafloor is the unpredictability both in space and time of food fall events. It is generally accepted that chemoreception is one of the major means by which marine organisms detect food sources. Another major source of potential information, however, may come from hydroacoustic stimuli, which have long-range penetration. Such hydroacoustic stimuli will either arise when a large carcass hits and impacts the seafloor or during food consumption of scavengers producing feeding noises. The intensity and transmission characteristics depend upon sediment properties, size, weight and composition of the carcass as well as on size and mouthpart morphology of feeding individuals. In this study the relevance of hydroacoustic stimuli for food fall detection has been investigated in the pandalid shrimp Pandalus borealis Krøyer, 1838. The sensitivity of P. borealis to particle displacement amplitude was found to be close to values measured in other crustaceans. Based on 228 single experiments carried out with five specimens, our results indicate that low-frequency noises may be helpful in detecting food fall events but only in the near-field. In this paper we suggest that the impact of a sinking carcass at the seafloor is a likely source producing elastic waves at the water - seafloor interface. Based on both empirical findings and general theoretical calculations of elastic waves originating from a sinking object hitting the seafloor we conclude that such ""micro seismic events"" may allow resting scavengers even several hundred metres away to detect a food source. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The coexisting complications of fluid overload and ascites may mask the severity of malnutrition, particularly in the early stages of its development. During periods of decompensation, protein and energy requirements are higher, and many patients have inadequate nutritional intake at these times. Further, protein supplementation should not be restricted ad hoc in cirrhotic patients, as for the vast majority of patients dietary protein does not precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. The impairment of hepatic glycogen storage in cirrhotic patients effects a state of accelerated starvation with catabolism of fat and protein to provide substrates for gluconeogenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of nocturnal nutritional supplements in improving nitrogen balance. Resistance to the actions of the anabolic growth factors insulin and growth hormone (GH) is common in cirrhosis, and recent studies have shown that GH resistance, in particular, may be overcome with exogenous GH therapy. Hypermetabolism may be observed in up to one-third of cirrhotic patients. The recent exciting observation that beta-blocker therapy can decrease energy expenditure and catecholamine levels in these patients indicates the need for further intervention studies of beta-blockers as metabolic therapy in cirrhosis. © 2002 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Body cell mass; Cirrhosis; End-stage liver disease; Liver transplantation; Malnutrition; Metabolic bone disease; Nutritional assessment","beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; catecholamine; glycogen; growth factor; growth hormone; insulin; M protein; alcohol liver disease; ascites; bone disease; catabolism; comorbidity; conference paper; diet supplementation; dietary intake; disease course; disease severity; energy; gluconeogenesis; glycogen storage disease; growth hormone deficiency; heart failure; hepatic encephalopathy; human; hypermetabolism; hypervolemia; liver disease; liver fibrosis; malnutrition; nitrogen balance; nutritional requirement; nutritional support; priority journal; prognosis; protein degradation; starvation; supplementation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036097133

It is not known whether uncoupling proteins (UCP), which are modulators of energy balance and metabolism, play a role in these actions of CLA. To determine the effects of dietary CLA on the expression of UCP in various tissues, 5-wk-old Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BI/6 mice were fed diets containing 1% CLA for 3 wk. CLA treatment reduced adipose depot weights in both rats and mice but had no significant effects on body weight. There was a species-specific effect of CLA on the expression of UCP. Whereas CLA did not affect the expression of UCP in most tissues in rats, mice fed CLA had increased expression of UCP2 in the mammary gland, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and white adipose tissue (WAT). Furthermore, UCP1 and UCP3 mRNA and protein levels in BAT were significantly lower in CLA-fed mice compared to controls. Skeletal muscle UCP3 mRNA was unchanged, but UCP3 protein levels were significantly increased in mice, suggesting translational or posttranslational regulation of this protein. Results from this study suggest that alterations in the expression of UCP in mice may be related to the previously reported effects of dietary CLA in lowering adiposity and increasing FA oxidation. In rats, however, induction of UCP is not likely to be responsible for fat reduction or for the inhibitory action of CLA on mammary carcinogenesis.",,"Fatty acids; Metabolism; Oxidation; Proteins; RNA; Tumors; Adiposity; Lipids; linoleic acid; messenger RNA; uncoupling protein; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; body weight; breast cancer; breast carcinogenesis; brown adipose tissue; cancer risk; controlled study; fat intake; fatty acid oxidation; lipid storage; mammary gland; mouse; mouse strain; nonhuman; protein expression; protein processing; rat; rat strain; risk factor; species difference; tissue level; white adipose tissue; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Animals; Blotting, Northern; Blotting, Western; Carrier Proteins; Dietary Fats; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Ion Channels; Linoleic Acids, Conjugated; Liver; Male; Mammary Glands, Animal; Membrane Transport Proteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mitochondrial Proteins; Muscles; Organ Size; Proteins; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; RNA, Messenger; Animalia; Rodentia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036757306

There is the potential to double the primary energy compared with the current level by utilising vehicles with electric drivetrains. There is also major potential to increase the efficiency of conventional ICEVs. The energy and environmental cost of using a passenger car can be reduced by 50% solely by using improved ICEVs instead of ICEVs with current technical standard. All the studied vehicles with alternative powertrains (HEVs, FCEVs, and BPEVs) would have lower energy and environmental costs than the ICEV. The HEVs, FCEVs and BPEVs have, however, higher costs than the future methanol-fuelled ICEV, if the vehicle cost is added to the energy and environmental costs, even if significant cost reductions for key technologies such as fuel cells, batteries and fuel storages are assumed. The high-energy efficiency and low emissions of these vehicles cannot compensate for the high vehicle cost.

Design: Double-blind randomized treatment with fenfluramine once daily coupled to a non-macronutrient specific energy restriction. Subjects: Seventeen obese men (age 43.9 ± 1.5 and body mass index (BMI) 34.3 ± 0.7) and 17 obese women (age 41.2 ± 1.2 and BMI 35.7 ± 0.6). Interventions: Subjects were given fenfluramine (60 mg) or placebo once daily and were also subjected to a non-macronutrient specific energy restriction of - 2.9 MJ/day (-700 kcal/day) for 15 weeks. Results: Body weight, FM, fat-free mass (FFM), waist circumference, BMI, as well as visceral (VAT), subcutaneous abdominal (SAT) and thigh (TAT) adipose tissue were all significantly reduced. Men lost significantly more VAT (- 41.6%) than SAT (-22.5%), or than TAT (- 20.5%) while no site difference in fat loss was observed in women when changes were calculated as a percentage of initial levels. Men lost about twice as much fat from the VAT compartment than did women (P < 0.05), even after having considered changes in FM as a potential covariate. In absolute values, TAT was reduced to a lesser extent in men than in women. However, when initial levels of respective fat depots were also taken into account, gender differences in VAT and TAT loss were no longer statistically significant. Conclusion: These results suggest that gender differences in VAT reduction during weight loss are independent of changes in FM. However, once initial levels of VAT are also taken into account, gender differences in the reduction of this tissue during weight loss are no longer apparent.","Preferential fat reduction; Visceral adipose tissue; Weight loss","fenfluramine; lipid; placebo; adipose tissue; adult; anthropometry; article; body fat; body mass; caloric restriction; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diet therapy; dose response; double blind procedure; female; human; human tissue; lipid storage; male; obesity; randomized controlled trial; retrospective study; sex difference; subcutaneous tissue; thigh; viscera; weight reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036228656

In the simulation, the pillared layered pore is modeled by a uniform distribution of pillars between two solid walls. Methane is described as a spherical Lennard-Jones molecule, and Steele's 10-4-3 potential is used for representing the interaction between the fluid and a layered wall. The site-site interaction is also used for calculating the interaction energy between methane molecules and pillars. An effective potential model that reflects the characteristics of a real pillared layered material is proposed here. In the model, a binary interaction parameter, kfw, is introduced into the combining rule for the cross-energy parameter for the interaction between the fluid and a layered wall. Based on the experimental results for the Zr-pillared material synthesized and characterized by Boksh, Kikkinides, and Yang, the binary interaction parameter, kfw, is determined by fitting the simulation results to the experimental adsorption data of nitrogen at 77 K. Then, by taking it as a model of pillared layered material, a series of GCMC simulations have been carried out. The excess adsorption isotherms of methane in a pillared layered pore with three different pore widths and porosities are obtained at three supercritical temperatures T = 207.3, 237.0, and 266.6 K. Based on the simulation results at different porosities, various pore widths and different supercritical temperatures, the pillared layered pore with porosity ψ = 0.94 and pore width hσp = 1.02 nm is recommended as adsorption storage material of supercritical methane. Moreover, the optimum adsorption pressure is determined at a given temperature and a fixed width of the pillared layered pore. For example, at temperature T = 207.3 K, the optimum adsorption pressures are 3.1, 3.7, and 4.5 M Pa at H = 1.02, 1.70, and 2.38 nm, respectively. In summary, the GCMC method is a useful tool for optimizing adsorption storage of supercritical methane in pillared layered material. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).","Adsorption, pillared layered pores; Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation; Supercritical methane","Adsorption; Adsorption isotherms; Computer simulation; Methane; Monte Carlo methods; Interaction energy; Surface chemistry; methane; adsorption; article; calculation; chemical interaction; energy; isotherm; molecule; Monte Carlo method; parameter; porosity; pressure; priority journal; solid; synthesis; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036026552

This study reports some of the first direct measurements of energy fluxes over the city of Christchurch, New Zealand, during both summer and winter. Observations of the surface energy balance were made over two mainly residential suburbs: St Albans and Beckenham. Net all-wave radiation Q* was measured with a net radiometer, the eddy covariance approach was used to measure the turbulent heat fluxes (sensible heat QH, and latent heat QE), and the heat storage flux Δ QS was estimated as the energy balance residual. During the predominant northeasterlies and unstable conditions in summer, the fetch at St Albans includes a commercial warehouse as well as residential areas. In summer, on a daily basis, QH is the dominant heat sink followed by Δ QS and QE. However, during daytime Δ QS can be considerable and may approach the magnitude of Q'H. Evaporation is low because the turbulent flux source areas are mainly centred over the commercial warehouse and yard, which have little greenspace. In winter the flux source areas are mainly residential for both sites, and the small daily surplus of Q* is partitioned mostly into Δ QS, with some QE and a small QH that may be directed either towards or away from the surface depending largely on the synoptic conditions. Under strong inversion conditions, which occur frequently in Christchurch during winter, the turbulent heat fluxes are very small and QH may be directed towards the surface for many hours overnight and early in the morning. During foehn events the energy partitioning is significantly altered, particularly in winter. Net radiation may be substantially decreased, evaporation is usually markedly increased and in winter QH may be directed towards the surface for much of the event. The results highlight the importance of seasonal and synoptic controls in energy partitioning at this location, although difficulties with fetch complicate the analysis.

Vascular administration of preservation solutions alone is unable to prevent ischemic injury of this layer during clinically relevant storage periods. The SB is unique in that it possesses both a vascular and a luminal route by which preservation solutions can be administered. We hypothesized that addition of a luminal-delivered solution, formulated on amino acid requirements for energy- and non-energy-related reactions, would provide site-specific preservation of mucosal energetics, barrier function and morphology throughout an extended period of cold storage. Of the three luminal solutions containing amino acids which were tested (UWG, AA1, AA2), only the two groups (AA1, AA2), containing glutamine plus 18 other amino acids, ±osmotic agent (lactobionate) and buffer (BES), exhibited significant improvements in energetics, barrier function, and histology compared to the clinical standard of isolated vascular University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. Although the AA1 and AA2 groups preserved barrier function and morphology up to 24 h better than all other solutions tested, AA2 proved to be the only luminal solution with values of permeability, conductance, and short-circuit current not significantly different from freshly isolated tissues. Furthermore, the greatest reduction in histologic injury was effected by AA2 treatment (median grade 2 compared to control, UW(v), grade 8). This study documents that a luminaldelivered solution, formulated on physiologic SB requirements, provides targeted preservation of the SB mucosa.","Amino acids; Histology; Mucosa; Small bowel transplantation","amino acid; glutamine; lactobionic acid; preservative; amino acid composition; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; conductance; controlled study; cryopreservation; energy transfer; graft preservation; histology; intestine ischemia; intestine mucosa permeability; male; nonhuman; rat; small intestine; Adenine Nucleotides; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Intestinal Mucosa; Intestine, Small; Male; Organ Preservation Solutions; Phenobarbital; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036523987

Injury caused by chilling (low temperatures above zero degree centigrade) is characterized primarily by inhibition of the photosynthetic process. The objective of this work was to evaluate the role of photosynthetic pigments in the tolerance of coffee (C. arabica L.) seedlings to chilling. The evaluation the photosynthetic activity was made by emission of Chl a fluorescence at room temperature (25°C) in vivo and in situ, using a portable fluorometer. The pigment content was obtained by extraction with 80% acetone, while estimation of membrane lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring the MDA content in leaf tissue extracts. The results indicated a generalized reduction in the quantum yield of PSII when the seedlings were maintained in the dark. The reduction occurred in the seedlings submitted to chilling treatment as well as in the control ones. This demonstrates that not only chilling acts to cause an alteration in PSII. It is possible that the tissue storage reserves had been totally exhausted, with the respiratory rate exceeding the photosynthetic rate; the later was nil, since the seedlings were kept in the dark. The efficiency in the capture, transfer and utilization of light energy in PS11 photochemical reactions requires a sequence of photochemical, biochemical and biophysical events which depend on the structural integrity of the photosynthetic apparatus. However, this efficiency was found to be related to the protective action of chloroplastid pigments, rather than to the concentration of these pigments.","Chlorophyll a fluorescence; Coffee; Lipid peroxidation; Photosynthetic pigments","Coffea arabica; Coffea arabica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037002016

The results were compared with those of conventional design EWHs having the same tank size and power rating. Data were obtained for two tanks with aspect ratios of 1 and 2, two draw-off rates of 5 and 10 1/ min, and using three heating elements of different heights. It is found that improved design EWHs provide more hot water at almost constant temperature in the first mean residence time, which is of prime concern for the user. Thus, they exhibit higher discharging efficiencies due to better thermal stratification inside the heater storage tank. Also, thermal performance is enhanced with increasing tank aspect ratio and decreasing draw rate. These characteristics have a direct impact on energy consumption and result in lower electricity bills. The design improvements are simple to adapt as they only require minor modifications to be made to existing EWH models. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The aim is to find the best configuration of the memory hierarchy without performing the exhaustive analysis of the parameters space. The target system architecture includes the processor, separated instruction and data caches, the main memory, and the system buses. To achieve a fast convergence toward the near-optimal configuration, the proposed methodology adopts an iterative local-search algorithm based on the sensitivity analysis of the cost function with respect to the tuning parameters of the memory sub-system architecture. The exploration strategy is based on the Energy-Delay Product (EDP) metric taking into consideration both performance and energy constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology has been demonstrated through the design space exploration of a real-world case study: the optimization of the memory hierarchy of a MicroSPARC2-based system executing the set of Mediabench benchmarks for multimedia applications. Experimental results have shown an optimization speedup of 2 orders of magnitude with respect to the full search approach, while the near-optimal system-level configuration is characterized by a distance from the optimal full search configuration in the range of 2%.","Design space exploration; Power and performance optimization","Algorithms; Computer architecture; Data storage equipment; Iterative methods; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Systems analysis; Design space exploration; Energy delay product metric; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036734998

Small amplitude oscillatory shear measurements were carried out at different temperatures, ranging from 190°C to 240°C. The storage (G′) and loss (G″) moduli curves obtained were horizontally shifted and curves of angle delta (δ) (δ = atan (G″/G′)) as a function of complex shear modulus (G*), known as van Gurp plots, were obtained at several temperatures, to test the applicability of time-temperature superposition principle (TTS) to these blends. The results showed that successful application of TTS depends on the flow energy of activation and horizontal shift factors of the individual components of the blend, on the interfacial properties of the blend and on the concentration of compatibilizer added to the blends. TTS application failed for PP/PS blend, but held for PP/HDPE blend. Addition of SEBS to PP/PS blends promoted successful TTS application at specific concentrations that corresponded to interfacial saturation of the dispersed phase.

This result can be understood in terms of the long-range quadrupolar wakes of noncircular vacuum chambers with finite resistivity. In vacuum chambers with circular cross section, the dominant transverse wake driven by a leading particle and seen by a trailing test particle is dipolar and is proportional only to the transverse offset of the driving particle. The contributions of preceding bunches or previous turns tend to cancel, as they add with oscillatory factors. On the other hand, quadrupolar wakes are independent of the offset of the driving particle, and thus the contributions of preceding bunches and turns are strictly additive. Since quadrupole fields are focusing in one plane and defocusing in the plane orthogonal to it, their effects on tune shifts in these planes have opposite signs. Their cumulative effect also explains the large values of the tune shifts measured in PEP-II, which exceeded estimates from other impedance sources by factors of 3 to 4. Our analysis also offers a connection to the familiar Laslett tune shift. © 2002 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18144396501

In addition, when rotor systems utilizing AMBs are operated at high speeds there will be synchronous vibrations due to unavoidable rotor mass unbalances, which generate synchronous disturbance forces. These forces and vibrations can often lead to severe problems in rotating machines including collision with the touchdown bearings at high speed and the possible risk of causing damage to the internal parts of the machines. In this paper, a new ""direct"" adaptive feedforward algorithm is proposed for minimizing selected vibration performance measures which is based on the filtered-x LMS adaptive filter algorithm.

The lipids of M. digitata consisted of seven major lipid classes: polar lipid, sterol, free fatty acid, unknown lipids 1 and 2, triacylglycerol (TG), and wax ester. The concentration of storage lipids, TG, and wax ester showed a top-base gradient along the length, whereas the levels of free fatty acid and unknown lipids showed a base-top gradient. The proportions of polar lipid and sterol in the top portion of the branch were slightly higher than those in the base portion. This observation appeared to be compatible with the view that the increased energy expenditure for proliferation enhanced the mobilization of the storage fuel lipids of wax ester and TG rather than the structure lipids of polar lipids and sterols at the top portion of the branch. Compositions of fatty acid also showed a length-wise diversity. The top portion had a lower proportion of palmitic acid (16:0) in all lipid classes of fatty acid ester, suggesting that this fatty acid was preferentially mobilized at the top portion, probably for the growth of coral cells.","Branching coral; Distribution; Fatty acid composition; Length-wise gradient; Lipid profile","Anthozoa; Montipora; Montipora digitata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036315791

The work was aimed on the determination of concentration boundaries of Laves phase and investigation of hydrogen sorption properties of alloys. Using X-ray, EDXA and electron microscopy methods the phase compositions of over 50 alloys were studied. The Laves phase concentration boundaries were determined to extend up to 26 at.% of vanadium. Compared to ternary Ti-Mn-V system the region of λ1-phase is about 2 at.% wider for Ti-Mn side of concentration triangle. Depending on metal concentrations lattice parameters were determined to increase proportionally with increasing titanium or vanadium concentration according to Vegard rule. The interaction of alloys with hydrogen was studied by PC-isotherm method.

This article reports on a method to determine tgel and tvit by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Gelation was determined at the onset of the storage modulus or by the peak of the loss factor. Vitrification was defined as the curve of the storage modulus as the curve reached a constant level (endset) in DMA tests. The experimental values obtained for tgel and tvit were compared with values obtained by other experimental methods and with theoretical values (tgel's) or indirect determinations (tvit's). From kinetic analysis by differential scanning calorimetry, conversions corresponding to gelation were obtained for the three systems; this yielded a constant value for each system that was higher than theoretical value. Values of the apparent activation energies of the DGEBA/1,3-BAC, TGDDM/DDS, and TGDDM/EPN/DDS epoxy systems were obtained from plots of tgel's against reciprocal temperatures. They were 53.2, 58.2, and 46.5 kJ/mol, respectively. © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

The system was a 0.78 m long, 0.40 m wide and 0.10 m thick concrete slab. A heat source was used to impose a constant heat flux which could be varied from about 200 to 700 W/m2. Temperatures at various points and heat flux by natural convection at the horizontal surface were measured. Using various assumptions, the system was also analyzed theoretically. It is found that the mathematical model to study the transient heat transfer in the slab system was satisfactory to predict its thermal behavior in various conditions. An empirical correlation for natural convection on the horizontal concrete slab was derived and used in the analysis. The results showed that the incident energy on the concrete slab was not a parameter affecting strongly the absorbed heat by the slab, the radiation heat losses made about 60% while those by natural convection 40%, and the major energy storage-restitution was taking place during the first 3 to 4 h.

In this work, we show the theoretical limit of stored energy with the maximum stresses. To achieve the ideal limit, we propose the toroidal coil with helical winding. It is a hybrid coil of a toroidal field (TF) coil and a solenoidal coil helically wound on a torus. The winding is modulated in such that the toroidal field is created in the torus whereas the poloidal field is only out of the tours. In this case, the electromagnetic force is represented by the difference in the poloidal and the toroidal magnetic pressure. The virial theorem in the magnet is the relation of the magnetic energy and the averaged stress, and shows that the best coil to store the magnetic energy under the weakest averaged stress requires equal averaged principal stresses in all directions, which determines the ratio of the poloidal and toroidal current of our toroidal coil. The coil increases the magnetic energy to 4 times the conventional TF coil with the same maximum stress.","Coil; Energy; Magnetic field; SMES; Stress; Super-conductivity; Tensor; Virial theorem","Critical current density (superconductivity); Electric currents; Electric energy storage; Electric windings; Electromagnetism; Magnetic fields; Magnetic flux; Matrix algebra; Optimization; Solenoids; Stresses; Tensors; Poloidal field; Superconducting coil; Superconducting magnetic energy storage; Toroidal field coil; Virial theorem; Superconducting magnets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036510122

It takes the form of a trapezoidal-shaped water store in direct contact with an inclined flat-plate solar collector assembly. This cross-section induces thermal stratification in the water store, and provides sufficient energy storage to meet typical daily hot-water demand. Its thermal performance is critically dependent on the waterside convective heat-transfer coefficient on the backward-reclining collector plate; previously evaluated by Cruz et al. (Cruz JMS, Hammond GP, Reis AJPS. Buoyancy-driven convective heat exchange in a trapezoidal-shaped solar collector/thermal store. In: Proc. of the 5th ASME/JSME Joint Thermal Engineering Conf., San Diego, CA (ASME, New York), 1999, 9 pp). In the current design, the absorber plate inclination to the horizontal was fixed at 45° (close to the local latitude) in order to yield maximum solar gain over a typical year. The energy saving provided by the solar collector/thermal store demonstrator largely depends on the amount of thermal stratification within the trapezoidal storage cavity. This was evaluated via both computation and measurements of the temperature field. A thermal network analysis model was then used to assess the energy-saving potential of the composite system. It indicated that a 30-70% reduction in daily load could be obtained in contrast to direct, electrical or gas, heating: the smaller saving occurred at times of greatest use or hot-water take-off. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The structures of such tanks may be idealized as cantilever cylindrical shells, and the structural response is investigated using a computational model. The modeling employs a doubly curved finite element based on a theory by Simo and coworkers, which is capable of handling large displacements and plasticity. Buckling results for tanks with four different geometric relations are presented to consider the influence of the ratios between the radius and the height of the shell (R/L), and between the radius and the thickness (R/t). The studies aim to clarify the differences in the shells regarding their imperfection-sensitivity. The results show that thin-walled short tanks, with R/L = 3, display high imperfection sensitivity, while tanks with R/L = 0.5 are almost insensitive to imperfections. Changes in the total potential energy of tanks that would buckle under the same high wind pressures are also considered.","Buckling; Cylindrical shells; Finite elements; Postbuckling; Tanks; Total potential energy; Wind load","Defects; Elasticity; Finite element method; Loads (forces); Mathematical models; Plasticity; Potential energy; Pressure; Shells (structures); Tanks (containers); Wind effects; Elastic buckling; Buckling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036570375

Recently, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-driven secreted proreins, i.e., connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and gremlin, were identified. They are up-regulated in kidneys of diabetic animals and modulate the biology of mesangial cells. CTGF mediates TGF-β-induced matrix overproduction by the mesangial cells. Gremlin is a putative antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein-2 that blocks mesangial cell proliferation. Thus, gremlin may modulate the biology of mesangium by stimulating mesangial cell proliferation and in turn production of matrix. In addition, transcriptionally regulated kinases, serum glucocorticoid-regulated kinase and munc-13 have been identified. The former stimulates renal tubular Na+ transport and is involved in hyperfiltraion of diabetic kidneys by a Na+ transport feedback mechanism. Munc-13 has been shown to induce apoptosis in hyperglycemic state via diacylglyecrol-activated, PKC-independent signaling pathway. Another pathway relevant to diabetic nephropathy is polyol pathway, where glucose is reduced to sorbitol by aldose reductase. Recently, a renal-specific reductase of the aldo-keto reductase family was isolated. It is up-regulated in diabetic mice, and this could serve as a suitable target for gene therapy in renal complications of diabetes. Several mitochondrial genome-encoded genes, such as, cytochrome oxidase and NADH dehydrogenase, are up-regulated in diabetic kidneys. A novel nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene, i.e., translocase inner mitochondrial membrane 44 (Tim44), is up-regulated in diabetic kidneys, and it may also serve as another target for molecular therapeutic intervention at the core storage energy sites, i.e., mitochondria. In this review, these novel differentially regulated genes that respond to hyperglycemic stress are described, and they may serve as possible targets for gene therapy in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.","Aldo-keto reductase; Mitochondrial translocase","aldehyde reductase; bone morphogenetic protein 2; connective tissue growth factor; cytochrome c oxidase; diacylglycerol; glucose; gremlin; polyol; protein inhibitor; protein kinase C; protein Munc 13; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase; sorbitol; transforming growth factor beta; unclassified drug; apoptosis; cell proliferation; conference paper; diabetic nephropathy; enzyme activity; gene expression; gene targeting; genome; human; hyperglycemia; mesangium cell; molecular biology; nonhuman; priority journal; signal transduction; sodium transport",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036177882

The excess water is disposed of to the sea. The aim of this study was to provide a model capable of predicting the microbiological quality of the water pumped for irrigation or discharged to the sea. Meteorological variables, flow rates, physical-chemical characteristics and faecal coliform (FC) contents were monitored for a year and a half. The hydraulic pattern of each lagoon was assumed to be that of completely mixed reactor because of the calculated dispersion numbers and the wind mixing effect. Coliform decay was assumed to follow first order kinetics in each lagoon. Die-off coefficients were calculated in each lagoon using a non-steady-state model. The main bacterial removal mechanism was shown to be solar irradiation. Empirical equations were established to calculate die-off coefficients as a function of received solar energy and temperature. FC die-off rates were higher in the first lagoon and then decreased successively in those following. FC numbers in the different lagoons were predicted with reasonable accuracy in spite of high variation in inlet water quality. The model will facilitate the prediction of water quality under various climatic conditions and different water reuse scenarios and will help to optimise reclamation and storage facilities. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The nutritional conditions of most species vary throughout the year considerably. Thus storage and mobilization of lipids have to be tightly controlled, yet little is known about its control. Though several hormones are known to have a lipolytic effect, short term regulation of lipolysis is known for catecholamines only. Catecholamines are usually released under stress conditions, including hypoxia. In mammals these hormones have a strong lipolytic action, causing high plasma fatty acids levels during hypoxia. In contrast to mammals, several fish species show a decrease of plasma FFA-levels during hypoxia and anoxia. However, some studies gave contrasting results when catecholamines were administrated to different fish species. The reason for this may be due to opposing effects of catecholamines on lipolysis in different tissues. From catecholamine administration experiments in cannulated carp there is evidence that norepinephrine inhibits lipolysis via β 1- and β3- adrenoceptors while β 2-adrenoceptors are involved in stimulation of lipolysis. Thus the opposite responses of different β-adrenoceptors may explain the conflicting in-vivo results obtained with fish. In vitro studies with adipocytes from different fish species confirm that activation of β -adrenoceptors suppresses lipolysis, while the opposite occurs in hepatocytes. Inhibiting β1- and β3- adrenoceptors in adipocytes were shown to be involved. Under hypoxia β-oxidation is inhibited, resulting in accumulation of fatty acids together with intermediates of the β-oxidation. This process may cause severe cellular damage in mammalian tissues, which 'apparently' does not occur in fishes. Fishes encounter (environmental) hypoxia on a regular basis, while for mammals hypoxia/anoxia is a pathological phenomenon. Hence the suppression of lipolysis in fishes under hypoxia (by β1- and β3- adrenoceptors) may be considered as a survival mechanism lost in higher vertebrates. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","β-adrenoceptors; Adipocytes; Adipose tissue; Catecholamines; Epinephrine; Free fatty acids; Hypoxia; Lipase; Lipid storage; Lipolysis; Liver; NEFA; Norepinephrine; Teleosts","beta 1 adrenergic receptor; beta 2 adrenergic receptor; beta 3 adrenergic receptor; catecholamine; fatty acid; hormone sensitive lipase; noradrenalin; adipocyte; adrenergic system; anoxia; article; cell damage; energy resource; fatty acid blood level; fatty acid oxidation; fish; hypoxia; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid composition; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipolysis; liver cell; nonhuman; systematic review; tissue distribution; Cyprinus carpio; Mammalia; Pisces; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744231870

Nevertheless, the phenotypic factors affecting successful anhydrobiosis have rarely been investigated. We report a laboratory study on the effects of body size, reproductive condition, and energetic condition on anhydrobiotic survival in a population of the eutardigrade Richtersius coronifer. Body size and energetic condition interacted in affecting the probability of survival, while reproductive condition had no effect. Large tardigrades had a lower probability of survival than medium-sized tardigrades and showed a positive response in survival to energetic condition. This suggests that energy constrained the possibility for large tardigrades to enter and to leave anhydrobiosis. As a possible alternative explanation for low survival in the largest specimens we discuss the expression of senescence. In line with the view that processes related to anhydrobiosis are connected with energetic costs we documented a decrease in the size of storage cells over a period of anhydrobiosis, showing for the first time that energy is consumed in the process of anhydrobiosis in tardigrades. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Animalia; Nematoda; Richtersius coronifer; Richtersius coronifer; Rotifera; Tardigrada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036845671

This cross-sectional study investigated the serum leptin concentrations of severely obese patients with binge eating disorder (BED), in whom body fat was greater than normal and, because of eating pattern, rapid and repeated changes in energy balances took place. METHODS: A group of BED obese patients was compared to a group of obese patients with a regular eating pattern with the same body weight, body composition and resting energy expenditure. Serum leptin was measured and the eating attitudes were evaluated by Eating Inventory and Eating Disorder Inventory. RESULTS: In these patients serum leptin concentrations were only weakly correlated to body mass. Furthermore, in BED obese patients serum leptin concentration was higher than in their non bingeing counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: In obese patients both body fat size and eating behavior influence serum leptin concentration, but BED patients binge eating is not triggered by a low leptin value.","Eating behavior; Leptin; Obesity","leptin; article; attitude; binge eating disorder; body composition; body fat; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; eating habit; energy balance; energy expenditure; female; hormone determination; human; lipid storage; obesity; priority journal; steady state; Attitude; Bulimia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Leptin; Obesity; Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036346099

In fact, when the zero-phase voltage of the source exists, none of the present compensation strategies can guarantee the instantaneous elimination of the neutral current in three-phase four-wire systems. Two approaches are distinguished in this paper for instantaneous compensation. The first eliminates the instantaneous reactive current, thus neutral current can still flow. The second eliminates the instantaneous pseudo-reactive current, so that the neutral current component is compensated. In the latter case, a new control strategy is designed to avoid instantaneous power flowing through the compensator. It provides flexibility in compensating for the neutral current in a three-phase four-wire system including the zero-sequence voltage. Finally, simulated and experimental results are obtained to confirm the theoretical properties and show the compensator performance.","Active filters; Current control; Instantaneous active and reactive current; Power system control; Reactive power control; Three-phase systems","Active filters; Electric current control; Electric potential; Energy storage; Zero phase voltage; Phase changing circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036815107

Three glass spheres having radii of 4.07, 3.5 and 3.135 cm were chosen for this study. A flowing water-glycol solution over a range of temperature varying between 4.5 and 12°C (during melting) and between -9.5 and -4.4°C (during freezing) was used as a heat transfer fluid (HTF) during the tests. The apparatus, method and results are described. Photographic means were used to characterize the water-ice interface position and its shape during discharging (melting) process. However, during charging (freezing) process a new method was devised for the same objectives. Several interesting results have been obtained from this study. Results obtained showed that the charging and discharging rates were constant with respect to the dimensionless time to at least 90% of the storage capacity of the single spherical ice storage element. These important and new results have allowed the formulation, described in the paper, of simple empirical equations describing the charging and discharging rates for a single spherical thermal (ice) storage element at any instant time period within the range of HTF temperature and spherical element size used. It is believed that these equations will be useful to colleagues interested in modelling the dynamic behaviour of thermal (ice) storage using spherical elements as phase change. Effects of the HTF temperature and capsule size on the rate of energy charged and discharged from a single spherical enclosure are presented and discussed.

The calorimeter is capable of measuring the differential heat flow between two cells containing a sample and a dummy. Deformation is performed in either compression or tension mode and ensures the equal forces applied to the sample and dummy in every moment during loading and unloading. The sensitivity of the calorimeter is &lt;1 μW, and the time constant is about 3-4 min. High sensitivity of the instrument allows the measurement of very small deformation heats appearing at low strains (pre-yield strain region). Such data did not exist in polymer literature. Cylindrical samples with 4 mm diameter and 6 mm length were made of glassy polymers, such as polystyrene, (poly)methylmethacrylate, (poly)carbonate and cured epoxy-aromatic amine networks. Samples were deformed at room temperature by uniaxial compression up to strains 8-15% (which is slightly above upper yield point for polymers studied) with the loading rate 1 MPa/min. The same measurements with Cu single crystal were performed for comparison. The work and heat of deformation were measured and the internal energy stored in the deformed samples was calculated with the use of first law of thermodynamics. Total strain, work, heat and stored energy of deformation were split for the elastic (Hookean) and inelastic parts. It was found that in inelastic process all studied glassy polymers store internal energy which does not recover even after unloading of the samples. The parameter dUin/dWin, giving the fraction of the inelastic deformation work Win stored as the internal energy was measured as a function of strain. For annealed samples this parameter is close to 100% for small inelastic strains and decreases to 60% as deformation approaching to yield point. This supports the earlier formulated idea [Polym. Sci. 35 (11) (1993) 1819] that high level of energy storage is the characteristic feature of inelastic response of glassy substances. In contrast, the Cu single crystal does not show any energy storage during elastic and plastic deformation processes. Within experimental accuracy, all deformation work for Cu single crystal is converted to heat. Different deformation behavior of crystal and polymer glasses reflects the differences in deformation mechanisms for both types of the solids. Some details of the inelastic response mechanism for glassy solids based on measured results are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Macrocyclops albidus (Copepoda) suffer from a reduced escaping ability and an increased level of general activity, when infected with Schistocephalus solidus (Cestoda). This facilitates predation by the subsequent host, the three-spined stickleback. However, instead of adaptive host manipulation by the tapeworm, the altered copepod behaviour might be explained more simply as a constraint of the infection. Energy depletion could lead to decreased muscle performance and increased food searching activity. Furthermore, resource allocation among host tissues might change after infection. We therefore analysed the amount of storage lipids and muscle tissue before and after experimental infection. To determine the amount of muscles, we developed a new polarization-microscopic technique. Irrespective of infection, lipids and muscles were predictors of copepod survival. However, we found no effect of the parasite infection on muscles or lipids, and no indication of a change in resource allocation between these tissues.

Batteries provide an energy storage facility to manage continued energy supply during eclipses and short-term peak power loading. The PCU regulates the spacecraft power required into one reliable, regulated 28 volt main bus supply line. The Rosetta spacecraft has to travel to a point, which is more than 5 AU from the sun, which reduces the available solar panel power to less than 1/25 of its power capability near earth. Thus, to limit the size of the solar arrays, it is mandatory for this mission to be able to utilise all the array electrical power.","Autonomy single point failure free; High efficiency; Low mass; Maximum power point tracking (MPPT)","Design; Electric batteries; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Power control; Solar cell arrays; Solar energy; Space flight; Power conditioning unit; Rosetta deep space mission; Solar panels; Spacecraft",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036569557

The modified plasma reactor treats large amounts of beads, which are uniformly surface-crosslinked. In this study, effects of the gas pressure, radio-frequency (RF) power, and the treatment time on the degree of surface crosslinking were systematically investigated. Degree of surface crosslinking was measured by solvent extraction method (boiling xylene method, BXM). The gel content of plasma-treated HDPE increases from 0.0 to 1.05% within 10 min at 100 mTorr, 200 W. FTIR and DSC analyses show that the crosslinked layer after plasma treatment is limited only at HDPE surface without changing the bulk thermal property of HDPE. Through the analysis of FTIR, it was confirmed that main peaks corresponding to CH2 bands were decreased and two peaks corresponding to CF2 and CF3 were observed after plasma surface modification. © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

The proposed power converter doesn't need energy storage units such as an electrolytic capacitor or a reactor. So there are many ripples across the DC-bus voltage and then, the input power factor can be improved. The proposed system consists of an only diode rectifier, a small film DC capacitor, a three phase inverter and an interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous motor. The basic ideas are based on two following operations. First, the inverter's controlled synchronous with the DC-bus ripple voltage by field-weakening method. The other is direct active power control from the source to the motor without smoothing the DC-bus voltage. This paper shows that the proposed method can obtain the input power factor over 97% by experimental tests, and realize the small size and the long life of the system. © 2002 IEEE.","field-weakening; interior permanent magnet motor; Power factor improvement; single-phase diode rectifier","Capacitors; Diodes; Electric inverters; Electric machine control; Electric motors; Electric power factor; Electrolytic capacitors; Magnets; Permanent magnets; Power control; Rectifying circuits; Synchronous motors; Active power control; Field-weakening; Following operation; Interior permanent magnet motors; Interior permanent magnet synchronous motor; Power factor improvement; Single-phase diode rectifiers; Three-phase inverter; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961711505

Design: A cross-sectional survey employing proportionate cluster sampling was conducted in 1998/1999. Dietary intakes were assessed using a non-consecutive 3-day weighed food record. Serum ferritin and C-reactive protein were analysed from non-fasting venepuncture blood samples and general sociodemographic data were collected. Setting: Cities of Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill, New Zealand. Subjects: Randomly selected healthy 6-24-month-old non-breast-feeding children (n = 226). Results: Total iron intakes (±standard deviation (SD)) among non-breast-feeding infants (&lt;12 months old; n = 42) and toddlers (&lt;12 months old; n = 184) were 8.4 ± 2.9mg day-1 and 5.0 ± 2.5 mg day-1, respectively. Fifteen per cent of infants and 66% of toddlers were at risk of inadequate iron intakes. Main sources of dietary iron were infant formula (60%) for infants and cereals (31%) for toddlers. Meat contributed on average 2% and 10% of dietary iron in the infant and toddler diets, respectively. Dietary factors positively associated with serum ferritin were intakes of iron and vitamin C, whereas intakes of calcium and dietary fibre were negatively associated. For each 1% increase in percentage of energy from iron-fortified formula concomitant with a 1% decrease from dairy products, there was a 4.2% increased odds of replete iron stores (ferritin ≥20 μg1-1). Conclusions: Toddlers were at higher risk of sub-optimal iron intakes than infants.

The influence of the edge pedestal structure imposed by the destabilization of type I ELMs on thermal energy confinement of the core plasma was also quantitatively clarified. As the density increased, the saturation of the pressure at the pedestal shoulder, pped, caused by the type I ELM activities forced a reduction in the pedestal temperature.

Time series models were used to simulate wind speeds incorporating any necessary chronological correlations. The power available from a wind turbine generator was calculated from the simulated wind speed using the function describing the relationship between wind speed and power output. The failure and repair characteristics of a wind turbine generator were simulated in a similar manner to those of conventional generating units. A battery state of charge time series was obtained from the load time series and the available wind generation time series. The performance of such a system is quite different from one containing conventional generating units due to the dispersed nature of the wind at the specific site location.

To enter the β-oxidation pathway, fatty acids need to be activated to acyl-coenzyme As (CoAs) by the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS; EC 6.2.1.3). Here, we report the characterization of an Arabidopsis cDNA clone encoding for a glyoxysomal acyl-CoA synthetase designated AtLACS6. The cDNA sequence is 2,106 bp long and it encodes a polypeptide of 701 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 76,617 D. Analysis of the amino-terminal sequence indicates that acyl-CoA synthetase is synthesized as a larger precursor containing a cleavable amino-terminal presequence so that the mature polypeptide size is 663 amino acids. The presequence shows high similarity to the typical PTS2 (peroxisomal targeting signal 2). The AtLACS6 also shows high amino acid identity to prokaryotic and eukaryotic fatty acyl-CoA synthetases. Immunocytochemical and cell fractionation analyses indicated that the AtLACS6 is localized on glyoxysomal membranes. AtLACS6 was overexpressed in insect cells and purified to near homogeneity. The purified enzyme is particularly active on long-chain fatty acids (C16:0).

Since the motivations of national programs are often different, due to a different context, we will take for granted that transmutation is generally seen as an option for the back-end of the fuel cycle in order to reduce the burden of potential geological storages of radioactive wastes (whatever their nature). Finally, we also acknowledge the fact that some highly respected scientists have at several occasions during this decade expressed their doubts about the value of the transmutation option.

Documenting contrasts in fuel composition and storage patterns within species, or even within individuals, would greatly help to elucidate the functional significance of the variety of storage strategies demonstrated in birds. We show here that the 40-50 g mass gain of 200 g in Eurasian golden plovers (Pluvialis apricaria) in autumn in The Netherlands consists of fat only, but that the similar gain in body mass in spring consists of proteinaceous tissue (pectoral and other skeletal muscle and possibly skin tissue). That the same golden plovers store energy in autumn and store protein in spring suggests that they face energy deficits in early winter and risk protein deficits in spring, especially perhaps after arrival on the breeding grounds in late April and early May. In autumn and winter their diet consists largely of protein-rich earthworms, but upon arrival on Low Arctic and montane tundras, golden plovers tend to eat berries which are rich in sugars but notably poor in proteins. We therefore propose that the build-up of proteinaceous tissue in spring reflects a strategic storage of a nutritional resource that is likely to be in short supply somewhat later in the year.","Frugivory; Fuel; Migration; Phenotypic flexibility; Storage strategies","bird; energy; fat reserve; protein; adaptation; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bird; body mass; caloric restriction; controlled study; food composition; food storage; frugivory; lipid storage; migration; morphological trait; muscle tissue; nonhuman; nutrition; priority journal; protein deficiency; protein metabolism; skeletal muscle; species difference; weight gain; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Birds; Body Composition; Energy Metabolism; Fats; Flight, Animal; Netherlands; Proteins; Reproduction; Seasons; Time Factors; Weight Gain; Animalia; Aves; Ciconiiformes; Pluvialis; Pluvialis apricaria; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53149127331

Helium diffusion rate has to be known in order to predict the long-term behaviour of the material, and particularly, the influence of helium accumulation on mechanical properties. A nuclear reaction analysis method, namely the 3He(d,p)4He reaction, has been used to analyse the evolution of 3He profiles after ion implantations at 1 and 3 MeV in two materials, monoclinic ZrO2 (as a test material) and Ca9Nd(PO4)5(SiO4)F1.5(OH) 0.5 britholite (envisaged for Am and Pu long-term storage). Two data processing methods are used: the classical excitation curve (proton yields versus deuteron energy) and second, the proton energy spectrum for a given deuteron energy. The characteristics of the 3He profiles (depth, width) obtained by both methods are compared to SRIM estimations. Their evolution during subsequent annealings allows an estimation of the helium diffusion rate in the britholite: D(cm2/s) = (2.5 ± 1.5) × 10-4exp(-(1.07 ± 0.03 eV)/kT) in the temperature range 200-400 °C, in agreement with previous results on similar materials. Moreover, the shape of the proton energy spectra suggests channeling effects in britholite. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Unlike more temperate areas, the northern water year is dominated, to a great extent, by this onset of spring which results in the melting of nearly half of the annual precipitation over a period of a few weeks, initiates the thawing of the river and lake ice and the soil active layer, and marks the beginning of the evaporation season. An early winter to summer transition occurred at two small research basins in the Inuvik area and at the East Channel of the Mackenzie River Delta. At the research basins, for example, the spring of 1994/95 had the earliest onset of continuous above-freezing air temperatures, removal of the snow cover, and initiation of runoff. Consideration of the entire water year at the research basins demonstrates that rain and snow were nearly equal in magnitude, evaporation exceeded runoff, and the annual change in storage was negative to near zero. This negative change in storage was related to the long, snow-free evaporation season, above-average air temperatures, and below-normal precipitation. The unusual winter to summer transition on the Mackenzie River in the eastern portion of the Mackenzie Delta was, in many ways, even more remarkable than that in the research basins. Earlier work had suggested that the timing of the spring breakup was very consistent from year to year. An analysis of the timing of breakup from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, however, shows a trend towards earlier spring breakup, with the mean for the 1990s being nine days earlier than that for the 1960s, and with the 1995 breakup being the earliest on record. Such an early breakup is not only an indication of warm local conditions, but of warm temperatures and an early runoff event over the more southerly areas of the Mackenzie basin. A companion Mackenzie Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment study illustrates the importance of a high pressure circulation pattern centred east of the basin to this early melt event. © Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society.",,"energy flux; evaporation; ice breakup; runoff; snowmelt; water budget; Canada; Mackenzie River Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036020880

The cell employed a bifunctional air-cathode using a La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 perovskite catalyst. The anode contained the intermetallic compound MmNi3.5Co0.7Al0.7Mn0.1 as the active material. The cell voltage at 20 mA/cm2 was 0.65 V (air) and 0.78 V (oxygen). Using air, 12 mW/cm2 of continuous power was delivered from the fuel cell for almost 1000 h. A maximum power output of 34 mW/cm2 (oxygen) was measured. The system acts as a fuel cell with built-in capacity because the hydrogen fuel in the anode is stored as MH. The H2-rechargeable MH-electrode showed an attractive recharge rate suitable for practical use: 87% of the full capacity was recharged within 58 min. By using a bifunctional air-electrode the MH-electrode can also be recharged electrochemically. The fuel cell can therefore be regarded as a battery which is rechargeable like a normal secondary cell, but which has the advantage of also being rechargeable with hydrogen gas. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. on behalf of the International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Fuel cell; Gas diffusion electrode; Metal hydride","Anodes; Catalysts; Cathodes; Electrochemistry; Energy storage; Hydrogen; Intermetallics; Perovskite; Metal hydride (MH) fuel cells; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036722422

On the basis of 722 voluntary dives recorded from 18 captive star-nosed moles, the mean dive duration (9.2±0.2s; mean ± S.E.M.) and maximum recorded dive time (47s) of this insectivore were comparable with those of several substantially larger semi-aquatic endotherms. Total body O2 stores of adult starnosed moles (34.0 ml kg-1) were 16.4% higher than for similarly sized, strictly fossorial coast moles Scapanus orarius (29.2 ml kg-1), with the greatest differences observed in lung and muscle O2 storage capacity. The mean lung volume of C. cristata (8.09 ml 100 g-1) was 1.81 times the predicted allometric value and exceeded that of coast moles by 65.4% (P=0.0001). The overall mean myoglobin (Mb) concentration of skeletal muscles of adult star-nosed moles (13.57±0.40 mg g-1 wet tissue, N=7) was 19.5% higher than for coast moles (11.36±0.34 mg g-1 wet tissue, N=10; P=0.0008) and 54.2% higher than for American shrew-moles Neurotrichus gibbsii (8.8 mg g-1 wet tissue; N=2). The mean skeletal muscle Mb content of adult star-nosed moles was 91.1% higher than for juveniles of this species (P&lt;0.0001). On the basis of an average diving metabolic rate of 5.38±0.35 ml O2 g-1 h-1 (N=11), the calculated aerobic dive limit (ADL) of star-nosed moles was 22.8 s for adults and 20.7 s for juveniles. Only 2.9% of voluntary dives by adult and juvenile star-nosed moles exceeded their respective calculated ADLs, suggesting that star-nosed moles rarely exploit anaerobic metabolism while diving, a conclusion supported by the low buffering capacity of their skeletal muscles. We suggest that a high mass-specific O2 storage capacity and relatively low metabolic cost of submergence are key contributors to the impressive dive performance of these diminutive insectivores.","Aerobic dive limit; Body oxygen store; Coast mole; Condylura cristata; Diving behaviour; Energetics; Insectivore; Lung volume; Myoglobin; Scapanus orarius; Star-nosed mole","hemoglobin; myoglobin; oxygen; aerobic metabolism; animal; animal behavior; article; chemistry; comparative study; diving; energy metabolism; hematocrit; kinetics; lung; mole (Insectivora); oxygen consumption; physiology; skeletal muscle; species difference; temperature; Aerobiosis; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Diving; Energy Metabolism; Hematocrit; Hemoglobins; Kinetics; Lung; Moles; Muscle, Skeletal; Myoglobin; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Species Specificity; Temperature; Animalia; Condylura; Condylura cristata; Mammalia; Neurotrichus gibbsii; Scapanus; Scapanus orarius; Talpidae; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036332210

Furthermore, as an example of application of rheological analysis, the selection of proper raw resin and processing conditions in the sheet-extrusion of MET-PP was studied. MET-PP shows the following rheological features due mainly to the narrow molecular weight distribution in comparison with ZN-PP with equivalent MFI to that of MET-PP: while the viscosities at low shear rates are lower, those at high shear rates are higher. Although there is little difference in the loss modulus G″ (viscosity), the storage modulus G″ (elasticity) is very (about one decade) lower. The die swell is much smaller. The entrance pressure loss and end correction coefficient are lower. The critical shear rate at which a melt fracture begins to occur is lower. The melt tension, elongational viscosity, and melt flow index ratio are lower. The flow activation energy is slightly lower.

Additionally, the existing literature does not emphasize extensively mathematical models for a precise analysis of the CEACS. Therefore, the study presented here deals with an initial investigation of useful models that allow for a systematic analysis of CEACS independent of the satellite types. The concept discussed is based on a double counter rotating flywheel assembly in the pitch axis.

Their range of applications could be further extended if their hydrogenation properties and degradation behavior could be improved. The main emphasis of this study was to find an economic manufacturing method for Mg-Ti-Ni-H systems, and to investigate their hydrogenation properties. (Mg 10-xTi x)-10, 20 mass% Ni systems were prepared by hydrogen-induced mechanical alloying (HIMA) using Mg and Ni chips and sponge Ti. The particles synthesized were characterized by X-ray diffraction, and their morphologies were observed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The absorbed hydrogen capacity (AHC) was measured by using thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) after HIMA. In addition, the crystal structures were analyzed in terms of their bright-/dark field images and the selected area diffraction pattern (SADP) of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In order to examine hydrogenation behavior, a Sieverts type automatic pressure-composition-isotherm (PCI) apparatus was used and the experiments were performed at 423, 473, 523, 573, 623 and 673 K. The results of TGA reveal that the absorbed hydrogen contents are around 2.5 mass% for (Mg 9Ti 1)-10 mass% Ni. With increased Ni content, the absorbed hydrogen content decreases to 1.7 mass%, whereas the dehydriding starting temperatures are lowered by some 70-100 K. The results of PCI on (Mg 9Ti 1)-20 mass% Ni show that its hydrogen capacity is around 5.3 mass% and its reversible capacity and plateau pressure are also excellent at 523 and 573 K.

The surface modification and Zr addition had also been carried out for improvement of its electrode performance. In comparison with the arc-melted polycrystalline one, the nanocystalline Mg2Ni phase showed a higher discharge capacity. By increasing milling time from 120 to 160 h, the grain size of Mg2Ni phase was more refined and the discharge capacity was raised from 180 to 370 mAhg-1. The discharge capacity of the 160-h milled Mg-Ni-Zr amorphous alloys also reached 530 mAhg-1. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) analysis showed that Mg2p spectra were shifted to lower binding energy implying the enhancement of the hydrogen diffusion and charge transfer reaction, and resulted in increasing the discharge capacity in amorphous alloys. To prevent the rapid degradation, the alloy powders were also coated with Ni and graphite by additional ball milling. The Ni and graphite protected the Mg from oxidation, and the coated powders showed a better cyclic stability.

Longitudinally polarised electron or positron beams in the HERA electron storage ring were incident on longitudinally polarised internal atomic gas targets as well as several nuclear gas targets. The primary goal of the HERMES experiment is the study of the spin structure of the nucleon. High precision measurements of double-spin asymmetries in inclusive and semi-inclusive scattering from undiluted polarised atomic hydrogen, deuterium and 3He gas targets are presented. These data represent the world's most precise experimental determination to date of the separate contributions of the spin of up, down and strange quarks to the spin of the nucleon, and the first direct indication of a positive gluon polarisation. The observation of single-spin asymmetries in the azimuthal distributions of hadrons in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering from longitudinally polarised targets is also presented. These single-spin asymmetries can be related to transversity, the only unmeasured of the three leading twist parton distribution functions. Moreover, first measurements of single-spin asymmetries in hard exclusive production of real photons and of pions are reported. Such data can be interpreted in the framework of generalised parton distributions, which is also used when discussing new data on hard exclusive electro-production of the vector mesons ρ, ω and φ.

The rate equations describing TSCs are solved numerically for various heating profiles, which makes it possible to evaluate the ionization energy, concentration, and capture cross section of traps. The slow and fast retrapping approximations are examined for an arbitrary heating profile. A new approach to TSC data processing is proposed: cleaning of a peak from the lower temperature peak by storing the preilluminated material in the dark at the relaxation temperature of the lower temperature peak. It is shown that heating (constant-rate or exponential) followed by isothermal holding makes it possible to determine the ionization energy of traps without knowing the retrapping mechanism. This approach is adapted for the case when the retrapping time is comparable to the carrier lifetime. Partially compensated silicon with impurity photoconductivity is prepared by doping with gold and phosphorus. It is shown that, using resonance photoexcitation, one can identify the nature (electron or hole) of traps and evaluate their ionization energy.

Pflanzengenet./Kulturpflanzen., Gatersleben (IPK), Corrensstrasse 3, D-06466 Gatersleben, Germany","Iron is abundant in most soils, but ferric compounds are almost insoluble. Therefore, plant roots use as tools acidification and enzymatic reduction of iron at the outer cell surface (strategy I) or solubilization by phytosiderophores, which are specific ferric chelators (strategy II). In the first case, iron is taken up as Fe2+ into the root symplast, and in the latter one, iron is taken up as Fe(III) complex. The path of iron from the root surface, up to the point of the xylem vessels within the central cylinder, may be completely symplasmic. However, a part of this route also may be an apoplasmic one, through the free space of the cell walls of rhizodermis and cortex (apoplast). In the endodermis, the Casparian band forms a strict barrier for apoplasmic transport; to move past this site, all ions must enter the symplast. During symplasmic transport, the intracellular environment is protected against the reactive species of iron by handling of iron in chelated forms. A promising candidate for this purpose is the plant-endogenous chelator nicotianamine. At the apoplasmic site, iron can be oxidized followed by precipitation as hydroxide or phosphate compounds. Thus, a pool of apoplastic iron can be formed, as shown by reductive mobilization or by proton-induced X-ray emission. This pool may be remobilized when iron deficiency takes place. During radial transport to the vessels, vacuoles may compete with the transport stream forming an iron store. When there is an iron excess, as in plants growing in waterlogged soils or by experimental techniques, plants can escape the deleterious effects of free iron by depositing it in phytoferritin, a storage protein inducible under iron excess. Also, nicotianamine forms a pool of metabolically available iron. Thus, in roots cells of the nicotianamine-free tomato mutant chloronerva iron precipitations occur as evidenced by energy dispersive X-ray analysis and the electron microscopic energy loss technique of energy spectroscopic imaging. Future research concerning the plant root's iron metabolism are needed to clarify the function of nicotianamine in intra- and intercellular iron trafficking and to identify the so-called iron-sensor which mediates the regulation of iron acquisition reactions of rhizodermal cells in response to the iron nutritional status of the plant.","Iron; Pools; Storage; Subcellular localization; Trafficking","iron; Lycopersicon esculentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036070099

In spite of the high reliability and simplicity of operation, the main disadvantages of this kind of power source are its pollution potential and fuel transportation costs. In a place like Antarctica environmental protection requirements are of prime importance. Apart from gas pollution, they also suffer from various other problems such as degradation of performance due to sub-zero temperature of operation, noise pollution, solidification of lubricants and mechanical wear and tear. Fuel cells find an ideal application for alternate energy solution, and can maintain the pristine nature of Antarctica. With this objective in mind, Research & Development Establishment (Engineers), Pune, Defence Research & Development Organisation, Ministry of Defence, Government of India joined hands with Centre for Electro-Chemical & Energy Research, SPIC Science Foundation, Chennai and developed three prototype 500 W, 12 V, PEMFC fuel cell power sources for this application. PEMFC has been chosen for study and experimentation at Antarctica because the solid electrolyte Nafion-117 is used in this cell and the electro-chemical reaction is exothermic so that the fuel cell can be activated at low temperature. PEMFC was first installed and successfully demonstrated during the XVII Indian Antarctic Expedition. Further studies continued during the XVIII Indian Antarctic Expedition and a series of scientific experiments were conducted in the areas of optimisation of humidification, temperature for reactants (hydrogen and oxygen), elimination of existing humidification system, feasibility of provision of air-cooling system in lieu of water cooling system, humidifcation of gases using membrane as a medium, charging/discharging characteristics of a metal hydride container for hydrogen storage, and performance of a dc-dc converter and static inverter under sub-zero temperature of operation. Based on the results of these experiments, the design of the fuel cell power source for cold region application has been finalised. The paper deals with the design criteria and design factors to be considered for the fuel cell power source for cold region application and details of tests and test results that led to the final design concept for such an application. The paper also deals with a proposed hybrid power plant taking into account the exploitation of wind energy with a fuel cell and generation of hydrogen by an electrolyser and provision of hydrogen storage. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Hydrogen storage; Low temperature applications; System design","Electric power generation; Environmental protection; Low temperature operations; Pollution control; Polyelectrolytes; Polymeric membranes; Solid electrolytes; Wind power; Humidification; Power sources; Solid oxide fuel cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036534656

This proposed technique uses only a few sets of data (voltage, current, speed, power factor or torque if possible) from the field test of motor (on-site), instead of the no-load and blocked rotor tests, coupled with the genetic algorithm for evaluating the equivalent circuit parameters. Once these parameters are known it is possible to obtain the operating performances (50-100%) of the motor such as efficiency, current, torque. This technique could be suitable for the general purpose drive applications when the motor cannot operate at no-load since its shaft is permanently connected to its load.

As a result, the entire elevator system suffers a remarkable energy loss. This paper proposes an energy-saving elevator capable of storing regenerated energy and capable of discharging the stored energy during operation. The result is a highly efficient elevator system. This paper also focuses on three methods for elevator systems: load-leveling method, storage method, and energy-saving method.

This requires both technical and economic information. The relevant technical information is specified in concise form by the energy-power relation (Ragone-plot) of the ESD and its lifetime. The economic information is given in terms of operation costs (energy costs), investment costs, and the economic benefit created by operating the ESD. The NPV is expressed as a function of variables such as the size of the ESD. An appropriate choice of these variables maximizes the NPV. If the benefit is given in terms of the energy supplied by the ESD and the lifetime is operation independent, the optimization reduces to a minimization of the total lifecycle costs. In this case a knowledge of the economic benefit, which is often the quantity that is most difficult to model, is not required. In more general cases, e.g. if the lifetime depends on optimization variables, a quantification of the benefit is necessary in order to maximize the NPV. We illustrate the approach with various stationary and mobile applications, and for batteries and capacitors. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

King penguins rely essentially on myctophid fish, which in summer are mostly available 400 to 500 km south of the Crozet Archipelago at the Antarctic Polar Front. Incubating male King penguins anticipate a possible delay in the return of the female by storing food in their stomach for several weeks, which enables them to feed the chick quickly if hatching occurs. We investigated the foraging trip duration, adult body mass regulation and the meal size for chicks relative to the laying date and the Polar Front position. We compared, in both early and late breeders, the energy content and the chemical and diet composition of the meals stored in their stomachs. During food storage by the male, the cessation of digestive processes was not complete as the meal showed some modifications of the biochemical composition, especially a decrease in lipid content; this is in contrast to oil storage in albatrosses and petrels, in which there is an increase in lipid content. On average, females came back from their second foraging trip at sea a short time before hatching. However, the trip durations were particularly variable depending on date and year, and as a consequence hatching occurred with either the female or the male incubating the egg. Late breeders showed longer foraging trip duration and built up larger fuel reserves than early breeders. Their energetic output per day foraging at sea was much lower than for early breeders. These differences in foraging trip durations of males were linked to a change in marine resource availability because, in spite of being at the same stage of the breeding cycle, male late breeders caught different prey compared to male early breeders. We assume that this strategy of long-term food storage and conservation in the stomach while fasting evolved in response to the unpredictable variations of water mass positions.","Crozet; Diet composition; Ecophysiology; Food provisioning; Foraging trip; Pelagic seabird; Polar Front","body mass; diet; food provisioning; foraging behavior; seabird; Crozet Islands; Indian Ocean; Aptenodytes; Aptenodytes patagonicus; Aptenodytes patagonicus; Aves; Ciconiiformes; Gallus gallus; Spheniscidae; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037130153

Though theoretical and experimental studies including the test procedures are available to estimate the performances of these systems, detailed experimental studies showing the temperature profiles of the absorber plate, water temperature in the riser and water flow in the riser are few. This paper presents details of experimental observations of temperature and flow distribution in a natural circulation solar water heating system and its comparison with the theoretical models. The measured profile of the absorber temperature near the riser tubes (near the bottom and top headers) conforms well with the theoretical models. The values at the riser tubes near the collector inlet are found to be generally much higher than those at the other risers on a clear day, while on cloudy days, these temperatures are uniform. The mean absorber plate and mean fluid temperature during a day has been estimated and compared with theoretical models. The temperature of water near the riser outlets was found to be fairly uniform especially in cloudy and partly cloudy days at a given plane during a day. The temperature of water in the riser depends on its flow rate. Measurements of glass temperature were also carried out. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A flash lamp energy of 27 J/cm 2 was sufficient to form a ferroelectric crystal structure due to rapid thermal effects with little heat diffusion in the depth direction. This technique enabled PZT film crystallization in Pt/PZT/Pt structures on multi-Al wiring layers. Granular PZT grains were observed on Pt, Ru and RuO 2 electrodes, which indicates that crystal growth begins from the film surfaces.

Initial experimental feasibility of a zinc-sulfur electrochemical system is explored in a zinc anode/aqueous polysulfide/CoS electrocatalytic cathode cell. Measured sustained cathode capacity approaches the theoretical 2 Faraday/sulfur limit. However, the anode tends to passivate due to the zinc sulfide discharge product, preventing sustained discharge.

The extreme operating conditions that occur in gas-storage and gas-producing wells could cause the cement sheath to fail, resulting in fluid migration through the annulus. Designing cement sheaths that can withstand the stresses induced by the various operations and maintain integrity during the life of the well will help minimize the risk of cement failure. A design procedure has been developed to estimate the risk of cement failure as a function of cement sheath and formation properties and well-stress loading. A few examples of the loading are cement hydration, pressure testing, gas injection, and gas production. The design procedure simulates the sequence of events from drilling to cement hydration, hydraulic fracturing, injection, production, etc. Cement failure modes simulated are de-bonding, cracking, and plastic deformation. An appropriate nonlinear material model, including cracking and plasticity, is used in the analysis. The sustained casing pressure observed on a number of wells after they have been put on production emphasizes the need to design a cement sheath that will maintain integrity during the life of the well. Field cases and applications are discussed. From the process discussed in this paper, one can estimate the risk of failure of different cement systems and select the system that can help minimize the overall cost. The process should improve the economics of constructing and producing gas and oil wells and also improve the safety due to the reduced risk of zonal isolation failure.",,"Computer simulation; Costs; Elastic moduli; Finite element method; Gas fuel storage; Hydration; Natural gas well drilling; Plant shutdowns; Plastic deformation; Problem solving; Stresses; Tensile strength; Well cementing; Completion fluids; Steam injection wells; Natural gas wells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642500864

The suitability of cultivars for extrusion cooking is important in this regard. To supply information useful to maize breeders and processors, biophysical (endosperm texture and hardness) and biochemical (protein and starch composition) properties of kernels, grits and extruded curls of several commercial maize cultivars were determined and related to extrusion performance. Results show that extrusion alters protein hydrophobicity and degree of aggregation, though differently between cultivars. Under conditions of this study, grits from harder maize expand more, consume less energy upon extrusion, and cook more rapidly than do grits from softer maize. These behaviors appear related to differing protein compositions and endosperm textures of cultivars. Results also suggest that reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of zeins (the storage prolamin proteins of maize) may be valuable for predicting end-use properties of extruded maize products, and as a quality estimator during maize breeding. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The influx of nutrients and energy in the soil was increased by addition of fertiliser nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium and of labile carbon (sugar). In addition, two bactericides (penicillin and streptomycin) and a fungicide (benomyl) were applied to manipulate the bacterial and fungal component of the soil. Experiments were carried out in a factorial design with repeated additions over four growing seasons. The present study investigated the nematode fauna and the effects of the manipulations on the abundance of nematode species.

ASP also appears to have a role in the regulation of energy balance. In addition to its role as a hormonal regulator of body weight and energy expenditure, leptin is now implicated as a regulatory molecule in lipid metabolism. However, little is known about the alterations in fasting plasma ASP and leptin concentrations in the nephrotic syndrome. As hyperlipidemia is one of the most striking manifestations of the nephrotic syndrome, we have investigated fasting plasma ASP and leptin levels and their relation to lipid levels in this syndrome. Twenty-five patients with untreated nephrotic syndrome and 25 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched healthy controls were included in the study. Fasting plasma lipoproteins, TG, total cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein A1 (apoAl), apoB, urinary protein, plasma albumin, third component of complement (C3), ASP, and leptin levels were measured in both groups. Total cholesterol, TG, low and very low density lipoproteins, lipoprotein(a), apoB, and urinary protein levels were increased in the patient group, whereas plasma albumin, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apoAI levels were decreased compared with those in the control group (P &lt; 0.001). Plasma ASP levels were significantly higher in the patient group compared with the control subjects (133.72 ± 65.14 vs. 29.93 ± 12.68 nmol/liter; P &lt; 0.001), whereas leptin (2.69 ± 2.06 vs. 3.99 ± 2.99 ng/ml; P = 0.118) and C3 (1.01 ± 0.25 vs. 1.06 ± 0.23 g/liter; P = 0.662) levels were not significantly different between the two groups. Plasma leptin levels were correlated with body mass index in both nephrotic patients (rs = 0.86; P &lt; 0.001) and controls (rs = 0.98; P &lt; 0.001), but were not correlated with the other parameters. Fasting ASP concentrations showed no correlation with body mass index, proteinuria, plasma albumin, leptin, or any lipid parameter in either group, but C3 levels (in patient group: rs = 0.92; P &lt; 0.001; in control group: rs = 0.68; P &lt; 0.001). Our findings showed that plasma ASP levels were significantly elevated, whereas leptin levels were normal in the nephrotic syndrome. Increased ASP levels in the setting of dyslipidemia in the nephrotic syndrome raise the possibility of an ASP receptor defect in adipocytes, which also suggests the existence of so-called ASP resistance. Moreover, it is possible that ASP activity is maximal, but cannot keep up with increased rates of lipid production by the liver. Thus, further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism or source (adipocytes, the liver, or both) of elevated ASP concentrations in the nephrotic syndrome.",,"acylation stimulating protein; apolipoprotein A; apolipoprotein B; complement component C3; leptin; lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; adolescent; adult; article; body mass; body weight; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; controlled study; diet restriction; energy balance; energy expenditure; female; human; hyperlipidemia; lipoprotein blood level; lipoprotein metabolism; male; nephrotic syndrome; priority journal; proteinuria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036171891

The photosystem I photochemical activity (energy storage, photoinduced P700 redox changes) was examined in a petJ-null mutant of Synechocystis PCC 6803. Surprisingly, photosystem I activity in the petJ-null mutant grown in the absence of copper was not much affected. However, in a medium with a low inorganic carbon concentration and with NH4+ ion as nitrogen source, the mutant displayed growth inhibition. Analysis showed that, especially in the latter, the isiAB operon, encoding flavodoxin and CP43′, an additional chlorophyll a antenna, was strongly expressed in the mutant.

Seastars from an intertidal population from the Maori Bay (North Island) and 2 shallow subtidal-intertidal sites in Otago Harbour on the east coast of the South Island had split, were asymmetrical, had multiple madreporites and skewed sex ratios when gonads were present. In contrast, none of the populations from 13 subtidal populations from the fjords on the west coast or a subtidal population from Stewart Island had characters indicating that they had recently split. Examination of genetic diversity using allozymes agreed with morphological interpretations; the populations from the Maori Bay and the east coast (Otago Harbour) had significantly lower genotypic diversity than expected, while the fjord populations had genotypic diversity that conformed to expectations under sexual outcrossing. We investigated the effects of food supply and fluctuating temperature on growth, energy storage, gonad development and fission of C. muricata from a fissiparous population in Otago Harbour. Growth, gonad development and the pyloric caeca index increased with increased food supply. No effects were found due to the fluctuating temperature regime. Fission occurred in all treatments except when the seastars were starving, as indicated by decrease in size. Gonad development and energy storage under intermediate food supply were similar to measurements of individuals in the field, and suggest food limitation for the population studied. Since fissiparity decreases with increasing size in C. muricata and growth rates and gonad development increase with supply of food, we propose that the occurrence of apparently fewer fissiparous individuals in habitats where food is abundant is correlated to food supply. Rapid growth would allow individuals to more quickly reach the size threshold at which fission begins to be suppressed. Conversely, where food supply or feeding time is limiting growth, the pattern would be a relative increase in abundance of small fissiparous individuals. However, populations from the fjords and Stewart Island do not seem to undergo fission at all. A possible explanation could be that the asexual mode of reproduction of this species is not triggered in the sheltered subtidal fjord environment. Another possibility could be that natural selection acts against asexual reproduction by fission in the fjord environment, or that the ability to split was lost due to founder effects and random genetic drift when the fjords were successively colonised following the rise in sea level after the last ice-age.","Allozymes; Asexual/clonal reproduction; Asteroidea; Echinodermata; Fissiparity; Fjord; Genotypic diversity; New Zealand","allozyme; asexual reproduction; echinoderm; food supply; genotype; sexual reproduction; temperature effect; Maori Bay; New Zealand; North Island; Asterias; Asteroidea; Coscinasterias; Coscinasterias muricata; Coscinasterias muricata; Echinodermata; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037150382

Thus, understanding the dielectric and electrical properties under an ac signal drive in these antiferroelectric thin-film compositions, such as lead zirconate thin films, and the effect of donor doping on them is very necessary. For this purpose, thin films of antiferroelectric lead zirconate and La-modified lead zirconate thin films with mole % concentrations of 0, 3, 5, and 9 have been deposited by pulsed excimer laser ablation. The dielectric and hysteresis properties have confirmed that with a gradual increase of the La content, the room- temperature antiferroelectric lead zirconate thin films can be modified into ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. ac electrical studies revealed that the polaronic related hopping conduction is responsible for the charge transport phenomenon in these films. With a La content of ≤3 mole % in pure lead zirconate, the conductivity of the films has been reduced and followed by an increase of its conductivity for a ≥3% addition of La to lead zirconate thin films. The polaronic activation energies are also found to follow a similar trend as that of the conductivity.",,"lanthanum; zirconium derivative; article; conductance; device; dielectric constant; doping; electricity; energy; excimer laser; film; hysteresis; pulsed electric field; signal transduction; temperature dependence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036574678

The SMES unit is located at the induction generators' terminal bus, for exchanging real and reactive powers in four quadrants, with the wind-diesel system. The system components are modelled by non-linear equations for accurate dynamic performance assessment and the SMES unit is modelled as a controllable current source. The control of the SMES unit is exercised through a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) self-tuning regulator (STR). The STR uses the local voltage and frequency measurements and generates appropriate signals for the control of the SMES unit. The SMES coil current deviation forms a part of one of the regulated variables of the STR for achieving a continuous control. The complete model of the hybrid system is developed and the parameters of the STR are adjusted for quality improvement of the power supply under turbulent wind. The scheme is then tested for load disturbances. The simulation results show the positive impact of the proposed scheme on the quality of the power supply both under turbulent wind as well as load disturbances.

The great diversity of prey species in striped marlin stomachs confirms their generalist feeding pattern with a high predatory capacity, foraging mainly on epipelagic organisms from neritic and oceanic zones. According to the index of relative importance (IRI), the most important prey were the chub mackerel Scomber japonicus (28%), California pilchard Sardinops caeruleus (27%), and jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas (7.7%), contributing up to 80% of the energy for striped marlin in this area. Analysis of the energetic dynamics suggested that major energy intake and storage of energy in the muscle, and ovary occur during the summer (August 1994). The southern Gulf of California is a migration zone of the striped marlin, in which the smaller marlin are consuming and storing energy to be prepared for reproduction, which may occur in an area, reported but unverified, south of the southern tip of Baja California (Revillagigedo Islands). © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Histological analysis, combined with oocyte examination and measurements of carbohydrate, protein, total lipid, and triacylglycerides levels from gonadal tissue, digestive gland, and adductor muscle were performed. One-way ANOVA was used for assessing differences in the area of oocytes over time. Similarly, a two-way ANOVA was applied for differences in the biochemical composition of specimens over time and sex. The gametogenic cycle was affected by the presence of ""La Niña"" cold event during the first half of 1999. Gametogenesis commenced early in February and occurred synchronously throughout the annual cycle. There were two reproductive peaks, one in spring (March to May) and other in summer (July to September). A massive spawning was observed in September-October when water temperature was 29-29.5°C. Carbohydrates, either stored or obtained from ingested food, were used as an immediate fuel for the production of oocytes, which grew and increased their protein content during the first half of the year. Lipids and triacylglycerides also showed two important peaks in the female gonadal tissue and digestive gland, corresponding to the same peaks described histologically. Reserves stored in the muscle and digestive gland were actively used for gametogenesis. Muscle proteins were mobilized to the gonad during the first half of the year, while carbohydrates were used during the second half. The digestive gland acted as a short-term storage site of carbohydrates and lipids during gonad development. More studies on seasonal changes and energy storage and mobilization in pearl oysters are required, especially involving the participation of the mantle tissue.","Bahía de La Paz; Gametogenesis; Metabolism; Pearl oysters; Pinctada mazatlanica; Temperature","biochemical composition; gametogenesis; mollusc; Bivalvia; Pinctada mazatlanica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036071346

The increased nitrite release associated with liposome administration led us to investigate the interactions between liposome supply and nitric oxide (NO) production through the use of L-NAME, a non-selective inhibitor of NO synthesis. Methods: Twenty-four livers from fasted rats were stored for 18 h at +4°C in University of Wisconsin solution directly (control group) or after infusion with ATP-containing liposomes (Lip-ATP), L-NAME (L-NAME) or both (Lip-ATP-L-NAME). Metabolic fluxes, cell volume and energy state were studied during reperfusion. Results: After storage, nitrite release was increased by 61% in the Lip-ATP group, markedly decreased in the Lip-ATP-L-NAME group and almost abolished in the L-NAME group. The ATP content was increased by 20% in the Lip-ATP group (P < 0.05 versus control) and on reperfusion this was associated with an increase in cell volume (17%; P < 0.05) and a decrease in branched-chain amino acid release (21%; P < 0.01). The simultaneous addition of L-NAME did not affect these results, but induced a large (6-fold) increase in glucose production, possibly related to the metabolism of glycerol supplied by the liposomes. In the L-NAME group, global amino acid release was 50% lower and was associated with a dramatic decrease in urea production while the energy state deteriorated rapidly. Conclusions: The improvement in energy state and anabolic cell swelling induced by ATP-containing liposomes seems to be independent of NO synthesis. On the other hand, inhibition of NO synthesis appears to exert a detrimental effect on the liver, presumably through the decrease in hepatic energy content.","Cell volume; L-NAME; Liposomes","adenosine triphosphate; branched chain amino acid; glucose; glycerol; liposome; n(g) nitroarginine methyl ester; nitric oxide; nitrite; urea; amino acid synthesis; animal tissue; article; cell volume; controlled study; cryopreservation; encapsulation; energy metabolism; gluconeogenesis; liver function; liver preservation; male; nonhuman; priority journal; protein metabolism; rat; reperfusion; urea cycle; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Cryopreservation; Energy Metabolism; Enzyme Inhibitors; Glucose; Liposomes; Liver; Liver Function Tests; Male; Models, Animal; NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester; Nitric Oxide; Organ Preservation; Proteins; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Urea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036741546

It is crucial for the performance as well as the reliability of the hard-disk drive to maintain precisely the optimal distance (flying height) between the disk and the read/write elements. With continuously increasing recording densities, the flying height is decreasing and will be &lt;10 nm in the next few years. This paper discusses the feasibility of thin-film microresistors integrated into the air-bearing surface (ABS) of standard sliders for in situ flying-height control. Microresistor loops can be realized in only a few fabrication steps, which can be added to a standard slider manufacturing process. The powered microresistor transfers thermal energy into the slider, leading to deformations of its ABS. As a consequence of such deformations, a variation of the flying height was observed. The polarity of the actuation, towards or away from the spinning disk, can be defined by the microresistor geometry and fabrication process. Simulations confirm that shape changes of the ABS induced by microresistor heating are responsible for the actuation. Reproducible flying-height variations of 2.3 nm have been confirmed by means of white light interferometry, and actuation efficiencies of 23 nm W-1 were achieved.","Flying-height actuation; Flying-height simulations; Hard-disk drive; Head/disk interface; Microheater; Slider deformation","Computer simulation; Hard disk storage; Interferometry; Mechanical variables control; Microactuators; Microelectronic processing; Resistors; Thin films; Air bearing sliders; Air bearing surface; Microheater induced slider deformations; Microresistor heating; Nanometer scale control; Polarity; Slider-to-disk spacing; Thin film microresistors; Microelectromechanical devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037103984

With the aim of automatic control, a fuzzy-logic system was developed on the basis of the collected knowledge of skilled vinegar brewers. In a first step, this fuzzy system was to assess the actual adaptation degree of the bacteria on the basis of data from robust and reasonably priced sensors. From this information an appropriate setpoint value for the inhibiting factor 'final acid concentration' was derived for each batch cycle. As a result a further acid tolerance was found after several batch cycles. This adaptation effect should be used to increase the product concentration to more than 20 g per 100 ml acetic acid with a high productivity. The stepwise adapted culture was productive over the aimed acetic acid concentration, a 10% improvement of the product formation rate could be found compared with the status before conditioning. High product concentration and increased productivity finally result in shorter cycle times, less transport and storage volumes, an improved utilization of energy and material resources, and, last but not least, they are an essential steps towards the fulfillment of economical and ecological demands. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

They therefore proffer an ideal source in the universal quest for compact, lightweight, long-lasting alternatives for batteries to power the ever-proliferating electronic devices. The motivation lies in the need to power, for example, equipment for infantry troops, for weather stations and buoys in polar regions which need to signal their readings intermittently to passing satellites, unattended over long periods, and many others. Fuel cells, converters based on miniaturized gas turbines, and other systems under intensive study, give rise to diverse practical difficulties. Thermoelectric devices are robust, durable and have no moving parts, but tend to be exceedingly inefficient. We propose regenerative combustion systems which mitigate this impediment and are likely to make high performance small-scale thermoelectric power generation applicable in practice. The efficiency of a thermoelectric generating system using preheat when operated between ambient and 1200 K is calculated to exceed the efficiency of the best present day thermoelectric conversion system by more than 20%.",,"Combustion; Electric converters; Fuel cells; Hydrocarbons; Numerical analysis; Thermoelectricity; Regenerative combustion systems; Thermoelectric power generation; Power generation",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037036566

In this paper, the cyclic properties of the Ti-Cr-V alloys are investigated in view of the crystal structure of the β protide phase, which was measured at the point after desorbing at the plateau region and the thermal stability of the γ protide phase, which was measured at the point immediately before desorbing at the desorption region. It was found that the crystal structure of the β phase was changed from BCC phase to BCT phase and the c/a increased with increasing the cycle number. This difference of the crystal structure of the β phase suggests that the lattice can't gradually contract to a-axis direction at absorbing process with increasing the cycle number. Furthermore, it was found that the absorption-desorption cycle process causes the declined slope of the ΔH plots due to existence of the different γ protides of different thermal stabilities. Namely, this result suggests that site energies of protium in the lattice have a distribution after absorption-desorption cycles.","Body centered cubic; Body centered tetragonal; Hydrogen storage alloy; Slope of ΔH plots; Titanium-chromium-vanadium alloy; β protide phase; γ protide phase","Absorption; Crystal structure; Desorption; Lattice constants; Solid solutions; Absorption-desorption cycles; Titanium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036874306

For the 20,438 ha watershed in the vicinity of the power project, the total C storage is 3.84 Mt C (14.10 Mt CO2) while C sequestration based on biomass change was 47.35 kt C (173.77 kt CO2). Relative to power plant emission, the C stored in the reserve is equivalent to more than 22 years of CO2 emission. Annual C sequestration is 27% of CO2 emission per year. For the next 25 years, two scenarios were projected. Under Scenario I (""Business as Usual""), the forest reserve will be able to store and sequester more than 32 years of CO2 emission from the power plants. Under Scenario II (""Accelerated Reforestation""), the reserve will be able to store and sequester about 34 years of CO2 emission. In addition, the rate of C sequestration based on biomass change in vegetation was recorded to assess the optimum land use that can absorb the carbon dioxide emitted by the power project. These are as follows: tree plantations (10.09 tC/ha/yr)&gt;coconut (4.78 tC/ha/yr)&gt;brushland (4.29 tC/ha/yr)&gt;natural forest (0.92 tC/ha/yr). In terms of cost, the power project operator is spending P1.22 per t CO2 (P4.4 or US$0.12 per tC for every year of C storage and sequestration. For 25 years, the total cost is P30.40 per tCO2 (P111.5 or US$2.94 per tC) which is comparable to the cost of C offset in other tropical countries. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We questioned whether such complications also occur in other races. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was performed in an outpatient clinic of a university teaching hospital with 156 Koreans, divided into HIV-infected subjects receiving HAART (n = 57, group 1), HAART-naïve subjects (n = 42, group 2), and healthy controls (n = 57, group 3). Lipodystrophy was assessed by physical examination and questionnaire and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Fasting triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, free fatty acid (FFA), Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), glucose, insulin, c-peptide, leptin, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), CD4, CD8 lymphocyte counts and HIV RNA load were measured. Results: Lipodystrophy was observed in only 3.5% of HAART-treated HIV-infected Koreans. No statistical difference in regional fat accumulation or peripheral fat wasting was observed between groups 1, 2 and 3. No statistical difference in triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, FFA, ApoA1, ApoB, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, leptin, cortisol, and DHEA were observed between groups 1, 2 and 3. HDL cholesterol was significantly lower in HIV-infected individuals compared to controls. Conclusions: Lipodystrophy, hyperlipidaemia, and insulin resistance are rare metabolic complications of HAART in an oriental HIV-infected group of individuals.

The present paper concentrates on the extent of endogenous lipolysis in selected (milled) raw materials and mixed feeds for pigs, as influenced by heat treatment, storage time and conditions and lipase and/or emulsifier addition. In 10 commercial compound feeds (closed formula, containing 20 to 50 g/kg fat) analyzed within 4 months after production, lipolysis (g FFAs/kg TFAs, total fatty acids) ranged from 210 to 770. In nine compound feeds (open formula) used in our own digestion experiments, lipolysis ranged from 250 to 850 g FFAs/kg TFAs, after 6 months of storage at 20°C. In diets containing no exogenous lipases, lipolysis was less pronounced. The type of lipase added, greatly influenced the extent of lipolysis. In addition, the kinetics of lipolysis were followed during storage of compound feeds for piglets and growing pigs (storage from zero to 56 days at -25, 5 and 20°C) containing either soy oil, medium chain triacylglycerols or rendered fats and all or not exogenous lipases. The data revealed that freezing could eliminate lipolysis, while at 5°C, only small differences in lipolysis compared with storage at room temperature were noted. Lipolysis amounted to 600-700 g FFAs/kg TFAs at day 56. The highest values were noted for diets containing an exogenous lipase and/or an emulsifier. Lipolysis was further studied in 29 milled feedstuffs, during storage from 0 to 56 days at room temperature. The extent of lipolysis was most pronounced for cereals (high, up to 600 g FFAs/kg TFAs), intermediate for thermal treated materials (e.g. soy products, 150 g FFAs/kg TFAs) and low for fish products (80 g FFAs/kg TFAs) and milk products (50 g FFAs/kg TFAs). Both endogenous and added fat was hydrolyzed, while no obvious substrate specificity was noted. Appropriate measures should be taken to delay or retard endogenous lipase activity in test feeds if long-lasting experiments (e.g. several weeks or months, to measure digestibility or energy content of fat; performance tests) have to be done with the same batches of prepared feeds. Also, the addition of lipases to manipulate fat digestion, should be carefully advised, in order to prevent an excessive endogenous lipolysis, already in the feed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Chemical heat pumps represent a new technology with great potential to reduce the energy consumption in very different sectors. They can provide the ability to capture the rejected low-grade heat and to reuse it at increased temperature levels in various industrial processes. Heat can be removed from a heat source at low-temperature by an endothermic reaction and can be boosted to a heat sink at high-temperature by an exothermic reaction. Since chemical heat pumps can operate without compression, with less electrical power and at higher temperature levels compared to conventional heat pumps, they can afford high performance advantages. As an additional advantage, energy storage can also be accomplished so that intermittent energy sources can be utilized in a chemical heat pump system. The objective of this work was to study methanol-formaldehyde-hydrogen, ethanol-acetaldehyde-hydrogen, i-propanol-acetone-hydrogen and n-butanol-butyraldehyde-hydrogen chemical heat pump systems based on catalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols at low-temperature and hydrogenation of aldehydes and a ketone at high-temperature. On the base of economic analysis, the quantity of waste-heat that must be supplied to produce the benefits of the process heat and also the improvement in the net gain reached were determined and compared. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that, negative sequence current and 2nd harmonic power will be injected into system, when conventional symmetrical fire is used in Power Conditioning System (PCS) of SMES. Two indices are used to evaluate the performance of PCS of SMES: the relative error of average value and 2nd harmonic component of active power supplied by SMES. To improve the performance of SMES, symmetrical vector control is put forward in this paper. According to the objective, there are three kinds of symmetrical vector control: positive sequence voltage control, zero negative sequence current control and constant active power control. Their principles are presented and improvements on the performance of SMES are verified by electro-magnetic transient simulation. It shows that all those three methods decrease the relative error of average value of active power supplied by SMES. Zero negative sequence current control and constant active power control can also limit the relative error of 2nd harmonic component of active power supplied by SMES effectively.","Asymmetrical voltage; Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES); Symmetrical fire; Symmetrical vector control","Capacitors; Computer simulation; Digital to analog conversion; Electric current control; Electric energy storage; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Error compensation; Numerical analysis; Power control; Voltage control; Asymmetrical voltage; Electromagnetic transient simulation; Power conditioning system; Superconducting magnetic energy storage; Symmetrical fire; Symmetrical vector control; Voltage source type; Superconducting magnets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036509590

The difference in performance is attributed to improved methods used for calculating the net radiation and the wind function. The simpler formulation of the finite difference model is considered to offset the disadvantage of the greater number of calculations required. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Several new HMW-GS and ω-gliadins that characterise this population were identified. The potential of this local variety for biscuit production was evaluated using 150 derived pure lines cultivated over three consecutive years. The use of various indirect tests and storage protein analysis allowed us to select 98 lines to study biscuit value (sweet-biscuit). The sweet-biscuit parameters studied were the speed and energy of dough extrusion, cooking time, dough temperature, and biscuit mass before and after cooking, length, thickness, width, density and surface appearance of the biscuit. These parameters were related to the technological characteristics as evaluated by mixograph and alveograph analysis as well as grain hardness, starch damage levels, protein content, relative viscosity of the pentosans, storage protein alleles, Zeleny test, flour yield and thousand kernel weight of grains. As the 'Barbela' lines were all of the soft type, our study demonstrated that grain hardness did not significantly influence the parameters of the biscuit test. Multiple regression analysis showed that protein content was the main variable accounting for the quality potential of the soft wheats selected for biscuit value. Protein content was negatively correlated with machinability (the ratio of extrusion speed/energy of dough extrusion), length and surface appearance of the biscuit. Moreover, the relative viscosity of the water-soluble pentosans was important for several biscuit parameters such as surface appearance and extrusion time. The variables of the mixograph generally correlated well with several biscuit parameters. Conversely, alveograph parameters did not show any significant correlation with the biscuit test. The variation observed in 'Barbela' lines for extrusion energy, length, density and surface appearance in the biscuit test were significantly influenced by the Glu-1 locus. This study allowed us to define additional criteria for predicting sweet biscuit value in a soft wheat progeny. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Biscuit-making quality; Soft wheat; Storage proteins; Triticum aestivum","Triticum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036738012

It stores well chewed and salivated food in amounts as needed for one to three hours or longer. The forestomach supplies its content for further digestion independently from its filling degree but in relation to the host's actual energy need during the light period or lipid metabolism during the dark period. Postprandial hyperglycemia and glycogen increase in the liver is lacking. Animals ingest most of their daily food during darkness. Meal frequency increases while the amount of food stored in the forestomach is hardly influenced. However, extremely high food demand or limitation of feeding time leads to increased filling per meal of the forestomach by four times and more, but in relation to ""eating for calories"". The brain's appetite-regulating-network and signals which mechanically record the distension of the forestomach-stomach-cavity determine the ingested volume. In leptin-deficient Lepob/Lepob mice the filling volume of the forestomach per meal increases up to five times during the night and twice during the day. The frequency of meals declines. Emptying of the forestomach is controlled by a local feed back loop between duodenal reabsorption and the tension of the forestomach muscle fibres linked by humoral signals such as secretin and cholecystokinin. During storage in the forestomach food pap is subjected to digestion of starch, fat and chitin, but none of cellulose or protein can be observed. Microorganisms are without significance for the forestomach's function as shown in germ-free animals. Lactobacillae dominate in the variety of organisms lodged there.

The load-shedding scheme and the tie line tripping strategy by using the frequency relays have been designed to prevent the power system from collapse when an external fault of utility power system occurs. An actual external fault case and a simulated internal fault case have been selected to verify the accuracy of load shedding scheme by executing the transient stability analysis. To improve the frequency and voltage responses, an SMES unit with various control modes has been installed in the cogeneration system. The sensitivity analysis of SMES unit with different parameters is applied to achieve better system responses. Besides, an SMES unit with active power deviation as feedback signal is also considered to improve the electric power fluctuation of the study plant with rolling mills. It is found that the SMES system will enhance the electric power quality and minimize the economic losses of the cogeneration facility due to unnecessary load shedding.","Cogeneration; Superconducting magnetic energy storage; Transient stability","Electric fault currents; Electric loads; Energy storage; Feedback; Superconducting magnets; Transients; Transient stability; Cogeneration plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036966550

Nowadays, deciphering the genome of several species allows one to draw the evolutionary tree of this protein going back to 1800 millions of years, at a time when oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere. This permits to follow the evolution of the ancestral gene and of its product. It is likely that, only in complex multicellular species, transport and storage of oxygen became the main physiological function of this molecule. In addition, in unicellular organisms and small invertebrates, it is likely that the main function of this protein was to protect the organism from the toxic effect of O2, CO and NO. The very high oxygen affinity of these molecules, leading them to act rather as a scavenger as an oxygen carrier, supports this hypothesis. Haemoglobins from microorganisms, which may probably be the closest vestiges to the ancestral molecules, are divided into three families. The first one is made from flavohaemoglobins, a group of chimerical proteins carrying a globin domain and an oxido-reduction FAD-dependant domain. The second corresponds to truncated haemoglobins, which are hexacoordinated with very high oxygen-affinity molecules, 20-40 residues shorter than classical haemoglobins. The third group is made from bacterial haemoglobins such as that of Vareoscilla. Some specific structural arrangements in the region surrounding the heme are cause of their high oxygen affinity. In plants, two types of haemoglobins are present (non-symbiotic and symbiotic), that arose from duplication of an ancestral vegetal gene. Non-symbiotic haemoglobins, which are probably the oldest, are scarcely distributed within tissues having high energetic consumption. Conversely, symbiotic haemoglobins (also named leghaemoglobins) are present at a high concentration (mM) mostly in the rhizomes of legumes, where they are involved in nitrogen metabolism. In some species, haemoglobin was proposed to be an oxygen sensor bringing to the organism information to adjust metabolism or biosynthesis to the oxygen requirement. Elsewhere haemoglobin may act as final electron acceptors in oxido-reduction pathways. Evolution of haemoglobin in invertebrates followed a large variety of scenarios. Some surprising functions as sulphide acquisition in invertebrates living near hydrothermal vents, or a role in the phototropism of worm need to be mentioned. In invertebrates, the size of haemoglobin varies from monomers to giant molecules associating up to 144 subunits, while in vertebrates it is always a tetramer. In some species, several haemoglobins, with completely different structure and function, may coexist. This demonstrates how hazardous may be to extrapolate the function of a protein from only structural data. © 2002 Académie des sciences / Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.","Evolution; Haemoglobin; Myoglobin; NO•; Oxygen","carbon monoxide; carrier protein; chimeric protein; coordination compound; gene product; globin; heme; hemoglobin; leghemoglobin; nitric oxide; oxygen; polypeptide; protein subunit; scavenger; sulfide; evolution; amino acid sequence; binding affinity; biosynthesis; complex formation; energy consumption; human; hydrothermal vent; legume; molecular evolution; molecular size; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; oxygen consumption; oxygen transport; phototropism; protein analysis; protein domain; protein family; protein folding; protein function; protein structure; review; rhizome; symbiosis; Vitreoscilla; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Invertebrata; Vertebrata",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036915028

The native legumin possessed the most binding affinity for HxAc through its unique quaternary structure.

However, more precise selection of design parameters for efficient design of surface irrigation is required for higher irrigation efficiency and the accurate prediction of the infiltration rate is of prime importance. Furthermore, the infiltration parameters may be different in ordinary and every-other furrow irrigation in different inflow rates. Therefore, this research was conducted to determine the parameters of Lewis-Kostiakov infiltration equation in ordinary and every-other furrow irrigation with different inflow rates based on the data obtained in the advancing stage (method I) and in both advancing and storage stages (method II). The results indicated that the Lewis-Kostiakov equation should be modified for furrow irrigation with different inflow rates Q by multiplication of Qγ except for the first irrigation in which Q multiplication is not needed. However, the value of exponent γ is lower when all data from the advancing and storage stages (method II) are used for calculation of the infiltration parameters. It is also concluded that the infiltration parameters for every-other furrow irrigation are higher than those for ordinary furrow irrigation. Furthermore, the data from the advancing and storage stages (method II) are more appropriate for the calculation of infiltration parameters than the data from the-advancing stage (method I), due to the fact that in method II, data were calculated from complete furrow irrigation including advancing and storage stages. © 2002 Silsoe Research Institute.

We report on the impact of a null mutation of the acid α-glucosidase gene (AGLU-/-) in mice on the force production capabilities, contractile mass, oxidative capacity, energy status, morphology, and desmin content of skeletal muscle. Muscle function was assessed in halothane-anesthetized animals, using a recently designed murine isometric dynamometer. Maximal torque production during single tetanic contraction was 50% lower in the knockout mice than in wild type. Loss of developed torque was found to be disproportionate to the 20% loss in muscle mass. During a series of supramaximal contraction, fatigue, expressed as percentile decline of developed torque, did not differ between AGLU-/- mice and age-matched controls. Muscle oxidative capacity, energy status, and protein content (normalized to either dry or wet weight) were not changed in knockout mice compared to control. Alterations in muscle cell morphology were clearly visible. Desmin content was increased, whereas α-actinin was not. As the decline in muscle mass is insufficient to explain the degree in decline of mechanical performance, we hypothesize that the large clusters of noncontractile material present in the cytoplasm hamper longitudinal force transmission, and hence muscle contractile function. The increase in muscular desmin content is most likely reflecting adaptations to altered intracellular force transmission. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Cytoskeletal remodeling; Desmin; Lysosomal glycogen storage; Muscle disease; Muscle function assessment","animal tissue; article; citric acid cycle; electromyography; gene disruption; lean body weight; metabolic activation; mouse; muscle function; muscle isometric contraction; muscle mass; muscle weakness; nonhuman; priority journal; protein content; protein expression; Actinin; Adenosine Diphosphate; Adenosine Monophosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; alpha-Glucosidases; Animals; Body Weight; Desmin; Glucan 1,4-alpha-Glucosidase; Glycogen; Glycogen Storage Disease Type II; Inosine Monophosphate; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Fibers; Muscle Weakness; Muscle, Skeletal; Phosphocreatine; Stress, Mechanical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036263249

The recently completed Samanalawewa reservoir primarily generates hydropower while the Udawalawe reservoir, which was built in the 1960s, supplies water mainly for irrigation. With the addition of the Samanalawewa reservoir, located upstream of the Udawalawe reservoir, the Government of Sri Lanka is planning to increase the irrigated area of the Udawalawe reservoir. The Samanalawewa reservoir is expected to act as an additional storage for irrigation water supply. A study was carried out to investigate the operational behavior of these two reservoirs. The model used in the study is based on stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) and simulation techniques. Since, the direct application of SDP for two reservoirs is limited by the dimensionality of the problem, a sequential decomposition method is employed in the model. The algorithm employed breaks down the system into single-reservoir subsystems and subsequently, each subsystem's operation is individually optimized using a SDP based optimization model and then simulated using a reservoir operation simulation model. The results indicate the usefulness of optimization techniques in planning reservoirs and deriving operational policies for them. The inclusion of the Samanalawewa reservoir reduces the irrigation water supply deficits at the Udawalawe reservoir. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Such a process is a potential candidate for switching atmospheric carbon emissions directly to long term sequestration, thereby relieving the intermediate atmospheric burden. Given sufficient research justification, the argument is that harmful impact in both the Atmosphere and the biologically rich upper marine layer could be reduced. The paper aims to estimate the role that active intervention, through direct ocean CO2 storage, could play and to outline further research and assessment for the strategy to be a viable option for climate change mitigation. The attractiveness of direct ocean injection lies in its bypassing of the Atmosphere and upper marine region, its relative permanence, its practicability using existing technologies and its quantification. The difficulties relate to the uncertainty of some fundamental scientific issues, such as plume dynamics, lowered pH of the exposed waters and associated ecological impact, the significant energy penalty associated with the necessary engineering plant and the uncertain costs. Moreover, there are considerable uncertainties regarding related international marine law. Development of the process would require acceptance of the evidence for climate change, strict requirements for large industrial consumers of fossil fuel to reduce CO2 emissions into the Atmosphere and scientific evidence for the overall beneficial impact of ocean sequestration. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The magnitude of the spring snowmelt and its potential to flood exposed bedrock portions of the landscape control the energy budget in the early part of the summer. In wet years. Bowen ratios are low and increase over the growing season. The high latent heat fluxes early in the year are promoted by water pooled in bedrock depressions and stored in the shallow soil. The high evaporation rates deplete moisture storage by the end of July after which latent heat fluxes decrease so that Bowen ratios exceed unity until the end of the growing season. This regime differs from other subarctic terrain types with similar vegetation. Exposed and shallow Precambrian bedrock keeps water close to the topographic surface and available for evaporation. The low surface resistance of ponded water on the bedrock surface and high vapor pressure deficits are possible causes for the high evaporation rates in June and July. However, in drier years. when ponded snowmelt water is minimal, evaporation is small and sensible heat dominates the early summer energy budget to a much larger degree than is observed elsewhere in the subarctic. It then becomes a very arid landscape. High evaporation-to-precipitation ratios throughout the summer are an important feature of the western Canadian Shield subarctic region, and this feature has significant hydrological implications. It is normal for a moisture deficit to be created each summer. The magnitude of this moisture deficit is the primary control on hillslope runoff response to precipitation later in the summer and autumn.",,"energy budget; hillslope; hydrological cycle; subarctic region; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036012197

The rheological properties of suspensions flocculated by associating polymers end-capped with hydrophobic groups are studied in relation to the bridging conformation. The flow of flocculated suspensions is Newtonian at very low shear rates. The liquidlike responses in the limit of zero shear rates imply that the polymer bridges are constantly forming, breaking, and reforming in a quiescent state. Due to the weak affinity of polymer for the particle surface, the adsorption-desorption process reversibly takes place by thermal energy. At low polymer concentrations, the polymer chains effectively form bridges between particles. From the high storage modulus and short surface separation between particles, it is considered that one polymer chain is directly adsorbed onto two particles to bind them together, because the hydrophobic groups are incorporated on the ends. With increasing polymer concentration, the relaxation time decreases and surface separation increases. The suspensions with polymer at relatively high concentrations are highly elastic even under large strains in the nonlinear region. The particles may be connected by bridges of interchain associations that are soft and flexible. The main factor controlling the theology of suspensions is the bridging conformation, which varies strongly depending on the particle and polymer concentrations.",,"Adsorption; Binders; Colloids; Concentration (process); Conformations; Flocculation; Newtonian flow; Polystyrenes; Rheology; Strain; Thermal effects; Quiescent state; Suspensions (fluids)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037133859

Classification of accidental fuel releases into instantaneous, intermediate, and continuous categories is given on the basis of a quantitative criterion, which includes the fuel properties, storage conditions, and breach size. The criterion is presented in a complete form for gaseous outflows. The internal structure of burning clouds is revealed using the results of numerical modeling obtained for gaseous and two-phase fuel releases. It is shown that the fireball burning time can be presented as a unified dependence on the Froude number defined in terms of the release velocity and the fuel mass. The numerical results agree reasonably well with the experimental data available. The radiative structure of a fireball depends significantly upon the cloud scale. Consequences of large-scale accidents involving releases of hydrocarbon fuels are demonstrated by the case history of the catastrophe that occurred in 1989 near Ufa, Russia. This accident is analyzed and compared with two previous cases; similar features and the effects of these accidents are revealed. For sufficiently large masses of fuel released, the fluiddynamic impact caused by the buoyant flow is shown to introduce a further hazardous factor, in addition to shock waves and thermal radiation. The fluid-dynamic scenario of the accident and the associated method for estimation of the fuel mass and energy released are presented.

In this study we focused on the kinetics and fates of ammonia, urea and uric acid. The results showed that ammonia (TAmm: NH3+NH4+), and urea-N contents increased during final oocyte maturation. Urea-N excretion dominated the total nitrogenous end product formation in early embryos. Later, yolk TAmm levels increased in embryos and ammonia excretion was low. In the last part of the embryonic stage TAmm accumulation dominated, and was apparently due to yolk storage. Around hatching, the larval body tissues (larva with yolk-sac removed) accounted for 68% of whole animal urea-N accumulation, while TAmm levels increased predominately by yolk accumulation. Afterwards, ammonia excretion dominated and uric acid accumulation accounted for less than 1%. Urea, synthesised either through the ornithine-urea cycle, argininolysis or uricolysis, accounted for approximately 8% of total nitrogenous end product formation in yolk-sac larvae. The results suggested that a sequence occurred regarding which nitrogenous end products dominated and how they were handled. Urea excretion dominated in early embryos (&lt; 7 dPF), followed by yolk ammonia accumulation (7-12 dPF), and finally, ammonia excretion dominated in later embryonic and yolk-sac larval stages (&gt; 12 dPF). © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

So, many studies on slush ice as a thermal storage material have been done. We have also been studying a suspension (slush ice) made from an oil-water mixture by cooling and stirring. From our study results, it was found that an additive having both an amino group (-NH2) and a silanol group (-SiOH) was essential to form a suspension with high IPF without adhesion of ice to the cooling wall. Moreover, ice particles formed in the suspension were dispersed and granular, and did not stick to each other. In the present paper, we carried out experiments to clarify the characteristics of the suspension formation process. From a thermal analysis of the substance formed in the suspension by difference scanning calorimeter (DSC), it was found that the substance was not ice but a compound of ice and additive. Then, at a very small depression of freezing point (about 7°C) all water in the mixture could be frozen by using the additive. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd and IIR.

As the main problem is related to the increases of the CO2-concentration in the atmosphere, forests may be viewed as part of the alleviation of the problem through their function as (i) a source of biomass for energy production, which may replace fossil fuels and thus indirectly reduce CO2-emissions, and as (ii) carbon storage, since a growing forest extracts atmospheric CO2 and fixes it as carbon in biomass. In the Scandinavian forestry, logging residues are increasingly being used for energy production. In this paper the value of forests as a source of bioenergy is added to the traditional timber value. Formulated as a joint production model within the Faustmann framework, the effect of this addition on the optimal rotation length is discussed. Based on data for spruce, the dominant species in the Scandinavian forestry, it is demonstrated that the rotation length is shortened compared to the standard Faustmann model. Shorter rotation length implies less carbon storage. Therefore, in this model without explicit regard to the social carbon storage value of the forest, the gains in terms of the climate problem from utilisation of forest biomass for energy production are being diminished by the value of reduced carbon storage. The carbon value of the forest is then added to complete the model, with the effect of increasing the rotation length, a result that is well known in the literature. Finally, the empirical effects of the interaction of these two climate-related value elements of the forest are discussed.","Bioenergy; Climate; Forestry; Joint production","Biomass; Climate change; Fossil fuels; Wood fuels; Empirical effects; Forestry; biomass power; carbon sink; forestry; fuelwood; Scandinavia; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347926158

While the slow growth rate may be linked to the energetic demands of having a large brain, there are other important morphological and physiological linkages that may be adaptive, including the development of significant fat stores with which to buffer against episodic and periodic energetic stress. In this comparative analysis of the energetic burden of pregnancy among primates (including humans), the daily energy investment in the development of neonatal tissue is modeled. During pregnancy, larger primates, notably the Hominidae, invest a smaller proportion of their maternal daily nonmaintenance energy budget in fetal tissue with increasing energy budget, allowing diverse adaptations, including foraging strategies which include folivory and mixed patterns of food getting, and meat consumption. Humans have a similar proportion of maternal daily nonmaintenance energy budget invested in fetal tissue with increasing energy budget to other apes and have a diet which is of much higher quality than predicted for body size and metabolic needs. The combination of high diet quality and low proportion of maternal daily nonmaintenance energy budget invested in fetal tissue allows greater brain size relative to body weight at birth compared with all other primates, apart from chimpanzees, and higher birthweight and body fatness at birth for a given body size than other primate species. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"adaptation; article; birth weight; body fat; body growth; body size; body weight; brain size; chimpanzee; controlled study; diet; energy metabolism; fetus (anatomy); fetus growth; food intake; food quality; foraging behavior; homo sapiens; Homonidae; human; life history; lipid storage; maturity; meat; morphology; nonhuman; nutritional requirement; pregnancy; primate; priority journal; reproduction; stress; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Cebidae; Cercopithecidae; Embryonic and Fetal Development; Energy Metabolism; Female; Hominidae; Humans; Hylobatidae; Pregnancy; Primates; Hominidae; Homo; Homo sapiens; Pan (ape); Primates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036724217

In North Africa, these ecosystems are often degraded due to their economical importance in energy supply. In mountain woodlands this dependence on the tree is even stronger, like in the High Atlas mountains in Morocco. Because of the strong human impact that affects mountain tree species, and to prepare an efficient management of Moroccan forest resources, a clear evaluation is required of their biomass and nutrient content. It was in this scope that we studied the Juniperus thurifera woodland of Azzaden Valley (western High Atlas, Morocco), where these two parameters were estimated. The results presented here show that in spite of a strong degradation of the trees and severe climatic conditions, the aerial biomass is included in the brackets defined by other authors for this kind of ecosystem. The mean biomass was about 49 Mg ha-1 with 95% of woody organs. The nutrient concentration (calcium, nitrogen, potassium and magnesium) for the different components shows that Ca ≫ N &gt; K &gt; Mg in trunks/branches, branchlets and leaves, and K &gt; N &gt; Ca &gt; Mg in female cones. It appears that the strong concentration of calcium in all tissues (except in reproductive organs) participates in the neutralisation of top soil acidity through litterfall. The nutrient content study shows that Ca and N storage were significantly higher in trunks or branches (71.2 kg ha-1 for calcium and 43.5 kg ha-1 for nitrogen). For all elements, the nutrient content in leaves was significantly higher than the nutrient content in branchlets and female cones. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We conducted three studies to examine the utility of using mobile, field-based artificial streams to assess the effects of pulp and paper effluents on fish as required in the Canadian Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) program. When evaluated against criteria of environmental relevance, interpretability, scientific defensibility, and cost-effectiveness, mesocosms satisfied all criteria. Measured endpoints on fish survival, energy use (growth, gonad size) and energy storage (liver size, condition) were relevant to the detection and quantification of effluent effects on fish. Response patterns were similar to those reported in the literature for field surveys showing reduced gonad size and increased liver size in adult mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) and decreased growth of juveniles. The flexibility of the systems to measure effects in multiple, replicated treatments under controlled effluent exposure and ambient conditions of water quality, temperature and photoperiod provided data that could not be obtained at these sites using field assessment approaches. The repeatability of using the same mobile, mesocosm system of uniform design and operation at different mill sites and for different receiving environments was unique and contributed to consistent scientific evaluation and interpretation. These studies demonstrated that mesocosms produced good quality data that fit within the required regulatory context of the Canadian EEM program.","Artificial streams; Ecotoxicology; Endocrine disruption; Environmental effects monitoring; Mesocosms; Pulp mill effluent","industrial effluent; ecotoxicology; effluent; environmental monitoring; mesocosm; pollution effect; pulp and paper industry; article; Canada; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; energy conservation; energy consumption; environmental change; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; female; field experiment; fish; gonad; growth; liver size; male; medical literature; medical research; mesocosm; nonhuman; paper; photoperiodicity; priority journal; pulp mill; stream (river); survival; water contamination; water quality; cellular organisms; Fundulus; Fundulus heteroclitus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036128637

The model is based upon a consideration of the hydrogen-metal reaction kinetics (i.e., static equilibrium condition between adsorbed and absorbed hydrogen at the particle interface) and the hydrogen-hydrogen (H-H) interaction kinetics. The relationship between the slope, the pressure level and the length of plateau region of the P-C isotherms can be derived from this expression and this then enables us to understand the hydrogen reaction mechanism in the alloy powders. The model is found to fit very well with experimental data obtained on LaNi4.7Al0.3. It can be used to analyse the enthalpies for the hydride decomposition and hydride formation processes, and the slope changes for the two-phase (α and β) coexistence region. The average enthalpies (H/M = 0.02 to 0.9) for hydride decomposition and hydride formation of the LaNi4.7Al0.3 alloy are ΔHd = 34.5 kJ mol H2-1 and ΔHa = -31.8 kJ mol H2-1. The effect of lateral H-H interactions on the values of equilibrium pressure and variation of slope with temperature are discussed. H-H interactions contribute to the slope, and the slope of P-C isotherms will become lower when the degree of H-H interaction is high in the LaNi4.7Al0.3 alloy. The H-H interactions do not contribute to the hysteresis of P-C isotherms for hydrogen-absorbing alloys. It is proposed that hysteresis originates from energy differences rather than from entropy differences. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the possible age-related changes of the dynamic viscoelasticity in the disk are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that the dynamic viscoelastic properties of the disk change with age. Thirty-six disks from young-adult, adult, and mature-adult cattle were used for dynamic tensile tests. In all disks, the magnitudes of the complex modulus, the storage modulus, and the loss modulus increased as the frequency increased. The mature-adult disks had higher values of these moduli than did the younger disks. The loss tangent ranged from 0.1 to 0.3, which means that the disk has relatively large elasticity and relatively small viscosity. It was concluded that both the elasticity and viscosity of the disk increase with age. This may reflect age-related changes in biochemical composition.",,"aging; algorithm; animal; article; biomechanics; cattle; chemistry; elasticity; energy transfer; mechanical stress; metabolism; physiology; statistics; temporomandibular joint; tensile strength; viscosity; weight bearing; Aging; Algorithms; Animals; Biomechanics; Cattle; Elasticity; Energy Transfer; Statistics; Stress, Mechanical; Temporomandibular Joint Disk; Tensile Strength; Viscosity; Weight-Bearing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036716859

The cut-off points for inadequate waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) for men and women were 0.95 and 0.80, respectively. Results. Inadequate WHR was positively associated with age, cigarette smoking, body mass index, and inversely associated with education level, income and leisure physical activity in both men and women (p<0.05). Inadequate WHR was not associated with lipids, carbohydrates and total fiber intake. Positive association was found with inadequate WHR and spirits consumption among menopause women (p<0.001), and the consumption of four or more glasses of beer per day in men (p<0.001). Conclusion.

Here we examined the effects of c-myc overexpression on the expression of hepatocyte-specific transcription factor genes which regulate the expression of genes controlling hepatic metabolism. At 4 months after streptozotocin (STZ) treatment, most diabetic control mice were highly hyperglycaemic and died, whereas in STZ-treated transgenic mice hyperglycaemia was markedly lower, the serum levels of β-hydroxybutyrate, triacylglycerols and non-esterified fatty acids were normal, and they had greater viability in the absence of insulin. Furthermore, long-term STZ-treated transgenic mice showed similar glucose utilization and storage to healthy controls. This was consistent with the expression of glycolytic genes becoming normalized. In addition, restoration of gene expression of the transcription factor, sterol receptor element binding protein 1c, was observed in the livers of these transgenic mice. Further, in STZ-treated transgenic mice the expression of genes involved in the control of gluconeogenesis (phosphoenolpyruvate carbokykinase), ketogenesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase) and energy metabolism (uncoupling protein 2) had returned to normal. These findings were correlated with decreased expression of genes encoding the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 3γ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and retinoid X receptor. These results indicate that c-myc overexpression may counteract diabetic changes by controlling hepatic glucose metabolism, both directly by altering the expression of metabolic genes and through the expression of key transcription factor genes.","Glucose metabolism; Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3γ (HNF3γ); Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα); Sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c); Transgenic mice","Disease control; Fatty acids; Glucose; Glycerol; Insulin; Proteins; Streptozotocin (STZ) treatment; Genes; 3 hydroxybutyric acid; fatty acid; glucose; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase; Myc protein; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP); retinoid X receptor; sterol regulatory element binding protein; transcription factor; triacylglycerol; uncoupling protein 2; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; correlation analysis; energy; fatty acid blood level; gene expression regulation; gluconeogenesis; glucose utilization; hyperglycemia; ketogenesis; liver cell; liver metabolism; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; streptozocin diabetes; transgenic mouse; triacylglycerol blood level; Animals; Blood Glucose; Blotting, Northern; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; DNA-Binding Proteins; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucose; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-gamma; Liver; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Nuclear Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1; Streptozocin; Transcription Factors; Animalia; Mus musculus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037115756

The vehicle should climb to 17-20 km by mainly taking advantage of direct sun radiation and thereafter maintaining a level flight; during the night, a fuel cells energy storage system would be used. A computer program has been developed to design the platform by taking into account the solar radiation change over one year, the altitude, masses and efficiencies of the solar and fuel cells, and the aerodynamic performances. The parametric studies have shown how fuel cells and solar cells efficiency and mass have the most influence on the platform dimensions. A wide use of high modulus CFRP has been made in designing the structure in order to minimise the airframe weight. A first configuration of HELIPLAT® (HE-LIos PLATform) was worked out, following a preliminary parametric study. The platform is a monoplane with 8 brushless motors, a twin-boom tail type with a long horizontal stabilizer and two rudders. The airfoil coordinates at the root and along the wing span as well as the wing planform were optimised to achieve the best efficiency. Several profiles and wing plans have been analysed using the CFD softwares Xfoil and Vsaero. Several wind tunnel tests were carried out to compare the analytically predicted performances. A preliminary design of a scale-sized technological demonstrator was completed with the aim of manufacturing a proof-of-concept structure. A FEM analysis was carried by using the Msc/Patran/Nastran code to predict the static and dynamic behaviour of the UAV structure. © 2002 by Romeo and Frulla.",,"Aero-dynamic performance; Brushless motors; Energy storage systems; Predicted performance; Preliminary design; Static and dynamic behaviours; Unmanned air vehicle (UAVs); Wind tunnel tests; Aerodynamics; Brushless DC motors; Efficiency; Fuel cells; Gas fuel purification; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Sun; Planforms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896862858

Such foods should provide energy and other nutrients in the required proportions to promote health and nutrition of the army personnel. This study evaluated the effect of storage on the resistant starch (RS) content of selected ready-to-eat (RTE) foods, viz., vegetable kichidi, vegetable pulav, chicken pulav, mutton pulav, sooji halwa, upma, cauliflower peas curry and potato peas curry prepared by Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL). Resistant starch was quantified directly in the residues obtained after removing digested starch in simulated physiological conditions. Nutrient content and carbohydrate profile of the foods were also analysed. Nutrient content varied depending on the basic ingredients used in their preparation. Total starch ranged from 18-74% and dietary fibre 13-20%, respectively. Storage of 4 months resulted in a significant increase (P<0.05) in the RS content of all foods except mutton pulav. It appeared that in addition to processing methods used, duration of storage could be an important factor, affecting RS formation in RTE foods. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","Processed foods; Resistant starch; Storage","starch; article; carbohydrate analysis; dietary fiber; food; food processing; nutrient content; storage; Brassica oleracea var. botrytis; Gallus gallus; Pisum sativum; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036876544

When the control rod system is out of operation, the small absorber ball system is required to emergently shut down the reactor by means of boron carbide balls totally dropping into channels in the side reflector by gravity. Before the reactor re-operates, these small absorber balls must be conveyed from channels in the side reflector back to the ball storage vessels below the head of reactor pressure vessel by a pneumatic conveying process. Detailed design of the small absorber ball system was carried out, and all the components were manufactured. In order to check the performances of the small absorber ball system, a pneumatic conveying experiment and a hot test were carried out in the laboratory, and also a pre-operation of the small absorber ball system was verified on the reactor site at room temperature. Test data of the small absorber ball system show that all the parameters, including time of ball dropping, time of ball conveying back, indication of ball level in the ball storage vessel, gas flowrate, and valve operation states, are acceptable and reasonable.

We investigated whether neonatal monosodium glutamate (MSG) treatment, known to cause arcuate nucleus damage and adult-age obesity, alters energy balance in the first two postnatal weeks. Continuously recorded MR and core temperatures (Tc) show that MSG treatment disinhibits the periodic, sympathetically controlled, energy-saving drops of Tc and MR. Increased energy expenditure thus explains reduced body fat at normal lean body mass found in MSG-treated pups artificially nourished identically to controls. In MSG-treated mother-reared pups, lean body mass is additionally reduced, suggesting that MSG also reduces suckling. Plasma leptin levels are similar in controls and MSG-treated pups but higher per unit of fat mass in the latter. We conclude that the postweaning development of MSG obesity and depressed thermogenesis are preceded by an early phase of increased energy expenditure with decreased fat deposition during suckling age and hypothesize cell damage in the arcuate nucleus to be involved in both.","Arcuate nucleus; Juvenile rat; Leptin; Monosodium glutamate; Obesity; Torpor","glutamate sodium; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; arcuate nucleus; article; body fat; body mass; brain injury; cell damage; circadian rhythm; controlled study; energy balance; energy expenditure; lipid storage; metabolic rate; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; rat; suckling; thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036711132

Materials and methods: Sensitivity to killing by DNA-incorporated 3H and 125I decays, accumulated during storage in the gas phase of a liquid nitrogen tank, was determined by clonogenic survival assay. Results: Induction of a lethal event in the STRij-4-2.2, WEHI-22.1, and L5178Y-R cell lines required approximately 30 times more 3H than 125I decays. Hence, the same ratio of 3H to 125I decays was found irrespective of whether the cell lines contained mutant or wild-type p53 and irrespective of whether they underwent rapid interphase or mitosis-related apoptosis after irradiation. The 18-81 cell line differed in showing a ratio of around 21 and it is argued that this may be a consequence of v-ABL over-expression. The assumption that DNA-incorporated 3H and 125I decays are low- and high-LET-like events respectively was confirmed by the similar sensitivity of L5178Y-R and -S cells to killing by 125I decays in contrast with their difference in sensitivity to 3H decays. Conclusions: The difference in lethal effectiveness between DNA-incorporated 3H and 125I decays can be explained by the hypothesis that simple DSB (double-strand breaks) are non-lethal and that cell killing is attributable to complex DSB. The low-LET radiation-specific sensitization of L5178Y-S cells may reflect defective repair of a DNA lesion class (presumably simple DSB) that is differentially induced by high- and low-LET radiation and is non-lethal to cells with normal repair capacity.",,"DNA; iodine 125; tritium; animal cell; apoptosis; article; cell killing; cell regeneration; clonogenic assay; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA repair; interphase; linear energy transfer; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; radioisotope decay; radiosensitivity; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Colony-Forming Units Assay; DNA; DNA Damage; DNA Repair; Genes, abl; Genes, p53; Iodine Radioisotopes; Linear Energy Transfer; Lymphocytes; Mice; Mutation; Transformation, Genetic; Tritium; Animalia; Murinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036086399

We show the results of two independent experiments to characterise the variability of (a) H-FABP protein content, and (b) H-FABP mRNA level in various bovine muscles. The H-FABP protein content in Belgian Blue bulls was positively correlated with the oxidative potential of the muscle. The regulation of H-FABP mRNA expression by breeding factors was studied in Montbéliard cattle. Thirty bulls and 30 steers were assigned to four different slaughter age groups (4, 8, 12 and 16 months-of-age). Four or five animals of each sex were slaughtered at each age. At 8 months, bulls and steers were divided into groups of either restricted (R) or ad libitum (AL) access to feed. To induce compensatory growth (C), remaining R animals were allowed ad libitum access to feed between 12 and 16 months-of-age, as were remaining AL animals. Total RNA was extracted from muscle samples taken at slaughter, i.e. m. semitendinosus (ST; glycolytic), m. triceps brachii (TB; mixed) and m. splenius (SP; oxidative). Equal amounts of total RNA (20 μg) were assayed for H-FABP mRNA levels by Northern hybridisation. At any age investigated, H-FABP mRNA levels per total RNA unit were higher in SP than in ST (P < 0.01), as much as 3.5-fold at 16 months-of-age. In each muscle, although at different ages, H-FABP mRNA levels increased approximately two-fold (P < 0.05) with increasing age. Castration had no effect on H-FABP mRNA expression. H-FABP mRNA levels were lower (P < 0.01) in ST of R than AL or C animals. In conclusion, the H-FABP mRNA and protein levels are potentially good indicators of the muscle metabolic type at a given age. In bovine skeletal muscle, however, H-FABP mRNA expression was little affected by the nutritional level and not regulated by testicular steroids. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Applications which are based on the zero resistance of the superconducting state, those based on the transition between the superconducting and normal state, and those based on Josephson junctions. When speaking about energy applications the main interest is focused on the first and second regime. Electrical power applications have been a challenge for high-temperature superconductor (HTS) materials since their discovery. Today, however, the only power application that has been commercialized is superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) and all those units are based on NbTi technology at 4.2 K. Success of HTS devices in energy sector depends on developing materials to techno-economic maturity and organizing efficient production, making model tests of key components and proving reliability in endurance tests. In general superconducting power applications offer a number of benefits to the electrical system: increased energy efficiency, reduced equipment size, reduced emissions and flexible transmission and distribution.

However, the dielectric constant of BST films decreases with film thickness, which has become a serious problem for dynamic random access memory (DRAM) application. We found Fe doping of BST films to be remarkably effective for suppressing the decrease in dielectric constant down to the very thin film regime. As a result, a marked increase in the dielectric constant for thin BST films is achieved. Furthermore, we identify the site where the doped Fe ions are substituted in the crystal by means of electron standing wave method using SrTiO3 single crystal. The result shows that most of the Fe ions are substituted at B sites (Ti sites), which suggests that Fe ions as acceptors compensate donor electrons and reduce band bending. This is thought to be the most likely mechanism of the increase in dielectric constant caused by Fe doping.","(Ba,Si)TiO3; BST; Capacitor; Dielectric constant; Doping; DRAM; EDX; Fe; SrTiO3","Barium compounds; Capacitors; Doping (additives); Dynamic random access storage; Electrons; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Iron; Permittivity; Barium strontium titanate; Electron standing wave method; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036819063

The observed epithelial cells were: E-cells (embryonic), located in the distal portion of the hepatopancreal tubules, R-cells (resorptive) F-cells (fibrillar) and B-cells (blister or secretory), found in its intermediate and proximal regions. Two types of electron-dense granules (EDGs) were found frequently in the cells of the proximal portion of the hepatopancreal tubule. Both types of EDGs presented alternating concentric electron-dense and electron-lucent layers. In order to better characterize these granules, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) cytochemistry were performed. One type of spherical granule was seen inside vacuoles surrounded by an association of myelin-like membranes as well as some small membrane-bound vesicles. This type of granule neither presented detectable Ca and P on EDXA spectra nor G6Pase cytochemical reaction products. The second type of granule had O, P and Ca characteristic peaks. G6Pase cytochemical products were observed inside these structures and showed that this mineralized type was surrounded by endoplasmic reticulum membranes. This result suggests that in U. cordatus the endoplasmic reticulum is associated with the genesis of mineralized EDGs. While amorphous mineral granules may be associated with a storage of Ca and P for the new carapace synthesis, EDGs covered by the non-mineralized spherical multi-layered membranes may be associated with late endosomes. No specific secretory pathway however was determined for the EDGs at the epithelial proximal portion. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The target energy of the hard X-rays is 0.1-1 MeV where conventional light sources cannot provide the sufficient amounts of photons. In order to obtain such hard X-ray beams, it is necessary to generate an infrared FEL in the wavelength range of about 1-10 μm. We just modify a 3 m planar undulator to a 3.55 m optical klystron. This new optical klystron has two undulator sections of 7 periods of 20 cm and one 75 cm dispersive section including two 1.5 cm free spaces. The maximum FEL gain at 10.6 μm is estimated to be over 2% and FEL oscillations would be achieved at around 10 μm. It would be also possible to lase with higher harmonics emitted from the optical klystron in the wavelength range of 1-3 μm.","FEL Compton backscattering; Free electron laser; Hard X-ray beam; Infrared region; Optical klystron; Storage ring","Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Free electron lasers; Infrared radiation; Oscillations; Photons; Storage rings; X rays; Optical klystron; Klystrons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036509056

By producing defense proteins beforehand, and storing them until infection, the host can cope with pathogens with a short time delay. However, producing and storing defense proteins require energy, and the activated defense proteins often cause harm to the host's body as well as to pathogens. Here, we study the optimal strategy for a host who chooses the amount of stored defense proteins, the activation of the stored proteins upon infection, and the new production of the proteins. The optimal strategy is the one that minimizes the sum of the harm by pathogens and the cost of defense. The host chooses the storage size of defense proteins based on the probability distribution of the magnitude of pathogen infection. When the infection size is predictable, all the stored proteins are to be activated upon infection. The optimal strategy is to have no storage and to rely entirely on new production if the expected infection size n0 is small, but to have a big storage without new production if n0 is large. The transition from the ""new production"" phase to ""storage"" phase occurs at a smaller n0 when storage cost is small, activation cost is large, pathogen toxicity is large, pathogen growth is fast, the defense is effective, the delay is long, and the infection is more likely. On the other hand, the storage size to produce for a large n0 decreases with three cost parameters and the defense effectiveness, increases with the likelihood of infection, the toxicity and the growth rate of pathogens, and it is independent of the time delay. When infection size is much smaller than the expected size, some of the stored proteins may stay unused. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"defense mechanism; host-pathogen interaction; optimization; protein; article; disease severity; experimental infection; growth rate; host pathogen interaction; host resistance; infection resistance; mathematical model; microbial growth; prediction; priority journal; protein synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036428740

From this analysis, the passive radon device, first developed for personal dosimetry in mines by the National Radiation Protection Board, UK (NRPB), has shown the most suitable set of characteristics. This radon monitor consists of a diffusion chamber, made of conductive plastic with less than 2 cm height, containing a CR-39 film (Columbia Resin 1939), as track detector. Radon detectors in workplaces may be exposed only during the working hours, thus requiring the storage of the detectors in low-radon zones when not exposed. This paper describes how this problem can be solved. Since track detectors are also efficient neutron dosemeters, care should be taken when radon monitors are used in workplaces, where they may be exposed to neutrons, such as on high altitude mountains, in the surroundings of high energy X ray facilities (where neutrons are produced by (γ, n) reactions) or around high energy particle accelerators. To this end, the response of these passive radon monitors to high energy neutron fields has been investigated.",,"plastic; radon 220; altitude; article; controlled study; diffusion chamber; film dosimeter; human; magnetic and electromagnetic equipment; mining; neutron dosimeter; radiation detector; radiation field; radiation monitoring; radiation protection; radiation response; United Kingdom; working time; workplace; X ray",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036396102

Kuntze were investigated using histochemistry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Moisture content and water status in tissues were also evaluated. In the embryo, TEM studies revealed the presence of one to several central vacuoles and a peripheral layer of cytoplasm in cells from different tissues of the cotyledons and axis. In the cytoplasm, lipid bodies, starch grains, mitochondria and a nucleus are evident. In most tissues, vacuoles contain proteins, indicating that the storage proteins are highly hydrated. In cells of the root cap, proteins are stored in discrete protein bodies. Both protein storage vacuoles and discrete protein bodies have inclusions of crystal globoids. EDX analysis of globoids revealed the presence of P, K and Mg as the main constituents and traces of S, Ca and Fe. In the root and shoot meristems, deposits of phytoferritin are present in the stroma of proplastids. The gametophyte consists of cells characterized by relatively thin cell walls and one to several nuclei per cell. Protein and lipid bodies are present, although starch is the most conspicuous reserve. Immediately after shedding, moisture content is approximately 145% (dry weight) for the embryo and 95% (dry weight) for the gametophyte. Calorimetric studies reveal that axes and cotyledons have a very high content of freezable water, corresponding to types 5 and 4, i.e. dilute and concentrated (or capillary) solution, respectively. The results are discussed in relation to the behaviour of the species, which has been categorized as recalcitrant. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London.","Lipid bodies; Mineral nutrients; Mitochondria; Phytoferritin; Protein bodies; Protein storage vacuoles; Seed moisture content; Seed ultrastructure; Vacuole","storage; Araucaria; Araucaria angustifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18744411790

It is found by XRD and EDS analysis that all the alloys mainly consist of two phases: a C14 Laves phase with hexagonal structure and a V-based solid solution phase with b.c.c. structure. In addition, a small amount of TiNi-rich phase is also found precipitated in both phases, probably due to the compositional segregation during solidification. The lattice parameters and unit cell volumes of the C14 Laves phase and the V-based solid solution all decrease when x is increased. Electrochemical measurements show that with x increasing, the maximum discharge capacity of the alloy electrode decreases and the activation properties also worsen, while the cyclic durability and the high rate dischargeability are all improved.

Acta 378 (2001) 35], the molecular mechanism for rotation of the c-rotor and the subsequent rotation of the γ-subunit and the ε-subunit has been proposed. The details of the elementary steps involved in ion translocation and energy conversion in the F0 portion of ATP synthase have been provided. Electrostatic effects drive the rotation of the c-subunits in steps of 15° each during proton binding as well as unbinding. During the rotation of the c-rotor, the energy of the ion gradients is transiently stored as twist in the c-subunits, and finally as torsional strain in the γ-subunit. The mechanism has been shown to be consistent with a general kinetic analysis of ATP synthesis by ATP synthase. The detailed molecular mechanism compels a paradigm shift from chemiosmotic dogma (where the membrane simply acts as an insulator and only energized aqueous media are permissible) towards a view where molecular interactions between ion and protein-in-the-membrane are critical for elementary steps involving transduction, storage and utilization of the energy of the ion gradients. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The sensitivity of the clonal material to the degradative effects of cuplump maturation increased with the level of tree energetic metabolism, with the most metabolically active plant materials (e.g., PB 235) being most sensitive, whereas the mass active clone PB 217 was less sensitive. A definite relationship evolves between Hevea tree metabolism and the stability of the structure of the biosynthesized rubber. The results presented here highlight at a macromolecular level the effects of maturation previously demonstrated on bulk processing parameters.","Bulk viscosity; Crosslinking; Cuplumps; Degradation; Hevea brasiliensis; Maturation; Molar mass distribution; Molecular chain length; Natural rubber","Biosynthesis; Latexes; Macromolecules; Metabolism; Molecular structure; Stability; Viscosity; Bulk viscosity; Clonal typologies; Cuplump natural rubber; Hevea tree metabolism; Maturation; Molecular chain length; Naturally coagulated latex; Tree energetic metabolism; Rubber; rubber; biosynthesis; energy metabolism; flow kinetics; Hevea; macromolecule; sensitivity analysis; tree; viscosity; rubber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037126249

The absorption coefficient was computed and the analysis of the data revealed the existence of two optical transition mechanisms. The direct optical energy gap Egd decreases from 1.74 to 1.58 eV as the film annealed to 520 K. Such behavior is attributed at present to unsaturated defects, which increase the density of localized states. The width of the tails of localized states Ee were calculated and found to be increased at high annealing temperatures. Films annealed at high temperature (Ta420 K) show a splitting of valence band by the spin orbit interaction. One may conclude that at high concentrations of Cu (x = 9), it is likely that the glass forming ability decreases. Other optical parameters (εi, εr, n and k) were calculated at different annealing temperatures. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","Data storage media; Optical coatings; Te-based alloys","Annealing; Copper alloys; Deposition; Energy gap; Fermi level; Optical data storage; Optical energy gap; Optical coatings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037078233

The graphite-hard carbon HC showed a higher reversible lithium capacity and better cycle performance than did the graphite-coke HC. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to analyze the deterioration mechanisms of the graphite-HC and graphite-coke HC. The decomposition products after the charge/discharge cycles were considered to be LiF and a carbonate compound, and the increase in inactive lithium in the decomposition products for the graphite-hard carbon HC was smaller than that for the graphite-coke HC. Therefore, it was thought that the graphite-hard carbon HC negative electrode suppressed the decomposition of the electrolyte and showed better cycle performance than did the graphite-coke HC negative electrode.

Their optical and electrochemical performances have been investigated in order to determine their possible applications in electrochromic devices as optically passive ion-storage layers. The targets used have been made of In2O3 and V2O5 powders mixed in different In/V ratios in a reactive sputtering atmosphere. Cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry studies of these films have been performed. The films demonstrate high ion-storage capacity retained even after 1000 cycles without any significant degradation. Lithium diffusion coefficients, calculated by the potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT), range around 10-13 cm2 s-1. The optical measurements, taken in the UV-vis-NIR transmittance and reflectance modes, have demonstrated that films are electrochromic, but the presence of In enhances their transparency and optical passiveness. The photometric spectra evaluation by a computer fitting shows that the refractive index is lower for films with higher In content. This result is in good agreement with Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) measurements.

Electric loads characteristics often make it necessity to adopt back-up energy sources, which, coupled with the main one, are able to satisfy loads requirements in terms of continuity and quality. For special applications, which require a high continuity source, it is necessary to combine the main electric energy source with UPS sources, which consist of a dc battery and a rotating electric generator, which supports the finite capacity of the battery pack. The research is actually devolved to study electric power systems, which, characterised by high reliability and low maintenance costs, present also low pollution and noise level: in particular, it is already carrying out tests to use UPS, which are equipped with fuel-cell systems [1]. When the duration of power outage/requirement is uncertain, the fuel-cell system is an ideal power source, which keeps generating power required by the loads, as long as a sufficient quantity of hydrogen and oxygen is provided. In the paper, the design for a fuel-cell-based inverter system is discussed.

By comparing four different species of fruit flies similar in shape but with different body mass, we have investigated how small insects cope with changes in fluid mechanical constraints on power requirements for flight and the efficiency with which chemical energy is turned into aerodynamic flight forces. The animals were flown in a flight arena in which stroke kinematics, aerodynamic force production, and carbon dioxide release were measured within the entire working range of the flight motor. The data suggest that during hovering performance mean lift coefficient for flight is higher in smaller animals than in their larger relatives. This result runs counter to predictions based on conventional aerodynamic theory and suggests subtle differences in stroke kinematics between the animals. Estimates in profile power requirements based on high drag coefficient suggest that among all tested species of fruit flies elastic energy storage might not be required to minimize energetic expenditures during flight. Moreover, muscle efficiency significantly increases with increasing body size whereas aerodynamic efficiency tends to decrease with increasing size or Reynolds number. As a consequence of these two opposite trends, total flight efficiency tends to increase only slightly within the 6-fold range of body sizes. Surprisingly, total flight efficiency in fruit flies is broadly independent of different profile power estimates and typically yields mean values between 2-4%.","Drosophila; Lift coefficient; Muscle efficiency; Power requirements; Scaling","Animalia; Drosophila melanogaster; Hexapoda; Insecta",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036994887

In the conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium, the hydrogen-storage capacity of Ti0.9Zr0.2Mn1.6Ni0.2 V0.2 alloy can reach 240.9 ml/g, from which it can be calculated that its theoretical capacity is 537.3 mA h/g. However, its discharge capacity in KOH solution is only less than 40 mA h/g. In order to improve this capacity, the effect of ball milling with Ni powders on the electrochemical and structural properties of Ti0.9Zr0.2Mn1.6Ni0.2 V0.2 alloy was investigated. The results show that proper ball milling with Ni powders is very effective to improve the discharge capacity of the Ti0.9Zr0.2Mn1.6Ni0.2 V0.2 alloy by increasing the surface electrocatalytic ability. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, this cycle performance is insufficient for dispersed energy storage systems, such as home use load leveling systems. In order to clarify the capacity fade factors of the cell, we focused our investigation on the ability discharge capacity of the positive and negative electrodes after 2350 cycles. Although the cell capacity deteriorated to 70% of its initial capacity after 2350 cycles, it was confirmed that the LiNi0.7Co0.3O2 positive electrode and graphite-coke hybrid negative electrode after 2350 cycles still have sufficient ability discharge capacity of 86 and 92% of their initial capacity, respectively. Accompanied by the result for a composition analysis of the positive electrode material by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), electrochemical active lithium decreased and the LixNi0.7Co0.3O2 positive electrode could be charged-discharged in a narrow range of between x=0.41 and 0.66 in the battery, although it had enough ability discharge capacity that can use between x=0.36 and 0.87. It is predicted that solid electrolyte interface formation by electrolyte decomposition on the carbon negative electrode during the charge-discharge cycle test is a main factor of the decrease of electrochemical active lithium. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Since it is radioactive, it needs to be stored in a safe but easily recoverable manner. It is an isotope of H, and hence some of the techniques used for hydrogen storage can be employed, the safest being its storage in the form of a tritide. However, in contrast to the case of hydrogen, tritium decays into 3He and thus modifies the properties of the tritide. The recoil energy of 3He in this decay process is very small, ∼1.03 eV, and not enough for atomic displacements to occur. We show in this paper, on the basis of our electronic structure calculations, that in the case of PdT, the 3He produced from the radioactive decay of tritium, although not soluble in the tritide, can be easily retained, in a metastable state, in surprisingly large quantities at the octahedral interstitial sites where it is born. This can explain the expansion of the lattice parameter, the lowering of the plateau pressure, and the fragility of the tritide observed experimentally. We also find that the lowering of the plateau pressure is not entirely due to the lattice expansion as usually assumed and that electronic interactions also play a role.",,"helium; palladium; palladium tritide; tritium; unclassified drug; article; calculation; chemical analysis; molecular interaction; nuclear industry; radioactivity; safety; structure analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036650689

Morphometric data indicate that the males are lighter, have longer wings, a higher ratio of flight muscles to body mass, and a lower wing load value than females. It was investigated whether this inability of females to fly is related to fuel storage, flight muscle enzymatic design and/or the presence and quantitative capacity of the endocrine system to mobilize fuels. In both sexes, readily available potential energy substrates are present in the haemolymph in similar concentrations, and the amount of glycogen in flight muscles and fat bodies does not differ significantly between males and females. Mass-specific activities of the enzymes GAPDH (glycolysis), HOAD (fatty acid oxidation) and MDH (citric acid cycle) in flight muscles are significantly lower in females compared with males, and mitochondria are less abundant in the flight muscles of females. There is no significant difference between the ability of the two sexes to oxidize various important substrates. Both sexes contain three adipokinetic peptides in their corpora cardiaca; the amount of each peptide in female grasshoppers is higher than in males. Thus, despite some differences listed above, both sexes appear to have sufficient substrates and the necessary endocrine complement to engage in flight. It seems more likely, from the morphometric data above, that the chief reason for flightlessness is that P. morbillosus females cannot produce sufficient lift for flight; alternatively, the neuronal functioning associated with the flight muscles may be impaired in females.","Flight behaviour; Flight muscle mass; Grasshopper; Metabolite and AKH-honnone level; Oxidative and enzymatic potential; Phymateus morbillosus; Sexual dimorphism; Wing load values; Wing morphology","flight; grasshopper; morphometry; sexual dimorphism; wing morphology; Orthoptera; Phymateus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036211233

The reactors were started in a slurry mode and brought to the target level of 26-30% total solids in about 3 months from start. Two feed characteristics, the level of PS solids in the feed, and the particle size of the OF-MSW, were the variables used to determine their effect on methane production during digester operation. Higher biodegradable volatile solid reductions and methane yields matched increased fractions of primary sludge in the feed (5%, 10%, and 15% as dry solids). Incomplete digestion, limited to fermentation, took place in reactors that did not receive primary sludge. The particle size did not have any effect on specific weight of the feed but the amount of primary sludge did. Addition of vitamins and micronutrients to the inhibited reactors did not stimulate methane production, which narrowed the range of possible causes to the lack of available macronutrients, namely nitrogen. On the other hand, possible un-ionized ammonia (NH3) inhibition of reactors fed with the highest primary sludge-amended feed hindered organic conversion rates. Elimination of pathogenic microorganisms from the high-solids residue via long-term storage, followed by low-dose lime disinfection, was also investigated. Storage alone reduced fecal coliform and Salmonella sp. bacteria to below detection, but bacterial spores of anaerobic Clostridium perfringens survived. Subsequent liming of the residue caused irreversible inactivation of the spores because of high pH and, possibly, free ammonia (NH3) inherent to sludge. © 2002 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Alkaline treatment; High-solid anaerobic digestion; Mesophilic; Pathogens; Storage","Alkalinity; Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Bacteria; Disinfection; Energy storage; Lime; Methane; Particle size; Pathogens; Sludge digestion; Alkaline treatment; Clostridium perfringens; Digester operations; High-solids; Irreversible inactivation; Mesophilic; Organic fraction of municipal solid wastes; Pathogenic microorganisms; Municipal solid waste; ammonia; methane; nitrogen; trace element; vitamin; anaerobic process; Disinfection; municipal waste; reactor; sludge; solid waste; anaerobic digestion; article; bacterial spore; biodegradation; Clostridium perfringens; coliform bacterium; controlled study; disinfection; fermentation; municipal solid waste; particle size; pH; reactor; Salmonella; sludge stabilization; solid state; stimulation; storage; Bacteria (microorganisms); Clostridium; Clostridium perfringens; Clostridium perfringens; Salmonella; Salmonella; Salmonella sp.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036207751

The control methods and strategy of the FES system for power quality are introduced in detail. A new rapid method to calculate the amplitude of sinusoidal voltage and current is presented which could improve the performance of the FES system. To realize the high efficiency of the energy conversion and to minimize the torque ripple of the motor/generator, the waveform of the AC power converter output currents is controlled to be sinusoidal by using sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) control method. During the storage period, the AC power converter accelerates the flywheel storing energy. At the generating times, the AC power converter drives the flywheel to decelerate and then the kinetic energy is transformed into electric energy and returned to power system.

Implications of high and low wave energy on the food web structure were assessed. The Sylt shore represents a dynamic intermediate beach type, while the Rømø shore is morphologically stable and dissipative. On the steep-profiled, coarse-grained Sylt shore, strong hydrodynamics resulted in erosion and high fluxes of organic material through the beach, but prevented any storage of food sources. In contrast, the flatprofiled, fine-grained Rømø shore, with low wave energy and accretion, accumulated organic carbon from surf waters. At Sylt, oxic nutrient regeneration prevailed, while anoxic mineralization was more important at Rømø. Macrofauna on the Sylt shore was impoverished compared with the community at Rømø. Correspondingly, abundances of epibenthic predators such as shrimps, crabs, fish, and shorebirds were also lower at Sylt. Meiofauna was abundant on both shores, but differed in taxonomic composition. Several major taxa were represented in fairly equal proportions of individual numbers on the well-oxygenated Sylt shore, while nematodes strongly dominated the assemblage at Rømø. Thus, on cold-temperate, highly dynamic intermediate shores with high wave energy and subject to erosion, the ""small food web"" dominates. Organisms are agile and quickly exploit fresh organic material. Larger organisms and nematodes abound under stable, dissipative and accreting shore conditions, where some food materials may accumulate and zoomass builds up to support numerous visitors from higher trophic levels.","Beach morphology; Food web; Sandy shore; Wave energy","accretion; beach erosion; beach morphology; food web; nutrient availability; trophic structure; wave energy; beach; food web; nutrient; wave energy; Denmark; Germany; North Frisian Islands; Romo; Sylt; Central Europe; Denmark; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Frisian Islands; Germany; North Frisian Islands; Northern Europe; Romo; Scandinavia; Schleswig-Holstein; Sonderjylland; Sylt; World; Decapoda (Crustacea); Nematoda; Decapoda (Crustacea); Nematoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036767576

Impaired fat storage rather than altered glucose metabolism in adipocytes probably contributes to development of insulin resistance in muscle and other tissues, in particular via increased delivery of nonesterified fatty acids into circulation. Lipid metabolism of adipose tissue is affected by the energy status of fat cells. In vitro experiments indicated the dependence of both lipogenesis and lipolysis on ATP levels in adipocytes. Thus, respiratory uncoupling in adipocytes that results in stimulation of energy dissipation and depression of ATP synthesis may contribute to the control of lipid metabolism, adiposity, and insulin sensitivity. This notion is supported by the expression of UCPs in adipocytes, for example, UCP2, UCP5, as well as some protonophoric anion transporters, and by induction of UCP1 and UCP3 in white fat by pharmacological treatments that reduce adiposity. A negative correlation between expression of UCPs in adipocytes and accumulation of white fat was also found. Expression of UCP1 from the adipose-specific promoter in the aP2-Ucp1 transgenic mice mitigated obesity induced by genetic or dietary factors. The obesity resistance, accompanied by respiratory uncoupling in adipocytes and increased energy expenditure, resulted from ectopic expression of UCP1 in white, but not brown fat. Probably due to depression of the ATP/ADP ratio, both fatty acid synthesis and lipolytic action of norepinephrinȩ in adipocytes of transgenic mice were relatively low. Expression of regulatory G-proteins, which are essential for both catecholamine and insulin signaling in adipocytes, was also altered by ectopic UCP1. These results support the role of protonophoric proteins in adipocytes in the control of adiposity and insulin sensitivity. Antidiabetic effects of thiazolidinediones, fibrates, β3-adrenoreceptor agonists, dietary n-3 PUFAs, and leptin may be explained at least partially by their effects on the energy and hence also the lipid metabolism of fat cells.","Adipose tissue; Lipogenesis; Lipolysis; Obesity; Uncoupling protein","adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; lipid; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein; uncoupling protein 1; uncoupling protein 2; uncoupling protein 3; uncoupling protein 5; adipocyte; conference paper; diabetic obesity; energy metabolism; human; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; lipolysis; nonhuman; respiratory chain; transgene; Mus musculus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036299147

The C14 Laves phase forms a continuous matrix, the V-based solid solution phase is the main phase in dendritic structure, and the TiNi-based third phase is precipitated both in the C14 Laves phase and in the V-based solid solution phase and tends to disappear after annealing treatment. The annealing treatment makes the composition of the alloy more homogeneous by redistribution of elemental constituents. Additionally, the annealing treatment leads to an increase of the lattice parameters and unit cell volumes of both the C14 Laves phase and the V-based solid solution phase and also the growth of the dendrites. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The kinetic parameters were found to be, in general, significantly different in both inactivation media. The magnitude of the activation energies for both the reactions of formation and inactivation of the intermediate enzyme indicated that conformational changes might play a major role in both processes when the solvent is added. A logarithmic model, although lacking a theoretical background, was able to predict the enzyme activity regeneration upon storage of the inactivated samples at 4°C.

In general, the use of linear theory has been found to be both insightful and accurate. However, in shallow water, linear theory becomes progressively less accurate, resulting in divergence between actual and predicted performance. This is a critical area for shoreline wave energy converters, since the potential for shoreline wave energy production will depend on developing progressively shallower sites. A suitable analytical model for devices in shallow water is required to predict the effect of water depth on performance and to provide guidance in device optimisation. Because of the lack of clarity in defining why linear-theory becomes less accurate in shallow water, digital video recordings are used to analyse the flow around the LIMPET wave energy converter. This provides detailed images that can be analysed both temporally and spatially. It is found that LIMPET'S operation differs qualitatively from that predicted by linear theory, identifying three critical flow characteristics; front wall swash, front wall down-wash and slosh in the water column. This paper describes the three flows, including a discussion of the influence of water depth, wave period and wave height. These are chosen to be typical for the LIMPET wave energy converter sited on the Isle of Islay, Scotland. The hydrodynamics of shallow water waves are used to provide tentative interpretations of the flow characteristics. It is suggested that the flow characteristics are all related to the change from sinusoidal to cnoidal or broken wave profiles, with related changes in the energy flux and horizontal particle velocity. Using these interpretations, the influence of shallow water on shoreline OWC performance is discussed.","OWC; Shoreline; Visualization; Wave energy","Digital storage; Electric converters; Flow visualization; Mathematical models; Nonlinear systems; Optimization; Video recording; Water waves; OWC; Shoreline; Wave energy; Flow of fluids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842608634

A dimensionless model is given, from which it is concluded that the main factors that influence the melting process are the dimensionless heating flux, the modified Stefan number, the relative thermal diffusivity and the relative thermal conductivity. The influence of preheating or solid subcooling is studied. It is found that though preheating does not have very important effects on the melting time, it does influence the interface marching velocity significantly. The melt fraction and the melting time are calculated extensively for various dimensionless numbers. The numerical results show that the ratio of the thermal conductivity of the solid to that of the liquid has little effect on the melting time, and the time for finishing melting can be expressed as a function of the dimensionless heating flux, the modified Stefan number and the relative thermal diffusivity, and the possible function form is suggested. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As expected by the complex structures of penicillins, several steps with different activation energies occurred in their decomposition processes. Model-fitting and model-free kinetic approach were applied to non-isothermal and isothermal data. In the model-fitting methods the kinetic triplets (f(α), A and Ea) that defines a single reaction step resulted in being at variance with the multi-step nature of penicillins decomposition. The model-free approach represented by isothermal and non-isothermal isoconversional methods, gave dependences of the activation energies on the extent of conversion. The complex nature of the multi-step process of the studied compounds was more easily revealed using a broader temperature range in non-isothermal isoconversional method. The failure in the model fitting method did not allow calculating storage times. Model-fitting and model-free methods, both isothermal and non-isothermal, showed that Fl mechanism is able to describe decomposition processes for drugs (having Phosphomycin salts as active component) for which a single decomposition process occurs. Statistical analysis allowed us to select reliable kinetic parameters related to the decomposition processes for these last compounds. This procedure showed that the values obtained by extrapolation, outside the temperature range where the processes occurred must be used with caution. Indeed half-life and shelf-life values, commonly extrapoled at room temperature, seemed to be unrealistic.","Arrhenius parameters; Drugs; Isothermal; Multi-step; Non-isothermal; Statistical analysis; Thermal decomposition","Activation energy; Extrapolation; Isotherms; Mathematical models; Pyrolysis; Statistical methods; Arrhenius parameters; Drug products",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036274227

These dynamic limits are functions rather than numbers; they are expressed in terms of classical exergy change and a residual minimum of dissipated exergy, or some extensions including time penalty. We consider processes with heat and mass transfer that occur in a finite time and with equipment of finite dimension. These processes include heat-mechanical and (in Part II) separation operations and are found in heat and mass exchangers, thermal networks, energy convertors, energy recovery units, storage systems, chemical reactors, and chemical plants. Our analysis is based on the condition that in order to make the results of thermodynamic analyses usable in engineering economics it is the dynamical limit, not the maximum of thermodynamic efficiency, which must be overcome for prescribed process requirements. A creative part of this paper outlines a general approach to the construction of ""Carnot variables"" as suitable controls. In this (first) part of work we restrict to dynamic limits on work that may be produced or consumed by a single resource flowing in an open heat-mechanical system. To evaluate these limits we consider sequential work-assisted unit operations, in particular those of heating or evaporation which run jointly with ""endoreversible"" thermal machines (e.g., heat pumps). We also compare structures of optimization criteria describing these limits. In particular, we display role of endoreversible limits in conventional operations of heat transfer and in work-assisted operations. Mathematical analogies between entropy production expressions in these two sorts of operations are helpful to formulate optimization criteria in both cases. Finite-rate models include minimal irreducible losses caused by thermal resistances to the classical exergy potential. Functions of extremum work, which incorporate residual minimum entropy production, are formulated in terms of initial and final states, total duration and (in discrete processes) number of stages. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The CI has been defined which is able to describe the discoloration kinetics with acceptable regression coefficients. The evaluation of the CIELAB values from the stability data has shown that the discoloration of the white tablets means an intensification of yellowish or brownish color which is manifested by more or less constant hue angle (hab) values and increasing chroma (Cab*) values. In the view of these data the discoloration kinetics can physically be expressed by the CI. With the CI values the discoloration kinetics can be calculated by linear or polynomial regression with acceptable confidence intervals. The discoloration rates determined under several storage temperatures follow the Arrhenius equation and the activation energy can be estimated for the products.

To optimise ventilation, one has to take into account that optimum temperature for canopy photosynthesis rises with increasing concentration of atmospheric CO 2. To predict canopy photosynthesis and to relate dry weight production to temperature control, a reliable model is needed. Models of canopy photosynthesis have not yet been validated at the extreme climate situations that may be expected in a solar greenhouse in summer (high irradiation, temperature and humidity). Three versions of increasing complexity of leaf photosynthesis simulation models, M1, M2, and M2+ were evaluated in a canopy photosynthesis model under such conditions. The reference (SUCROS related) model, M1, has been extensively validated for a tomato crop under normal greenhouse conditions. M2 is an extension of M1 with a more biochemical description of the underlying processes. M2+ is an extension of M2, including a sub-model of stomatal resistance. In a crop model, the three sub-models were compared under fixed conditions and with observed climate data. There were substantial differences between the three models, especially at high temperatures and high radiation, irrespective of the CO2 level. The biochemical model, M2, performed somewhat differently than M1. But, the strongest discrepancies were observed with model M2+ due to the much higher predicted stomatal resistance compared to the values adopted in M1 and M2. The results demonstrate that it is necessary to investigate the performance of greenhouse crop models under a wider range of conditions when they are to be applied in a solar greenhouse.","Humidity; Simulation; Stomatal resistance; Tomato",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37949048227

When previously imbibed seeds were stored dry before the onset of radicle protrusion, the seeds remained viable for at least 1 year and Hb mRNA was detectable in the embryos throughout this time.

First, the systems using underground thermal energy are classified into two categories: borehole system with indirect heat exchange, and aquifer system with direct use of underground water. These systems are also divided into thermal storage systems and heat source/sink systems. Second, the characteristics of the underground in Japan are analyzed by using a geographical information system (GIS) and hydrogeological information. Regulations on environmental protection, such as those relating to national parks for instance, and the distribution of thermal energy demand eliminate 77% of Japan from consideration for underground thermal energy utilization. Areas limited to borehole thermal energy utilization account for 17% of areas where underground thermal energy can be used, with the remaining 74% suitable for both boreholes and aquifers.

The constitutive equations describe the one-way and two-way shape memory effect as well as pseudoelasticity, pseudoplasticity and the transition range between pseudoelasticity and pseudoplasticity. The material model is based on a free energy function as well as evolution equations for internal variables. In detail, the free energy function is introduced in order to describe the energy storage during thermoelastic processes, the energy difference between the regarded phases (austenite and martensite) as well as the energy storage due to the evolution of the residual stresses. In contrast to this, the evolution equations for the internal variables represent the observed inelastic behavior of shape memory alloys as well as the related thermomechanical coupling effects. Due to the description of the energy storage and release during the martensitic phase transitions by means of a mixture theory, one internal variable is the fraction of martensite. Others are the inelastic strain tensor and internal variables describing residual stresses. The viscous material behavior of NiTi shape memory alloys, which is experimentally observed, is represented by an inelastic multiplier of Perzynatype. Numerical solutions of the developed constitutive equations for isothermal and non-isothermal strain and stress processes demonstrate that the material model represents the main effects of shape memory alloys. Additionally, the material model is able to depict the multiaxial material behavior as observed. Numerical solutions are compared with uniaxial and in particular biaxial experimental observations on NiTi shape memory alloys.","Phase transitons; Shape memory alloys; Thermomechanical model; Thermoviscoplasticity","Elasticity; Free energy; Martensitic transformations; Mixtures; Numerical methods; Residual stresses; Strain; Thermomechanical treatment; Viscoplasticity; Thermomechanical models; Shape memory effect",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036028526

In order to investigate the possibility of radiant energy being deposited in its absorber cavity without being transformed into heat when detecting soft X-rays, SYRES has been directly compared with the electron storage ring BESSY I, a primary radiometric source standard of calculable spectral radiant power. To this end, the integral radiant power emitted by the storage ring into a solid angle defined by a high-precision aperture was measured with SYRES. The experiments were conducted at two nominal energies of the circulating electrons, 800 MeV and 340 MeV, to study the influence of the different spectral distributions of the synchrotron radiation. For the original graphite-coated cavity absorber, significant discrepancies were found which could be traced back to the ablation of the graphite coating from the copper cavity body. In the case of the new gold-coated cavity absorber, the calculated and measured values of the radiant power agreed in all experiments within the combined relative uncertainties of typically 2.5 × 10-3 (k = 1).",,"Cryogenics; Heat radiation; Radiant heating; Radiometers; Storage rings; Synchrotron radiation; X rays; Cryogenic radiometers; Thermal variables measurement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036944913

We have tried to obtain information on possible hepatic mechanisms contributing to this effect. Methods: Rats were fed a HF diet, isocaloric with the control diet, for 3 weeks without or with clofibrate. Several parameters related to liver glucose and glycogen metabolism were measured. Results: Clofibrate prevented the induction of glucose intolerance by 3 weeks HF feeding. Improved glucose tolerance by clofibrate was not due to increases in glucose phosphorylation or glycolysis in the liver, since both the HF diet and clofibrate suppressed glucokinase and pyruvate kinase activities with no effect on glucose 6-phosphatase. Clofibrate decreased glycogen storage in both control and HF rats. Clofibrate, with and without HF feeding, inhibited weight gain during the experimental period. Body temperature was significantly elevated by clofibrate, indicative of an increased basal metabolic rate. The capacity of liver mitochondria to oxidize long-chain fatty acids increased by clofibrate treatment. Mitochondria did not show uncoupling. Conclusions: Clofibrate does not improve glucose tolerance by improving hepatic glucose or glycogen metabolism. Peripheral glucose oxidation may be facilitated by increased energy dissipation. © 2002 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper, mechanical alloying (MA) was used to synthesize nanocrystalline LaNi4-xMn0.75Al0.25Cox (x=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0) hydrogen storage materials. XRD analysis showed that, after 30 h milling, the starting mixture of the elements decomposed into an amorphous phase. Following the annealing in high purity argon at 700 °C for 0.5 h, XRD confirmed the formation of the CaCu5-type structures with a crystallite sizes of about 25 nm. The nanocrystalline materials were used as negative electrodes for a Ni-MHx battery. Cobalt substituting nickel in LaNi4Mn0.75Al0.25 greatly improved the discharge capacity and cycle life of the LaNi5 material.

Methods: Subjects were 24 premenopausal women (mean age, 39.5±9.4 years; range, 32-52 years) with uterine leiomyomas. They were given GnRH agonist (leuprorelin acetate, 3.75 mg) monthly for 4 months. Age and height were recorded. Body weight, regional and total body composition, and the ratio of trunk fat mass to leg fat mass (trunk-leg fat ratio) were assessed by whole body scanning with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Changes in these variables were investigated. Relationships between the changes in regional lean and fat mass were investigated using Pearson's correlation test. Results: Trunk fat mass significantly increased from 8616±3538 to 9265±3526 g (P<0.01) and trunk-leg fat ratio significantly increased (1.02±0.39 to 1.07±0.39, P<0.05). Trunk lean mass significantly decreased from 18,509±2602 to 17,916±2402 g (P<0.01). However, body weight, and lean and fat mass component in the extremities did not change. Change in trunk fat mass was inversely correlated with change in trunk lean mass (r=-0.439, P<0.05), but such relationships were not observed in arm and leg regions.

Marchetti and Nakicenovic and Norton and Bass have modeled the multivariant case of various technologies introduced at different times. A new, simple and flexible model has been proposed based on potential penetration. Potential penetration is penetration on the assumption that no other new technology will enter the market. In a stable competitive environment, potential penetration curves are typically positively sloped S-curves. The new model gives a good fit in markets with a limited number of competitors, which are capable of totally cannibalizing previous generations of technologies. It also fits well with markets with many competitors in a competitive equilibrium situation. Examples are the Dynamic Random Access Memory chips (DRAMs), fiber and energy market. The new model features fewer variables compared with existing models and can readily be adapted to technological processes with time varying parameters, which is particularly important in volatile competitive markets. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

However, electron beam treatment is a typical line-of-sight process and demands a complicated target manipulation and beam-rastering system. A new method, circumventing the limitations inherent in the scanning electron beam treatment is presented. The workpiece to be treated is immersed into the plasma and surrounded by a negatively biased grid, preventing the penetration of plasma electrons. Further, the workpiece is connected to a positive DC high voltage source of about 20kV and a capacitor, acting as an energy storage. Changing the grid bias, electrons are extracted from the plasma and accelerated by the positive potential towards the workpiece. During the pulsed electron bombardment, power densities of about 10kW/cm2 can be achieved, resulting in a rapid thermal heating and self-quenching, occurring after the electron pulse. Detailed investigations are presented on the response of plasma if electrons are extracted by a large electrode with special emphasis on the processes near the wall and near the control grid. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","Electron saturation current; Heat treatment; Plasma","Capacitors; Electric potential; Electrodes; Electron beams; Plasma applications; Steel; Wear of materials; Electron saturation current; Heat treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037176762

Data from MAST H-modes suggest that the aspect ratio dependency of international confinement and L-H threshold scalings may need to be modified to improve predictions for ITER. Access to H-mode on MAST is strongly affected by both the divertor magnetic geometry and fuelling location, with the formation of an edge transport barrier being facilitated by operation near the symmetric, connected double-null configuration and with poloidally localized inboard gas puffing. The ELMs on MAST appear to be Type III in nature, even in the highest performance plasmas and with the maximum available auxiliary heating power. ELM energy losses are less than 4% of stored energy in all regimes so far explored. These Type III ELMs are associated with a reduction in the pedestal density but no significant change in the pedestal temperature or temperature profile, indicating that energy is convected from the pedestal region into the scrape-off layer. Analysis of the energy observed to arrive at the divertor targets indicates that ELM losses are predominantly on the low field side.

Functionalized HOPG substrates are obtained using the focused ion beam (FIB) nanoengraving technique to pattern 2D-organized arrays of defects (nanoholes, nanobumps) which act as traps for the diffusing clusters. Depending on the deposition conditions (nature, size and fluence of the deposited clusters) and the functionalized substrates (nature and size of the FIB-induced defects, geometry of the 2D array of defects and temperature during deposition) high-quality quantum-dot arrays can be obtained with well controlled and reproducible morphologies. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the cluster deposition experiments on functionalized substrates allow us to obtain quite good fits of the experimental images performed by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TMAFM), leading to systematic investigations of the best conditions to realize high-quality quantum dots systems.

Australia New Zealand Food Authority employs scientific, legal policy, communication and administrative staff in our Australia and New Zealand offices. Prior to 1991 each of Australia's States and Territories had their own food standards; however, in 1991 Commonwealth legislation was introduced to consolidate responsibility for developing food standards in one specialist agency and to ensure the uniformity of Standards across all States and Territories in Australia. This was extended to New Zealand in 1995 when we became a bi-national agency following the signing of a Treaty between Australia and New Zealand to develop joint food standards for both countries. Australia New Zealand Food Authority's objectives in setting food standards are to: protect public health and safety; provide adequate information to enable consumers to make informed choices; and prevent misleading or deceptive conduct. Health Ministers have recently approved a new Joint Food Standards Code for Australia and New Zealand. This is the result of over 6 year's work and many rounds of public consultation. The new Code has had extensive input from government agencies, industry and consumers. In drafting the new code our emphasis has been on making decisions based on sound science and the most up-to-date information available. We also recognized the need for Standards to be practical in not imposing unnecessary costs on food manufacturers with an inevitable flow on effect to consumer prices. The Joint Code will replace both the existing Australian Food Standards Code and the New Zealand Food Regulations after a 2-year transition period. During the development of the Joint Code a wide range of matters were considered in relation to labelling. Amongst these were consumer needs, costs to industry, voluntary versus mandatory, enforcement issues, relationship to advertising and exemptions. A number of features of the new Code relate specifically to labelling and include: warning and advisory statements; ingredients lists; date marking; directions for use and storage; nutrition information; legibility requirements; and percentage labelling. One of the key features of the Joint Code is the requirement for most packaged foods to bear a nutrition information panel (NIP). Information must be presented on the amount of fat, saturated fat, protein, energy, carbohydrates, sugars and sodium. For the majority of foods the label is the first and only source of information regarding the nutritional content of food purchased. Mandatory nutrition labelling will ensure that consumers are provided with key nutritional information about foods. Single ingredient produce such as fruit and vegetables, and some other foods such as spices, tea and coffee will be exempt. The new requirements will give consumers more nutritional information to allow product comparison. All products will be required to provide information on these nutrients on both a per 100 g basis and in terms of an average serving. In addition to the mandatory nutrient declarations NIP are also required to carry additional data for any substance for which a nutrition claim is made. During the 2-year transition period to December 2002 ANZFA will be working with industry, enforcement agencies and consumers to help to ensure that there is a smooth transition to the Joint Food Standards Code.","Australia; Food standards; Labelling; New Zealand; Nutrition","food additive; Australia; conference paper; consumer; cost benefit analysis; food; food composition; food industry; food packaging; government; human; law; legal aspect; New Zealand; nutrient content; policy; standard; article; government; Australia; Food; Food Labeling; Government Agencies; Human; Legislation, Food; New Zealand; Food Labeling; Government Agencies; Humans",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036341495

One of the imaging type photoelectron spectromicroscopies is micro-ESCA or micro-XPS (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). We connected the modified commercial system (Fisons Instruments, ESCALAB 220i-XL) to the beamlines, which cover the photon energy range of 10 eV-5 keV at the UVSOR facility, Institute for Molecular Science, Okazaki, Japan. It is expected that spatial resolution of 2 μm for the imaging mode and 20 μm for the spectroscopic mode can be achieved. In conjunction with monochromatic and polarized synchrotron radiation light from the UVSOR storage ring, photoelectron spectroscopy studies have been performed, not only for surface science but also for spectroscopy of small samples. Another imaging type of photoelectron spectromicroscopy is known as photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM). Now commercial PEEM is available with relatively high performance. We report here the example of the combination study of PEEM and X-ray magnetic dichroism spectroscopy for magnetic domain imaging performed at the Photon Factory, KEK, Tsukuba, Japan. Imaging with spatial resolution less than ∼200 nm is now possible using the synchrotron radiation. According to the demands from industrial usage, such as production of magnetic recording media etc., the application method becomes more important. These types of microscope techniques are very valuable, especially in the high brilliant synchrotron light source facility. The future prospects of photoelectron spectromicroscopy are described. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Because of the wide energy gap and the very low minority-carrier generation rate in SiC, it should be possible to achieve very long retention times. The investigations show that charge leakage through the gate oxide may prevent the use of SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors as memory elements. Importantly, the experiments demonstrate that both the charge leakage and carrier-generation rate are low in the case of nitrided SiO2-SiC interfaces. The retention time extrapolated to room temperature is in the order of 109 years for the case of MOS capacitors on 4H-SiC, which is approximately equal to the theoretical limit. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.",,"Charge leakage; Charge retention; Gate oxide; Generation rate; Memory element; Metal oxide semiconductor; Metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors; Nitrided; Non-volatile random-access memories; Retention time; Room temperature; Theoretical limits; Dielectric devices; MOS capacitors; Random access storage; Silicon carbide; Semiconducting silicon compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956048036

The minimum wire material and fast scanning speed have been chosen to achieve the precise profile measurement and minimum beam destruction because the requirements are critical for the lowest kinetic energy of 500MeV.

It was found that the treated alloy electrode exhibited a better activation property than the untreated one in the sealed battery as well as in open cell. For the treated alloy electrode activating, the polarization resistance in the sealed battery was almost equal to that in the open cell. But in the case of the untreated alloy electrode activating, the polarization resistance in the sealed battery was larger than that in the open cell. The reason is that the oxide film on the untreated alloy surface suppressed the combination of the oxygen evolved on the positive electrode with hydrogen on the negative alloy surface. In addition, the decaying of capacity of the untreated alloy electrode was much faster than that of the treated one. The reasons were, that after surface treatment, the Ni-rich and Al-poor layer on the alloy surface not only had a high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen electrode reaction, but also facilitated the combination of the oxygen with hydrogen and hydrogen adsorption on the alloy surface. © 2002 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

A bending deformation mode is also analyzed in the region of the glass transition of the two components to study the phase separation.

The Rotation-Cylinder Method (RCM) was initiated and has been developed to magnesium based composites with moderate rotation under normal atmosphere. In this study, the Mg-(1, 5, 10) wt.%Ni alloys were easily manufactured by RCM and evaluated to hydrogenation properties by Sieverts-type automatic pressure-composition-isotherm (PCI) apparatus at 523, 573 and 623 K. The evolution of microstructure of as-cast specimens appeared to be typical hypoeutectic structure. From the results of backscattered electron imaging (BEI) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), the difference of composition between α-Mg and Ni-rich eutectic region was distinguished clearly. The hydrogenation properties of Mg-Ni alloys depended on the behavior of nickel compositions. The hydrogen capacity of Mg-10 wt.%Ni was 6.0-6.2 wt.%, and the plateau pressures were around 0.026, 0.18 and 0.67 MPa at 523, 573 and 623 K, respectively.

According to the characteristics of the orthogonal ion injection in the reTOF analyzer, the incident ion beam properties have been determined. Different ion ejection modes from the trap cell, consistent with orthogonal-reflector time-of-flight mass spectrometry (O-reTOF/MS), have been investigated by simulations (SIMION 6.0) and experimental exploration. Especially, the following scanning modes have been studied: (1) dc scan applied to the ring electrode, (2) dc pulse applied to the ring electrode, and (3) dc pulse applied to the end-cap electrodes with switching off the drive rf voltage, under various storage conditions and for different m/z values. Distributions of ion velocities, kinetic energies, and ion ejection times, obtained by simulations and experiments, were compared using the ejection mode (2). Results from simulations of ions orthogonally injected into the reTOF/MS, show that the incident ion beam must be mono-energetic, with initial radial KE < 2 eV to be efficiently deflected and detected. The simulations and experiments of original scanning from ion trap enlighten that dc ejection with rf voltage was not compatible with O-reTOF analysis (high energetic and noncontinuous ion beam). Appropriate dc ejection, with switching off the rf voltage, was consistent with O-reTOF analysis. For enhancing the duty cycle of the proposed system, the challenge is then to optimize ion ejection to get an ion beam as continuous as possible. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.","Kinetic energy measurements; Orthogonal coupling; Quadrupole ion trap; Time-of-flight","article; electric potential; energy transfer; kinetics; mass spectrometer; process optimization; simulation; storage; tandem mass spectrometry; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037160467

The object of this study was to examine the influence and toxicity of SO on the optic nerve after vitrectomy with SO tamponade. Methods. We injected medical grade SO and emulsified SO into rabbit eyes after gas-mediated vitreous compression and examined the eyes by light microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) (point analysis and area analysis) 6 months after injection. We compared the findings in the non-treated eyes and eyes with only gas-mediated vitreous compression with those in SO-injected eyes. Results. Vacuole-like structures were seen in the optic nerve posterior to the lamina cribrosa. In the group treated with only gas-mediated vitreous compression, the myelin structures were shown by TEM to be destroyed and replaced by glial tissue, while in groups injected with medical grade or emulsified SO severe destruction of the myelin sheath (myelinolysis) was observed. Silicone was identified at the electron-dense edges of the vacuoles by EDXA point analysis, but not in the vacuoles without electron-dense deposits. Dots of Si K alpha were not seen in the control groups, and dense dots were observed in SO-injected groups, by EDXA area analysis. Conclusions. Some of the vacuoles might be artefacts caused by insufficient fixation or the operative procedure, but TEM showed almost no artefacts in the control optic nerve. Thus, most vacuoles may be SO storage sites. SO uptake into the optic nerve might play a role in the pathogenesis of optic nerve atrophy after SO injection.","EDXA; Emulsified silicone oil; Gas-mediated vitreous compression; Mapping; Myelin; Silicone oil; Vacuole","myelin; silicone oil; silicone oil; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; artifact; cell vacuole; controlled study; demyelination; disease severity; drug effect; emulsion; gas; glia; histology; microscopy; myelin sheath; nonhuman; optic nerve; optic nerve atrophy; pathogenesis; rabbit; surgical technique; transmission electron microscopy; vitrectomy; X ray analysis; animal; chemically induced disorder; electron microscopy; injection; methodology; optic nerve disease; pathology; ultrastructure; vitrectomy; X ray diffraction; Animals; Injections; Microscopy, Electron; Optic Nerve; Optic Nerve Diseases; Rabbits; Silicone Oils; Vitrectomy; X-Ray Diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047682877

The system has a capacitor bank of 5mF for energy storage, which can be charged up to 3000V. The pulse magnet has a bore of 30mm (including the pickup coil), which is subdivided into two coils and produces a maximum field of 5T with pulse frequencies of 17.5 and 25Hz. The magnetisation is measured with a well balanced and temperature stabilised coaxial pickup system. The signal is integrated with a stable analogue integrator with selectable time constants. The signals are connected to a 14bit 5M sample/s two-channel ADC in a computer. For the data handling a C++ -based computer program was written. The effects of eddy currents on the metallic samples are corrected by using the so-called f/2f method. Here two hysteresis measurements with two different time constants are used to measure the eddy current error. The function and reliability of the system is demonstrated by measuring the hysteresis of standard permanent magnets in the PFM and in a static system. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Twelve sportsmen volunteered for this study. The exercise test was performed on a mechanically braked Monark cycle ergometer and consisted of a triangular progressive test. Three blood samples were obtained in each test: at rest, just after exercise, and after recovery. The following hematological parameters were determined: red blood count (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hto), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total proteins (TP), serum iron (Fe) and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), ferritin (FER), transferrin (TRF), haptoglobin (HPT), and serum cortisol (COR) concentrations. We have found changes in hematological and biochemical variables related to Fe metabolism during the study. The changes observed could be the result of hemoconcentration processes after exercise and, at least in part, to physical stress and muscular damage. We conclude that athletes, after a period of adaptation, with a good plan of work/recovery series, undergo a biological redistribution on hematological and biochemical parameters concerning Fe metabolism during the training and competition period. Also, daily Fe supplementation could restore and mask the true repercussions of maintained training observed in other sports.","Exercise; Ferritin; Haptoglobin; Iron; Transferrin; Volleyball","ferritin; haptoglobin; hydrocortisone; iron; transferrin; acute phase response; adaptation; adult; article; bicycle ergometer; competition; controlled study; diet supplementation; exercise; hemoconcentration; human; human experiment; iron balance; iron binding capacity; iron blood level; iron deficiency; iron metabolism; iron storage; male; muscle injury; physical stress; sport; training; vitamin intake; blood; blood cell count; endurance; energy metabolism; exercise; fitness; metabolism; physiology; questionnaire; sport; Blood Cell Count; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Humans; Iron; Male; Physical Endurance; Physical Fitness; Questionnaires; Sports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036889584

Two modelling components were required: the first, SCAM (Soil Canopy Atmosphere Model), is a biophysical land surface model used to simulate the effects of shelter on the plant canopy and soil energy and water exchanges. The second is the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) configured for crop modelling (Carberry et al. 2002). This paper describes the link between the two and the parameterisations developed to simulate the effects of shelter and provide potential evaporation estimates for input to APSIM. A series of sensitivity analyses using SCAM demonstrate, as expected, that over the course of the growing season and during meteorological conditions typical of agricultural regions in south-eastern Australia, plant evaporation is relatively insensitive to wind speed. This is consistent with theory and illustrates that reducing wind speeds will only reduce evaporation fluxes when the (unsheltered) canopy evaporation rate exceeds the equilibrium evaporation rate. In other words, reductions in water loss as a result of shelter will arise from one or a combination of the following: (i) reduced soil evaporation following rainfall; (ii) reduced evaporation of rainfall intercepted by the plant canopy; and (iii) reduced plant transpiration during wet periods and/or periods of very high demand when transpiration exceeds the equilibrium evaporation rate. Increased storage of soil moisture as a result of shelter early in the season may sustain crop transpiration later in the growing season. While this may not modify seasonal water use, increased soil water availability for the growing crop may confer an advantage in terms of final yield. The paper then describes the development and validation of a bulk scalar transfer coefficient, or resistance, based on wind tunnel experiments investigating scalar (heat and water vapour) transport in windbreak flows. This coefficient is used in SCAM to parameterise the effect of shelter on the exchanges of heat and water between the atmosphere and the soil and/or plant canopy. A simple parameterisation for this coefficient is developed and implemented. The potential effects of shelter on evaporative demand and hence plant growth are then quantified by using the predictions of plant potential evaporation, calculated from a modified version of SCAM as input to APSIM. The simulations show that events where reduced evaporative demand benefits plant growth can occur intermittently in the latter part of the growing season (i.e. post-anthesis for cereals) for some climatic regimes, as illustrated by the simulations for the Roseworthy, Esperance and Atherton sites used in the National Windbreaks Program.","Atmospheric demand; Crop energy balance; Windbreaks","agricultural ecosystem; evaporation; microclimate; shelter; wind break",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036405499

The final four stages of a Berner impactor served to collect particles with aerodynamic diameters between 60nm and 1μm on polished silicon substrates at sampling times between 10s and 16min. In the single-particle impact regime (fractional coverage below 5%), most of the particles produced circular black tracks, of which 15 to 30% contained cores of carbonaceous nanoparticles. At a fractional coverage above about 10%, initially generated deposits became increasingly active as centres of preferred aerosol collection. As a result, the number of black spots remained almost constant, but the area per spot increased rapidly. At this stage of fractional coverage, structured aerosol matter became visible within large black areas of random shape. The deposits showed clear evidence for the onset of phase separation between carbon nanoparticles and material rich in sulphur, probably a mixture of alkaline and alkaline earth sulphates. After some time of sample storage in air the low-coverage sulphate matter tended to attain a fractal pattern. At a fractional coverage of several hundred per cent, large amorphous or crystalline objects had grown, but 30% or more of the nominal impact area still did not contain any aerosol matter. Moreover, carbon nanoparticles were found to be phase separated from the newly grown, very uniform aerosol material. The observations imply that sub-micrometer aerosol matter collected in impactors has lost memory of the original particle morphology. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this study, we have addressed the issue of capturing the variability of metabolic performance observed during muscle exercise in humans by using an original method of normalization. Metabolic changes induced by various kinds of exercise were investigated using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 4.7 T in 65 normal subjects (23 women and 42 men) and 12 patients with biopsy-proven muscular disorders. Large variations in the extent of PCr breakdown and intracellular acidosis were recorded among subjects and exercise protocols. For all the data pooled, the amplitude of mechanical performance accounts for 50% of these variations. When scaled to the work output, variations of PCr consumption account for 65% of pH changes through a linear relationship. This linear relationship was substantially improved (90%) when both variables were scaled to the square of work output performed (P1 and P2). By capturing most of the initial interindividual variability (90%), P1 vs. P2 relationship represents an ideal standardization procedure, independent of any anthropometric measurements. This relationship also discloses a significant link between the extent of PCr breakdown and intracellular acidosis regardless of exercise protocol. Moreover, changes in the slope of the P1 vs. P2 regression curve, as measured in old subjects and in selected patients, directly reflect alterations of energy production in muscle. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Energy metabolism; Human muscle; Muscle physiology; Muscular disease","acidosis; anthropometric parameters; article; cell kinetics; cell pH; clinical article; controlled study; exercise; female; glycogen storage disease type 5; human; male; metabolism; mitochondrial myopathy; muscle biopsy; muscle contraction; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; physical performance; physiology; priority journal; standardization; work",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037156876

To achieve these objectives, we systematically studied the effects of the gas pressure, the radio frequency (RF) power and the treatment time on the degree of crosslinking. The degree of crosslinking was measured by solvent extraction method (BXM: boiling xylene method).

A scaling of core stored energy is given as Wscale = Cεf-1Bp,f2Vcore, where εf is the inverse aspect ratio at the ITB foot, Bp,f is the poloidal magnetic field at the outer midplane ITB foot, and Vcore is the core volume inside the ITB foot. This scaling is equivalent to the condition for the core poloidal beta εfβp,core = C1 with C1 ≈ 1/4. Though Wcore is little dependent on Pnet, the estimated heat diffusivity in the ITB region moderately correlates with a neoclassical diffusivity, and the neoclassical transport is not inconsistent with the data.

At high temperature, a few degrees before melting, the two components have the same monoclinic phase RIV′ (C2/m, Z = 4). The solid-liquid equilibrium can be explained by simple isomorphism, and the solid-solid equilibria by crossed isodimorphism. The solid-liquid domain ([RIV′ + L]) is very narrow (less than 0.2 K), and the enthalpy of fusion is high enough to consider the alloys of the system as promising candidates for thermal energy storage. Three solid-solid domains were observed ([β + RIV′], [γ + RIV′] and [β + γ]), these are related by a peritectoid invariant at ≈323 K, with compositions from 55 and 80 mol% in C20H41OH.

Aceruloplasminemia is an iron metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene. It is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration in association with iron accumulation. Excess iron functions as a potent catalyst of biologic oxidation. Previously we showed that an increased iron concentration is associated with the products of lipid peroxidation in the serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain tissues. To clarify the free radical-mediated tissue injury caused by intracellular iron accumulation through mitochondrial dysfunction. Patients and Methods. We have measure brain oxygen and glucose metabolisms using positron emission tomography (PET) and examined brains at autopsy for iron contents and activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in two affected patients who had different truncation mutations of the ceruloplasmin gene. Results. PET showed a marked decrease in glucose and oxygen consumption in the entire brain of aceruloplasminemia patients, with a preponderance of metabolic reduction in basal ganglia. Enzyme activities in the mitochondrial respiratory chain of the basal ganglia were reduced to approximately 45% and 42% respectively for complexes I and IV. An inverse relationship was shown between the amounts of iron accumulated and the levels of mitochondrial enzyme activities in all the brain regions examined. Conclusion. Iron-mediated free radicals may contribute to the impairment of mitochondrial energy metabolism in aceruloplasminemia.","Free radical; Iron; Lipid peroxidation; Mitochondrial respiratory chain; Positron emission tomography","ceruloplasmin; free radical; glucose; iron; mitochondrial enzyme; oxygen; ceruloplasmin; glucose; oxygen; aceruloplasminemia; adult; aged; article; autopsy; basal ganglion; brain metabolism; brain oxygen consumption; case report; controlled study; degenerative disease; disorders of metal metabolism; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; female; gene mutation; glucose metabolism; human; human tissue; iron blood level; iron storage; lipid peroxidation; male; mitochondrial respiration; positron emission tomography; respiratory chain; tissue injury; blood; computer assisted emission tomography; iron metabolism disorder; metabolic encephalopathy; metabolism; middle aged; scintiscanning; Aged; Brain Diseases, Metabolic; Ceruloplasmin; Glucose; Humans; Iron Metabolism Disorders; Middle Aged; Oxygen; Tomography, Emission-Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036212028

Consequently, atmospheric and sea ice perturbations over the deep water production sites excite a large-scale response establishing an oceanic ""tele-connection"" with time scales of years to centuries. To study these feedbacks, a coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice model consisting of a two dimensional atmospheric energy and moisture balance model (EMBM) coupled to a thermodynamic sea ice model and an ocean general circulation model is utilised. The coupled model reproduces many aspects of the present oceanic circulation. We also investigate the climate impact of changes in fresh water balance during an ice age initiation. In this experiment part of the precipitation over continents is stored within continental ice sheets. During the buildup of ice sheets the oceanic stratification in the North Atlantic is weakened by a reduced continental run-off leading to an enhanced thermohaline circulation. Under these conditions salinity is redistributed such that deep water is more saline than under present conditions. Once the ice sheets built up, we simulate an ice age climate without net fresh water storage on the continents. In this case the coupled model reproduces the shallow and weak overturning cell, an ice edge advance insulating the upper ocean, and many other aspects of the glacial circulation.",,"atmosphere-ice-ocean system; climate feedback; climate modeling; (North); Atlantic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036198950

Supercooled thermal energy storage (Super-TES) stores thermal energy at temperatures lower than the melting point of the phase-change material (PCM), thus reducing the heat loss from the storage system. During nucleation and solidification, the temperature of PCM is not constant in Super-TES. The solidification process in Super-TES, therefore, influences the performance of the storage system because thermal properties of PCM, strongly depend on the temperature and phase of the material. The results show that the growth rate of the hydrate increased with increasing degree of supercooling and that this growth rate was slow compared with that of metals. When the degree of supercooling was less than about 10 K, the crystal of the hydrate grew like a single crystal, and the growth rate was approximately proportional to the third power of the degree of supercooling. Because the viscosity of the hydrate in the liquid phase below the melting point increased drastically, when the degree of supercooling exceeded about 10 K, the crystal grew like a dendritic crystal, and the increase in the growth rate with increasing degree of supercooling decreased.",,"Crystal growth; Heat storage; Nucleation; Sodium compounds; Solidification; Supercooling; Viscosity; Thermal energy; Crystallization; Crystallization; hydrate; performance; phase change; Solidification; Storage; Thermal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036095143

Such EPR pairs can be used to test nonlocality of electrons in solid state systems, and they form the basic resources for quantum information processing. The central idea is to exploit the spin correlations naturally present in superconductors in form of Cooper pairs possessing spin-singlet wavefunctions. We show that nonlocal spin-entanglement in form of an effective Heisenberg spin interaction is induced between electron spins residing on two quantum dots with no direct coupling between them, but each of them being tunnel-coupled to the same superconductor. We then discuss a nonequilibrium setup with an applied bias where mobile and nonlocal spin-entanglement can be created by coherent injection of two electrons, in a pair (Andreev) tunneling process, into two spatially separated quantum dots and subsequently into two Fermi liquid leads. The current for injecting two spin-entangled electrons into different leads shows a resonance and allows the injection of electrons at the same orbital energy, which is a crucial requirement for the detection of spin-entanglement via the current noise. On the other hand, tunneling via the same dot into the same lead is suppressed by the Coulomb blockade effect of the quantum dots. We discuss Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the current and show that they contain h/e and h/2e periods, which provides an experimental means to test the nonlocality of the entangled pair. Finally, we discuss a structure consisting of a superconductor weakly coupled to two separate one-dimensional leads with Luttinger liquid properties. We show that strong correlations again suppress the coherent subsequent tunneling of two electrons into the same lead, thus generating again nonlocal spin-entangled electrons in the Luttinger liquid leads. © 2002 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Entanglement; Luttinger liquids; Quantum dots; Superconductor; Transport; Tunneling","Coulomb blockade; Electron transport properties; Fermi liquids; Nonvolatile storage; Oscillations; Paramagnetic resonance; Semiconductor quantum dots; Solid state physics; Andreev tunneling; Entanglement; Luttinger liquids; Nonlocal spins; Resonant transport; Electron tunneling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9644266704

Miocene coal-bearing deposits are most substantial; resources related to them are located in the eight lignite-bearing regions with total quantity above 40 bill. Mg. Origin of major lignite deposits are tectonic and subrosional. Coal of the 4 economic seams belongs to the hypolignite group and is of rather good quality. Lignite in Poland is exploited from more than two hundred years. Recently, four large mines operate in central Poland (Adamów, Bełchatów and Konin) and south-eastern Poland (Turów). They produce about 60 mil. Mg of lignite per year. Almost whole coal is used as energy resource for five mouth-mine power plants, producing ca. 52 mil. MWh annually, and covering ca. 40% of Poland recent requirements. This energy is the cheapest one in Poland. Small amounts of lignite cover local requirements, and are used for production of valuable fertilisers. Also by-products: Ceramic and kaolin clays, bentonite, quartz sand and aggregate, and bog-lime are selectively exploited. The Legnica region is regarded as the most probable new operating mining area in the future. Complex technologies applied recently allow to substantially decrease environmental impact of mining, and the reclaimed areas are returned to agriculture and forestry. Final excavations are used as waste storage areas, and part of them is transformed into scenic lakes. Proper environmental protection and reclamation procedures are extremely important, because future of lignite mining development depends on its social acceptance.","By-products; Coal mining; Coal quality; Lignite resources; Perspectives; Poland; Power production; Tertiary","coal mining; coal rank; exploitation; lignite; Tertiary; Poland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036991194

In neonates and low birthweight infants, the amount and the quality of the nutritional lipids is of particular functional importance because of the rapid growth and the very limited endogenous lipid stores. The availability and the metabolism of membrane components such as long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), phospholipids and cholesterol have direct effects on the functions of cell membranes. Several studies show that the early supply of docosahexaenoic acid influences visual and cognitive functions at later ages. LC-PUFA also regulate gene expression and serve as substrates for the formation of the bioactive eicosanoids prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes, which modulate thrombocyte aggregation, inflammatory reactions, postnatal closure of the ductus arteriosus and development of immune phenotypes. Most infants >28 gestational weeks clear 2 g intavenous lipids per kg bodyweight daily, and infants >32 weeks up to 3 g/kg. About 30% of infants between the 27th and 32nd gestational week develop lipid concentrations in the serum >100 mg/dl with lipid infusions dosed at 2 to 3 g/kg, which, however, are also regularly observed in enterally fed infants. An increased risk for hypertriglyceridemia exists in very immature infants <28 gestational weeks and in severe infections or distress, where serum triglyceride concentrations should be measured. It appears reasonable to adjust the lipid dose to avoid serum triglycericles >200 mg/dl. Retrospective studies had raised concerns on potential adverse effects of an early lipid supply in preterm infants on later rates of chronic lung disease and mortality, but a meta-analysis of five prospective controlled studies showed no adverse effects of intravenous lipids within the first 5 days of life. Lipid emulsions based on soy bean oil have been traditionally used in paediatric patients but the adequacy of this practice has been challenged, primarily because of the high PUFA content and low vitamin E content. More recently, alternative lipid emulsions have been made available for paediatric clinical practice. These emulsions contain physical admixtures of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and soy bean oil thereby reducing the amount of PUFA. A lipid emulsion on the basis of olive oil and soy bean oil provides a reduced content of PUFA and larger proportions of oleic acid. New products with preformed long-chain n-3 fatty acids derived from marine fish oil have become available and may improve the n-3 fatty acid status in infancy. © 2002, Elsevier Science Ltd.

The 10-member crown (referred to as O2N2) undergoes a reversible photo- and thermally driven isomerisation, similarly as parent azobenzene. It is expected that constraints imposed by the crown on conformations of azobenzene-containing crown ethers may modify the energetics of the isomerisation process. The experiments were performed in pMMA matrices. The isomerisation was monitored spectrophotometrically. The transcis isomerisation was driven photochemically (λ = 365 or 500 nm) and the reverse cis-trans isomerisation was driven by the excitation in the visible (413 nm) or occurred spontaneously in the dark. The pre-exponential factor of the latter process amounts to ca. 6 × 1011 s-1 and the activation energy is equal to ca. 118 kJ/mol, being higher than in other azobenzene-containing crown ethers and in parent azobenzene. The stability of the cis isomer at room temperature is much higher than that in other crown ethers, the extrapolated ambient-temperature time constant being of the order of several years. The stability of the cis form of O2N2 in the darkness, combined with a good reversibility is a promising feature for future applications of the material in optical data storage. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

One such mechanism that enhances oxygen delivery seasonally is an increase in blood oxygen carrying capacity. This response is enhanced in birds because of their rapid erythrocyte turnover rate. Some small birds have also evolved winter fattening, which helps them to meet the energy challenge presented by winter conditions. Such adaptations, while well documented for North Temperate birds, have received little attention in birds inhabiting temperate Australia. Over a two-year period, we examined seasonal changes in mass, an approximate indicator of fattening, and the parameters determining blood oxygen carrying capacity in a population of superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus) in outer Melbourne, Australia. Body mass did not vary significantly seasonally, but haematocrit and whole blood haemoglobin were significantly higher in the breeding season than at other times of year and the erythrocyte count was significantly higher in spring than in autumn. We conclude that the failure of the fairy-wrens to increase mass in winter (i.e. show marked winter fattening) was probably due to the comparative mildness of the climate and to the known fitness costs of fat storage. The significant 18% increase in blood oxygen carrying capacity in spring probably helped the birds to meet the additional energy requirements of breeding, particularly the likely increase in flight activity. However, given the magnitude of the increase, other mechanisms must have been involved in meeting breeding costs. The seasonal peak in blood oxygen carrying capacity did not coincide with the time when moulting was most pronounced.",,"body mass; energy; oxygen; passerine; seasonal variation; Australia; Aves; Malurus cyaneus; Passeriformes; Troglodytes troglodytes; Troglodytinae; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036406854

Eleven specific enzyme deficiencies of carbohydrate oxidation affect skeletal muscle alone or in combination with other tissues, such as liver, heart or red blood cells. These hereditary glycogen storage diseases cause two major clinical presentations: one characterized by fixed, often progressive muscle weakness, and the other by acute, intermittent, and reversible muscle dysfunction manifesting as exercise intolerance (myalgia on exertion, muscle contractures, myoglobinuria). Recent findings: The focus of this review is on recent developments in: clinical features, including a brief description of the newest identified glycogen storage disease type XIII; molecular genetic studies discussing genotype-phenotype correlations in some carbohydrate oxidation disorders; pathophysiological mechanisms, especially those assessed by non-invasive 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy; and therapeutic approaches such as nutritional supplementation and gene therapy, including recombinant enzyme replacement. Summary: Although major progress has been made in an understanding of the molecular genetic bases of carbohydrate oxidation defects, the pathophysiology of exercise intolerance and muscle weakness remains to be further clarified.

Day-to-day variability in the hydrographical and biological features of the estuary during the study period was due to changes in meteorological and tidal conditions. Phytoplankton biomass and primary production increased with the improvement of weather, i.e., light conditions, during neap tides. Thus a mixed bloom of cryptophyceans, Euglena sp., and the dinoflagellate Peridinium foliaceum developed in the middle and upper estuary. Photosynthetic responses of phytoplankton were related to the time-scale of changes in light regime. Allocation of photosynthate to major macromolecular classes (LMWM, lipid, polysaccharide, and protein), like phytoplankton biomass and primary production, showed strong spatio-temporal variability. High carbon fixation into low molecular weight metabolites was associated with growth limitation by low light. The relative incorporation of photosynthetic carbon into proteins increased at the beginning of the phytoplankton bloom but overall, it was rather constant. However, carbon allocation into storage products such us lipid or polysaccharide increased when carbon and energy produced under optimal growth conditions exceeded what could be assimilated into protein. These patterns are explained by both spatio-temporal changes in the environmental conditions and species-specific differences. In general, daily variability appeared to be more important than diurnal periodicity in the physiological responses of phytoplankton. Results from this study show that phytoplankton photosynthesis and carbon metabolism are simultaneously affected by biotic and abiotic factors, although short-term light fluctuations may have a major influence on the physiological state of phytoplankton in the Urdaibai estuary.","Carbon metabolism; Physiological state; Phytoplankton; Short-term variability; Summer bloom; Urdaibai estuary","Biomass; Carbon; Estuaries; Metabolism; Metabolites; Molecular weight; Photosynthesis; Physiology; Proteins; Tides; Environmental conditions; Environmental engineering; biotic factor; carbon; environmental factor; estuary; photosynthesis; physiology; phytoplankton; Atlantic Ocean; algae; Cryptophyta; Dinophyceae; Euglena; Peridinium; Peridinium foliaceum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037095953

A conventional batch-type implanter requires tilted implantation to suppress the spatial variation in a wafer. Tilted implantation, however, imposes a limit on inter-well isolation, since it deteriorates the punchthrough resistance between the source-drain diffusion and the well, and causes variation in the threshold voltage for metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) around the well boundary. A parallel beam produced by a single-wafer implanter is found to give quite a uniform doping profile even for 0°-normal implantation. Small tilt angle implantation using a high-energy parallel beam improves inter-well isolation by ∼ 0.16 μm compared with the conventional 7°-tilted implantation, which yields a ∼ 15% reduction in the static random access memory (SRAM) cell size. This advanced retrograde well technology is indispensable for inter-well isolation of a 90-nm-node embedded SRAM with a sub-1-μm2 cell. © 2002 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","High-energy ion implantation; Parallel beam; Retrograde well; Silicon; System on a chip","Ion implantation; Microprocessor chips; Semiconducting silicon; Silicon wafers; Threshold voltage; High-energy ion implantation; Parallel beam; Retrograde wells; System on a chip; Random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32444440042

In this FES, an induction machine of which the winding connection was controllable was used to eliminate the power converter from the conventional FES system. This reduced the total cost of the FES system, because the price of the electronic power converter is a large part of the total FES system cost. In this paper, the new system configuration was proposed and the operation of the suggested FES system using the induction motor/generator was explained in detail. A new levitation system which consisted of the HTS wire and bulks was proposed. This levitation system was designed to produce a very high levitation force to store the same amount of energy compared to that of the high-speed conventional FES system.

Differential scanning calorimetry on PBT specimens deformed both below and above their glass-transition temperature (Tg ≈ 50 °C) showed the presence of a broad exothermal peak whose area represents the energy released for the nonelastic strain recovery. This energy became more and more pronounced as the strain level increased, and it decreased as the deformation temperature increased, even if a significant contribution was detected on specimens deformed at temperatures much higher than Tg. For two temperature conditions (21 and 100 °C), strain-recovery master curves were built showing the following two distinct deformation components: one recoverable with time and another one irreversible, this latter one arising from relatively low levels of strain. The recoverable component can be erased by heating the material at temperatures much higher than its Tg, close to the onset of the melting process. On the other hand, the irreversible strain component does not recover even if the material is brought close to the onset of the crystals melting. The shift factor for the strain-recovery master curves was compared with the shift factor for the construction of the dynamic storage modulus master curve obtained in the linear viscoelastic regime (small strain). © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

Technological developments over recent years in the field of thermal electricity generation, together with research and technologies emerging from environmentally friendly systems, are allowing increases in the efficiency of energy generating processes accompanied by a reduction in polluting gases released into the atmosphere. This work develops the methodology for defining and designing a cogeneration plant based on a combined cycle and using a computer program to provide time simulation. By way of example, the results obtained from the thermal power station of a chemical complex are given. As a novel feature, the work includes the application of a system to capture carbon dioxide, a gas that makes a significant contribution to the so-called 'greenhouse effect', the main cause of global warming. The work carried out allows highly accurate forecasting of future working of the cogeneration system in the proposed application, and analysis of the performance of the plant as a function of its capacity to capture carbon dioxide. The work also considers the feasibility of long-term confinement of the captured carbon dioxide in the deep ocean, and analyses its impact on plant efficiency. Finally, an economical analysis of the proposed plant is included in order to evaluate the impact of the potential carbon dioxide capture and storage system. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the heating run of the hydride of LaNi5, two endothermic peaks were observed. One was the peak for the transformation from the γ phase (full hydride LaNi5H6) to the β phase (hydride LaNi5H3).

To prove this hypothesis the connection between ketone bodies and citrate formation of milk was studied. A fluorimetric method was used to determine citrate and a headspace sampling gas chromatographic (GC) method was developed for determination of ketone bodies. Under real conditions of milk sampling, transport and storage, preserved milk samples of 119 clinically healthy dairy cows obtained in the 48 hours after milking were investigated. A low level of acetoacetate (ACAC) was found in all samples. This fact can be explained by the spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate during sample storage (previously decarboxylised acetoacetate = pdACAC) and, consequently, the majority of the amount of acetoacetate in the samples (AC+pdACAC) appeared in the measured acetone concentrations. Based on the measured acetone concentration of milk samples two groups were formed retrospectively: HA (high-acetone) group (n = 41) with an AC+pdACAC concentration of > 0.4 mmol/1 and a LA (low-acetone) group (n = 78) with an AC+pdACAC level of ≤ 0.4 mmol/l. In the milk of cows of Group HA a positive correlation (r = +0.623) and linear connection between acetone (AC+pdACAC) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) levels was found [BOHB = 2.491 + 0.586 × (pdAC + ACAC)]. Furthermore, in this group a negative correlation between citrate and BOHB and AC+pdACAC was also established (r = -0.579). Focusing on the results of this group the authors found a significant drop of AC+pdACAC and citrate during the metabolically critical first 1-4 weeks of lactation. For this reason they suggest that simple, easy, automated methods (i.e. flow injection analysis, Fourier transformation infrared analysis) should be introduced for the simultaneous determination of acetone and citrate concentration in milk to make the evaluation of the energy status of high-producing dairy cows easier and more certain.","Citrate; Cow's milk; Ketone bodies","3 hydroxybutyric acid; acetoacetic acid; acetone; citric acid; ketone body; animal; animal disease; article; automation; cattle; cattle disease; concentration (parameters); controlled study; correlation analysis; dairy cattle; dairying; decarboxylation; energy; female; flow injection analysis; fluorometry; gas chromatography; infrared spectroscopy; ketoacidosis; lactation; metabolism; methodology; milk; milk level; nonhuman; pregnancy; preservation; sampling; storage; Animalia; Antidesma platyphyllum; Bos taurus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036373675

The treatments were 1) Control (defatted rice bran; DFRB), 2) fresh rice bran (FRB) and 3) rancid rice bran (RRB). Rice brans were intentionally spoiled by two degrees of rancidity by the values of free fatty acids (FFA): 7.6% (FRB) and 16.3% (RRB). Diets were prepared on an isonutrient basis, and defatted or rancid rice brans were included 5 and 10% for starter (0-3 week) and finisher (3-6 week), respectively. At the end of the feeding trial, six chicks per treatment were sacrificed, and thigh meats were ground and stored at 1°C for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and peroxide value (POV) analyses. For a digestibility, 48 growing chicks (4 weeks old) were employed in cages (3 replicates/treatment, 2 birds/cage) according to the experimental design: FRB, RRB, pelleted and extruded rice bran. Some of the FRB were pelleted (70°C) or extruded (110°C). There was no significant difference in growth performance during the starter period, but chicks fed a diet containing DFRB grew faster (p<0.05) with increased feed intake (p<0.05) than those fed diets containing rice brans, FRB or RRB, during the finisher period. Feed conversion ratio in the RRB was inferior (p<0.05) to the DFRB. Between rice bran groups, weight gain was higher (pco.os) in FRB than in RRB during finisher period. There was a similar trend in growth performance of chicks for the overall period (0-6 week) as the finisher period. Dry matter and energy digestibilities were higher (p<0.05) in extruded than in RRB group. Protein digestibility was improved (p<0.05) when rice bran was extruded, but not pelleted. The chicken meats from RRB showed higher (p<0.05) TBARS than those from FRB during storage for 4 weeks at 1°C. In conclusion, it would appear that feeding rancid rice bran gave negative effects on growth performance and lipid stability of meat in broiler chicks.","Chicken Meat Quality; Digestibility; Growth; Rancidity; Rice Bran","Aves; Gallus gallus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035982442

In lupins, seed oil content varies from 16% in Lupinus mutabilis to 8% in L. angustifolius. We have shown that TAGs rapidly accumulate during mid-stages of seed development in L. mutabilis compared to the lower seed oil species, L. angustifolius. In this study, we have targeted the key enzymes of the lipid biosynthetic pathway, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DAGAT), to determine factors regulating TAG accumulation between two lupin species. A twofold increase in ACCase activity was observed in L. mutabilis relative to L. angustifolius and correlated with rapid TAG accumulation. No difference in DAGAT activity was detected. We have identified, cloned and partially characterised a novel gene differentially expressed during TAG accumulation between L. angustifolius and L. mutabilis. The gene has some identity to the glucose dehydrogenase family previously described in barley and bacteria and the significance of its expression levels during seed development in relation to TAG accumulation is discussed. DNA sequence analysis of the promoter in both L. angustifolius and L. mutabilis identified putative matrix attachment regions and recognition sequences for transcription binding sites similar to those found in the Adh1 gene from Arabidopsis. The identical promoter regions between species indicate that differential gene expression is controlled by alternative transcription factors, accessibility to binding sites or a combination of both. © Springer-Verlag 2002.","Glucose dehydrogenase; Lupins; Matrix attachment regions; Triacylglycerol","acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; diacylglycerol acyltransferase; glucose dehydrogenase; triacylglycerol; acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; acyltransferase; diacylglycerol acyltransferase; triacylglycerol; article; binding site; controlled study; DNA sequence; enzyme activity; gene expression; gene identification; genetic transcription; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lupin; lupinus angustifolius; Lupinus mutabilis; molecular cloning; molecular recognition; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plant genetics; plant metabolism; plant seed; priority journal; promoter region; seed development; sequence analysis; species comparison; amino acid sequence; comparative study; enzymology; gene dosage; genetics; metabolism; molecular genetics; Arabidopsis; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Lupinus angustifolius; Lupinus mutabilis; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; Acyltransferases; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase; Gene Dosage; Glucose 1-Dehydrogenase; Glucose Dehydrogenases; Lupinus; Molecular Sequence Data; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Seeds; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842866723

The decay times range from 4 to 60 s and from 0.05 to 0.6 s for the slow and fast decays, respectively. The former is attributed to the visco-elastic fluctuation of the constituent particles in the colloidal lattices and the latter to their synchronous elastic fluctuation. The slow decay times obtained from the electric potential measurements are larger than those obtained from the reflection measurements, whereas the fast decay times obtained by the former are smaller than those obtained by the latter.

For the particular case of Au7+ this study is expanded to include the energy dependence of the branching ratio. In connection with the sequential decay of Au8+ the information can be used for a model-free determination of the dissociation energy of Au8+. A second line of studies concerns the production, properties and storage behavior of polyanionic gold clusters. Such species have recently been produced by electron attachment to monoanionic gold clusters stored in the Penning trap. While collisional excitation may lead to ion loss due to changes of the ion motion upon electron emission, the competition between electron detachment and neutral atom evaporation can be studied by laser excitation.

Optimisation of industrial energy systems may show a way towards improved use of resources in energy supply as well as in production processes. The deregulation of the electricity market in some countries increases flexibility in electricity contracts. Taking advantage of the price structure in these contracts is one of the ways to minimise the energy costs and decrease the influence on the environment. Thermal energy stores are very suitable facilities for achieving these goals, having the capability of moving energy use from one period of time to another and thereby influencing not only energy cost but also costs related to power demand if electric energy use is involved. In this paper, the influence on energy costs, energy and material flows resulting from the use of energy storage is discussed. Energy storage has been modelled by using MIND (Method for analysis of INDustrial energy systems) in the form that has recently been developed by the author.

In this paper, we show how oystercatchers increase their intake over the longer term using mussel colour as a cue. Wintering oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus feed extensively on mussels Mytilus edulis in the estuaries of southern Britain. They show a marked preference for brown-shelled mussels over the commoner black-shelled morph, and we show that this enables them to maximize their rate of energy gain over a longer period than a single foraging bout. The brown and black mussels did not differ in ventral thickness and energy content, which are the main criteria for mussel selection and most important for short-term optimization. The brown mussels contained significantly less moisture, so by selecting them, oystercatchers could pack more mussel flesh into their limited oesophageal storage capacity. This enables them to increase their overall consumption during a feeding bout and increases their long-run energy gain rate, to an extent that is large enough to be significant for survival, especially during the short exposure of the mussel beds in winter.","Colour preference; Intake rate; Mussel; Optimality; Oystercatcher; Polymorphism","color; diet; food intake; optimum foraging theory; prey preference; wader; article; color; energy; feeding; food intake; mussel; nonhuman; oyster; prey; priority journal; survival; Animals; Birds; Bivalvia; Color; Cues; Diet; Ecosystem; England; Feeding Behavior; Predatory Behavior; Survival Rate; United Kingdom; Bivalvia; Haematopodidae; Haematopus; Haematopus ostralegus; Musculus niger; Mytilus; Mytilus edulis; Ostreidae; Scolopacidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53149129035

On structures with W-plugs two voiding modes with different activation energies were observed, on Cu-lines with DD-vias a monomodal behavior only.

The average kinetic energy of the ions was found to increase with increasing space charge, mean free path and the ion charge state. For a trapped ion in a given coulombic field, the mass of the ion and the amplitude of the applied RF potential did not affect the average kinetic energy. The consequences for multipole-storage-assisted dissociation (MSAD), in which ions are accumulated for prolonged periods of time in the multipole ion trap of an electrospray ion source, are discussed. As a result of radial stratification inside the ion trap, MSAD can lead to the preferential excitation of ions with larger m/z values. Such discrimination would have negative consequences for the detection of labile non-covalent adducts, which are normally detected at higher m/z values than their constituent species.","Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR); Hexapole ion trap; Ion optical modelling","ion; article; calculation; covalent bond; cycloaddition; dissociation; electric potential; energy; kinetics; mass spectrometry; radiofrequency; signal detection; stratification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036013640

The supercooled thermal energy storage (Super-TES) stores thermal energy at temperatures lower than the melting point of the phase-change material, which reduces heat loss from the storage system. The thermophysical properties of disodium hydrogenphosphate dodecahydrate were used for the calculation. From the results of the calculation, we found that Super-TES is more advantageous than the conventional latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) when the initial temperature of the storage system is close to the melting point of the hydrate. Although the efficiencies of LHTES monotonically decrease with increasing storage temperature, the efficiencies of Super-TES reach the maximum when the storage temperature is higher than the ambient temperature. The optimal storage temperature that gives Super-TES the maximum efficiency increases with the storage volume and the thickness of the thermal insulation. ©2002 IEEE.",,"Computer simulation; Crystallization; Melting; Power generation; Solidification; Supercooling; Thermal insulation; Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES); Phase-change materials (PCM); Sensible heat thermal energy storage (SHTES); Thermal energy; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844508564

The reproductive cycle was studied by visual inspection of the gonad, the use of the gonad condition index, the gonad dry weight of a standard queen scallop 50-mm height, the average oocyte diameter and the percentage of the gonad occupied by oocytes. The same results were obtained with each of these methods. Following a resting period in autumn, which varied in length depending on the year, there was a period of recovery in winter, followed by a spawning period lasting until the end of summer. There were several partial spawnings, followed by recovery periods until the gonad was totally spent. Accumulated reserves in the adductor muscle (glycogen and proteins) and digestive gland (lipids) were used up during gametogenesis. The weight and condition indices of both organs and their reserve substrate contents showed parallel changes throughout the two years of the study.","Aequipecten opercularis; Breeding season; Energy reserves; Reproduction; Ría de Arousa","breeding season; mollusc; reproductive cycle; spawning; Spain; Aequipecten opercularis; Bivalvia; Invertebrata; Mollusca; Pectinidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036967340

A simple way to prepare oil in water (O/W) emulsions is using a tank and an agitation device. The aim of this work is to propose a technology to prepare surfactant-fuel oil-water emulsions by means of a system involving a tank equipped with baffles, and an agitation device. The employed fuel oil was a high-viscosity fraction, which makes it difficult to handle. Axial, radial, and mixed flow impellers were assessed in the preparation of O/W emulsions, with and without the presence of baffles. Sixteen commercial surfactants were evaluated on the O/W emulsion formation. The effect of the storage temperature on the emulsions stability was assessed. The presence of salt on the surfactant-fuel oil-water emulsion was also investigated. Power vs. Reynolds numbers, extremely important data for the scaling up of the process, were calculated in basis of the power drawn when preparing the emulsions. Total consumption energy applied to the system, as well as pumping capacity were measured and related to the quality of the O/W emulsions obtained. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The designer has to take this fact into consideration, together with the system performance, in order to design devices portable or otherwise. An exploration approach for optimising the power and performance of the datamemory hierarchy as well as the instruction memory in the early system-design phase, is introduced. A power- and performance-efficient data-memory hierarchy is obtained by applying data-reuse transformations in a high-level description of the application, whereas the instruction-memory power optimisation, of the selected optimal data hierarchies of the previous step, is achieved by using a suitably selected cache memory. Furthermore, two cache energy models, namely the high-level power model and the architecture-dependent power model, are introduced. The experimental results, obtained with four well known motion-estimation kernels, provide an insight on the trade-offs among algorithm performance and energy consumption, comparing memory hierarchies with and without an instruction cache for the ARM programmable core. Comparisons results are also provided for choosing an optimal cache memory size.",,"Algorithms; Buffer storage; Energy utilization; Multimedia systems; Optimization; Systems analysis; Multimedia kernels; Power exploration; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036630503

To properly to assess differences and draw valid comparisons, the two heating methods used in the experiment were applied to samples for identical exposure times, and the samples were heated to attain the same final temperatures. Although the soluble Ca and Pi contents were lower in the heated milk samples, no significant differences in salt partitioning were found between microwave and conventional heating. Ionic calcium levels in the milk samples pasteurized using microwave energy were very close to the levels in the samples heated in a conventional water bath (∼90% of the level in the untreated milk samples). The microwave heating-induced changes were completely reversed after storage at 20 °C for 24 h. The coagulation properties of the heated milk samples were also examined, and the coagulation time was longer and the curd formation rate slower in the microwave-heated milk than in the raw milk. Still, the experimental results demonstrated that microwave heating was no more detrimental to the milk than conventional heating and could thus be used for pasteurization purposes.","Calcium; Heating; Microwave; Milk; Mineral balance","calcium; magnesium; mineral; phosphate; potassium; sodium; sodium chloride; animal; article; bath; chemistry; energy; exposure; heat; heating; microwave radiation; milk; mineral balance; partition chromatography; pasteurization; room temperature; Animalia; Animals; Calcium; Heat; Magnesium; Microwaves; Milk; Minerals; Phosphates; Potassium; Sodium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037051504

SEM and EDS analyses have indicated that the microstructure of melt-spun alloy is a very fine dendritic structure (10×3 μm), while the as-cast alloy is a much coarser dendritic structure (300×50 μm) with noticeable composition segregation. Electrochemical tests have indicated that the melt-spun alloy has a higher discharge capacity of 385 mA h g-1 in comparison with 371 mA h g-1 for the as-cast alloy and the melt-spun alloy has very good cycling stability. After 500 cycles, 80.7% of the initial discharge capacity is retained, much higher than 63.1% of the as-cast alloy. It is thus inferred that the electrochemical capacity of the nanocrystallite C14 phase is higher than that of the conventional C14 phase. Nevertheless, the activation property and the high-rate dischargeability of the melt-spun alloy were both found to decrease noticeably, most probably due to the higher resistance against decrepitation and cracking of the alloy with a more refined grain structure. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Most of our previous work investigated the determination of residual gas saturation for sandstone reservoirs with high values of porosity and permeability.

A number of cores from a Western Canada carbonate reservoir were tested as part of an experimental program to determine the residual gas saturation at ambient conditions. Primary and secondary spontaneous imbibition tests were performed on each core plug. Different initial water saturation conditions were used and the obtained results were compared. The centrifuge technique was used to set the initial water saturation. The initial imbibition rate was found to be the key for residual gas saturation. The effects of core plug properties were addressed. Our work also addressed the prediction of field scale recovery by application of simple scale-up laws. Different simple predictive models, which were used to fit sandstone reservoirs successfully, were tested as part of this work.

The strategy pursued in some industrial European countries of granting priority to regenerative sources and subsidizing the infeed of raw natural energy into the electrical grid is ineffective when mainly thermal power stations are employed for grid control; the control should include regenerative sources as well. Also, part of the expected fuel saving by the use of wind or solar energy is lost through the control of the thermal stations. When further expanding the use of renewable sources it is necessary to develop large energy storage facilities for decoupling generation from consumption; chemical storage could facilitate a flexible demand-driven reconversion to electricity with stationary or mobile fuel cells.

The stationary thermal equilibrium state is determined through the analytical solution of a two-dimensional heat diffusion problem for an infinitely long cylinder with different thermal conductivities inside and outside the cylinder, both spatially variable. In the exterior of the cylinder, convective heat transport is approximated in terms of a linear diffusive process, while in its interior convection is assumed to be suppressed and only the much smaller radiative conductivity remains. The results show that, under the conditions prevailing near the bottom of the solar convection zone and in the limit of small cylinder radius, the temperature disturbance (thermal shadow) in the exterior of the insulating cylinder is almost negligible due to the large efficiency of convective energy transport. The spatial dependence of the conductivities and the curvature of the external temperature profile lead to a temperature excess in the interior with respect to the undisturbed temperature profile far away from the cylinder. We show that, within the framework of the thin magnetic flux tube approximation, this temperature excess is due to a heating term equal to the negative divergence of the undisturbed radiative heat flow, as suggested earlier by Fan & Fisher (1996). These results are independent of the treatment of the convective transport in the exterior as long as the stratification is almost adiabatic. The consequences for the storage of magnetic flux in the solar convection zone, brought about by the enhanced buoyancy and caused by the heating effect, are discussed.","Sun: interior; Sun: magnetic fields","Buoyancy; Computer simulation; Fourier transforms; Heat transfer coefficients; Magnetic flux; Molecular weight; Perturbation techniques; Temperature; Thermal conductivity; Thermal diffusion; Thermal effects; Thermal gradients; Heating effect; Magnetic flux tube; Stationary thermal equilibrium state; Stellar convection zone; Undisturbed radiative heat flow; Astrophysics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036612267

In this plan, we consider the transport and storage of a large quantity of hydrogen in a large tank. First we must evaluate the consequence of the postulated accident of liquid hydrogen. Since we have developed the multi-phase hydrodynamics analysis code (CHAMPAGNE), we apply the code to simulate the formation and dispersion of hydrogen vapor clouds. In the present paper we have improved the calculation model in two ways. We added a function to CHAMPAGNE for solving evaporation phenomena realistically, made many parametric calculations and planned the small-scale hydrogen dispersion experiments for the validation of this model. Another improvement is the turbulent mixing of evaporated liquid hydrogen. Now we have completed the basic functions of our simulation code.

Unlike related approaches, the technique utilizes the fixed order of memory accesses and data correlation of video sequences by dynamically adjusting the memory bitwidth to the number of bits changed per pixel. Instead of treating data bits independently, we group the most significant bits together, activating the corresponding group of bit lines adaptively to data variation. The approach is not restricted to specific bit patterns, nor does it depend on the storage phase. It works equally well on read and write accesses, as well as during precharging. Simulations show that in using this method, we can reduce the total energy consumption of frame memory by 20% without affecting the picture quality. The implementation scheme is simple yet compact.","Bit compression; Frame memory; Low-power design; Video encoders","Computer architecture; Computer simulation; Data compression; Image coding; Optimization; Video encoders; Data storage equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036687131

The plateau pressure was effectively decreased by the partial substitutions of Zr for Ti, while the slope was increased. It was found that the decrease of stoichiometry and the substitutions of V, Cu were very effective in improving the sloping properties and the improvement of sloping properties was mainly attributed to the strain energy effect. After careful balancing of the substitution effects of the alloying elements, it was found that showed good plateau characteristics with considerably small hysteresis and sloping. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

At higher frequencies (1-100 Hz), anisotropic elastic behavior was observed. This observation confirmed the viscoelastic nature of the coating. A master curve for the storage modulus of NiCoCrAlY coating was successfully constructed using appropriate shift-factors. This master curve can then be used for finite element or design analyses to provide important data input.

The procedure aims at finding the configuration that yields the best compromise for the two considered objectives: the long-term average performance and the overall cost of the generating system. In particular, the objectives of the optimization problem are: the maximization of the Supplied Load Fraction, that is the fraction of the actual electrical load that can be supplied by the system, and the minimization of the Relative Unit Electricity Cost, that is the net cost of generating each kWh during the lifetime of the stand-alone solar electrical system referred to the UEC calculated in case of loads supplied by the grid. The control variables are the solar cell array surface, the tilt angle of the modules, and the storage system capacity. The fuzzy multi-objective optimization procedure is described and the application results are presented considering different configurations characterized by some parameters, such as the electrical load, the yearly power demand, the distance from the utility grid, and the solar cells unit cost.

The degradation of the response of position-sensitive X-ray tomography detectors in the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak is found after neutron exposure produced by deuterium-deuterium and deuterium-tritium plasma fusion experiments. For the purpose of further detailed characterization of the neutron degradation effects, an azimuthally varying-field (AVF) cyclotron accelerator is employed using well-calibrated neutron fluence. These neutron effects on the detector responses are characterized using synchrotron radiation from a 2.5GeV positron storage ring at the Photon Factory (KEK). The effects of neutrons on X-ray sensitive semiconductor depletion thicknesses are also investigated using an impedance analyser. Novel findings of (i) the dependence of the response degradation on X-ray energies as well as (ii) the recovery of the degraded detector response due to the detector bias application are found and interpreted by systematically combined methods using a synchrotron facility, a cyclotron facility, a fusion plasma device, material analysis methods along with our recent theory on semiconductor X-ray responses. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The excess power generation capacity, which is available when demand is low, is used to store energy in the form of compressed air. This energy is then retrieved during peak demand periods. The structural features and leakage stabilities of the air storage site determines the efficiencies of energy conversions and corresponding economics. The objectives of this paper is to formulate advanced criteria for design of CAES systems in hard rock in Israel, and to examine specific designs performance through predictions available from numerical models. Underground space provides opportunities for safe storage and conservation of energy. This concerns enhanced protection and security as well as lower response to external thermal and mechanical influences (impact and vibrations) that characterize highly controlled environments. Design examples of CAES system are presented and their geomechanical and thermal responses to compression and air release cycles are considered.

The 2-step chylomicron metabolism consists of lipolysis by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) on vessel walls and hepatic uptake of triglyceride-depleted remnants. A triglyceride-rich emulsion that mimics chylomicrons, labeled with [9, 10−3H]glycerol-trioleate (TG) and [1−14C] cholesteryl-oleate (CE) was intravenously injected into 14 obese women with body mass index between 30 and 40 kg/m2 (age, 30 to 40 years), before and after a 2-month energy-restricted diet and into non-obese controls for determination of radioactive lipid plasma kinetics. TG kinetics evaluates lipolysis, whereas CE kinetics evaluates remnant removal. The emulsion TG fractional clearance rate (FCR, in min−1) was similar in obese women and their controls (0.126 ± 0.065; controls, 0.111 ± 0.031), but the CE-FCR was pronouncedly reduced in the obese subjects (0.028 ± 0.014; controls, 0.070 ± 0.009 min−1; P &lt;.0001). After the energy-restricted diet, TG-FCR was reduced in the obese women (0.075 ± 0.044 min−1; P &lt;.05), but CE-FCR was unchanged (0.032 ± 0.025 min−1). Therefore, the lipolysis of the chylomicron-like emulsion is normal in obese women, but remnant removal from the plasma is diminished. After active weight loss by an energy-restricted diet, the remnant removal was unchanged but lipolysis was diminished, possibly due to adaptative changes in LPL activity.

No effective therapy except surgery has been available for Peyronie's disease. We investigated the clinical efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave treatment (ESWT) using EDAP LT-02 as an alternative method of treatment for Peyronie's disease. Methods: Five patients aged 35-65 years were treated by ESWT. All patients had undergone unsuccessful medical treatment before ESWT. Each patient was treated by ESWT (7-40 storages at an energy density of 45-96 MPa) between three and five times at 4-week intervals. Although no patient needed anesthesia, all were administered diclofenac suppository (50 mg) before ESWT. Results: Of the five patients, four were eligible for evaluation. The penile plaque disappeared in one patient (25%). In the other three patients (75%), the penile plaque did not disappear, but softened. Although no improvement of erectile penile curvature was recognized, erectile penile pain disappeared in all patients. Conclusions: These results indicate that ESWT is a possible alternative to surgery in the treatment of Peyronie's disease.","Extracorporeal shock wave treatment; Peyronie's disease","diclofenac; adult; aged; anesthesia; article; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; erectile dysfunction; extracorporeal lithotripsy; human; male; pain; penis erection; Peyronie disease; priority journal; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Humans; Lithotripsy; Male; Middle Aged; Penile Induration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036228628

The high water production and necessity of on-site water liquidation often deteriorate the recovery efficiency and hamper maintaining an environmentally friendly production. During the past decades intensive R&D activity has been made to develop a viable well treatment method, however on account of the inverse mobility ratio in gas/water system, the conventional water shut-off or profile correction methods could not be used successfully under field conditions. According to some proposals the most promising procedure might be the injection of a high salt-containing polymer solution into the wells utilizing the reversible swelling/shrinking properties of the adsorbed polymer layer. If this mechanism works properly, a disproportional permeability modification is resulted and hence, the water productions is significantly decreased. In contrast to mentioned technical solution the new idea is to use a ""poor"" solvent for preparation of the treating solution. The concept is based on the fact that the ""solvent power"" worsens as the alcohol content in the aqueous phase is increasing. A detailed laboratory study has been made in order to optimize the alcohol type and concentration, and different polymers were used as model to demonstrate the feasibility of the theoretical considerations. Complex rheological measurements served to study the flow properties of treating solutions and to determine the molecular conformation in bulk and adsorbed states. Sophisticated hydrodynamic measurements were carried out to demonstrate the disproportional permeability modification in gas/water systems and in different porous media. Finally, the general procedure was up-scaled to field conditions and the technology was tailored to individual well conditions. In the frame of the pilot test four gas wells operating at the largest Hungarian gas field were treated with alcohol-containing polymer solutions. The pilot tests were supported with sophisticated reservoir engineering supervision and the results were evaluated meticulously by academic and practical experts. According to the available data two treatments proved already positive, one of them showed outstanding performance. At the present time the observations are continued and new treatment project is planned by the operator.

The most abundant renewable energy resources come from intermittent, often unpredictable and non-despatchable sources such as wind, solar and wave. The integration of such variable power sources into the electricity grid network make the control of strict voltage and frequency limits and the security of supply through reserve capacity management difficult.

In this paper, yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) bulk of HTS was proposed as a switch material, and the test on the fundamental characteristics of a mechanical contact between two YBCO bulks was carried out. As a result, a switching phenomenon between low and high resistance ranges was observed at a threshold current value in the V-I characteristics of the YBCO contact. Furthermore, the tests indicate that a certain amount of current needs to flow before the switching phenomenon.

The neutral Li atoms, originating from the process under scrutiny, were recorded by an energy-sensitive surface barrier detector in order to measure the relative electron single detachment cross section. The findings are the following. The cross section increases smoothly above the 1.4 eV detachment threshold and reaches a maximum at about 12 eV.

However, they have a number of limitations. These limitations of two- or/and three- element resonant topologies can be overcome by adding a fourth energy storage element. This paper introduces a cascade double Γ-CL CSRI, which has very smooth waveforms for output voltage and current, and a very low total harmonic distortion (THD) value.

It has very important effects on neuroendocrine functions and energy expenditure. The aim of our study was to determine leptin levels of children with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), which is known to affect body metabolism, and to investigate the relationship between duration of the disease, insulin dosage, HbA1c levels, body mass index (BMI), serum lipids and IGF-1 levels. Sixteen patients with IDDM (chronological age 13.8 ± 2.6 years) whose HbA1c levels were 10.2 ± 1.9 %, BMI 21.2. ± 2.7 kg/m2, insulin dosage 0.9 ± 0.4 U/kg/day and duration of the disease 6.7 ± 2.6 years, and 12 healthy controls (13.4 ± 2.6 years) were included in the study. Fasting plasma leptin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay method. The mean plasma leptin levels of the patient and the control groups were 19.1 ± 7.6 ng/ml and 6.1 ± 2.9 ng/ml, respectively, and significant difference was found between the two groups (p&lt;0.05). No correlation was found between leptin values and IGF-1, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride levels, atherogenic index, insulin dosage or HbA1c levels in the patient group. A weak statistical correlation was determined between BMI and leptin levels in the IDDM group (r=0.28, p&lt;0.05). A positive correlation was also found between leptin levels and the duration of the disease (r=49, p&lt;0.05). As a result, it seems that leptin levels of children with IDDM differed from the levels of the control group significantly, and that the duration of insulin therapy was responsible for this difference.","Children; Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Leptin","cholesterol; gene product; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; leptin; lipid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; somatomedin C; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; adolescent; article; atherogenesis; body fat; body mass; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; controlled study; correlation function; disease course; dose response; energy expenditure; energy resource; female; hemoglobin determination; hormone blood level; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; metabolism; neuroendocrine system; protein blood level; radioimmunoassay; school child; triacylglycerol blood level; Adolescent; Child; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Female; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Leptin; Male",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036658999

During the last 10 years circuits with inductive energy storage and semiconductor opening switches (SOS) have been developed. We give a detailed overview on their ability to produce pulses of different polarity and amplitudes up to hundreds of kV, current values up to 10 kA, pulse duration up to hundreds of nanoseconds and frequencies up to 10 kHz with average output power up to tens of kW. This parameters make their application as power supplies for plasma-based ion implantation devices favourable.

A novel approach for reducing energy consumption in core processors used in systems with cache-based architectures is present. In this scheme, instructions are fetched and stored in the I-cache in compressed form. The beneficial effect is an increase of the cache hit ratio; therefore, the number of accesses to the main memory is reduced, and so is the energy required to fetch the instructions. Static code size reduction is achieved as a by-product. A hardware decompression unit performs fast low-energy on-the-fly instruction decompression at each cache look-up. The decompressor is placed outside the core boundaries: therefore, processor architecture does not need any modification, making the proposed compression approach suitable to IP-based designs. The viability and effectiveness of this solution is assessed through extensive benchmarking performed on a number of typical embedded programs. Beside code size, energy and performance optimisation results, the authors also report data regarding the synthesis and implementation of the decompression unit. The energy penalty it introduces is taken into account in the evaluation of the achieved energy savings.",,"Buffer storage; Codes (standards); Energy utilization; Microprocessor chips; Cache energy; Code compression; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036630114

Glutamine (gln) -supplemented University of Wisconsin (UW) solution improves overall small bowel (SB) preservation. Sustained gln metabolism in a system devoid of hepatic detoxification will necessarily result in the accumulation of pH active end products leading to nonphysiologic pH shifts. We hypothesized that simultaneous addition of N,N-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethane sulfonic acid (BES), a known buffering agent, would potentiate the beneficial effect of gln supplementation by addressing the fundamental metabolic principle of pH homeostasis. Methods. Sprague-Dawley SB rats were administered a vascular flush with one of four solutions: UW; UW+90 mM BES (UWB); UW+2% gln (UWG); or UW+2% gln+90 mM BES (UWBG). Indices of energetics, barrier function, gln catabolism, and histology (light and electron microscopy) were assessed over a 10-hr cold storage time course. Results. Superior gln utilization in the UWBG group was indicated by elevated levels of key catabolites (glutamate, aspartate, glycine, ammonia). The addition of BES and gln resulted in significantly higher levels of all energetic parameters (ATP, total adenylates) at 10 hr compared with UW, UWB, and/or UWG. Barrier function was markedly improved after 10 hr storage in the UWBG group; mannitol permeability was 169 nmol/cm2/hr versus 572 and 445 nmol/cm2/hr (for UW and UWG, respectively). Histologic injury at 10 hr was 5.5, 7.5, and 8 (Park's grade) for UWBG, UWG, and UW. Ultrastructural damage was markedly reduced with UWBG, as assessed by grade of mitochondria damage. Conclusion. This study strongly supports that the beneficial effects of gln-enriched UW solution can be amplified when combined with an effective buffering agent such as BES.",,"2 [bis(2 hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid; ammonia; aspartic acid; buffer; glutamic acid; glutamine; glycine; mannitol; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; University of Wisconsin solution; amino acid metabolism; animal tissue; article; blood pH; cell damage; cell ultrastructure; controlled study; cryopreservation; electron microscopy; energy transfer; histology; intestine graft; intestine mucosa permeability; intestine transplantation; male; metabolite; mitochondrion; nonhuman; organ preservation; parameter; priority journal; rat; rat strain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037180913

Earlier a quite detailed simulation model was developed for analysis of the thermal and optical characteristics of this desalination system concept. This paper describes laboratory experiments with a small roof module and presents measurements compared to simulations obtained in order to validate the thermal part of the model. Equations, parameters and simplifications used in the model are briefly described. The laboratory work has been carried out with artificial light from a solar simulator operated in a well controlled thermal environment. The validation has an emphasis on the main parameters with impact on the water production capacity. These are the light absorptance and temperature of the absorber, the water flow rate and temperature, the inlet water temperature and the water storage volume. The main conclusion is that good agreement is obtained between simulated and measured variations of water production values for variations of these parameters. Concerning absolute values the simulated values are somewhat overestimated and possible factors behind this are discussed. Based on the simulation results, the presentation also includes some more conceptual discussions concerning system designs and operation methods. The most important indication is that geothermal water at elevated temperatures combined with this roof technology is the alternative with the highest water production capacity. A final, overall statement is that the model has a considerable potential for development into a more general system analysis tool.","Artificial solar irradiation; Conceptual discussion; Desalination; Greenhouse; Simulation model; Validation","Computer simulation; Evaporation; Geothermal water resources; Greenhouses; Light absorption; Optical properties; Simulators; Solar energy; Desalination systems; Desalination; desalination; greenhouse; irradiation; roof; solar desalination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037137962

In this brief note we establish some new passivity properties of RC and RL circuits under the more restrictive assumption that the characteristic functions of the capacitances and inductances are nondecreasing. In particular, we prove that for this class of nonlinear RC circuits passivity is preserved even if we take as port variables the sources currents and the voltage derivatives. We also show that nonlinear RL circuits define passive ports with port variables the sources current derivatives and the voltages. The storage function in both cases is the sum of the resistors co-content, which is a function associated to the power dissipation. The proof of these properties is a direct application of Tellegen's theorem. We illustrate the applicability of these results to generate new Lyapunov functions for nonlinear stabilization problems.

In the first one, we have developed a new simple and efficient technique to identify the parameters of the moving average (MA) process using the technique of higher order cumulants. The simulation for different orders of MA in the presence of Gaussian noise, for SNR lower man 20 dB, gives satisfactory results. In the second objective, the proposed method was adopted for modelling half-hour solar radiation recorded in Marrakesh. Accurate design and optimisation of short response time solar energy systems with storage are sensitive to the stationary and sequential characteristics of half-hourly solar radiation. So, in order to benefit from some characteristics of stationary processes, a preliminary transformation was performed on the original data. The proposed method was used to look for a simple and efficient model to represent solar half-hourly radiation sequences needed for many applications in the solar energy field. The Giannakis technique based on cumulant diagonal slices and the partial autocorrelation function of Box & Jenkins and Brockwell & Davis are used for selection of the model order.","Diurnal component; Higher order cumulants; Solar energy; Solar half-hour radiation","Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Product design; Cumulant diagonal slices; Moving average (MA) process; Radiation sequences; Solar energy; power generation; solar power; solar radiation; Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; Marrakech [Marrakech (PRV)]; Marrakech [Morocco]; Morocco; North Africa; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10844288852

However, due to an increased participation of embedded, hand-held devices in Internet activity, migrating code on the Internet has to be designed and implemented well in terms of energy consumption, execution speed, and on-chip memory space consumption. These parameters should be treated equally with respect to other more common design criteria. This paper introduces trade-offs between energy consumption and on-chip memory space consumption during the implementation phase of such a system. The content-aware knowledge of the designer is exploited during the implementation so that energy efficient data structures are implemented in a relatively easy way. We also show that optimizing for energy consumption is not necessarily the same as optimizing for execution speed (or vice versa). Gains in energy consumption and/or execution speed are presented for only a relatively small overhead in on-chip memory space consumption. Depending on the behaviour of the adjacent software modules (of the module under investigation) on the one hand, and some general platform related criteria on the other hand, we show that non-trivial data structure implementations can lead to a better matching of the software onto the platform.","Energy consumption; On-chip memory footprint; Partitioned data structure","Data storage equipment; Data structures; Energy utilization; Hand held computers; Internet; Microprocessor chips; Optimization; Software engineering; Modular software; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036989125

The test programme consisted of (i) falling weight impact tests to determine the penetration energy and (ii) experiments to determine the influence of hybrid construction on damage development and impact fatigue lifetime under repeated impact conditions at sub-penetration energy levels. The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of hybridisation on the impact behaviour of GRP laminates as well as to find optimal conditions for hybridisation. It was shown that in the case of a rigid test set-up - and hence small deflections - the influence of the Dyneema® on the impact behaviour of hybrid laminates is rather small because damage processes are the result of local contact stresses in the vicinity of the impact body, whereas in the case of a compliant test set-up and large deflections the high energy storage capacity of the ductile Dyneema® fibres is used far more effectively for the protection of hybrid composite laminates. Therefore, it was concluded that in order to fully utilise the potential of high-performance polyethylene fibres it is essential that these fibres are located on the (non-impacted) tensile side of an impacted laminate and that the geometrical test conditions are such that large (bending) deformations are allowed.",,"Bending (deformation); Composition effects; Compressive stress; Delamination; Elasticity; Fatigue of materials; Impact testing; Laminated composites; Resins; Tensile stress; Dyneema; Elastic energy; Falling weight impact test; Hybridisation; Penetration energy; Test geometry; Glass fiber reinforced plastics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036408872

KG, Dahlewitz, Germany; Negulescu, D., Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd. and Co. KG, Dahlewitz, Germany","Conventional two-stage high pressure turbine (HPT) air system concepts usually are based on exclusive use of compressor delivery air to cool HPT blades and vanes and to seal the gaps between rotors and stators. This air is expensive in terms of engine efficiency, since work has been done on it from all stages of the compressor and the air is lost for the main thermodynamic engine cycle. It is also very hot, leading to strong thermal loading of the turbine material. Improvements in this area thus lead to an immediate reduction of fuel consumption and increased cycle life of the turbine discs. On static components, it is common practice to use pre-swirl nozzles in order to reduce the relative total temperature of downstream disc and blades. To feed the interstage cavity between both HPT discs, the air is transferred through the first rotor disc or drive arm. In a conventional system, the air is passed on through straight holes, thus no benefit is taken from the internal energy potential of the cooling air, where work output from the flow would lead to an immediate air temperature reduction. The advanced air system presented in this paper uses de-swirl nozzles in the rotating part to extract energy from the fluid. By this, the air temperature for the downstream static part is reduced on the one hand and in addition, the overall turbine efficiency is increased due to the contribution from the fluid. This paper will cover the effects of an air system design change from a conventional to an advanced HPT air system on the Rolls-Royce BR715 aeroengine based on numerical analysis and test data. An overview of the change to the flow field and prospect of current research programmes in this field will be given.

A broad program with a focus on the superconducting magnet technology was established to include large magnets for nuclear fusion, high-field magnets for nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers, ore separation and energy storage magnets. Research and development work was performed in collaborative projects with other national as well as international institutions and industry. The success of these projects has been supported by a broad foundation of engineering science in superconductor development, electrical and cryogenic engineering. Several well known test facilities like TOSKA, STAR, HOMER, MTA along with well equipped laboratories for conductor development, materials at cryogenic temperatures, cryogenic high-voltage engineering have made substantial contributions to in-house, national and international projects. A strong cryogenic infrastructure with two refrigerators and sophisticated cooling circuits from about 4.5 K down to 1.8 K assure the reliable operation of these large facilities. Last but not least, cryogenic research, including vacuum pumps for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, improvements in thermal insulation, cryogenic instrumentation and small on board refrigerators has supported progress in this field.

Three different aspects are covered: Q (i) as a relation between the stored energy and radiated power in the modes corresponding to a given radiation field outside a spherical source volume, (ii) as a function of the measurable impedance or admittance and (iii) as a function of the bandwidth of a resonated system. The first approach yields a theoretical lower limit: the larger the sphere, the more inconceivable in practice. The second approach approximates the observable stored energy and incorporates the minimum energy necessary for the transport of energy from the feed point to the region outside the circumscribing sphere. The third method yields the antenna Q on condition that the input impedance corresponds to a single resonance phenomena.","Antenna; Bandwidth; Input impedance; Quality factor; Stored energy","Antennas; Approximation theory; Asymptotic stability; Capacitor storage; Electric impedance; Electromagnetic fields; Integral equations; Maxwell equations; Transmission line theory; Input impedance; Quality factor; Radiating system; Single resonance phenomena; Spherical source volume; Electromagnetic waves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036747361

Depending on fluctuation, beam transmission efficiency from the linac to the booster synchrotron was significantly affected, and beam intensity in the booster synchrotron changed 20-30%. This caused delay of optimization of the various parameters in the booster synchrotron. More problematic, the beam intensities stored in each rf (radio frequency) bucket of the storage ring at SPring-8 were all different from each other. The users utilizing synchrotron radiation requested that the beam intensity in each rf bucket be as uniform as possible. It was thus a pressing necessity to stabilize the beam energy in the linac. Investigation of the cause has clarified that the various apparatuses installed in the linac periodically changed depending on circumstances and utilities such as the air conditioner, cooling water and electric power. After various improvements, beam energy stability in the linac of <0.06% rms was attained. Consequently, the beam intensity in each rf bucket required by users was almost satisfactorily improved.

The main reason for the proposal was the petroleum crisis, which called attention to alternative energy sources and the necessity of hydrocarbon substitution. As an energy source, hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and is also common on earth. Hydrogen is the most important alternative energy source for the growing energy demand and is the answer to the present need for clean, efficient and environmentally friendly energy technologies. Burning hydrogen produces water and a small amount of nitrogen oxides, which can be eliminated with fuel cells. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that produces electricity without combustion in an efficient and silent manner. If the hydrogen is obtained from a primary CO2 free energy source, such as solar, wind or nuclear, the green-house effect and the acid rain could be avoided during energy generation. Hydrogen can also be used as an energy carrier. The state of the art in research and development on hydrogen worldwide and in Mexico is presented.","Environmental contamination; Fuel cells; Fusion; Hydrogen energy; Storage and transportation","alternative fuel; hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29144524739

Models were used to estimate crop net photosynthesis, heating and ventilation requirements, CO2 consumption and crop value. For enrichment using pure CO2 the comparison showed how the most economic CO2 control set point changed with the price of CO2. The best performance was obtained with optimal control in which the CO2 concentration was adjusted continuously to maximise the financial margin. With exhaust gas CO2, the storage of excess heat produced by the heater or CHP unit when operated during the day to provide CO2 increased the financial margin. Without heat storage it was preferable to dissipate the excess heat directly to the external environment than to use the greenhouse heating system as this increased the ventilation requirement. For the same gas price, the financial margin with a CHP unit only exceeds that of a boiler when a heat store is used and excess heat is dissipated via the greenhouse heating system.","Energy; Glasshouse; Photosynthesis; Profit; Ventilation","Chandipura virus; Lycopersicon esculentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879453366

Its use in research is more than writing or running code. Having something significant to compute and deploying judgement in what is attempted and achieved are especially challenging. In science or engineering, one must define a central problem in computable form, run such software as is appropriate and, last but by no means least, convince others that the results are both valid and useful. These several strands are highly interdependent. A major scientific development can transform disparate aspects of information and computer technologies. Computers affect the way we do science, as well as changing our personal worlds. Access to information is being transformed, with consequences beyond research or even science. Creativity in research is usually considered uniquely human, with inspiration a central factor. Scientific and technological needs are major forces in innovation, and these include hardware and software opportunities. One can try to define the scientific needs for established technologies (atomic energy, the early semiconductor industry), for rapidly developing technologies (advanced materials, microelectronics) and for emerging technologies (nanotechnology, novel information technologies). Did these needs define new computing, or was science diverted into applications of then-available codes? Regarding credibility, why is it that engineers accept computer realizations when designing engineered structures, whereas predictive modelling of materials has yet to achieve industrial confidence outside very special cases? The tensions between computing and traditional science are complex, unpredictable and potentially powerful.","Knowledge management; Materials modelling; Nanotechnology; Validation","article; chemical model; chemical structure; computer simulation; information retrieval; materials testing; methodology; nanotechnology; physics; quality control; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Computer Simulation; Information Storage and Retrieval; Materials Testing; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Nanotechnology; Physics; Quality Control; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842855618

Several sets of group constants for eight different temperatures between 0.1 and 2.5 K in a neutron energy region of 0.1 μeV to 10 eV are generated. A model UCN source of pure liquid 4He is analyzed, in which UCNs are produced by down-scattering of cold neutrons, stored optically by total reflection at the surface, and destroyed by the neutron β-decay only. The following results are obtained: (a) As lowering temperature below about 0.5 K, UCN density exhibits saturation behavior because of no significant up-scattering of UCNs. (b) In addition to single down-scattering of a 1 meV neutron, multiple scattering of a higher-energy neutron contributes largely to UCN production, nearly doubling UCN density.

The forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second for T2DM women (2.67±0.30 and 2.15±0.20 l, respectively) were significantly (p≤0.05) lower than for control women (3.22±0.30 and 2.58±0.31 l, respectively). However, trunk fat mass and trunk lean body mass for T2DM women (16.68±2.31 and 20.87±1.91 kg, respectively) were comparable with those for controls (16.46±2.54 and 19.65±3.42 kg, respectively).

New NPY receptor related antagonists such as S.A.0204 are being developed as potential anti-obesity drugs affecting adipocyte lipid metabolism and thermogenesis. In this sense, those animals fed on a high-energy yielding (cafeteria) diet decreased body fat weight as compared to overweight controls, when they were administered with S.A.0204, and increased body temperature, which statistically correlated with high UCP2 mRNA expression levels in white adipose tissue. In addition, the in vivo NPY-antagonist administration was able to prevent white adipose tissue growth in animals fed the cafeteria (high-fat) diet by impairing PPARγ and C/EBPα mRNA expression in white fat cells. In summary, this novel NPY related-antagonist S.A.0204 may regulate body fat deposition by affecting both energy dissipation and white adipose tissue deposition, representing a potential new pharmacological strategy for obesity management.","Adipogenesis; Cafeteria diet; NPY; Obesity; Thermogenesis; Uncoupling proteins","antiobesity agent; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; messenger RNA; neuropeptide Y; neuropeptide Y receptor antagonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; sa 0204; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 2; carrier protein; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; cell receptor; ion channel; messenger RNA; mitochondrial protein; mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2; neuropeptide Y receptor; protein; transcription factor; adipocyte; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body fat; body temperature; controlled study; correlation function; energy yield; feeding; female; food intake; gene expression; in vivo study; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipolysis; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; obesity; priority journal; rat; regulatory mechanism; statistical analysis; thermogenesis; tissue growth; white adipose tissue; adipose tissue; animal; chemistry; drug antagonism; drug effect; energy metabolism; fat intake; gene expression; genetics; metabolism; obesity; Wistar rat; Animalia; Cafeteria; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Temperature; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Female; Gene Expression; Ion Channels; Membrane Transport Proteins; Mitochondrial Proteins; Obesity; Proteins; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Receptors, Neuropeptide Y; RNA, Messenger; Thermogenesis; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036005856

The plant served as a pilot unit for exploring the technical reliability and evaluating the economic feasibility of the process of converting solar thermal energy into electricity. This paper consists of a close evaluation and analysis of the long-term performance of the system and a review of 15 years of successful operation. The aim of this study was to go over the main problems and technical difficulties encountered and pinpoint the major factors affecting the plant operation in order to identify the optimal operating policies toward the enhancement of the plant efficiency. Even though the thermal performance of the plant was relatively low, the impact of such a plant on the energy sector of the country was significant in terms of energy saving and environmental protection. In regions with high solar radiation such as Tunisia with a daily mean insolation of 4.8 k Wh m-2, the use of solar power plants - similar to this one - essentially for heat production prove to be a good alternative especially for remote and rural areas. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As technology moves to sub-10nm spaced head-disk systems, high spindle speed, ramp load/unload mechanism, and high seeking speed, the likelihood of such thermal energy generation increases and so is the intensity of such interaction. Experimental results presented in this work indicate that signal can be decayed by slider disk contact in load/unload operation, even when the contact cannot be detected easily by AE sensor attached at the end of the suspension arm. A special disk is proposed and used for the visualization of potential tribological decay. The disk uses a layer of magneto-optical material with low Curie temperature to replace the magnetic layer used in magnetic media and record the traces left by potential sources of tribologically induced decay. The method and corresponding setup were used successfully in the study of the effectiveness of anti-particulate designs and the identification of the worst case among loading and unloading operations at high longitudinal load/unload speed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Matrix gel (MG) used in the experiments was 0.6 wt% gellan gum gel added with 5 mM CaCl2 (MG(0.6%-5 mM)) or 0.8 wt% gel added with 5 mM CaCl2 (MG(0.8%-5 mM)). MG(0.6%-5 mM) was filled with particle gels of 0.6 wt% gellan gum added with 5 mM CaCl2 (PG(0.6%-5 mM)) or with 2 mM CaCl2 (PG(0.6%-2 mM)). MG(0.8%-5 mM) was filled with PG(0.8%-5 mM) or PG(0.8%-2 mM). Breaking stress, breaking strain, breaking energy and dynamic viscoelasticity of all kinds of gels containing PG decreased with increasing PG content. The sample size dependence of breaking stress of gels containing PG was more intense than that of gels without PG. These results may indicate that particle gels act as inactive filler in the matrix gel. Storage Young's modulus of MG(0.8%-5 mM) without PG increased with increasing temperature from 10 to 40°C and then decreased with further temperature increase to 60°C. The degree of variations of storage Young's modulus with temperature reduced, as the PG content increased. The degree of syneresis increased with an increase in the PG content during storage for 5 h.

Therefore, Photon Beam Position Monitors (PBPM) are being built as detectors of beam movement and as references for feedback systems. The PBPM must not be destructive and has to be suitable for continuous usage. Usual storage ring configurations permit a significant part of the radiation coming from the upstream and downstream dipoles to be superimposed with the undulator radiation. A novel detector, based on spectroscopic techniques, has been developed at ELETTRA. It can be tuned on the working energy of the undulator from a few eV to some keV. A detailed description of the detector layout and its working principle is presented.

""Orphan sources"" may end up in scrapyards. An out-of-use Co-60 medical teletherapy source, left unattended in a disused parking area belonging to a Medical Dealer, was stolen and sold to a scrap dealer in Samutprakarn Province at the end of January 2000. Because of its valuable appearance, a number of workers in the scrap trade who were not aware of radiation hazards managed to dismantle all parts. The Co-60 source was removed and left unshielded among pieces of scrap metal in the yard of the scrap shop. Some workers immediately became sick. Eighteen days later when they went to a local hospital their symptoms were recognized as radiation sickness and the incident was reported to the Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP) in Thailand. The unshielded source, with an estimated activity of 15.7 TBq (425 Ci), was retrieved soon after by an emergency team and placed in safe storage at the OAEP premises. Ten victims developed radiation sickness symptoms, of which three died soon after the accident. The accident alarmed the public, and has raised national concerns. The accident is similar in some ways to the 1987 radiation accident at Goiania, Brazil, involving a Cs-137 radiotherapy source. If not properly disposed of orphan radiation sources can lead to serious injury or even death.

This property could improve oxygen availability for myocytes during hypothermic arrest of hearts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the advantage of using cardioplegic solutions enriched with bovine hemoglobin when storing rat hearts. Hearts excised from rats after perfusion with different cardioplegic solutions (Celsior, Celsior plus 4% human hemoglobin, Celsior plus 4% and 8% bovine hemoglobin) were compared. Biopsies were obtained from the beating hearts before cardioplegic infusion and during a 48 h period of cold storage. Adenosine triphosphate, its catabolites and markers of oxidative stress were measured as indices of preservation. The results show that bovine hemoglobin-enriched solutions highly improve adenosine triphosphate content, decreasing its catabolites; no significant changes in antioxidant status were evident. The statistically significant difference was evident up to 6 h of storage. Doubling the concentration of bovine hemoglobin produces only slight improvement. Alternative hemoglobins with different properties may improve and prolong heart storage. As bovine hemoglobin delivers oxygen even at low temperatures, it improves energy content and anabolic reactions, without decreasing oxidative stress. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

When designing a SAPF, it is crucial to generate reference currents for determining actual compensating current injections to the point of common coupling. In contrast to the conventional instantaneous reactive power theory, which needs coordinate transformations, the new method proposed in this letter is to determine reference compensating currents based on the balance of the instantaneous reactive and active power generated in the SAPF. It is shown that the proposed method is suitable for reactive and harmonic power compensation by using a SAPF. In addition, to maintain the sinusoidal source currents this method also eliminates the need for installing energy storage devices for reactive power compensation as well as the dc source for the harmonic compensation in the active power filter. Therefore, a simpler design of the SAPF with minimal line losses can be expected.","Active power filter; Coordinate transformation; Instantaneous power balance; Instantaneous reactive power theory; Reference compensating current","Electric currents; Electric loads; Energy storage; Reactive power; Shunt active power filters (SAPF); Active filters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036530965

The radiation exposure of the personnel during transportation and storage of these casks is caused by mixed photon-neutron fields and, frequently, the neutron dose is predominant. In operational radiation protection, survey meters and even personal dosemeters with imperfect energy dependence of the dose-equivalent response are used, i.e. the fluence response of the devices does not match the fluence-to-dose equivalent conversion function. In order to achieve more accurate dosimetric information and to investigate the performance of dosemeters, spectrometric investigations of the neutron fields are necessary. Therefore, fluence spectra and dose rates were measured by means of a simple portable Bonner multisphere spectrometer (BSS). The paper describes briefly the experimental set-up and evaluation procedure. Measured spectra for different locations, types of casks and inventory are discussed. The spectra provide a basis to determine dose rates and other integral quantities with higher accuracy and for choosing suitable area monitors, respectively, to establish correction factors applied to the dosemeter reading. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The companies involved in the project were the dairies Valio Ltd. from Finland, Arla from Sweden and TINE from Norway as well as the technochemical company Suomen Unilever Oy DiverseyLever from Finland. Dr Gun Wirtanen, VTT Biotechnology, coordinated the project. The senior advisors at Nordic Industrial Fund involved in the project were Maija Uusisuo and Oddur Gunnarsson. The experiments were focused on monitoring methods in sanitation of open and closed systems e.g. fogging, ozonation, footbath hygiene, cleaning of cheese moulds and yoghurt pasteurizers, development of testing procedures for measuring disinfectant efficacy, microbial resistance phenomena against disinfectants, life-cycle assessment (LCA) and an evaluation procedure for the functionality of the cleaning procedures. New procedures in hygiene have been implemented in dairies, based on the results. The findings can be summarized as follows: • The main task of the research conducted in Sweden was to develop and evaluate practical methods for the measure of cleaning and disinfection efficiency. These methods are suitable for equipment surfaces used for production of various dairy products. The analysing methods, washing out and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) agar, worked well in testing the cleanability of plastic cheese moulds. As part of this study a 5-step method how to evaluate cleaning and disinfection agents was prepared at Arla Foods. • Bacillus cereus is an important target organism when disinfecting equipment for production of consumer milk in Nordic dairies. The total number of remaining Bacillus spores on solid surfaces is a useful indicator for measuring cleaning and disinfection efficiency. Improved methods for detection of surface-adhered spores can be based on fluorescent dyes,indirect immunofluorescence and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) techniques. • Less environmentally harmful cleaning procedures based on ozonated water and enzyme-based agents used in cleaning-in-place (CIP) were investigated. Energy can also be saved using lower temperatures. Promising results with 1.3 log-unit spore-reduction (i.e. 90.0-99.9% reduction) was achieved using an ozone (O3) concentration of 0.1-0.3 ppm.• Fogging with different agents including ozone is a potentially useful method for disinfection of production and storage rooms. There are, however, difficulties in reaching areas such as the outside of pipelines, rubber hoses and ceilings. In these areas there are probably attached microbes that can adapt to the disinfectant when exposed at sublethal concentrations or survive because they are resistant to the fogging agent. The results showed that ozone is less effective when the microbes are dry. The performance of the fogging unit should be monitored frequently to ensure optimal disinfection. • According to a questionaire, footbaths were extensively used in Norwegian dairies. The aim was to combine practical information and laboratory research to develop a maintenance guideline for footbaths. A maintenance guideline is clearly needed, because it is evident that survival, growth and spreading of resistant bacteria occur when using footbaths. The Norwegian report initiated an investigation at Arla Foods in which the microbial status of the footbaths was mapped. Microbial contaminants were found in all footbaths tested, even though the sodium hypochlorite concentration in general was correct or above the recommended level. Based on the results achieved, it is recommended that footwear should be changed, when entering a clean area, instead of using footbaths. • The LCA of various CIP methods, including standard CIP with lye phase, acid phase and thermic disinfection and enzymatic cleaning followed by acid treatment and chemical disinfection, was performed at TINE. The LCA covered all environmental aspects including transportation and effects on the wastewater. In an LCA all the potential environmental effects of each emission were considered according to the worst case scenario. The LCA provides information necessary for choosing the best CIP method, even though widely varying assumptions must be made and limitationsconsidered. In this study enzyme-based CIP procedures showed the best results, because enzymes are used in very small concentrations and at low temperature. • The aim of the sanitation study on yoghurt fermentation lines was to isolate interfering spoilage microbes, possibly thermophilic bacteria, from a yoghurt process and to find suitable agents for cleaning the yoghurt-soiled process surfaces. In the pilot-scale cleaning studies, in which various cleaning agent combinations were compared, yoghurt-milk including process isolates were burned on stainless-steel surfaces using steam heating. The results showed that the best cleaning effect for surfaces with the burned milk-soil was achieved with a 2-phase cleaning procedure using chelator-based sodium hydroxide (NaOH). • The cheese mould hygiene studies were carried out at both pilot and process scale. The structure of the plastic cheese moulds is complex, with long, narrow conical channels. The ultrasound cleaning procedure was shown to be efficient in cleaning the channels of the cheese moulds. The cleanliness of the cheese moulds both after pilot-scale cleaning and during processing was assessed using various methods, of which the dipslide technique proved to be the most practical for detecting microbial contaminants. In industrial scale, pH measurement proved to be a useful indicator for checking, as long as the cleaning procedure was functional. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) as well as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) measurements were useful in following up the organic load of the cleaning waters. • In trials to develop new environmentally less harmful cleaning agents, proteinase samples e.g. cryotin from cod, trypsin from Antarctic krill and chymotrypsin from cod, were prepared at the University of Iceland. A microtitration tray procedure with assessment based on fluorometric, colorimetic and turbidometric methods was developed to study the efficacy of these enzymatic cleaning agents on Bacillus biofilms. A method based on the fluorogenic redox indicator resazurin was further used in evaluating the enzymatic cleaning procedures on biofilm bacteria of the lactic-acid bacteria, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The proteinase samples tested removed biofilms when there was no milk residues on the surfaces. • To evaluate the influence of fluid dynamic shear (0.024-0.53 m/s) of disinfectant solutions on the extent and mode of detachment of P. aeruginosa biofilm, a concentric cylinder reactor (CCR) was used. The results showed that the CCR can be used to discriminate between biocidal and cleansing action for different disinfectant types. In testing of disinfectant efficiency, impedance can be used for evaluating surface sterility because very few, well-adapted, fast-growing cells as well as large amounts of chemically treated cells change the conductance or capacitance values in the liquid. With staining procedures, the viability and total amount of cells can be measured on the surface. Cultivation is not a proper method for measuring well-established biofilms on surfaces, because the cells can stick firmly to the surface material, and thus not all cells are measured using swabs. • 1-N-phenyl-naphthylamine (NPN) uptake measured spectrophotometrically can be used to evaluate the effects of cell sensitizers on both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In Gram-positive cells the protective outer membrane (OM) is lacking and NPN has much greater free access to the cytoplasmic membrane. The results of the NPN uptake assay for permeabilization of bacteria by chelators and polyethyleneimine (PEI) showed that the sensitivity towards OM-permeabilizing substances varied considerably between bacterial species. In general, citric acid was an effective permeabilizer, whereas sodium citrate was a much weaker agent. • Parameters in the test based on hydrogels i.e. biofilm constructs of poloxamer were optimized using various disinfectants. The results showed that a 5-h incubation period of 100 μl of inoculated droplets was the best test matrix. Disinfectant efficacy on biofilm bacteria can be optimized using this method. The results showed that Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to disinfectant treatments than are Gram-positive bacteria. The hydrogen peroxide-based agents proved to be efficient against most microbes tested.Development of detection and identification methods for assessing microbial contaminants on or in process equipment, raw material, process air, packaging material and final products should be continued.

They are charged in periods of low electricity demand and discharged when the demand is high.

Additionally, electrical energy storage can support the net-integration of renewable energies with irregular availibuity, like wind and solar power generation. Technologies for large-scale electrical energy storage are few, since most of the mechanical and chemical energy storage systems are limited concerning their storage capacity and power output. Pumped hydro energy storage is a well-established large-scale technology, but shows high investment costs. In contrast to this, compressed air energy storage (CAES) shows promising potential for the future. This tecnnology has already been demonstrated in two commercial power plants.

Pentaethoxytantalum [Ta(OC2H5)5], the most widely used source gas for depositing Ta2O5, was used as the source gas and NH3 as the reaction gas. The activation energy of the surface reaction was estimated to be 1.1 eV for a single-source deposition (Ta2O5 deposition), and to decrease to ca. 0.37 eV with the addition of over 50 sccm NH3. Deposition rate at the surface-reaction-controlled regime increased to 2.6 nm/min with 100 sccm NH3 but decreased upon adding more than 100 sccm of NH3. The overall deposition rate of the surface-reactioncontrolled regime was as predicted by the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. With an increase in both deposition temperature and NH3 flow rate, the TaON phase predominated over Ta2O5. The dielectric constants of the as-deposited and N2-annealed TaOxNy films were 51 and 146, respectively. It is believed that TaOxNy films are attractive high-dielectric-constant materials for the next generation of gigabit dynamic random access memory devices. However, TaOxNy films exhibit relatively high current leakage densities of 10-5 to 10-3 A/cm2 at 1.0 MV/cm. A porous TaOxNy film microstructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy, and this seemed to be responsible for these high leakage currents. Further systematic optimization of the deposition and annealing processes is needed to produce a dense microstructure with a low leakage current level. © 2002 The Electrochemical Society.

Predators that prey on a population of such individuals can choose to assimilate the reserves or the structure of the prey, or both. As a consequence, the Holling type II description we use for predator-prey interaction has to be revised. In this article we study tri-trophic food chains with two-component populations in a chemostat. The influence of different degrees of assimilation of reserves and structure on the long-term dynamics of the food chain is studied with bifurcation analysis of the governing system of ODEs. The results presented in bifurcation diagrams show large quantitative effects. The modelling will start at the individual level. The two components of the prey are assimilated in parallel and the usable portions are added to a common storage pool, the reserves. The energy stored in these reserve materials is used for maintenance and growth. The three processes, assimilation, maintenance and growth, are modelled as chemical reactions where mass and energy conservation laws are obeyed. With stationary solutions the growth rate has to be positive in order to compensate for predation and other causes of depletion. However, with oscillatory solutions, reversed growth can occur when time-periods exist where the reserves are less than needed to pay maintenance costs. When reversed growth is allowed, the two components can be transformed into each other without heat or product formation, which is unrealistic. This calls for a constraint on the maintenance requirements so that reversed growth does not occur. This constraint yields a new cause for extinction by nutrient enrichment for the two-component model. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The existence of a strong built-in electric field induced by the spontaneous polarization and by the piezoelectricity is exploited to entangle few-exciton states in coupled QDs without the use of external fields. The analysis of the electro-optical response of the coupled GaN QDs is based on a realistic - i.e. fully tri-dimensional - description of Coulomb-correlated few-electron states, obtained via a direct-diagonalization approach. The combined effect of the built-in electric field and ultrafast sequences of multicolor laser pulses in the few-carrier regime is investigated. We show how the built-in field induces intrinsic dipole-dipole coupling and thus allows the implementation of quantum information processing. As an example we will implement basic quantum information gates and we will demonstrate that our implementation scheme is compatible with a subpicosecond operation timescale, i.e. with timescales much lower than the decoherence time of the system. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In 1996, early and late Zn sprays increased Zn concentration in the cortical tissue by 61 and 50 μg 100 g-1 fresh weight respectively. Late Ca sprays increased tissue Ca by 0.75 mg 100 g-1 fresh weight but early Ca sprays had no affect on tissue Ca. Early sprays of Zn and Ca had beneficial effects on the firmness (penetrometer) and mechanical properties of apple tissue at harvest that included a higher stiffness and work of fracture. There was less effect of spray treatments on mechanical properties of tissue from fruit stored in controlled atmosphere (CA) conditions (1.2 kPa O2, &lt; 1kPa CO2 at 3.5 °C) for 7 months. However, after a further 7 days at 20 °C firmness was higher in fruit sprayed early with Zn and Ca. Early sprays of Zn and Ca reduced fruit yield at harvest and increased cell wall content of the tissue. Effects of spray treatments on tissue mechanical properties were attributable to crop reduction and this was confirmed where firmness data was analysed using yield as a covariate. In 1998 early sprays of 'Zintrac' or 'Stopit' again increased the firmness of fruit at harvest and also in fruit stored in CA for 4 or 6 months. There were consistent improvements in tissue mechanical properties of stored apples as a result of early sprays. Early Zn application increased tissue Zn by 16 μg 100 g-1 fresh weight and, as in 1996, reduced fruit numbers and yield and increased total and alcohol insoluble dry matter. However, contrary to previous results, there was no significant yield reduction from early Ca sprays. Although improvements in firmness appeared to be related directly to supplementing Ca nutrition early in fruit development, there was no increase in tissue Ca at harvest. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) of cell walls also confirmed no changes in the Ca concentration of the middle lamella region or in the primary cell wall due to early Ca application although early Zn sprays appeared to increase Ca in these domains. Zn was not detected in any domain of the cell walls analysed using EELS. Late Ca application had no positive effect on tissue texture despite increasing tissue Ca from 2.9 to 3.8 mg 100 g-1 fresh weight.","Ca; Malus domestica; Mechanical properties; Sprays; Storage; Zn",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13144280323

The energy deficiency in dairy cows can cause subclinical or clinical ketosis. In ketotic state the concentration of ketone bodies (acetone, AC; acetoacetic acid, ACAC; and β-hydroxybutyric acid, BOHB) increases in the different body fluids and simultaneously, changes in concentration of other compounds are also expected. The authors' hypothesis is that the members of the TCA-cycle, such as citric acid (CA) also change in association of increased formation of ketone body. To support this hypothesis the concentrations of ketone body components and CA were parallel measured and their relationship was studied in raw milk samples. Based on the AC concentration of the milk samples two groups were formed retrospectively: High Acetone (HA) Group (n = 41) of AC concentration > 0.4mM and Low Acetone (LA) Group (n = 78) with the AC level ≤ 0.4 mM. In all samples very low ACAC level was found, which is a consequence of the spontaneous decarboxylation of ACAC to AC during the usual sample storage.

Numerical experiments show its numerical properties and computational efficiency. The wave amplitude is not damped and the total energy is conserved. The alternative leapfrog scheme is one of the most efficient schemes.

The quality attributes of interest were mold growth, color, odor, and moisture. The odor sensory attribute changed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) during storage and was influenced by storage time and temperature. Interactive effect of packaging-temperature and temperature-time affected odor changes significantly. A kinetic reaction model was used to analyze odor sensory data. The degradation of pleasant odor followed a first-order reaction, and the temperature dependence of these reactions indicated an Arrhenius relationship. While an activation energy (EA) of 29.98 kJ/mol was calculated for samples stored in aluminum foil, a higher value of 49.04 kJ/mol was obtained for samples stored in LDPE. The negative values of enthalpy (ΔH*) in both packages indicate that deterioration change in fura is exothermic. The higher values of EA and free energy of activation (ΔG*) for fura stored in LDPE packages indicate a large change in quality. However, the lower values of free energy of activation (ΔG*) and negative values of entropy of activation (ΔS*) forfura stored in aluminum foil packages indicate a product that is more thermally stable, and odor deterioration is less influenced by temperature. There is no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) in the shelf life of fura stored at 20, 25, and 35°C in the two packaging materials.

Several donors have been used to support the electron transport through PS I. NADPH and NADH demonstrated low rates of electron donation to PS I, while ascorbate and ascorbate plus 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) couple have been found more effective in both P700+ reduction and stimulation of the variable component of the PA signal. A linear relationship was found in isolated PSI particles between the (A830, max - A830, steady)/A830, max and (PAmax - PAsteady)/PAmax ratios, which characterized the relative amount of P700 in the reduced state and the relative magnitude of the variable PA component, respectively. That linear relationship was obtained independently from the nature of electron donor used for the reduction of P700+. Such linear relationship was also obtained at various wavelengths of modulated light in the range of 660 to 720 nm, only the slope of the linear fits varied with wavelength. It is concluded that reduced P700 act as a photochemical quencher of absorbed energy. Variable thermal dissipation in PSI reaction centers of isolated submembrane particles linearly depends on the amount of reduced P700 and thus constitutes an appropriate indicator of the redox pressure applied to PS I.","P700; Photochemical quenching; Photosystem I; Thermal dissipation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036915262

This compares with 510 billion m 3 (18 TCF) of natural gas calculated for the Sable offshore resources in eastern Canada. In the United States, where coalbed methane resource evaluations and production have increased substantially over the past 20 years, 7% (1.34 TCF) of total domestic gas production is derived from coalbed methane. In this period, the cumulative US production of coalbed methane has exceeded 198 billion m 3 (7 TCF) and more than 8000 coalbed methane wells have been drilled. In Maritime Canada, the largest coalbed methane resources occur in the offshore areas of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Sydney Basins where 196 and 26 billion m 3 (69 and 9.3 TCF) of gas, respectively, have been projected. In the old mines, the greatest resources are present in the Prince and Phalen mines of the Sydney coalfield, which together contain 1.70 billion m 3 (60 BCF) of gas, and in the Westville mine of the Pictou coalfield with 198 million m 3 (70 BCF). Vitrinite is the dominant constituent in 27 of the 42 coals examined. Vitrinite/ inertinite ratios for these 27 coals range from 4.0 to 8.4. These high values may indicate the presence of highly fractured coals with corresponding high permeability and flow efficiency, favourable for the storage and flow of methane gas. Coal rank has a pronounced effect on coalbed methane generation, and the prime gas zone often lies between 1.2% and 1.6% Ro max. (medium to low volatile bituminous). The prime zone in the Maritimes Basin underlies much of the central and eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence, and extends for significant distances seaward into the offshore Sydney Basin. Coalbed methane production from the very large resources available in Atlantic Canada may provide a valuable and long-lasting energy resource, largely free of polluting components. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray analysis of the particulate matter revealed that it contains aluminum and phosphorus, the latter thought to be derived from minodronic acid. In contrast, the number of the particulate matter did not increase, when the formulation was stored in either plastic containers or in SiO2-treated glass ampoules. The spike of minodronic acid solution with aluminum ions led to the particulate generation. These results demonstrate that the particulate matter is a complex of minodronic acid molecules and aluminum ions, which apparently leached from the glass of regular ampoules. Since the particulate generation could not be observed at higher temperatures, it was suggested that the complex formation was exothermic and accelerated testing did not predict the stability in terms of particulate generation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We consider three aspects of this complex problem. (i) Magnetic flux needs to be stored against buoyant loss for a sufficiently long time in order to be amplified by the dynamo process. Convective pumping in strongly stratified convection is probably not sufficient for the strong fields (of order 105 G) which have been inferred from the simulations of rising flux tubes. The required subadiabatically stratified storage region is likely to be generated by the asymmetric flow field (strong coherent downflows, weak upflows) characteristic for compressible convection in a stratified medium. (ii) In a weakly subadiabatic region or a convective overshoot layer, the force equilibrium of a magnetic layer is very similar to that of an isolated flux tube: zero buoyancy and balance between the magnetic curvature (tension) force and the Coriolis force induced by a longitudinal flow along the field lines in a rotating system. In a strongly subadiabatic radiative region, a magnetic layer develops a different kind of force equilibrium, which involves buoyancy and a latitudinal pressure gradient.(iii) A field of 105 G is difficult to generate by convection or differential rotation. The outflow of plasma from an 'exploded' flux tube provides an intensification mechanism which is not limited by the Lorentz force and converts potential energy of a superadiabatic stratification into magnetic energy.","Convection; Dynamo; Solar magnetic field","Buoyancy; Computer simulation; Entropy; Heat convection; Kinetic energy; Magnetic field effects; Magnetic flux; Plasma theory; Potential energy; Solar radiation; Thermal stratification; Lorentz forces; Sun",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036618281

While the Zr-based alloy electrode is not fully activated before 50 cycles, the ball-milled Zr-based alloy electrode using Ti-based alloy as a surface modifier is fully activated within only four cycles. In order to analyze the strikingly improved kinetic characteristics after ball-milling, the microstructure of ball-milled alloy is examined by transmission (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). It is observed that there is a surface-alloying region at the contact points between the two alloy powders from the TEM bright-field image. Furthermore, the local quantitative analysis by EDS clearly reveals that the atomic concentration of the constituting elements in the surface-alloying region is gradually changed between the two alloy powders. From the above results, it is suggested that the high kinetic energy applied in the ball-milling process causes cold-welding or surface alloying at the points of impact where Zr-based alloy particles collide with Ti-based alloy particles by the action of steel balls at high speed. The SEM analysis demonstrates that the particle size is decreased as the ball-milling time increases, which implies an increase in the surface area of Zr-based alloy particles touching Ti-based alloy particles. Eventually, it can be suggested that Ti-alloy powder serves as a window for hydrogen to penetrate into the Zr-based alloy, which leads to easy absorption/desorption of hydrogen and also to improvement in the kinetic properties of the Zr-based alloy electrode at initial cycles. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The power consumption of instruction ROMs strongly depends on the switching activity of bit-lines. If a read bit-value indicates '0', the precharged bitline is discharged. In this scenario, a bit-line switching takes place and consumes power. Otherwise, the precharged bit-line level is maintained until the next access, thus no bit-line switching occurs. In our approach, the binary-patterns to be assigned to op-codes are determined based on the frequency of instructions for reducing the bit-line switching activity. Application programs are analyzed in advance, and then binary-patterns including many '1's' are assigned to the most frequently referenced instructions. In our evaluation, it is observed that the proposed approach can reduce bit-line switching by 40%. © 2002 IEEE.","Batteries; Computer science; Embedded system; Energy consumption; Frequency; Informatics; Pattern analysis; Random access memory; Read only memory; Voltage","Application programs; Bins; Computer science; Electric potential; Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Random access storage; ROM; Solar cells; Switching; Binary patterns; Frequency; Informatics; New approaches; Next access; Pattern analysis; Random access memory; Switching activities; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66849142482

The combination of d.c. link converters does show a lower number of turn-off power semiconductors and, therefore, has been denoted as Sparse Matrix Converter (SMC) or Very Sparse Matrix Converter (VSMC). A limitation of the phase displacement of the current and voltage fundamentals at the input and at the output to ± π/6 does allow a further reduction of the system complexity, accordingly the respective topology has been introduced in the literature as Ultra Sparse Matrix Converter (USMC). In this paper a novel concept for the analytical calculation of the current stresses on the power semiconductors of the Sparse Matrix Converter Topologies (SMC, VSMC, and USMC) is proposed. As a comparison to a digital simulation shows, the analytical results do show a very good accuracy in a wide modulation range and for widely varying load current phase angle and widely varying ratio of output and mains frequency. Therefore, the analytical results provide an excellent basis for the dimensioning of the SMC, VSMC or USMC and/or for the determination of the rated output power and efficiency which could be achieved by employing given power transistors and diodes.",,"Approximation theory; Calculations; Computer simulation; Current voltage characteristics; Electric network topology; Electric rectifiers; Matrix algebra; Power electronics; Semiconductor diodes; Conduction losses; Conventional matrix converter; Power semiconductor; Sparse matrix converter; Ultra sparse matrix converter; Very sparse matrix converter; Power converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037235569

In the heating runs of the hydride with x ≤ 0.1 two endothermic peaks were observed. With the increase in the aluminum content, the first peak at lower temperature decreased, while the second peak at higher temperature increased. Furthermore, the difference in the temperatures of the peak top decreased with the increase in the aluminum content. In the heating runs of the hydride with x &gt; 0.1 only one endothermic peak was observed. These endothermic peaks shifted to higher temperatures with the increase in the hydrogen pressure. Using Ozawa's method, the activation energies for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes were estimated. The activation energy for the dehydrogenation process of the hydrides increased with the increase in the hydrogen pressure and the aluminum content. However, the dependence of the activation energy on the aluminum concentration in the range of x ≥ 0.1 was different from that of x &lt; 0.1. The activation energy for the hydrogenation process was estimated only in the range of x &gt; 0.1 at the hydrogen pressure of 5 MPa.

The selection of a memory location from a memory array involves driving row and column select lines. A signal transition on a row select line often consumes significantly more energy than a transition on a column select line. In order to exploit this difference in energy consumption of row and column select lines, we propose a novel address assignment methodology that aims to minimize high energy row transitions by assigning spatially and temporally local data items to the same row. The problem of energy efficient address assignment has been formulated as a multi-way graph partitioning problem and solved with a heuristic. Our experiments demonstrate that our methodology achieves row transition counts very close to the optimum and that the methodology can, for some examples, reduce row transition count by 40-70% over row major mapping. Moreover, we also demonstrate that our methodology is capable of handling access sequences with over 15 million accesses in moderate time.","Address assignment; Data layout; Memory synthesis","Address assignment; Data layout; Memory synthesis; Minimized memory row switching; Multi-way graph partitioning problem; Algorithms; Cellular arrays; Data transfer; Graph theory; Logic design; Optimization; Performance; Storage allocation (computer)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036907179

One of the interesting nanoscale devices for these kind of applications are the square magnetic nanodots. However a very large integration of this structures in a 2D array leads to interactions between different dots due to the existence of strong magnetic poles at the dot borders. For certain dimensions they may also become unstable due to the high magnetostatic energy and may fall into circular magnetisation distributions, usually referred to as vortex. Magnetostatically coupled bilayers exhibit a higher stability in parallel magnetisation distributions due to a good magnetic flux closure between magnetic layers. Parallel magnetisation structures appear to be stable in bilayer nanodots for a wider range of dimensions rather than in monolayers. Therefore, the higher stability of the magnetisation in this structures as well as the reduction of the magnetic poles at the dot borders make this kind of structures interesting from the high density recording point of view. In this paper it is studied the different stable configurations for square magnetic dots in materials with two magnetic layers with dimensions suitable for a good magnetostatic coupling between them. Results are compared with dots in materials with one single magnetic layer with similar dimensions. Magnetic fields necessary to switch between the different stable configurations as well as the switching mechanisms are also studied. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

While the current sharing between parallel-connected capacitors is good, it is not the case with parallel-connected clamping diodes. Despite a very-low-inductance busbar and attention to symmetrical layout, unequal current sharing results. Good agreement was obtained between measured waveforms and a detailed simulation model. The simulation model indicated that the unequal current sharing is due to small differences between the coupling factors of the parasitic busbar inductances near the capacitors at the ends and at the middle of the bank. It is concluded that the best solution is to place the parallel diodes as close as possible to each other at a position where best averaged coupling is achieved with the individual capacitors of the bank.","Current sharing; High-frequency busbar; Pulsed power; Resonant forced commutation","Capacitors; Electric current control; Inductance measurement; Power electronics; Semiconductor diodes; Waveform analysis; Current sharing; Parallel connected capacitors; Parallel connected clamping diodes; Parasitic busbar inductance; Polar capacitor bank; Pulsed power; Resonant forced commutation; Industrial electronics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036874833

Using simulated Mondrian-type colour surrounds on a CRT monitor, subjects make a series of colour matches between a test and a matching surface; the surfaces are rendered under the same standard illuminant (equal-energy illuminant). The 16 test surfaces used were categorised into four apparent-hue collections. The analysis of the colour differences show that subjects maintained good mental representations of the surfaces, although a shift in luminance was found. With these results, we investigated how errors in remembering surface colours might be translated into errors in reconstructing surface reflectances. Thus, a description of the remembered surfaces is provided, and the spectral differences are analysed via a goodness-of-fit coefficient (GFC). As it is derived from colour-differential thresholds and GFC values, the analysis of the recalled spectral-reflectance functions shows little loss of information in the observer's task, despite imperfect mathematical recovery of the surfaces. The similarities between test and matching surfaces suggest that colour-constancy algorithms could benefit of memory matches when an illuminant change takes place, and use spectral-tolerance bands defined over the surfaces comprising a scene to improve their implementation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Glucocorticoid excess is usually a result of exogenous administration of glucocorticoids or alteration of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, in the majority of patients it is due to an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma. Other possible causes are ectopic ACTH-secreting tumours of the lung, glucocorticoid-producing adrenal tumours and other ectopic tumours. The symptoms include central fat deposition, altered energy and protein metabolism, hypertension and depression. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the HPA axis provide a rationale to correct the alterations observed in Cushing's syndrome. Recent developments have identified possible targets and drugs for therapy at different levels of the HPA axis.

The pressure-composition-temperature (P-C-T) tests show that the highest hydrogen concentration can reach 1.58 wt% for Zn-free (x=0) composition and then decreases from 1.44 wt%(x=0.2) to 1.19 wt%(x=0.3), respectively, with the increase of Zn in the alloys. The electrochemical tests show that the electrochemical capacity of alloys reaches a very high level, 380 mAh/g for x=0, and then decreases to 366 mAh/g(x=0.1),345 mAh/g(x=0.2) and 271 mAh/g(x=0.3), respectively, with the increase of Zn in the alloys. The attenuation rate of capacity decreases from 16% (x=0) to 4% (x=0.3) after 100 charging/discharging cycles.

Optic microscopy, SEM and EDX analyses indicate that the main part of alloys are Mg-free and Mg-contained LaNi5-based solid solutions. The latter is the key to the high electrochemical capacity. The addition of Zn makes the secondary phase change from LaNi2 to Co-rich phase in the alloys and also influences their quantity and shape. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Cycle stability; Discharge capacity; High rate discharge ability; Hydrogen storage alloy; P-C-T curve","Approximation theory; Catalysis; Electrochemistry; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Microstructure; Nickel alloys; Optical microscopy; Oxidation; Powder metals; Scanning electron microscopy; Solid solutions; Hydrogen storage alloys; Hydrogen fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036779024

But in the WTG, the power fluctuations caused by the wind speed fluctuation are the most crucial issue in providing their energy to the utility. It was found that the power compensation system (PCS) with the suitable capacity is still unknown. In this paper, the argument to time range and standardized wind speed including fluctuations is discussed. We estimated the storage capacity of PCS at a wind profiles by standardization of wind speed and verified the validity of their capacities using a computer simulation.

When used to elucidate the effects of electrochemical intercalation of ions in oxide films, the information required is the valence state of multivalence ions. To ensure that this information is not compromised by surface reoxidation, we have developed an in situ electrochemical cell for use with aprotic and anhydrous electrolytes. This cell has been used to study lithium intercalation in thin oxide layers built up on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides. Samples can be exposed for intercalation of lithium (or de-intercalation), rinsed, dried and transferred within the vacuum of the spectrometer for characterization. The cell is designed to be withdrawn into a nacelle when not in use so as not to interfere with the normal use of the spectrometer.

Three technologies involving hydrogen gas energy have already been proposed: gas liquefaction at low temperature, gas compression at high pressure and the formation of metallic hydrides. Another technology corresponding to a variant of gas compression concerns gas adsorption under pressure. Considerable activity has been devoted to the experimental and numerical studies of nanoscale-dimension material adsorptive properties in order to store hydrogen gas by adsorption. Thus, within the framework of studying hydrogen storage for future clean vehicles, we performed hydrogen adsorption on both current active carbons and promising new adsorbents. We carried out analysis of the gas/solid interface reactivity by numerical simulations. More specifically, we studied the potential of hydrogen adsorption by new graphitic materials, for which recent works have demonstrated that these adsorbents may have high adsorptive capacities owing to their surface reactivity in relation to their nanometric dimensions. These adsorbents present structures that are favourable to the adsorption phenomenon because of the attractive interaction range between gas molecules and adsorbent atoms. In this work, we studied the gas/solid interface reactivity in order to discuss the potential influence of carbon nanofibre dimensions on hydrogen adsorption. We performed Monte-Carlo numerical simulations of gas adsorption on materials that could represent these adsorbents in reality. We computed these simulations in order to analyse interface reactivity and to obtain interface information and predictions of gas adsorption, with the aim of optimizing adsorbent structures for hydrogen adsorption. Moreover, we realized experimental studies of gas adsorption in microporous material in order to validate our numerical predictions and to obtain other information on the reactivity of the gas/solid interface.","Adsorption; High pressure; Simulation; Surface reactivity","Air pollution control; Computer simulation; Gas adsorption; Gas fuel analysis; Graphite; Hydrogen; Monte Carlo methods; Nanostructured materials; Phase interfaces; Porous materials; Pressure effects; Vehicles; Gas solid interface reactivity; Hydrogen absorption; Surface reactivity analysis; Surfaces",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036693501

During these phases the systems evolve only due to slow changes in their environment, being practically in equilibrium on large scales. The eruption onset would then be identified with a bifurcation or catastrophe point in the solution diagram. Different energy storage mechanisms can be studied by different parameterizations of e.g. the boundary conditions. Also from the more fundamental point-of-view of the theory of dynamical systems, studying the possible stationary states and the bifurcation properties of plasma systems should be the first step towards a more thorough understanding of their full dynamical behaviour. In any case one will have to solve highly non-linear partial differential equations with the possibility of the existence of multiple solutions (or of none at all) for a given set of boundary conditions. Such problems can, in general, only be solved numerically. The most appropriate class of numerical algorithms for this type of problem are continuation methods which can calculate complete solution branches and detect bifurcation points. In this work a numerical bifurcation code based on a continuation method is presented. In addition to solving the non-linear magnetohydrostatic equations, the code can check a sufficient linear stability criterion for each solution. Some preliminary results for simple magnetohydrostatic equilibria are presented and potential future applications are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This, however, will not simply consist into replacing a battery equipment by another one, but will draw significant impact over the Electrical Power System as a whole. Among the areas of concern is the capability to keep an adequate cell voltage balancing throughout the spacecraft life in order to guarantee that no cell will be overstressed to a point where its life expectance could be impaired. Through the Stentor program, such a balancing system has been developed and validated for GEO missions, and will be soon flight proven. However, since it relies on the measurement of the cell open circuit or near open circuit voltage to derive its instantaneous state of charge, it can hardy be transposed as such to a LEO application, where such conditions are far from being frequent. As a consequence, new principles have to be devised, also with the objective of reducing the amount of required hardware and relying as little as possible on resources external to the EPS, namely the on board computer.

On the one side, beams from on-line mass separators have been decelerated in order to inject them in ion traps for precise experiments. On the ohter side, beams from on-line mass separators have been post-accelerated in order to use the secondary beam for nuclear reaction studies. Both applications put stringent requirements on the ISOL beams. These requirements relate to: • the element range of the beam, including refractory elements; • to the time span of the separated isotopes, down to the millisecond region; • to the intensity of the beam, dealing with high-intensity targets; • to the charge state of the beam, breeding it up from 1+ to n+; • to the purity of the beam, in mass as well as element selection; • and to the ion-optical quality, related to energy as well as time. This contribution deals with the recent developments in each direction and will give an outlook for further studies. Special emphasis is put on the use of dense, noble gases for thermalization, storage and transport of short-living ions and on the use of selective laser ionization. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A simulation model was developed to investigate the dynamic behavior of the units in interaction with the power system. As a result of a systematic multivariable controller design, active and reactive power control channels are decoupled. The controller used in this study shows a Dead-Beat-behavior. A special feature of the controller is its ability to compensate terminal voltage changes.

Commercial units are built up based on modular units, namely cells, which are composed of a three-phase diode-based front-end rectifier, a dc link electrolytic capacitor, and a single-phase full-wave voltage-source inverter. The main advantage is the improved power quality at both ac system and motor sides. However, two drawbacks are present in these configurations. These are: (a) the single-phase operation of the inverter in each cell generates a large second current harmonic that is injected back into the dc link capacitor, thus, a large electrolytic capacitor has to be used in order to guarantee a reduced voltage ripple across it; (b) the three-phase diode-based front-end rectifier does not provide the regenerative operating mode as required, for instance, by down-hill belt conveyors in minery applications, where this operating mode is the normal one. This paper proposes to replace the diode-based front-end rectifier by an active front-end rectifier and a novel control strategy in order to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks. In fact, the active front-end rectifier allows the topology to regenerate and the control strategy removes the large second current harmonic from the dc link capacitor, thus reducing its size. Both features are achieved without any penalties in the quality of the waveforms. Simulated results confirm the theoretical considerations. © 2002 IEEE.",,"AC motors; Belt conveyors; Cells; Cytology; Diodes; Electric inverters; Electrolytic capacitors; Industrial electronics; Rectifying circuits; Topology; Active front end rectifiers; Control strategies; Current harmonics; Dc link capacitor; Medium-voltage ac drives; Simulated results; Single phase operation; Storage requirements; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902347002

The lower the melting point, the more severe the specimen damage. The amount of specimen damage can vary substantially even for particles of the same size and composition.

Time dependency of the levitation force following a jumpwise movement of the permanent magnet was measured. The results were used to setup an engineering design algorithm for energy storage HTS flywheels.

The Griffin Area Development in the southern Carnarvon Basin, offshore Western Australia, consists of three oil fields; Griffin, Chinook and Scindian, tied to the ""Griffin Venture"" Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) facility. First production commenced in January 1994, with a maximum rate of 85,000 stb/d reached shortly after start-up. The Zeepaard Formation is the primary reservoir in the development. It has excellent productivity and strong aquifer support. In eight years of production, over 100 MMstb of oil has been recovered through nine vertical wells. Production began to decline from 1996, with escalating water cuts from the majority of the wells. Reprocessing of the 1991 3D seismic data, combined with reservoir modelling studies, led to the approval and subsequent drilling of two Zeepaard infill wells in mid 2000, one in the Scindian Field and the other in Griffin. The results of the Griffin infill well changed the understanding of reservoir sweep in that field and led to a re-entry campaign in late 2000. This was followed by a second infill well in early 2002. Each infill well has flowed in excess of 20,000 stb/d, lifting the production potential of the Griffin Venture, improving the reservoir sweep and accelerating reserves into field life. In February 2002, the facility was producing at 60,000 stb/d, with 40,000 stb/d of this attributable to the three infill wells drilled in the area since July 2000.",,"Core analysis; Energy storage; Oil well drilling; Oil well logging; Oil well production; Petroleum reservoirs; Production platforms; Risk assessment; Seismic prospecting; Infill wells; Oil reservoir dynamics; Subsea wells; Offshore oil fields",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642562596

The architecture of the proposed family of networks is inspired from bipolar Hopfield's neural network (BH). We have modified the function of energy of the bipolar Hopfield model by a new function of the outputs of neurons that we are naming function of similarity as it measures the similarity between the outputs of neurons. When binary neurons are considered and the function product is used as a function of similarity, then the proposed model is identical to that of Hopfield. We have studied a method to load a set of patterns into the network. That method corresponds to the Hopfield's one when bipolar neurons are been considered. Finally we show that an augmented network avoids the storage of undesirable patterns into the network, as the well-known effect of loading the opposite pattern into the Hopfield's network. For this new storage technics an expression that allows to set bounds to the capacity of the network is obtained. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.",,"Auto-associative Memory; Binary neurons; Hopfield models; Hopfield Networks; Multivalued recurrent network; Neural models; Auto-associative Memory; Binary neurons; Hopfield models; Hopfield Networks; Multi-valued; Multivalued recurrent network; Neural modeling; New functions; Hopfield neural networks; Artificial intelligence; Neural networks; Neurons; Neural networks; Hopfield neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038482873

E.g., using linear allocation and scheduling functions (loop transformations) results in distributed computations and communication between nearest neighbor processors. So, data can be stored locally in each processor which is essential for low power VLSI designs. We show that the chosen mapping has a significant influence on the consumed energy. Our estimation approach identifies statements with decreased operand switching activity. For these statements with reduced activity, a lower power consumption value can be directly obtained from a generated table based model to refine the estimation.

Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection 15 d before the starting of pregnancy. The rats had their energy balance variables followed for 21 d. Protein, fat and energy content of dams was determined from samples of the carcasses. Pregnancy led to increased energy intake, energy gain and energy expenditure as well as higher gross food efficiency than non-pregnant counterparts. Diabetes increased metabolizable energy intake but not the energy gain of the animals: They had very high energy expenditure, so that diabetes blocked the improvement in gross food efficiency shown during pregnancy. Offspring from diabetic dams were born with lower body weight. Pregnant animals did not present the usual energy storage as seen by lower energy gain of diabetic dams as well as by the lower fat content in the carcasses of pregnant diabetic rats. It is concluded that diabetes impairs the energy variables usually enhanced by pregnancy alone.","Diabetes mellitus; Energy balance; Energy expenditure; Pregnancy","fat; isophane insulin; protein; streptozocin; animal experiment; animal model; article; body composition; body weight; caloric intake; carcass; controlled study; energy balance; energy consumption; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; fat content; female; food intake; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; low birth weight; metabolic disorder; newborn; nonhuman; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; progeny; protein content; rat; streptozocin diabetes; urine volume; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036261923

The threshold voltage change for proton and alpha irradiations is about three orders of magnitude larger than that for electrons. The performance degradation is mainly caused by the total ionization dose (TID) damage in the tunnel oxide and in the interpoly dielectric layer and by the creation of interface traps at the Si-SiO2 interface. The impact of the irradiation temperature on the device degradation was studied for electrons and gammas, pointing out that irradiation at room temperature is mostly the worst case. Finally, attention is given to the impact of isochronal and isothermal annealing on the recovery of the degradation introduced after room temperature proton and electron irradiation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Kurchatoval, Moscow, 123182, Russian Federation","The role of the polarization mechanism in bremsstrahlung and radiative recombination in a plasma with heavy ions is investigated. A study is made of a hot plasma with the electron temperature Te = 0.5 keV, containing Fe, Mo, W, and U ions, a relatively cold plasma with a temperature of 0.1-10 eV, and a storage-ring plasma with relatively low-energy electrons. The spectral characteristics, as well as the total cross sections and rate constants for electron-ion recombination, are calculated with allowance for real ionization equilibrium in a plasma. The calculations are carried out using the quasiclassical approximation for electron scattering and the statistical model for the ions, which provides a universal description of the spectra of various chemical elements over a wide temperature range. It is shown that the polarization mechanism contributes to both the effective radiation intensity and the total radiative recombination rate. The temperature range is found where the polarization recombination of electrons in collisions with FeIII ions plays an important role, which indicates the collective behavior of the electron core of an iron ion in this temperature range. Taking into account polarization effects increases the calculated total continuum intensity. As a consequence, the effective plasma charge Zeff determined from this intensity without allowance for polarization effects turns out to be overestimated. © 2002 MAIK ""Nauka/Interperiodica"".",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035995411

We evaluate four baseline options, and three potential CDM interventions. The emissions reductions range from -670 to +5 929 Mg CO2 per year, with all option but one showing positive emission reductions. Using metered solar water heating with liquefied petroleum gas back-up as the CDM intervention, and electric storage geysers as the baseline, the annual emissions reductions are 5 686 Mg CO2. The cost-effectiveness from the national perspective, which is the incremental life cycle costs divided by the lifetime emissions reductions, is -$18 per Mg CO2. From the perspective of the CDM investor, however, the cost-effectiveness is $5.2 per mg CO2, assuming that the investor receives all of the carbon credits for providing the incremental capital investment. From our analysis, we conclude that using the current technology (kerosene stoves) as a baseline is probably not appropriate because it does not reflect likely future trends and also penalises the community for their poverty and current lack of infrastructure. We also highlight the importance of credit sharing, and how it affects the cost-effectiveness of the project from the CDM investor's perspective. The lessons from this analysis are important for the current international policy debate on how to preferentially treat small-scale CDM projects.","Additionality; Baselines; Clean Development Mechanism; Kyoto Protocol; Solar water heating; South Africa","alternative energy; carbon emission; emission control; solar power; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242668698

A bottom-up methodology for designing balanced systems is described. The approach differs from the classical mechanism synthesis methods in that a simple already balanced mechanism is developed into a mechanism of the desired specifications, rather than that an adjustment mechanism is synthesized to match the required transfer function between the energy storage devices. The described methodology uses some idealizations to yield a coherent theoretical framework for designing systems that are perfectly balanced. When real world constraints are to be applied on a system conceived of in this way, numerical approximation may become necessary. This paper describes an approximation method using an ideal design as an initial estimate. Examples are given that illustrate the followed approach.

More in particular, we steer and verify the development of a task-level data transfer and storage methodology, the development of a task-level scheduling methodology and the development of an instruction memory management methodology. All of these methodologies are focussed on reducing the overall energy consumption of the complex dynamic system on a heterogeneous platform architecture. Compared to research in the academic and industrial context, our contribution is to integrate in a scalable way existing energy and performance simulators of the components of a heterogeneous multiprocessor SoC. Also a novel instruction memory hierarchy is included. The simulation environment consists of multiple processing nodes connected to a distributed memory hierarchy. To reduce the energy consumption of the system, both the processing nodes as well as the memory architecture can be varied: the processing voltage of each node can be tuned and the memory hierarchy can be fully customized. The integration of dynamic real-time applications on this platform is simplified by the availability of a multi-processor RTOS. The use of the simulator to develop our high-level design methodologies is illustrated on real-life multimedia applications.","Energy/performance modeling; Instruction hierarchy management; Multi-processor simulation; Task concurrency management; Task data management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347934778

Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) attracts all of our attentions as the efficient electric power storage equipment. As the electric power can be charged and discharged at high speed, SMES stabilizes the power system if it is properly controlled. We have been experimenting the stabilizing control of power systems using a 50 kJ SMES and one machine infinite bus system. The fuzzy logic type switching control with consideration to loss in the inverter-converter unit is applied to SMES to stabilize power systems. In this paper, the result of the stabilization control experiments of the power system is stated. The proposed fuzzy logic type switching control is equal to or more effective than the conventional method which does not take loss in consideration. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In order to monitor a radon signal due to variable pressures and rock stresses we use a natural laboratory under a reservoir of the Vianden (Luxembourg) pumping storage power plant. Depending on energy demands, the artificial reservoirs at the top of a hill experience daily variations in water levels of up to 16 meters, thus exerting variable pressures on the underlying rocks. Radon concentrations are continuously measured in boreholes drilled into the bedrock under water reservoir. We observe some very strong variations in transient radon concentrations induced by variations of water level. The reservoir consists of two independent reservoirs that were emptied individually for some period of time. The observed radon pattern depends on the location of the boreholes under the reservoir and is different if both basins are working together, or if one of the reservoirs is empty. The observed patterns can be accounted for by variable pathways of fluids, fluid overpressure and a dynamic flow in cracks.","Crustal deformation; Radon; Radon transport; Stress-strain in rocks","groundwater; radon; stress field",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29144438142

Studies of the behaviour and population dynamics of mantle autotomy in F. ficus have previously been reported, but here, a detailed description of the structure of the autotomy tissue is presented for the first time. Whether or not this autotomy tissue has the secondary function of a storage compartment was also investigated through analysis of its biochemical composition. Figsnails were collected from the coast of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Histological observations indicated that the most obvious feature of the autotomy tissue is the extensive network of muscle fibres and connective tissues. In the swollen autotomy tissue, not only do the epithelia rupture, but the connective tissue expands threefold on the dorsal side and 15-fold on the ventral side. Chemical analysis of body composition indicated that the average contents of protein, lipid, carbohydrate and ash in the foot, mantle and autotomy tissue are in the range of 55.6-76.5%, 0.6-14.1%, 2.0-27.9% and 6.5-13.5%, respectively, with the caloric value ranging from 4.7 to 5.5 kcal g-1 dry wt. The content of carbohydrate in the autotomy tissue is much less than that in the foot and mantle, i.e. 2.0-6.8% vs. 13.0-27.9%. There is no indication that the autotomy tissue serves as an energy reserve. Hence, it is suggested that the autotomy tissue functions only as a defensive weapon.","Autotomy mantle; Biochemical composition; Ficus; Histology; Mesogastropod","carbohydrate; lipid; protein; histology; animal tissue; article; autotomy; chemical analysis; female; gastropod; histology; male; nonhuman; sex difference; snail; Taiwan; Animalia; Ficidae; Fraxinus; Gastropoda; Mesogastropoda; Trixis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036551643

The site of the drill was selected at the periphery of the Devonian South Mountain batholith, which contains important mineralization of tin and uranium. The drill hole intersected texturally uniform megacrystic biotite granodiorite, which does not display any pronounced primary vertical zonation. At depth, the drill core contains zones of alteration, fracturing, and brecciation. The alteration is mainly due to fluid flow along the fractures. Some fractures are mineralized and contain galena, sphalerite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, hematite, quartz, and carbonate minerals. Common occurrence of alteration zones in the hole suggests that such zones are widespread in the batholith and point to abundant hydrothermal activity deep within the massif. It is inferred that the potential for hidden economic mineral deposits within the batholith is much greater than is suggested by surface features. The association of mineralization as seen in the drill core with the most primitive rocks of the batholith further indicates that mineral deposits in granitoid rocks are not always hosted by the most evolved and fractionated rocks. Extensive fracturing demonstrates that the batholith is not a suitable candidate for the storage of radioactive waste material. High temperature measured in the drill hole (∼68°C at a depth of about 1,450 m) suggests that the pluton has promise as a source of geothermal energy.",,"batholith; Devonian; geochemistry; granodiorite; mineral deposit; mineralization; petrography; tin; uranium; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043201107

One of these is the effect of the current redistribution between superconducting strands and stabilizer on the quench propagation and stability. In this study, we assume a superconducting magnet to be immersed in liquid helium. A quasi-three-dimensional model is proposed to study thermal diffusion in superconducting magnet and current diffusion is based on the solution of Maxwell's equation. The uniform temperature distribution in the cross-sectional area of conductor is taken into account due to the high thermal conduction of stabilizer and small size compared with the length. An adaptive mesh scheme COLSYS is employed to capture the solution of temperature and current in the front of normal position.

Since the requirements on productivity are very high for mobile machinery, high output capacity combined with high overall efficiency over a wide velocity range is therefore of great importance. A traditional solution for drive train in mobile machinery is to use a hydrodynamic transmission (torque converter) in series with a multi-speed shiftable gearbox. For heavy machines, engine power above 150 kW, torque converters have been used exclusively until a few years ago. However, the development of hydrostatic drive concepts and microprocessor control have made it possible to be competitive with converter drives. Joining pumps, motors and mechanical gears in smart concepts, so called power split transmissions, has make it possible to keep prescribed output power and velocity range without the need of sophisticated power shift gearboxes. In constant pressure hydraulic systems gas loaded accumulators can be used for energy storage. During braking and lowering of loads, the kinetic energy of the load can be stored in the accumulator and then the energy will be reused for acceleration and lifting of the load. Secondary controlled motors and hydrostatic transformers are components that can be used in conjunction with accumulators to improve the overall efficiency of hydrostatic systems. The need is also growing for technology that is capable of not only efficiently producing high-quality works, but also being environmentally friendly. In that sense, high efficient hydrostatic systems with good controllability would be extremely useful in a large quantity of outdoors industrial applications. The aim of this paper is to show how the advantage of hydrostatics can be exploited to reach high capacity, high overall efficiency and controllability required for high productivity.

Although examples are mentioned where the energy shifts of energy bands relative to each other influence the physical properties, we mainly discuss the combined effects of crystal symmetry and spin-orbit coupling. In crystals without inversion symmetry this leads to a spin splitting of the bands which in particular for compound semiconductors produce interesting optical properties which also may be of technological importance. Also the properties of magnetic metals are influenced by relativistic effects, again mainly due to the spinorbit coupling. A quantitative description of spin polarization and spinorbit coupling is essential for materials where the spin-and orbital moments are comparable in magnitude. Often such materials also are those where simple (local) implementations of the density functional theory are not sufficiently accurate. Strong electron correlations require other theoretical methods, self-interaction corrections, “LDA+U”, for example. Magnetooptical effects (Kerr effect, circular dichroism), magneto-elastic effects and magnetostriction are fields of great importance, in basic as well as applied solid state research. An understanding of the relation between magnetic properties of layered structures and spin dependent transport properties is essential for the explanation of the Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) effect, and thus for the development for novel recording and storage devices. © 2002, Elsevier Inc.

To obtain the flow duration curve necessary for a correct design of the micro-turbine, the following hypothesis have been made: the behavior of the mountain basin is modeled like a linear reservoir, the rainfall is described as a marked Poisson process and the snowmelt is modeled using the empirical temperature-index approach. The result of the simulation is the hourly electrical output as a function of the daily flow of available water. A single micro-turbine is enough for this basin.

The hydration of CaO was studied in the chemical reaction control region by thermogravimetric analysis for a reactant solid particle size of under 53 μm, a reaction temperature of 503-550 K and a water vapor pressure of 1.0-2.3 kPa. The experimental results obtained by thermogravimetric analysis with the vacuumed forced convection type experimental device agreed with our reaction model. The model is based on the following two assumptions. 1. The hydration of CaO is a reversible chemical reaction. Thus, the final reaction conversion is an equilibrium reaction conversion. 2. The equilibrium reaction conversion is determined by reaction temperature and water vapor pressure, and reflects the reaction rate. The reaction order of the hydration are was found to be 1.0 with respect to the concentration of solid reactant and water vapor pressure.

Moreover, the aim of this study is to check the effectiveness of shielding of the storage area. NTDs were mounted with the boron converter on their surface as one compressed unit. The converter is a lithium tetraborate (Li2B4O7) layer for thermal neutron detection via 10B(n,α)7Li and 6Li(n,α)3H nuclear reactions. The area passive dosemeters were installed on 26 different locations around the source storage area and adjacent rooms. The calibration factor for NTD-based area passive neutron dosemeters was found to be 8.3 alpha tracks.cm-2.μSv-1 using active snoopy neutron dosemeters in the KFUPM neutron irradiation facility. The results show the variation of accumulated dose with locations around the storage area. The range of dose rates varied from as low as 40 nSv.h-1 up to 11 μSv.h-1. The study indicates that the area passive neutron dosemeter was able to detect accumulated doses as low as 40 nSv.h-1, which could not be detected with the available active neutron dosemeters. The results of the study also indicate that an additional shielding is required to bring the dose rates down to background level. The present investigation suggests extending this study to find the contribution of doses from fast neutrons around the neutron source storage area using NTDs through proton recoil. The significance of this passive technique is that it is highly sensitive and does not require any electronics or power supplies, as is the case in active system.",,"boron; boron derivative; lithium borate; unclassified drug; petroleum; article; calibration; controlled study; electronics; geographic distribution; neutron dosimeter; neutron dosimetry; neutron radiation; nuclear energy; nuclear track detector; power supply; proton radiation; radiation detector; radiation monitoring; Saudi Arabia; sensitivity analysis; comparative study; fast neutron radiation; human; instrumentation; neutron; radiation dose; radiation monitoring; radiation protection; thermoluminescence dosimetry; Fast Neutrons; Humans; Neutrons; Petroleum; Radiation Dosage; Radiation Monitoring; Radiation Protection; Thermoluminescent Dosimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842848024

The main advantage of ice storage is to shift the electrical demand from the summer afternoon peak period to nighttime. In subtropical cities, such as Hong Kong, weather in summer is not stable due to rainy days and even thunder-storms. It will be a great waste if ice is blindly stored without any reference to the actual demand on the following day. It will also result in poor performance of the whole air-conditioning system if ice is blindly discharged during normal operation. Our firm belief is that ice charging and discharging should be tightly coupled with the actual weather in order to achieve an optimal goal where accurate weather prediction and cloud tracking are the major tools. Such information can be freely downloaded from the Internet. A useful linguistic-numerical conversion scheme has been established based on our statistical analyses for the past two years. We have also developed a chiller capacity-based control algorithm for ice discharging. Three cases have been simulated, and we have concluded that substantial energy saving and excellent performance can be guaranteed with this new weather information-based intelligent ice storage control system. The research results may be useful to aid real-time air-conditioning control based on weather prediction and real-time monitoring.",,"Air conditioning; Algorithms; Cold storage; Energy conservation; Evaporators; Ice; Internet; Monitoring; Performance; Thunderstorms; Ice storage; Intelligent control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17144457651

For instance, choosing a linked list as a data structure as opposed to an array for a specific situation, was mainly motivated from a performance point of view under the implicit assumption that the computer platform (that had to run the software) consisted out of one monolithical, physical memory. In the context of mobile, embedded devices, energy consumption is as important as performance. In addition to this, the assumption of one monolithical memory is outdated for many (if not all) current-day platforms! Clearly, there is a need to improve the choices that are made during data structure analysis given specific knowledge of the memory hierarchy of the platform under investigation. We show how memory related energy consumption can heavily be reduced by taking into account the access behaviour of the application on the one hand and the available on-chip and off-chip memory space on the other hand. We do this by exploiting the sparseness that is present in one steady state of the data structure under investigation. Analytical results show that energy reductions of a factor of 8.7 are feasible in comparison to common data structure implementations. We trade these gains off with on-chip memory space consumption of a custom memory architecture.","Energy consumption; On-chip memory footprint; Partitioned data structure","Application specific integrated circuits; Data storage equipment; Dynamic programming; Embedded systems; Microprocessor chips; Monolithic integrated circuits; Dynamic application execution; Off chip memory; On chip memory; Power electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036954281

Furthermore, results from a NOPEX experiment in the northern zone of the boreal forest in Finnish Lapland highlights the very unique processes associated with the energy exchange within a forest in wintertime.

The high energy fuel is used with an oxidiser, viz., hydroxyl ammonium perchlorate as a bi-propellant system for torpedo propulsion. Thermal stability of high energy fuel has been arrived at by differential thermal analysis and also by following the depletion in stabiliser content as well as increase in acidity with ageing. Rate constant for decomposition, activation energy for depletion of 2-nitro diphenylamine (2-NDPA) and shelf-life of high energy fuel have been determined. Due to the high vapour pressure of high energy fuel (because of 1,2-dinitroxy propane), usual experimental set up could not be used and the sample was conditioned in sealed tubes. The shelf-life of high energy fuel is arrived at using Woolwich, Berthelot and Arrhenius equations and the results obtained are 100 years, 125 years and 276 years, respectively. Considering the safety aspect, the lowest value, viz., 100 years is recommended as safe life of high energy fuel.

Energy savings for heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems have been studied and implemented extensively. However, the implication of control systems for energy savings has been somewhat neglected, and the strategies have been to use existing proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative (PID) controllers. For conventional HVAC control, a well-tuned PID controller has been considered adequate. It is questionable whether the PID controller ensures that the control system can be operated at the most efficient condition for energy consumption. This paper describes a clear, concise comparison of tuning methods for a PID controller for energy savings. PID controllers are designed for a first-order lag plus dead-time system. From among well-known tuning methods, the Ziegler-Nichols rule, partial model matching method, and optimization method have been chosen for purposes of comparison of control performance. A numerical comparison of three methods with PI, I-P, PID, and I-PD control configurations has been presented for both reference tracking and load disturbance suppression characteristics. It is found that the control performance due to PI and I-P control is superior to that due to PID and I-PD control, and I-P and I-PD control is more practical than PI and PID control for energy savings. The resultant graphical comparisons for control performance document the choice of the best tuning method that makes the control system consume the least energy.",,"Air conditioning; Control system analysis; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Natural resources; Optimization; Sensors; Ventilation; Energy savings; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036459754

The design goals are to reach as high a torque as possible for a given magnet volume while the no-load losses are to be minimized as well. Since Halbach arrays result in a more gradual change of magnetic flux density in the airgap of a machine, they were considered as an alternative for the radially magnetized array to lower the eddy current losses in the winding of a machine with a slotless stator without compromising the torque production. In this paper, the conventional radially magnetized array is compared with both a discrete Halbach array and an ideal Halbach array with respect to torque production. An equivalent current density in the airgap is used to calculate the electromagnetic torque. The results are presented as the torque as a function of the ratio of magnet thickness to total airgap length.",,"Current density; Eddy currents; Energy storage; Flywheels; Machine windings; Magnetic flux; Magnetization; Rotors; Magnetic flux density; Permanent magnets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036040852

Major interstate natural gas pipeline assets include Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL), Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, L.L.C, TransColorado and Trailblazer. NGPL transports up to 5.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf)/day) of natural gas through 10,000 miles of pipeline and has 210 Bcf of working gas storage.

KMI affiliates also own and operate significant liquid pipelines, CO2 pipelines, bulk and liquids terminals, natural gas retail distribution and electric generation. KMI has a long history of performance under a risk based Integrity Management Program. Integrity maintenance projects carried out in a given year are selected from a list of proposals submitted by individual pipeline operations managers. A variety of integrity project proposals are received for specific pipeline segments each year, including replacements, in-line inspections and hydrostatic tests. KMI's Risk Engineering group performs a risk-based evaluation of the projects proposed in any given year to identify the most cost effective collection of projects that provide the greatest level of risk reduction. The approach is based on a benefit cost ratio, defined as the expected risk reduction in dollars per mile over the project useful life, divided by the total project cost. Risk reduction is estimated using a quantitative risk analysis approach in which the failure rate reduction achieved by carrying out a given project is multiplied by the expected failure costs. The project ranking provides a useful guide for selecting projects that fit within the maintenance budget while providing the greatest risk reduction. The benefit cost results can also be used as a tool to justify the maintenance budget. This paper describes the quantitative risk evaluation approach and demonstrates its benefits, which include substantial potential savings and a convincing case to support the decisions made.",,"Hydrostatic tests; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Gas fuel storage; Natural gas pipelines; Petroleum pipelines; Risk assessment; Petroleum industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036432082

Other metal ions that are commonly found in biological systems bind to the ferroxidase centre, including manganese(II), cobalt(II) and zinc(II). In this work, copper(II)-binding to BFR and its effect on iron(II) oxidation kinetics were studied by a combination of gel filtration-copper(II) binding assay, optical, magnetic and kinetic methods. Data indicate that two copper(II) ions bind per subunit with a Kd of ≈ 2.0 × 10-5 M and establish the order of divalent metal ion binding as Cu(II) &lt; Co(II) &lt; Zn(II), i.e. it does not follow the Irving-Williams order. A number of lower affinity copper(II)-binding sites were also detected. The presence of copper(II) was found to significantly enhance the rate of iron(II) oxidation and subsequent core formation. This effect does not arise from copper(II) bound at the ferroxidase centre but, rather, is due to displaced copper(II).

High-pressure air compressed by motor-driven compressors in nighttime and stored in underground reservoir is provided to the CAES G/T for power generation in day time.

Developed control logic was tested by comprehensive simulation tests covering almost all expected operations such as start, acceleration, load application and rejection, recuperator active/non-active mode transfer etc. Finally, we conducted hardware in the loop simulation test to assure Electronic Control Unit (ECU) function and performance.

The ABB is a device installed on some high-speed disk drives for reducing radial vibrations of motor spindle motion. The existence of rolling friction between the balancing ball and its runway may, however, results in the ball settling at undesirable angular positions, which greatly limit the performance for radial vibration reduction. The objective of study is to design an intelligent feedback scheme to overcome the aforementioned drawback of the ball-balancer system. The method of fuzzy logic control is proposed by activating the control scheme from the onset of system dynamics until the ball settles at the desired angular position. In this way the system becomes passive after the ball settles at its desired angular position, i.e., saving energy for the control effort. A mathematical model is established first. The influence of rolling resistance on the steady-state solution and stability of the ball is analyzed. The proposed fuzzy control scheme is then designed. The system augmented with the control scheme is simulated to verify the validness of the fuzzy logic control.","Automatic balancer system; Fuzzy control; Perturbation method; Rolling resistance","Computer simulation; Control system synthesis; Feedback; Fuzzy control; Fuzzy sets; Mathematical models; Optical disk storage; Perturbation techniques; Position control; Rolling resistance; System stability; Vibration control; Automatic ball type balancer system; Fuzzy logic control; Radial vibrations; Intelligent control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036911816

The JET-X mirrors were first calibrated at the Max Plank Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics' (MPE) Panter facility, Garching, Germany in 1996 (SPIE 2805 (1996) 56; SPIE 3114 (1997) 392). Half-energy widths of 16 arcsec at 1.5 keV were confirmed for the two flight mirrors and the flight spare. The calibration of the flight spare was repeated at Panter in July 2000 in order to establish whether any changes had occurred during the 4yr that the mirror had been in storage at the OAB, Milan, Italy. The results reported in this paper confirm that the resolution of the JET-X mirrors has remained stable over this storage period. In an extension of this test program, the flight spare EPIC camera was installed at the focus of the JET-X mirror to simulate the optical system of the Swift XRT. Tolerances in the mirror focal length, the on-axis and off-axis point spread functions were measured and calibration data sets were used to obtain centroid positions of X-ray point sources. The results confirmed Swift's ability to determine the centroid positions of sources at 100mCrab brightness to better than 1 arcsec and provided a calibration of the centroiding process as a function of source flux and off-axis angle. The presence of background events in the image frame introduced errors in the centroiding process and this was accounted for by reducing the sampling area used for the centroiding algorithm. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In stochastic associative processing, the association probability of each stored pattern depends on the similarity between the stored pattern and the input pattern. Such unique processing is useful for sequential stochastic association and for clustering for vector quantization. Conventional single-electron circuits operate only at very low temperature for practical junction capacitance (i.e., 30 K for 0.1 aF) because the charging energy in these circuits is directly related to the tunnel junction capacitance.

We extend this work to the Gaussian noise channel and to partial-response codes. We show that the storage requirement ∼(2 1-R - 1) -t paths for rate-R convolutional codes over the binary channel becomes ∼2 2Rt over the Gaussian channel, where the decoder must correct t errors. Thus, convolutional coding over the Gaussian channel is not only 3 dB more energy efficient, but its decoding is simpler as well. Next, we estimate the path storage for partial-response codes, i.e., real-number convolutional codes, over the Gaussian channel. The growth rate depends primarily on the bandwidth of the code. A new optimization procedure is devised to measure the maximum storage requirement in Gaussian noise for these two code types. An analysis based on difference equations predicts the asymptotic storage growth for partial response codes.","Convolutional coding; Decoding; Decoding complexity; Intersymbol interference reduction; Partial response coding","Decoding complexity; Partial response coding; Bandwidth; Convolutional codes; Difference equations; Energy efficiency; Error correction; Gaussian noise (electronic); Intersymbol interference; Decoding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036566745

On the other hand, HTS conductors are extremely brittle so that the SMES with HTS coils requires special structural considerations to limit tensile stresses. We proposed the concept of the force-balanced coil (FBC) which is a helically wound toroidal coil applied to SMES. The FBC can minimize the working stresses and reduce the mass of the structure for energy storage. However, the winding of the FBC is a three-dimensional complex shape so that it may be difficult to manufacture the helical windings without a decrease in the critical current of HTS conductors. To estimate the helical winding technique problems, we designed and fabricated a small helical coil using 340 m of Ag sheathed Bi-2223 HTS tapes. This paper describes the experimental results with liquid nitrogen cooling and a solution to the helical winding technique problems in order to prevent a drop in the critical current of HTS conductors.","Bending stress; Bi-2223/Ag tapes; Helical coil; SMES; Winding tension","Bending strength; Brittleness; Cooling; Critical current density (superconductivity); Current voltage characteristics; Electric coils; Electric energy storage; Electric windings; Silver; Superconducting magnets; Superconducting tapes; Tensile stress; Bending stress; Force balanced coils; Helical winding technique; Liquid nitrogen cooling; Superconducting helical coil; Superconducting magnetic energy storage; Winding tension; High temperature superconductors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036509864

In large magnets such as the SMES magnets the stability, which is determined by several factors, e.g., conductor's cooling condition and operating current, magnet's winding structure, is a crucial problem. For the stable and compact SMES magnet development, two kA class conductors with different copper ratios were selected as candidate conductors. The effect of the cooling condition, the copper ratio, and the conductor's size upon the recovery currents was investigated experimentally. The test results indicate that the recovery current characteristics of the strands vary considerably according to their insulation method. In the fully insulated strands with a low copper ratio, the recovery current densities range from 10 to 20% of their engineering critical current densities. The recovery current density of the 30-conductor with a cooling channel is about a factor of 1.8 higher than that without a cooling channel.","Conductor's size; Cooling condition; Copper ratio; Recovery current; Superconducting magnetic energy storage device","Cooling; Copper; Critical current density (superconductivity); Electric currents; Electric energy storage; Electric insulation; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric windings; Magnetic fields; Superconducting electric lines; Superconducting magnets; Superconducting tapes; Conductor size; Cooling condition; Copper ratio; Recovery current; Superconducting magnetic energy storage; High temperature superconductors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036509850

It is shown that for the accurate prediction of the UO2 surface oxidation, it is important to know separately the rates of island nucleation and of island-radius growth. Only a certain product of these two rates can be obtained from isothermal experiments.

Thanks to their unique properties, such as tunability, full coherence, high intensity, spectral and temporal stability, they offer new opportunities for many kinds of spectroscopy: in particular, storage ring FELs are ideal sources for pump-probe experiments in conjunction with synchrotron radiation, as demonstrated by a series of studies of the nonequilibrium space charge distribution at photoexcited Si surfaces and interfaces performed at SuperACO.

We have found that, while chemisorption of individual H atoms to the external surface of the fullerenes is observed, hydrogen atoms cannot be attached to the inner wall of the structures and can only exist in a molecular form inside the fullerenes. We further find that, as a function of the symmetry of the encapsulating cavity and a delicate balance between repulsive energies among (formula presented) molecules inside the structures and those between (formula presented) molecules and the fullerene walls, molecular (formula presented) clusters of well defined shape are formed namely: linear configurations, two-dimensional zig-zag and triangular arrays, and three-dimensional structures such as octahedral and icosahedral clusters, as well as helicoidal cylindrical-shape assemblies. In the cylindrical configurations (C and BN tubes), hydrogen atoms are placed inside the structures up to a bond breakage of the fullerene network, which allow us to estimate the maximum storage capacities of the different configurations. Actually, in our closed nanotubes, we relate the bond breakage mechanism to the development of a nonuniform hydrogen accommodation along the tubes, driven by the both highly anisotropic (formula presented) and wall-(formula presented) repulsive interactions.

However, in power reactors with high burn-up, the accumulation of FP nuclides affects the neutron balance mainly due to the absorption reaction and it cannot be neglected when calculating the neutron flux of a high burn-up reactor. In this study, the lumped group constants of FP nuclides used for a fast reactor shielding calculation were computed with the JENDL-3.2 library and compiled to the JSDJ2/JFTJ2 set. The effect of considering FP nuclides on the neutron flux calculations was evaluated in the JOYO experimental fast reactor.

Such a system has been designed to supply the electricity needs of a residential user (a small residential building in a isolated village of a valley of the Alps in Italy) during a complete year of operation, without integration of traditional energy devices based on fossil fuels. A simulation in the Matlab environment has been developed to determine the energy performance of this system during a complete year of operation. The simulation of the operation of the system has been made on an hourly basis as a succession of steady states. The technical feasibility of the system will be evaluated, through the analysis of some variables (e.g. the production and consumption of electricity along the year by the different components, the production, storage and utilisation of hydrogen, etc.). The analysis will show that in a complete year nearly the 50% of the electrical load required from the final user will be given by the PEMFC, even if the micro-hydro turbine and the PV array produce a very high amount of energy. Moreover, the electricity produced by the PEMFC is the 38.5% of the input electric energy sent to the electrolyzer; this value indicates the mean annual efficiency of the conversion chain of the production and utilization of hydrogen inside this plant.

This feature is quite different from that used in the traditional block buffering technique. Simulation results show its effectiveness in terms of power consumption and energy∗delay product. The proposed TLB can reduce power consumptions by about 40%, 10%, 23%, and 23%, compared with a FA (fully associative)-TLB, a micro-TLB, a victim-TLB, and a banked-TLB respectively. Also the proposed TLB can reduce Energy∗Delay products by about 38%, 28%, 21%, and 21%, compared with a FA-TLB, a micro-TLB, a victim-TLB, and a banked-TLB respectively.

Even though it showed impressive hit/miss statistics, the scheme has not been welcomed by the industry, presumably because implementation of the original version is complex and might involve access-time penalties among other costs. This paper presents a simplified, easy to implement variant that we call ""minimally-skewed-associativity"" (MSkA). We show that MSkA caches, for many cases, should not have penalties in either access time or power consumption when compared to set-associative caches of the same associativity. Hit/miss statistics were obtained by means of trace-driven simulations. Miss ratios are not as good as those for full skewing, but they are still advantageous. Minimal-skewing is thus proposed as a way to improve the hit/miss performance of caches, often without producing access-time delays or increases in power consumption as other techniques do (for example, using higher associativities). © 2002 IEEE.","Bandwidth; Cache memory; Computer architecture; Costs; Delay; Energy consumption; Energy efficiency; Indexing; Statistics; Visualization","Bandwidth; Buffer storage; Cache memory; Costs; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Flow visualization; Indexing (of information); Statistics; Time delay; Access time; Associative cache; Associativity; Delay; Set associative cache; Skewed associative cache; Trace driven simulation; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43449130603

Capacitors are considered the most feasible energy storage for the SSC, particularly in high power applications. However, charging techniques of such Energy-Storage Capacitors (ESC) have not been reported in literature. This paper proposes and describes the self-charging technique that uses the voltage source converter of the SSC to charge its ESC. The active power, used in charging, is taken at the expense of the load active power. Thus two different cases are considered. One case considers that the phase angle of the load voltage is not allowed to jump during the charging process but the magnitude of the load voltage is reduced to 95-99% of its rated value. The other case assumes that the phase angle of the load voltage is allowed to jump. In this case, the VSC of the SSC extracts active power from the grid and injects reactive power into the grid. In both cases, a proper control algorithm is presented. PSCADEMTDC simulation verifies the validity of the proposed technique. © 2002 IEEE.","Capacitor Charging; Energy Storage; Static Series Compensator; Voltage dips","Electric power system protection; Industrial electronics; Capacitor charging; Charging techniques; Energy storage capacitor; High power applications; Self charging technique; Static series compensator; Voltage dip; Voltage source converters; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846982715

In this paper, a new control method for the matrix converter based on direct conversion approach to realize both the instantaneous output current control and reduction of the input current harmonics is proposed. The proposed method is an extension of the PWM method for conventional voltage source inverters (VSI's). Thus, the achievement of instantaneous output current control is performed as VSI's. In order to improve input current waveforms, a new switching strategy is introduced. Because the proposed control method is based on the PWM method for the conventional VSI's, it can be implemented with a simple system configuration. The results of the experiments prove the instantaneous control capability of the output current with the sinusoidal input current.","Input current harmonics; Instantaneous current control; Matrix converters; PWM method","Capacitors; Electric currents; Electric inverters; Electric potential; Harmonic analysis; Waveform analysis; Matrix converters (MC); Electric converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036445979

A major consideration in the design of such systems is the means of channeling electronic excitation from sites of light absorption to centers where it is stored or released. Storage is often achieved by driving charge separation or, for the longer term, a more complex chemical reaction whilst rapid release is commonly associated with frequency up-converted emission. In each case channeling to the conversion site generally entails a multi-step energy transfer mechanism whose efficiency is determined by the arrangement and electronic properties of the array chromophores or ions, guided in the more complex systems by a spectroscopic gradient that promotes overall directionality. The functional cascade molecules known as photoactive dendrimers are exemplars of this approach. The latest developments involve new mechanisms for concerted excitation transfer in multichromophore systems, leading towards the tailoring and exploitation of optical nonlinearities for high intensity energy pooling applications.","Dendrimers; Energy harvesting; Nonlinear optics; Optoelectronics; Photoactive materials; Photonics; Photosynthesis; Solar energy","Chromophores; Crystals; Dendrimers; Energy resources; Large scale systems; Nonlinear optics; Optoelectronic devices; Photosynthesis; Separation; Energy harvesting; Materials science",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036422106

There are three kinds of storing technologies for ozone at present: First, ozone gas is stored at high pressure in a gaseous state. As ozone is used, it is discharged from the container. Second, silica gel (which stores ozone at low temperatures) is able to adsorb ozone. When the silica gel is heated, ozone becomes detached. Third, silica gel that is stored under high atmospheric pressure can adsorb ozone. To detach ozone, the atmospheric pressure is reduced. It has been found that it is unnecessary to change the temperature and pressure inside the container when removing ozone from silica gel. This means that ozone can be detached from silica gel using very little energy. This system is proposed for storing ozone in industry, and this system is effective for Power Load Leveling.","Ozone; Ozone adsorption; Ozone storage; Power Load Leveling; Silica gel; Storage of ozone","Atmospheric pressure; Containers; Silica gel; Power load levelling; Ozone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036063117

Both cold-worked state and the stored energy at each instant of deformation depend on the deformation history. Therefore, the instantaneous rate des/dwp of energy storage seems to be an appropriate measure of the energy conversion process (wp is the work of plastic deformation). The rate of energy storage is important characteristic of the whole energy storage processes. It is a macroscopic quantity that is influenced by many microscopic mechanisms. Each of them is described by the separate internal paramenter Hi. In mathematical description, the stored energy is a function of H1,H2, H3 ..., Hn. Since there exist couplings between different mechanisms the function can not be, in general, written in the from: Σi=1nes(i) (Hi). The similar remark concerns also the energy storage rate. The present paper is devoted an answer if it is possible to distinguish the influence of the change in given internal parameter on the rate of energy storage. In order to find the answer the theoretical analysis of energy storage rate on the basis of phenomenological thermodynamics of plastic deformation was done. The theoretical description of the experimental method od stored energy determination is presented. The results of the analysis have been used to support the additive partitioning of the resultant rate of the energy stored and to show experiment which allows distinguishing the particular components. Each component represents the specific microscopic mechanism. The analysis of preliminary experimental data arrived at the conclusion that in the initial stage of plastic deformation of polycrystalline metal at least two components of the energy storage rate exist. One of them is associated with the rise of dislocation density, and another one is related to the internal stress field due to elastic accommodation of incompatible strains in the vicinity of grain boundaries.",,"Additives; Energy storage; Mathematical models; Metals; Plastic deformation; Thermodynamics; Tensile deformation; Polycrystalline materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036026006

For industrial applications, such as pulsed corona processing, a long lifetime, high repetition rate, high efficiency and high reliability are required. At the loffe Institute, an unconventional switching mechanism has been found, based on the very fast recovery process in a silicon p+p′nn+ diode. This paper describes the application of such a 'drift-step recovery diode' for high-power pulsed corona plasma generation. The principle of the diode-based nanosecond pulse generator will be discussed in detail. The generator will be coupled to a wire-plate corona reactor via a transmission-line-transformer, which has the following advantages: (i) increase of the output voltage, (ii) impedance transformation to improve the matching with the reactor, (iii) protection of the switch against reflections and mismatches, (iv) limitation of the switch current during short-circuit or breakdowns, and (v) easy coupling with a DC-bias voltage. The developed circuit has been tested at both a matched resistive load and a wire-plate pulsed corona reactor. Various ways to improve the matching with the reactor have been evaluated. We found that superposition of the pulse on a DC-bias voltage gives the best result. For example: without DC-bias, more than 50% of the energy-per-pulse reflects back to the source. However, the reflected energy is could be reduced to &lt;15% when using a DC-bias voltage of 25 kV.",,"Capacitors; Electric breakdown; Electric corona; Electric reactors; Electric transformers; Impedance matching (electric); Semiconductor diodes; Semiconductor switches; Short circuit currents; Drift-step recovery diode; Nanosecond pulse generator; Pulse corona generation; Semiconductor diode switch; Transmission line transformer; Pulse generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036999036

In this paper, we use diffractive superresolution technology to design a pure-phase plate for realizing the smaller spot size than the usual Airy spot size. We have calculated 2,3,4,5 circulation zones for optimizing the highest energy compression (Strelratio) with the constraint of the Firstzero value G=0.8. Numerical results show that the 2-circular zone pure-phase plate can yield the highest Strelratio (S=0.59) with the constraint of G=0.8. The 3-circular zone pure-phase plate with the respective phases of Φ1Φ2Φ3 has also been calculated. At the same time the 4,5 circular zone binary phase (0,π) plates are calculated to yield the result of S = 0.57 with G=0.8. The usage of the superresolution phase plate aims to realize the smaller spot size instead of the usage of the higher numerical aperture lens, which is the main advantage of this superresolution technology. Therefore, in this constraint of G=0.8, we have selected the 2-circular zone with binary phase for ease of fabrication. At last, we use a 50 nanometer fiber tip detector to scan the diffractive superresolution light spot in order to compare it with the Airy spot. Detailed experiments are presented.","Diffractive optics; Nanometer technology; Pure-phase plate; Superresolution","Constraint theory; Density (optical); Diffraction; Microscopic examination; Optical design; Optical disk storage; Optical instrument lenses; Optimization; Photodetectors; Diffractive superresolution technology; Fiber tip detector; Nanometer technology; Pure phase plate; Small diffraction spot size; Diffractive optics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036993255

The fluctuations are obtained by solving a system of nonlinear equations that are derived from the equations of energy spectra and of root mean square of the fluctuations. This method requires as many computer memories and computations as one-dimensional case even for the three dimensional calculations. It is shown that there is a strong resemblance of the simulated velocity fluctuations and experimental data. The energy spectra of these velocity fluctuations are quite accurate with less than 0.01% relative errors to the prescribed spectra. Secondly, these solutions are used to examine the capability of the vortex methods to produce turbulent flows with the prescribed parameters. It is found that although the energy spectra by the vortex method scatter to some extent, they are distributed along the prescribed spectra. It can be said that the vortex methods are able to simulate the target turbulence fairly well. Also it is found that the solutions with the LES model increase and deviate from the target spectrum at the higher frequency regions. This may suggest the nonessentiality of the LES model for the vortex method.",,"Artificial turbulence; Computer simulation; Data storage equipment; Turbulent flow; Viscosity; White noise; Vortex flow",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036383672

We find that the overdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x single crystals, even if they were single-phased immediately after a high-temperature annealing process, show progressively pronounced multiple superconducting transitions with time as they were kept at room temperature in a dry air atmosphere. The results reveal that the oxygen dopants in the crystal are still mobile at room temperature. These dopants tend to rearrange and thus form different phases, at a characteristic time scale of one or two weeks or so. Moreover, the diamagnetic loops in the newly segregated phase are very weak, presumably due to the existence of additional inhomogeneity down to a nanometer scale. Our results also show that the optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x crystals seem capable to remain in a single transition with storage time.",,"bismuth; calcium; copper; oxygen; strontium; article; conductance; crystal; energy transfer; magnetism; molecular dynamics; phase transition; room temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20744436246

In the present experiment, electron density was measured by a He-Ne laser interferometer with chordal lines-of-sight. In order to observe the motion of the plasma opening switch (POS) plasma, the electron density contours during the conduction, opening, and postopening phases were drawn by combining the results of interferometer experiments. The radial and axial motion of POS plasma was investigated from the density contours. As conduction time progressed, the POS plasma moved toward downstream. At 800 ns, which corresponds to the time of opening in the current waveform, low-density region less than 1015 cm-2 is seen at 10 mm from the cathode. After the opening was completed, the low-density gap disappeared and the shape of the corn-shape-like plasma was distorted. The interferometer experiment was followed by the additional spectroscopic experiment. The results of spectroscopic experiment were in good agreement with those of interferometer experiment.","Electron density; Inductive energy storage; Laser interferometer; Plasma opening switch; Pulsed power; Vacuum gap","Carrier concentration; Cathodes; Interferometers; Vacuum; Chordal laser interferometer; Coaxial plasma opening switch; Plasma motion; Plasma devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036826783

Rolling blackouts have become commonplace in various areas of the country. Much of this energy is supplied by old power plants, many of which have been in operation for longer than their original design life. The ever-growing population, increasingly dependent on electric energy, is fueling the demand for more electricity. This demand is being met with construction of new generating stations and innovative methods of generating electricity from existing power plants. Geosynthetic materials provide solutions to various concerns associated with electrical power generation such as groundwater contamination, disposal of spent fuel, and storage of process water. Geosynthetics have long been used in evaporation, cooling and brine ponds. However, since it may take years to build a new power plant from the ground up, geosynthetics are being used to line pumped storage ponds to help squeeze as much electricity as possible out of existing power plants. The pumped storage ponds facilitate the storage of potential energy in the form of water. As an additional feature, some pumped storage ponds are implementing floating covers to ensure that the water necessary for hydroelectric power generation does not evaporate.",,"geosynthetics; power plant; storage structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036805016

The heavy mineral assemblage of Albian to Turonian sediments reflect a narrow source rock area and short transport distances. A prominent change in the heavy mineral association of Late Cenomanian to Neogene sediments indicates enlargement of source area and longer fluvial transport distances, or longer storage of sediment within the littoral energy fence. The sudden change within the heavy mineral associations marks the transition from the late syn-rift stage to the early passive margin stage of the Southern Atlantic. During Albian to Late Cenomanian time, the basin geometry was mainly controlled by steep slopes and sediments were transported directly to the depocenter. The situation changed in Late Cenomanian time. A small shelf area developed where sediments from different sources were mixed and reworked before deposition. We believe that the W-E direction of the long-shore drift, which transports today huge quantities of near-shore sand, was established at the end of the Paleogene. This resulted from the drifting of southern West Africa across the paleoequator and subsequent change in surface wind directions.","Heavy minerals; Ivory coast; Provenance; Sediment dispersal; Southern Atlantic","Cretaceous; heavy mineral; provenance; sediment transport; sedimentary basin; source rock; Tertiary; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036773099

The extra energy, which is required for removing ozone, is unnecessary. Only the oxygen-purging step is requiied. We changed tbe temperature of the silica gel and measured the differences in the amount of stored ozone. The amount of adsorption became linear. It followed the expression of van't Hoff. We made a computer program to simulate the phenominon of the storage and removal. The results of the program demonstrated this phenomenon. We propose to use this method as a storage method for ozone. The ozone storage system, according to this principle, is comtact and inexpensive to construct. In this system, we calculated the power consumption of a sewage plant, which processes 100, 000 tons of wastewater per day. The genegation ability of the Ozonizer can be decreased approximately 40 percent by introducing the ozone storage unit.

Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is a general method for detailed modeling of scatter, but to date, fully 3D MCS-based statistical reconstruction approaches have been prohibitively slow and require internal computer memory of hundreds of Giga byte. Here, we develop computationally efficient fully 3D MCS-based reconstruction strategies by combining the following methods: (i) a dual matrix reconstruction approach is used to accelerate the reconstruction and avoid massive transition matrix pre-calculation and storage, (ii) stochastic photon transport calculation in MCS is combined with an analytic detector modeling step, in order to achieve low noise in the Monte Carlo based re-projection already after only a small number of photon histories have been tracked, and (iii) the number of photon histories simulated is kept an order of magnitude lower in early iterations than in the last couple of iterations, or alternatively, the major part of the photon histories calculated for an early iteration is re-used in later iterations.

A large proportion of resources allocated to the Community-Based Nutrition Programme (CBNP) of the Department of Health in the Western Cape is spent on crèche-feeding schemes. To date, little evaluation of the CBNP has been undertaken. Aim. A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the nutritional adequacy of meals provided, and facilities available, at state-funded crèches in the Cape Metropole. Methods. A questionnaire was administered to managers of 43 conveniently sampled crèches in two districts of Cape Town. Twenty-two of the crèches were randomly selected for nutrient assessment of a duplicate meal, and a typical meal sample was weighed and analysed for this purpose. Anthropometric measurements for a random sample of 10% of the children (N = 275) attending these 22 crèches were obtained. Results. Only one crèche did not have food preparation and storage facilities (due to theft). Toilet facilities were inadequate at some crèches. The ratio of children to toilets was 23.7 (± 16.6):1, ranging from 6.5:1 to 91:1. None of the meals provided met one-third of the age-related Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for energy, calcium, iron or phosphorus. With regard to protein, 86.4% of the meals sampled did meet one-third of the RDA for 1-3-year-olds and 68.2% for 4 - 6-year-olds. At crèches where the meals provided ≥ 15% of the RDA for energy for 4 - 6-year-olds, it was reported that a mean of R1.18 (± R0.48)/child/day was spent on food, compared with a mean of R0.89 (± R0.20)/child/day in crèches at which the meals provided < 15% of the RDA for energy (P = 0.14). According to the World Health Organisation classification of moderate undernutrition, in the age group ≤ 60 months (N = 170) there was found to be a low prevalence of stunting (7%), a moderate prevalence of underweight (16%) and a very high prevalence of wasting (11.8%). In children older than 60 months (N = 105) there was found to be a low prevalence of stunting (12.4%), underweight (8.7%) and wasting (2.9%). Conclusion. The nutritional content of meals provided at state-funded crèches in two areas of the Western Cape is largely inadequate, and is positively associated with the amount of daily spending per meal. These findings suggest that more attention should be directed towards improved training of crèche staff with regard to menu planning and food budgeting.",,"calcium; iron; phosphorus; protein; administrative personnel; age; anthropometry; article; budget; caloric intake; child care; child growth; community; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease severity; evaluation; female; financial management; food composition; food intake; food processing; food storage; health care facility; health program; human; infant; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; nutrient content; nutritional value; preschool child; prevalence; protein intake; public health service; questionnaire; resource allocation; sanitation; South Africa; staff training; world health organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036650834

So, we need to reduce the radial magnetic field components of the solenoid as much as possible to get high performance HTS magnet. In this paper we investigate various HTS coil shapes, obtained from the optimum algorithm, in which the radial magnetic field components are minimized. Three different constraints were used during optimization calculation: (1) fixed magnet volume condition, (2) fixed center magnetic field condition, and (3) maximum magnetic energy storage condition. The calculated results using those three different constraints showed almost similar shapes to one another and turned out to be effective to reduce the radial magnetic fields in the winding section. Finally, it is pointed out that two or three sectioned multi-magnet shape, which can be deduced from the calculated shape, could be more optimal to reduce the radial magnetic field in the coil, and more practical to fabricate. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A mathematical model was first described from energy conservations, in which the effects of thermal storage, the absorption of optical energy, as well as the thermal contact resistances at interfaces between materials in the PV panel were taken into consideration. Based on this model, for indoor cases, numerical analysis of heat transfer was then carried out by using a fractional scheme under the assumptions of constant physical properties, and constant efficiency of the optical energy conversion for the panel working under indoor conditions. It was found that the thermal contact resistances at interfaces play a profound role of the temperature field in a PV panel. The effect of thermal storage is rather significant for the evolution of average surface temperature and average temperature of solar cells. However, the extinction coefficient of the transparent glass cover shows just a slight influence on temperature field. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Energy conservation; Numerical analysis; Photovoltaic cells; Thermodynamic stability; Optical energy; Heat transfer; civil engineering; conservation; energy; heat transfer; mathematical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036563564

It is questioned whether this is always necessary. In different phases of the storage period the critical levels of ethylene were determined. Bulbs of eight economically important cultivars ('Apeldoorn', 'Christmas Marvel', 'Leen van der Mark', 'Monte Carlo', 'Negrita', 'Prominence', 'White Dream' and 'Yokohama') were exposed to various ethylene levels. In the first experiment bulbs were exposed to ethylene for two days shortly after harvest. Only in the cultivar 'Apeldoorn' this resulted in gummosis. In two subsequent experiments later during storage, bulbs were exposed to various ethylene levels during five weeks. Bulbs were investigated on visible internal damage, flower quality and bulb production. Damage depended on applied ethylene level, cultivar and period of storage. Research will be continued to define tolerable ethylene levels, taking into account the cultivar and the developmental stage of the bulb.","Flower bud blasting; Gummosis; Splitting; Tulipa gesneriana; Ventilation","Tulipa; Tulipa gesneriana",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958095892

Since it is radioactive, it needs to be stored in a safe but easily recoverable manner. It is an isotope of H, and hence some of the techniques used for hydrogen storage can be employed, the safest being its storage in the form of a tritide. However, in contrast to the case of hydrogen, tritium decays into (formula presented) and thus modifies the properties of the tritide. The recoil energy of (formula presented) in this decay process is very small, 1.03 eV, and not enough for atomic displacements to occur. We show in this paper, on the basis of our electronic structure calculations, that in the case of PdT, the (formula presented) produced from the radioactive decay of tritium, although not soluble in the tritide, can be easily retained, in a metastable state, in surprisingly large quantities at the octahedral interstitial sites where it is born. This can explain the expansion of the lattice parameter, the lowering of the plateau pressure, and the fragility of the tritide observed experimentally. We also find that the lowering of the plateau pressure is not entirely due to the lattice expansion as usually assumed and that electronic interactions also play a role. © 2002 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038269535

At commercial flight altitudes, as well as at sea level, the most important particle radiation is due to neutrons, created in the atmosphere by spallation of nitrogen and oxygen nuclei, induced by cosmic-ray protons. When, e.g., an electronic memory circuit is exposed to neutron radiation, charged particles can be produced in a nuclear reaction. The charge released by ionization can cause a flip of the memory content in a bit, which is called a single-event upset (SEU). A similar logic error in one of the storage registers of a microprocessor may trigger an unanticipated loop that cannot be escaped without turning the unit off. To get a deeper understanding of these phenomena, more detailed cross section information on neutron-induced charged-particle production at intermediate energies is needed. To this end, double-differential cross sections of inclusive light-ion production in silicon, induced by 95 MeV neutrons, have been measured. The experiment was performed using the MEDLEY setup, which consists of eight three-element particle telescopes, covering the angular range 20° – 160°. The charged particles were identified using ΔE - ΔE - E techniques. By using an active target, consisting of a 300 μm thick Si detector, the energy loss in the target itself could be measured and corrected for. © 2014 Atomic Energy Society of Japan.","Active silicon target; Charged-particle spectrometer array; Double-differential cross section; SEU",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010527091

Two different quantities of floor thermal mass-5-cm-thick-slab and 10-cm-thick-slab-are considered and simulations are performed for sunny or cloudy cold winter conditions. Two different thermostat setpoint profiles were considered for proportional control of the room air temperature or of the operative temperature: constant setpoint and half-sinusoid. Shutoff control based on a maximum floor surface temperature of 29°C and combined feedback-outdoor reset control were also considered. An explicit one-dimensional finite difference model was employed. Significant heating energy savings were observed due to storage of passive solar gains incident on the floor thermal storage mass, especially when a half-sinusoid setpoint profile was employed. Control of auxiliary heating based on a room effective (operative) temperature is shown to result in improved thermal comfort and higher utilization of passive solar gains as compared to room air temperature control. Outdoor reset control combined with feedback control of room temperature eliminates occurrences of uncomfortable lows but results in room overheating, especially on sunny days, and higher energy consumption as compared to proportional feedback control; shutoff control based on floor surface temperature is necessary with reset control.",,"Computer simulation; Energy conservation; Feedback control; Solar radiation; Floor heatings; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17044454678

The aim of this paper is to assess the potential and prospects of briquettes from residues of agricultural and forest/medicinal plants, which are presently used inefficiently as a source of energy. The scope is to assess the briquetting technology at manufacturing level, assess the performance of the biomass briquetting systems and briquette burning devices in Nepal, analyze selected properties of briquettes, compare briquettes with selected energy forms, and assess the potential of raw materials available for briquetting. From the study, it is evident that the potential of residues generated from agricultural and forest/medicinal plants is significant. However, there is a need to further assess their availability, method of collection and storage, chemical composition, calorific value and other characteristics, environmental implications of their utilization, and other factors. Appropriate machinery has to be developed or acquired for wider application of briquetting technology. Furthermore, there is a need for support from related organizations/institutions for developing and promoting this technology.",,"Briquets; Briquetting; Financial data processing; Plants (botany); Production; Raw materials; Societies and institutions; Biomass briquetting system; Briquette burning device; Rice husk; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041786666

In soft spin-valve cells, fast and energy-cost effective magnetization switching can be triggered by a transverse field pulse of moderate amplitude, below the in plane anisotropy field, because of an amplification effect brought by the demagnetizing field at the early stage of the reversal. The same effect is no more possible in hard nanomagnets with perpendicular easy magnetization axis. We propose a new type of nanostructured magnetic device, designed to overcome this limitation. The speed is obtained through the use of a very high effective magnetic field, obtained by incorporating a significant exchange field which stores the energy in the form of a constrained domain wall surrounding a region of high magnetic anisotropy. This stored energy is partially available to accelerate the magnetization reversal in a precessional scenario. We illustrate the concept by studying numerically a model system. The key parameter for the reversal is the ratio of the domain wall width to the structure lateral dimension. Possible routes for device preparation are discussed. Promising application to magnetic storage are anticipated.",,"Cost effectiveness; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic devices; Magnetic fields; Magnetic materials; Magnetization; Mathematical models; Hard nanomagnets; Magnetic nanostructures; Transverse field pulse; Ultrafast switching; Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038746617

Unlike existing approaches, the technique exploits the pixel correlation in video sequences, dynamically adjusting the memory bit-width to the number of bits changed per pixel. Instead of treating the data bits independently, we group the most significant bits together, activating the corresponding group of bit-lines adaptively to data variation. The method is not restricted to the specific bit-patterns nor depends on the storage phase. It works equally well on read and write accesses, as well as during precharging. Simulation results show that using this method we can reduce the total energy consumption of video memory by 20% without affecting the picture quality.","Bitwidth-compression; Frame memory; Low-power design","Computer simulation; Data structures; Dynamic random access storage; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Image coding; Image compression; Image quality; Bit width compression; Frame memory; Motion picture experts group; Pixel correlation; Video memory; Digital image storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036959491

But based on our experimentally measured data, initial distribution is not step function but has inclined slope. It leads the over estimation of the diffusion coefficient especially for low mobility lubricants. In this paper, instead of assuming initial distribution is step function and using similar solution, the diffusion coefficient is estimated by the method combining the experimentally measured results and the numerical solutions. The estimated diffusion coefficient is much lower for the low mobility lubricants. Calculated thickness distribution agrees well with the experimentally measured distribution.

The so-called pq theory has given a new definition of instantaneous reactive power, and it has been discussed and developed by many authors. In this paper, the merits and demerits of the instantaneous reactive power compensator are discussed. It is shown theoretically that applying instantaneous reactive power compensation to unbalanced three-phase systems has a serious disadvantage in that it causes third-order harmonic currents on the source side, which problem cannot be avoided. To overcome this problem the authors propose a new approach, and name it the ""quasi-instantaneous"" reactive power compensator. It compensates individual-phase reactive currents. The basic principles of the quasi-instantaneous reactive current compensator are discussed in detail, and its validity is confirmed using digital simulation. In particular the authors Show that the power factor of each phase becomes unity on the source side, but the source currents remain unbalanced when the proposed method is applied. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The ion irradiations were performed by ion projection through silicon stencil masks fabricated by silicon on insulator (SOI) membrane technology. The ion projector at the Fraunhofer Institute for Silicon Technology (ISiT) was operated at 73 keV ion energy and with a 8.7-fold demagnification. After exposure to 3 × 1014 Ar+/cm2 magnetic islands smaller than 100 nm in diameter were resolved in the Co/Pt multilayers by means of magnetic force microscopy. The impact of different ion species (He+, Ar+ and Xe+) and ion energies (10 - 200 keV) on the multilayer structure was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. The ballistic interface intermixing was used to predict magnetic coercivity changes for various irradiation conditions. The simulations revealed that with 73 keV Ar+ and Xe+ ions the irradiation dose could be reduced by a factor of 100 and 400 respectively in comparison to 73 keV He+ which was verified in the experiments. X-ray reflectivity measurements confirmed that the Co/Pt superlattice structure is slightly weakened during the irradiation and that the surface smoothness of the media is preserved.

These ICs from their processing till applications cope with irradiation damages, which are side effects of the ICs manufacturing, due to the plasma, e-beam, X-ray and implantation processing, etc. On the other hand, ICs may be submitted to a significant natural radiation level, as e.g. in applications for space satellites and airplane equipment. Therefore, a proper analysis of the IR,p degradation by high-energy irradiation in silicon technology is proposed. It is found that IR,p increases slower for low fluences of neutron irradiation as compared to the leakage of the p-n junction planar regions, so that the IR,p contribution to the total IR decreases. However IR,p still dominates in irradiated small-size junctions. Moreover, for higher fluences the IR,p again strongly increases its contribution to the overall leakage. Deep insight into the underlying physics is obtained by an analysis of the gated diodes current. This method saves test-chip area and testing-time and omits the assumption of the same parasitic leakage for all junctions. Results are reported for n+p gated diodes and p-n junctions in Czochralski, epitaxial and float zone silicon, exposed to 1 MeV fast neutrons with fluences in the range 5 × 1011-5 × 1013 n/cm2. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A site-specific QRA methodology was developed using both U.K. and U.S. guidance to produce Risk-Based Clean-up Levels (RBCLs) for benzene, and other petroleum hydrocarbons. The U.K. has no nationally based guidance on risk assessment and studies are designed by the consultant for submission to the U.K. Environment Agency (EA) for their approval. It is the EA's role to determine whether the work has been undertaken satisfactorily. To achieve these RBCLs, ex situ bioremediation was identified as the best practicable remedial option. This was carried out in windrows using mechanical aeration (to achieve oxygenation with ammonia nitrate granule and woodchip addition) for a total of approximately 5291 m3 of soil. The bioremediation process was successful in achieving the site specific RBCLs for benzene and for other hydrocarbons within an average of 5 to 6 weeks. This article describes the successful implementation of Risk-Based Corrective Action (RBCA) at this petroleum release site as a demonstration of how risk-based remedial standards for contaminated sites can be achieved with regulatory approval. © 2002 by AEHS.","Bioremediation; Petroleum soil and groundwater contamination; Risk based corrective action","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Bioremediation; Crude petroleum; Energy storage; Groundwater; Risk assessment; Soils; Petroleum soil and groundwater contamination; Risk based corrective action (RBCA); Toxic materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036026223

Densification provides advantages for the handling, storage and transport of the fibrous agricultural residues. In order to find the significant factors and determine the best operating conditions for the densification process, two experiments were carried out. In both cases, the responses measured or monitored were: density, durability and energy consumption. In the first experiment a fractional factorial design with six factors (2 6-1) was used, in which four factors were significant. With this information a second experiment was undertaken: a central composite design with seven center points. Afterwards each response was modeled and the optimum point was determined by applying a graphical method. This paper presents the statistical analysis of the experiments and the method used to optimize simultaneously the three responses. Since the response models showed inconsistencies with respect to the classical assumption of homoscedasticity in the statistical analysis, these were fitted again using weighted least squares. This procedure allowed for greater precision in the calculation of the optimum point.","Densification; Fibrous agricultural material; Optimization; Overall optimum",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41949106045

The main feature of SMES is that it has the ability to store energy and return this again to supply. The approach is based on absorbing/injecting active power energy via SMES to the induction generator terminal bus when the terminal voltage is more/less than normal voltage. The dynamic model of self-excited induction generator SEIG in synchronously reference frame is established. Also dynamic model of SMES is present. The Proportional-Integral PI controller is designed to control the absorbed and injected active power using the pole assignment approach. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed PI controlled SMES, the SEIG is subjected to different disturbances such as wind speed, load changes, and reference terminal voltage. Moreover, a comparison between the SEIG responses after application a varieties of excursions when the PI controlled SMES or PI controlled Static Var Compensator SVC is connected at SEIG terminal.

Overcharging results in excessive temperature in the battery, which degrades the chemical composition of the electrolyte. During charging, when the battery reaches end-of-charge, the energy being supplied to the battery is no longer consumed in the charge reaction and this additional energy starts dissipating as heat within the battery. At this point, the oxygen cycle accelerates, which leads to temperature rise inside the battery. State-of-the-art control technology is required to control the charging of the battery and prevent the battery going into thermal runaway.

The unique properties of such systems are millimeter to sub-millimeter spatial resolution as well as a good time and energy resolution for the hard x-ray regime above 15 keV. When dealing with fast moving heavy ions at accelerators or storage rings, this spatial resolution guarantees for a suppression of Doppler broadening without a loss of detection efficiency. Another example is the combination with a focusing crystal spectrometer, where a position-segmented detector permits the measurement of an energy spectrum wide enough to investigate the interesting energy regime simultaneously. In addition, the good energy resolution enables discrimination against background events of the recorded spectra arising from various sources. Very recently such a micro-strip detector system, developed at the Forschungszentrum Jülich, with a position resolution of close to 200 μm has become available An additional important feature of such detector systems is their sensitivity to the photon polarization at energies above 50 keV.

One is that carriers can be quickly pulled out of gate region without applying a high voltage to the gate. The other is that its ON-state voltage is very low. These features make the SI Thy especially suitable for a switch of high rep-rate inductive-energy-storage pulsed power modulators, since the switch can interrupt a current rapidly and energy loss by the switch in a conduction phase can be remarkably reduced. In this research, a high rep-rate inductive-energy-storage pulsed power modulator, which uses a high voltage Si Thy as an opening switch, has been designed and constructed for application to an induction synchroton. The maximum operating frequency of the modulator is expected to be 1 MHz. The induction synchroton accelerates bunched charged particle beams using induced electric fields, which is proportional to the time derivative of magnetic flux in a toroidal core. In order to prevent a magnetic flux of the core from saturating, it is necessary to reset the toroidal core after each acceleration pulse. Therefore, a reset circuit independent of an acceleration circuit is needed in general. However, the proposed modulator can supply both the acceleration and the reset pulses without any additional circuit and is especially suitable for an induction synchrotron accelerator.",,"Electric potential; Energy dissipation; Inductance; Thyristors; Induction synchrotron; Pulsed power modulator; Modulators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036999068

This is done by casting the retrieval process of the model with graded response neurons, into the framework of a diffusive process governed by the Fokker-Plank equation, which leads to a Langevin system describing the process at a microscopic level, while the time evolution of the probability density function is governed by a multivariate Fokker Planck equation operating over the space of all possible activation patterns. The present unified approach has two notable features: (i) greater biological plausibility and (ii) ability to escape local minima of energy (associated with spurious memories), which makes it a potential tool for those complex optimization problems for which the previous models failed.","Associative memory; Fokker-Planck equation; Graded response; Hopfield model; Stochastic dynamics","Asymptotic stability; Computer simulation; Neural networks; Numerical methods; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Random processes; Biologically plausible associative memory; Continuous unit response; Fokker-Planck equation; Graded response; Hopfield model; Stochastic dynamics; Associative storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036966811

Schwerionenforsch.-Darmstadt, D-64291 Darmstadt, Germany","In heavy ion fusion, the compression of the DT pellet requires high intensity beams of ions in the gigaelectron volt energy range. Charge-changing collisions due to intrabeam scattering can have a high impact on the design of adequate accelerator and storage rings. Not only do intensity losses have to be taken into account, but also the deposition of energy on the beam lines after bending magnets, for example, may be nonnegligible. The center-of-mass energy for these intrabeam collisions is typically in the kiloelectron volt range for beam energies in the order of several gigaelectron volts. In this article, we present experimental cross sections for charge transfer and ionization in homonuclear collisions of Ar4+, Kr4+, and Xe4+, and for charge transfer only in homonuclear collisions of Pb4+ and Bi4+. Using a hypothetical 100-Tm synchrotron as an example, expected particle losses are calculated based on the experimental data. The results are compared with expectations for singly charged Bi+ ions, which are usually considered for heavy ion fusion.","Charge transfer; Heavy ion fusion; Ionization","Accelerator magnets; Charge transfer; Energy dissipation; Ion beam assisted deposition; Ion beams; Ionization; Scattering; Storage rings; Synchrotrons; Heavy ion fusion; Heavy ions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036945285

In light of such circumstances, the High Pressure Institute of Japan (HPI) has prescribed its code ""Assessment procedure for crack-like flaws in pressure equipment"" for conducting quantitative safety evaluations of flaws detected in common industrial pressure components such as pressure vessels, piping, storage tanks, and so on designed and fabricated in accordance with Japanese codes and regulations such as JIS B8265 and High Pressure Gas Safety Law. The FFS code consists of Level 1 assessment (whereby assessment can be conducted without extensive knowledge of fracture mechanics) and Level 2 assessment (which enables more detailed fracture mechanics analyses and is currently being studied). The allowable flaw size is specified in accordance with the plate thickness. The required impact absorbed energies based on material strength, whether or not PWHT has been done and the orientation of the flaw in relation to the weld seam, are also specified. An approximated equation of stress intensity factor for an embedded flaw near the surface has been derived. The re-characterization procedure for assessing an embedded flaw has been clarified.

These shortages were attributed mainly to foreign exchange shortages and alleged mismanagement and corruption at the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe (NOCZIM). As shortages intensified, problems of product shortage began to unfold, which adversely impacted on the urban poor. The public began to question the industry's policies on the sustainability of the liquid fuel sector policies in Zimbabwe. Of particular concern was policies regarding regulatory mechanisms, pricing, distribution, utilisation of storage facilities, supply routes and NOCZIM management.

Compared with other crystals used as volume holographic storage media, it has a great merit that an image recording does not erase the recorded one in multiplex storage process. But its photorefractive effect appears weaker than other crystals in the same conditions. We doped photorefractive sensitizing element Ce into Pr:LibNO3 to get Ce:Pr:LiNbO3 crystal with Czochralski method. The structure of crystals has been determined by X-ray powder diffraction method. The results indicate Pr:LiNbO3 and Ce:Pr:LiNbO3 keep the same structural characteristics as pure lithium niobate. In the absorption spectra of Pr:LiNbO3 and Ce:Pr:LiNbO3 samples with non-polarized light in wavelength of 300-900nm, the absorption edge of Ce:Pr:LiNbO3 shifts to the red compared with that of Pr:LiNbO3.The diffraction efficiency, writing time and especially erasing time of Ce:Pr:LiNbO3 have been measured.

The dryer reduced the moisture content of fresh maize to the safe storage level of 12% (wb) within 12 hours resulting in 98% viability of dried maize. Yam chips required the same time to loose 29.62% of moisture, bringing it to the safe storage moisture level of 14.21%.

The sensory evaluation of dried product shows a more acceptable, neat and spore less food materials when compared with the sun-dried ones. By controlling the temperature and environmental air condition of the drying chamber, it was possible to retain a good proportion of the natural taste, odor, flavor and color of the dried product.

O. Kuntze in pure culture have produced interesting new data. To investigate the response of phosphate metabolism to a change in external monovalent cations, samples were exposed to a Hoagland solution containing different monovalent cations Li+, Na+, K+, or Rb+ at 10 mM concentration. A method of nutrient cycling during analysis where the cation was changed and the phosphate kept constant allowed us to determine the kinetics of phosphate accumulation, storage and incorporation into polyphosphate following exposure to the range of test cations. Different external monovalent cations had different effects upon changes in the content of both phosphate and polyphosphate. Treatment with Li+, Na+, or Rb+ resulted in a change in phosphate accumulation to 60, 73, and 107% and in content of the intracellular mobile polyphosphate (polyP) to 119, 112, and 94%, respectively, compared with the control taken as 100%. The effect of each cation is related to its position in the periodic table. Reversing this process, i.e., exchanging with K+, returned phosphate metabolism to normal. Although, the increase in depolarization of the cell membrane should affect the internal pH, fungal metabolism using energy requiring mechanisms appeared necessary to maintain the intracellular pH, Thus, increasing contents of mobile polyp were the consequence of an increasing energy demand. On the other hand, the increasing depolarization of the cell membrane following the sequence Rb+ &lt; K+ &lt; Na+ &lt; Li+ inhibited the net Pi accumulation. Furthermore, it is postulated that the Pi accumulation was also regulated by the intra-cellular content in poly P.","Ectomycorrhizal fungus; Monovalent cations; NMR; Phosphate accumulation; Polyphosphate; Suillus bovinus","Cell culture; Cell membranes; Metabolism; Nuclear magnetic resonance; pH effects; Phosphates; Positive ions; Rate constants; Solutions; Monovalent cations; Fungi; Fungi; Suillus; Suillus bovinus; monovalent cation; polyphosphate; article; Basidiomycetes; drug effect; ion transport; kinetics; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pH; Basidiomycota; Cations, Monovalent; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ion Transport; Kinetics; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Polyphosphates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036558375

This article shows the mechanical structure design of the cryogen-free SWLS. The three pairs of coils are supported in an aluminum-reinforced block and bonded by two iron return yokes. The poles are fixed to the return yoke and will move with the yoke. The finite element method is used to evaluate the stresses caused from the thermal contraction of materials and the coil's Lorentz force. The simulation result shows that the thermal stress of coil from 293 K to 4.2 K is too large and will cause the failure of the coil if the poles, the coils, and the aluminum support are all fixed together. The stress level is not reduced even the soft material is placed among the interfaces of these different parts. The reduction of the stress level is achieved by leaving a suitable clearance among these interfaces and allowing relative sliding motion between the return yoke and the coil, and between the coil and the aluminum support. Analysis results show that such a design will reduce the stress to a level of two to three times less.","Mechanical design; Stress; Superconducting magnet; Thermal contraction","Aluminum alloys; Computer simulation; Design; Finite element method; Heat conduction; Iron; Light sources; Storage rings; Stresses; Synchrotron radiation; Thermal stress; Thermodynamic properties; Mechanical design; Superconducting coil; Superconducting wavelength shifter; Thermal contraction; Superconducting magnets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036510073

With higher fuel costs and requirements to reduce engine exhaust emissions, new hydraulic system configurations should be considered. Traditional hydraulic systems conssume an excessive amount of energy due to metering losses. A single pump usually supplies flow to multiple functions, with differing flow and pressure requirements resulting in excessive metering losses. The energy of mass and inertial loads is usually dissipated by metering losses. Opportunities exist for reducing metering losses by the use of multiple pumps and by using hydrostatic control of individual functions. Hydrostatic control also allows for energy recovery when used in conjunction with an energy storage system. These alternative configurations have the potential of reducing engine size and reducing emissions by reduced transients and lower overall power requirement. This paper will discuss the source of hydraulic system losses and recommend alternative configurations that can result in dramatic reductions in energy requirements. A dynamic simulation of an example machine will be presented with an improved hydraulic system, illustrating the potential for reduced losses and the ability to accomplish the same functionality and control performance. The benefits of the alternative configuration will be analyzed in comparison to the costs.

Different concepts are presented, built on fuel, electrical or thermal energy storage. A comparison is provided, showing that the latter should be preferred. The biggest remaining issue for long stops is storage itself.

The CO 2 , sealed by several thin shale layers, has modified the impedance contrast and thereby created visible time-lapse effects on the seismic. These thin CO 2 “clouds” are mapped in detail from the time-lapse seismic data (1994, 1999 and 2001) using Spectral Energy Difference (SED) attributes. From these attributes, linear structures interpreted as flow boundaries become apparent inside some of the clouds. Observations of old (non-injected) gas accumulations in the overburden where mapped by an attribute classification. Motivated by positions of potentially deformed zones above highly compacted mud volcanoes, possible gas leakage paths from the deeper Sleipner Field was investigated. Leakage paths through the thick shale layers in the overburden are important regarding the future distribution of CO 2 . No obvious leakage correlation was found. Instead, old gas in the overburden seems to be trapped in glacial related sediments and structures. © 2002 SEG Annual Meeting.

Thus, understanding the dielectric and electrical properties under an ac signal drive in these antiferroelectric thin-film compositions, such as lead zirconate thin films, and the effect of donor doping on them is very necessary. For this purpose, thin films of antiferroelectric lead zirconate and La-modified lead zirconate thin films with mole % concentrations of 0, 3, 5, and 9 have been deposited by pulsed excimer laser ablation. The dielectric and hysteresis properties have confirmed that with a gradual increase of the La content, the room-temperature antiferroelectric lead zirconate thin films can be modified into ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. ac electrical studies revealed that the polaronic related hopping conduction is responsible for the charge transport phenomenon in these films. With a La content of 3 mole % in pure lead zirconate, the conductivity of the films has been reduced and followed by an increase of its conductivity for a 3% addition of La to lead zirconate thin films. The polaronic activation energies are also found to follow a similar trend as that of the conductivity. © 2002 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038342294

For this purpose the representation of the Kerr effect in the complex rotation-ellipticity plane is introduced. A depth sensitivity function controlling the Kerr effect is defined and its dependence on the photon energy and angle of incidence is studied. A general way to determine the in-depth location of the FM layer, from which the Kerr signal originates, is proposed. In the case of a FM bilayer structure, previous proposed solutions are discussed within a unified formalism. For a system with three or more FM layers two approaches are proposed to extract selectively the magneto-optical signals originating at individual FM layers: the parallel Kerr vector and cascade numerical projection methods. These methods are successively checked experimentally on simple multilayer structures. Finally, on the basis of the developed approaches a readout solution for multivalued magneto-optical recording in a four-storage-layer structure is proposed. © 2002 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038291964

The radiative decay of the two lowest pure breathing levels [Formula Presented] and [Formula Presented] is seen to be considerably faster than expected from rotationless calculations.

The results show that the proposed technique allows immediate power and area-time savings of existing designs rather than exploring potential benefits by a new logic design to the problem using the classic pipeline clocking mechanism. © 2002 IEEE.","Circuit synthesis; Clocks; Computer science; Cybernetics; Design engineering; Energy consumption; Field programmable gate arrays; Logic design; Pipelines; Proposals","Clocks; Computer science; Cybernetics; Energy utilization; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Logic circuits; Logic design; Logic Synthesis; Microprocessor chips; Pipelines; Systems analysis; Alternative systems; Circuit synthesis; Design effort; Design Engineering; Original design; Potential benefits; Proposals; Storage elements; Design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949655082

Taking time-resolved pictures of imploding plasma and observing x-ray signals, it was investigated that how the wire-array implodes for the different current rise times. For the x-ray diagnostics, the X-ray diode (XRD) and the diamond detector were used. When the current rise time is slow, the peaks of XRD and diamond detector were observed at the different time. In the time-resolved picture, the implosion of precursor plasma was observed followed by the main implosion. The strong kink instability was observed when the pinched plasma was completely created. When the current rise time is fast, no kink instability was observed. However, the implosion did not fully cover between the electrodes.

As a consequence and considering that unity power factor is not required, many alternatives to the classical two-stage approach have been proposed reducing the cost of the power supply, especially in low power applications. The recent publication of the Amendment 14, that modifies the definition of the Class D of EN61000-3-2, may change the scope again. In this paper, a new AC/DC converter is proposed. This converter has been designed to improve the efficiency over the classical two-stage approach by improving the. energy management. Thus, output power is processed 1.2 times instead of twice. Moreover, the voltage on the storage capacitor is not very sensitive to input voltage variations making easy the optimisation of the converter. The line current has been analysed and a trade-off between efficiency and distortion has been found. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Economic and social effects; Industrial electronics; Ac/dc converters; High-efficiency; Input voltages; Low power application; PFC converters; Storage capacitor; Two stage approach; Unity power factor; Rectifying circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950875318

These two kinds of energy have specific environmental impacts and constraints which are briefly discussed. A significant contribution of renewable energies implies that large land areas and a good energy storage technology are available while nuclear energy cannot be sufficiently extended using the present PWR reactor technology.

The total net number of etched-track pits of the present detector was 75 ± 15 when used for measuring an effective dose of natural background level neutrons for 1 mo, which gives enough counting statistics. The method can thus be applied for monitoring the effective dose of neutrons around nuclear sites and high-energy accelerator facilities.","Detector, etched-track; Dose equivalent; Monitoring, environmental; Neutrons","polycarbonate; radon; article; artifact; dose response; electrochemical analysis; energy; environmental monitoring; film; measurement; neutron; neutron dosimetry; priority journal; radiation detector; radioactive waste processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036778452

On one hand, this methodology has to be generic; on the other hand, the proposed methods of environmental impact assessment must be applicable for each specific situation. We have reinterpreted the ISO environmental monitoring model in terms of remote sensing survey and GIS models. Besides storage of the scalable earth surface and underground information, the methodology and suggested software tools allow for the modelling of the interaction between engineering objects and the environment during full life cycle of oil and gas fields starting from their exploration until their abandonment. The remote sensing methods reviewed in this article, as well as the suggested methodology, can be applied for a wide range of targets in different regions.

Long-term storage of assets, exposure to harsh environments, and requirements for high reliability with minimum field checks are significant concerns for Army missiles and munitions. These concerns warrant investigation into new and advanced techniques that provide health monitoring and prognostics capability, as well as robust design. In the past, missiles and munitions were commonly stored for long periods of time within the various military depot environments. In the present Army, however, missiles and munitions can expect deployment into a theater of operations and subsequent return to stocks for a potential future deployment. These deployments are expected to occur several times during an asset's life cycle, with extremes being experienced for each deployment due to handling, transportation, and theater storage. Therefore, the potential detrimental affects which a missile and/or munition will likely encounter must be understood and accounted for in its design and fielding so that its war fighting capability and readiness can be assured. Ultrahigh reliability of weapon systems is a critical requirement for the transformed Army to quickly enable a lethal and decisive battle force. This presentation will define ultra-reliability as it relates to missiles and munitions. Approaches to achieving ultra-reliability will be discussed, including joint efforts by the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy in modeling materials aging phenomena.","Diagnostics; Missiles; Prognostics; Reliability; Soldering","Ammunition; Computer simulation; Military applications; Missiles; Reliability; Systems analysis; Prognostics; Software Package PRISM; Ultrahigh reliability; Computer systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036446270

This new VD-S2PFC provides a reduction (by half) of the total voltage drop due to diodes conducting at the same time from the line input to the energy-storage capacitors. Moreover, the size of the additional inductors used to shape the line current is dramatically reduced due to the fact that these inductors form part of an additional output of the main dc-to-dc converter, which is based on a full-wave rectifier and, therefore, these inductors are operating at twice the converter switching frequency and with a higher duty cycle than in the case of being based on a half-wave rectifier, as in some previous cases. The experimental results show that both inductors can be built into two E20 cores for a 100 W, 62 Vdc prototype. The voltage across the series connection of both energy-storage capacitors is lower than 500V and the total efficiency of this prototype is 92-90%.",,"Capacitance; Capacitor storage; Electric converters; Electric currents; Electric inductors; Electric potential; Electric rectifiers; Semiconductor diodes; Voltage control; Full wave rectifier; Single stage power factor corrector; Voltage drop; Electric power factor correction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036442957

According to the magnitude of the load resistance and the circuit characteristic impedance, the load current or capacitor voltage may swing or not. The current or voltage oscillation is often not allowed due to the load property or the voltage reversal limit of the energy storage capacitors. Crowbar circuits are inserted for the suppression of the oscillation in these cases. Usually diodes are used as a crowbar switch but when the system voltage and current become high it is not a practical system because the cost of the diodes goes up enormously. A novel crowbar scheme using a spark gap or vacuum gap switch which was triggered at a proper time after the current peak was proposed, implemented and tested. A Rogowski coil was used for sensing the current peak. Because the output of a Rogowski coil shows generally the time derivative of the current waveform, a diode inserted in parallel to the output signal can clamp the positive part of the induced voltage signal of the Rogowski coil. When the voltage arrives at a proper negative value, a square pulse voltage signal of 15V which triggers the trigger generator for the gap switch for crowbarring can be produced through an amplifier circuit. The implemented circuit shows successful crowbarring actions at a RLC circuit of 1236 uF, 160 uH, 100 mOhm with the capacitor charged up to 17 kV, the peak current of 34 kA and the capacitor voltage reversal of 1.8 kV.",,"Amplifiers (electronic); Circuit oscillations; Diodes; Electric coils; Electric currents; Electric potential; Electric spark gaps; Electric waveforms; Equivalent circuits; Semiconductor switches; Crowbar circuit; Crowbar scheme; Rogowski coil; Vacuum gap; Capacitor storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036367785

J3X 1S1, Canada","In the last decade, the mechanical alloying and mechanical grinding techniques have been used extensively to synthesise or modify hydrogen storage materials in an attempt to improve their hydrogen sorption properties. Since hydrogen diffusion through grain boundaries is usually much faster than in the bulk and since calculations show that the H/M ratio in metallic clusters containing hydrogen can reach high values when the size of clusters is reduced to the nanometer scale, one was hoping that ball milled nanocrystalline metal hydrides could have better absorption/desorption kinetics as well as improved storage capacity. The kinetics and the activation are improved in most cases but we usually observe a loss in capacity in as-milled AB, AB5 and AB2 hydrogen storage systems. For Mg-based hydrides, however, the loss of capacity is negligible. The loss of storage capacity is usually attributed to structural disorder which could be topological or chemical in nature. For instance, the loss of capacity and the change in the equilibrium plateau pressure in ball-milled nanocrystalline FeTi was attributed to amorphous grain boundary phases. Fortunately, this loss of capacity can be recovered by thermal treatment at relatively low temperature. In this paper, we report and compare the hydrogen storage properties of mechanically treated low and high temperature metal hydride systems and discuss the influence of structural disorder, microstrain and grain size on properties.","Hydrogen storage; Mechanical alloying MA; Metal hydrides; Nanocrystalline materials","Activation energy; Alloys; Comminution; Grain boundaries; Grain size and shape; Hydrogen; Mechanical alloying; Nanostructured materials; Reaction kinetics; Sorption; Synthesis (chemical); Hydrogen storage alloys; Hydrogenation decrepitation; Mechanical grinding alloys; Mechanosynthesis; Structural disorder; Hydrides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036172909

These storage fields consist of a network of storage wells connected via a series of short pipeline laterals and headers. Typical field configuration consists of one or two main headers with several laterals branching off to the gas storage wells. Due to the shorter line lengths (2.5 miles or less) and other operational conflicts, it is difficult to utilize conventional online smart pigging methods to assess the integrity of these laterals and headers. Based on the type (welded steel), average age, and operating conditions of the pipelines in these storage fields, an internal inspection method was desired. Consumers Energy has teamed with Baker Atlas to utilize their Vertiline wire conveyed MFL (magnetic flux leakage) smart tools to assess the integrity of these gas storage field headers and laterals. The Vertiline technology was originally conceived for down hole well casing integrity analysis, however, the application was found to be ideal for short section, limited access, and otherwise unpiggable pipelines. The Baker Vertiline technology can currently be used on pipeline sizes up to 24"" in diameter, and larger diameter tools are under development. This paper will explore the process that Consumers Energy undertook to utilize wire conveyed MFL smart tools in its gas storage field pipelines. Field preparation for tool runs, running the tool and gathering data, and data presentation will all be reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages, techniques, capabilities, and technology of the wire conveyed MFL smart tools themselves will also be discussed, along with other potential applications such as use in analysis of pipeline river crossings, pipelines lacking pig launching facilities, and offshore production lines.",,"Natural gas storage fields; Gas fuel storage; Inspection; Natural gas pipelines; Natural gas wells; Welded steel structures; Gas pipelines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036431175

In order to meet the growing demand for petroleum, additional refining capacity is planned to be created involving augmentation of some of the existing refineries and construction of new refineries. While the refineries will be in a position to meet the demand of petroleum products, the critical and vital issue will be to supply crude oil to the refineries and to reach the products to various consumption centers in an efficient, reliable and cost effective manner. In addition to the liquid petroleum, Natural Gas is emerging as the major source of energy/feedstock. Infrastructure for storage and transportation of Natural Gas are also required to be set up in a big way to meet the projected demand. This can best be done by constructing new pipelines which are recognized worldwide as the most reliable and cost effective mode of transportation of oil and gas. In addition to the requirement for new pipelines, there is a need for upgradation of technology in the existing cross-country pipelines, many of which are more than 20 years old. Moreover, Indian Government has, as part of the process of liberalisation of the economy through a series of measures focused on the infrastructural developments, technology upgradation, trade policies and financial reforms, has opened the core sector of Petroleum to private investment. Thus, considerable scope exists not only for consultants, equipment and material manufacturers/suppliers and contractors for providing their services but also for making investments in the Indian pipeline industry.

An expander cycle was chosen for the engine. The two turbines are arranged in series and the energy to drive the turbines is provided by the hydrogen that is cooling the combustion chamber wall. The engine will be qualified in 2005. Today the turbines have been accepted in concept reviews in 1999 and in the preliminary design review during 2001. With use of Vulcain experience and Volvo experience from other internal programs cost cutting production techniques were chosen. The reduction of development cost and lead-time lead to an increase concurrent work not only at Volvo but also together with costumers and suppliers compared with Vulcain experience. The requirements on very low production cost with full reliability gave the need to incorporate the lessons learned from Vulcain together with focus on the necessary new technologies. During the conceptual phase design-to-cost approach was used to have a good balance between performance and production cost. Similar basic concept choices are chosen for both LOX and LH2 turbines so maximum know how transfer is obtained. Material choices are made identical where it is possible. Cost optimized manufacturing methods are applied and turbines with radial milled unshrouded rotor blisk and radial milled stator with brazed shroud is the result. Inlet manifold is a casting, integrated with the pump, with a varying cross-sectional area to achieve a low tangential pressure variation at the stator inlet. On the hydrogen turbine, an exhaust duct without guide vanes is chosen, and for the oxygen turbine a mainfold is chosen due to geometrical restriction and also to take care of the outlet swirl. To support the concept choice a demonstration program was performed. Different turbine stage geometries were tested for performance in air. Shrouded and unshrouded rotor blades were tested with different tip clearances. Velocity mapping using Laser Doppler technique and a series of CFD analysis completed the test campaign Verification by material test in hydrogen was performed very early in the program in order to justify the choice of material. A modal test with damping measurements has been completed in rotor alone installation with the Vinci LH2 blisk. The mechanical design has been justified with FE analysis and design criteria according to Vulcain experience. The blisk high cycle fatigue resistance has been verified by a system of analyses and tests including unsteady flow analysis and FE analysis. Manufacturing technologies have been developed and evaluated early for the concept and manufacturing process choices. This and the early design-tocost approach required concurrent engineering with all design and manufacturing engineers working in the same office. A new CAD program made it also possible to have a master model with all manufacturing steps collected in a data base and from this drawings, manufacturing sheets, NC programs and analysis models are taken. © 2002 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Unlike existing approaches, the technique exploits the pixel correlation in video sequences, dynamically adjusting the memory bit-width to the number of bits changed per pixel. Instead of treating the data bits independently, we group the most significant bits together, activating the corresponding group of bit-lines adaptively to data variation. The method is not restricted to the specific bit-patterns nor depends on the storage phase. It works equally well on read and write accesses, as well as during precharging.

Initially, the savings in energy were achieved through development of more energy efficient equipment and processes. However, once reaching the limits to these options, the focus of the cost and energy reduction efforts switched over to the possibilities of energy management and power peak control. Reduction of peak power demand has a significantly positive impacton environment, because in the most countries, the peak power is generated using fossil fuels. To assist customers in peak power demand control, the Swedish company MIC, which was a subsidiary of electricity generating company Sydkraft, developed an Energy Control System (ECS). The main feature of this system, approaching the energy optimization problem in several different ways, is control of peak power, which enables the customers to achieve stable, smooth power consumption and through that lower the fixed energy costs. The other important parts of the system are the capabilities for internal measuring, scheduling and alarm handling. Because the system is object oriented and modular in hardware, software as well as in handling and configuration, it provides the advantage of flexibility, enabling easy expansions and modification. As of today, the system, which is described in this paper, has been installed in approximately 150 industrial plants and facilities in Sweden and successfully marketed in USA, Germany and New Zealand. The customer base is wide, ranging from large pulp mills, steel plants to smaller energy consumers such as foundries, cool storages and commercial and residential buildings.",,"Electricity; Iron and steel industry; Optimization; Power control; Problem solving; Alarm handling; Energy consumers; Energy control system (ECS); Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751271835

This is a domain of todays high-performance computers. A fast three dimensional parallel Finite-Difference algorithm with time dependent mesh refinement is developed to analyse and visualise the complex behavior of traveling waves in transient dynamics and acoustics. The propagation of mechanical waves is characterized by the change and interaction of strain energy and kinetic energy in space and time. According to this, the presented algorithm is based on the solution of the three-dimensional wave equation as a first order formulation in terms of stresses and velocities or acoustic pressure and particle velocity, representing both forms of energy in a direct way. Using explicit time integration and lumped mass description the equations of all nodes of the FD-method are decoupled. This leads to a very efficient algorithm, inherent parallel, and best suited to all kinds of parallel computing. The parallel FD-program is implemented on a 16 processor CRAY T3E parallel computer with distributed memory. The parallel efficiency of the algorithm and the efficiency of the time dependent mesh refinement are examined.

The main influence of this is related to economics and connected with energy production, storage and utilisation. Due to such industrial problems, international collaborative researches become necessary. From the point of electrodes consideration, materials must be light and give high cell voltage and capacity. Therefore, thin-film technology may be one of the best solutions. Thin-film technique reduces the internal resistance of solid state battery. Its application provides various advantages over other techniques using bulk materials. For example, thinning of layers to give lower electric resistance in the transverse direction, provide a clean surface for the compound, improve the electrode -electrolyte interface contact, make film deposition of alkali metals easier, give good adhesion between layers, etc. Establishment of a reliable process of thin-film microbatteries fabrication would make them available for their use as power sources in integrated circuits. Some important fast-ionic conductors (solid electrolytes) are the iron compounds such as PbF2, iodine compounds such as RbAg 4I5 and LiI. Using thin-film for solid state electrodes offers certain significant advantages over their crystalline counterpart, such as easy to synthesise, easy to implement, larger electrochemically active surface, high diffusion coefficient of the mobile ion, a large number of available sites for the intercalants, etc. Two systems of amorphous materials are currently used, the semiconducting oxide-based glasses such as V 2O5, WO3, MoO3, and the amorphous chalcogenides, such as MoS2, MoS3, V2S 5, NiPS3. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Electric batteries; Electric resistance; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Iron compounds; Thin films; Amorphous chalcogenides; Semiconducting oxide-based glasses; Thin film technology; Thin-film microbatteries fabrication; Solid state devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844520413

Conventionally low temperature fusing is realized by reducing the molar mass of the binder polymer. In parallel with a reduced melt viscosity the glass transitions temperature Tg decreases resulting in a poor storage ability. This phenomenon is reviewed for typical toner binder resins like styrene acrylics and polyester and compared to cyclo-olefin-copolymers COC derived from ethylene and norbonene (trade name: Topas® of Ticona, Germany). For these new materials the glass transition temperature is easily adjusted by incorporating different amounts of the cyclic olefin into the polymer meaning that the Tg of COC can be controlled independently of molar mass. Thus an optimum balance between low melt viscosity necessary for low temperature fusing and excellent anti blocking properties is obtained. In addition Topas® COC binder resins offer a unique combination of surface, electrical, mechanical and environmental friendly properties which is ideal for using these material as toner binder resins.",,"Binders; Energy utilization; Glass transition; Low temperature effects; Photography; Resins; Molar mass; Toner binder resins; Printing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442328247

In this method, the constant rewriting is conducted in the normal state or dropout state, so this data restoring is inefficient in terms of the restoring speed and the energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a dynamic dropout data restoring technique in the FTHM. In this dynamic technique, the strength of the rewriting effect change in proportion to dropout level, i.e. if dropout level becomes large, the strength of the rewriting effect also becomes large automatically. Therefore, this dynamic technique can improve the restoring speed and reduce the energy consumption for restoring. First, we analyze the temporal response of the output efficiency and the hologram.

Both phenomenological models and experimental interpretations of optical absorption bands, tentatively associated with F-type (electron) centres created by X-ray or electron irradiation , is reviewed. Interpretation of three radiative processes (super-fast core-valence transitions, slow trapped exciton luminescence and luminescence of structure defects) observed in undoped LiBaF3 crystals is analysed with respect to practical application. Attention is paid to the behaviour of ultraviolet emission so far ascribed to self-trapped exciton luminescence and also observed as a result of electron recombination with localized hole at various temperatures (even at room temperature), depending on crystal purity and growth conditions. Finally, some aspects of ionic processes in thermal relaxation of defects are pointed to.","Absorption; Color centers; Excitons; LiBaF3 crystals; Luminescence","Color; Electron irradiation; Excitons; Light absorption; Lithium compounds; Perovskite; Photolithography; Ultraviolet radiation; X rays; Electronic excitations; Fluorescence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344513353

The influence of the roll speed, the linear load, and the coating suspension on the measured pressure profile was studied. The influence of the roll speed on the measured pressure profile was found to be minimal, whereas the effect of the linear load was evident. Even though the pressure profile was measured under the roll cover material the measured values were relatively high. This sets high requirements for the roll cover materials. Strain profiles of the roll cover material in the nip contacts and the heat build-up of the cover material during the coating process were measured with strain gauges and thermocouples installed inside the roll cover material. It was observed that the temperature of the roll cover material increased several tens of degrees depending on both the linear load and the machine speed. Such a temperature increase has a distinct effect on the dynamic mechanical properties of the roll cover material and thus probably on the whole coating process. The measured strain profiles of the roll cover material in the nip contacts were consistent and correlated realistically with the pressure profile and temperature measurements.",,"Coatings; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Energy storage; Strain gages; Viscoelasticity; Roll covers; Paper; Coatings; Paper; Strain Gages; Viscoelasticity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242365333

As the temperature is decreased below about 0.5 K, the UCN density shows a saturation behavior because of no significant up-scattering and UCN loss by neutron β-decay only. Single down-scattering of a 1-meV neutron and also multiple scattering of a higher-energy neutron contribute largely to UCN production.

Apart from the performance improvement, higher specific impulse and a lower flame temperature, requirements for safe production, storage and storage lifetime can be mentioned. At TNO-PML gun propellant compositions have been developed and investigated over the years. A number of compositions have been evaluated for their energy content and ballistic performance. A selected number have been produced on a small scale and tested. Some compositions have been produced with a twin screw extruder and underwent full scale testing. The paper describes process modelling and processing safety aspects of laboratory scale processing. Furthermore the internal ballistic and performance characterisation and safety properties of the LOVA propellants that are under development will be presented.

However, beam parameters at the target are decreased because of extreme transverse heating and growth of the beam momentum spread due to intrabeam scattering. These effects can be suppressed by application of the electron cooling system (ECS). Design study of ECS has been performed in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The design project and characteristics of the system are described, as well as analysis of the accumulation kinetics in the presence of the cooling system. Design work has shown that because of the small length of the straight section (2.35 m), the effective length of the cooling system is small (about 55-60 cm). Nevertheless, for long accumulation times (>100 s), the system allows us to significantly improve the beam parameters at the target (specific energy, specific power, and so on) and to suppress the beam losses by an order of magnitude.","Electron cooling systems; Intrabeam scattering; Ion accumulation; Nonlinear resonances","Compaction; Cooling systems; Electromagnetic wave scattering; Electron resonance; Electrons; Heating; Plasmas; Reaction kinetics; Storage rings; Electron cooling systems; Ion beams",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036950113

Also the rising prices of all fuels should be taken into account. Since energy consumption will increase in the future, the possibility of using renewable energy resources and rational energy use are investigated. The quality of energy exploitation can be increased by storing thermal energy in different types of storage. This is especially important for waste heat from industrial processes, which is usually thrown away. This heat can be efficiently used in low-temperature heating systems. The same holds true for heat from condensing units of air-conditioning systems. One of the solutions is thermal energy storage in seasonal storage, where aquifers are one of the possibilities. Since they are very large, the amount of heat that can be stored is very high. The paper gives a review of thermal energy storage methods in aquifers, describes such storage in the world with a basic mathematical description of the processes in aquifers, and presents the possibilities of use in Slovenia. © 2002 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

The main application of this ring is the generation of a monoenergetic and directed flux of positronium atoms and its use in experiments. Positronium is generated in interactions of positrons, circulating inside a storage ring accumulator, with free electrons of the cooling electron beam that have velocities very close to the positron velocities. This allows us to obtain a high positronium flux with small angular and velocity spreads of the atoms and provides a significant advantage for the proposed arrangement of experiments, so-called positronium-in-flight setups, as compared with traditional approaches in which positronium was generated in targets. In particular, the precision in measuring positronium parameters (lifetime, the probability of decays with momentum conservation, charge invariant violation (CPT violation), fine structure of the positronium spectrum, and Lamb-shift measurements) can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, some experiments that are unrealistic within traditional schemes become feasible with the proposed facility.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036882822

Some disadvantages of multiple connected inverters, such as harmonic current flowing from an inverter unit to the other one, and increase of the number of inverter units, cannot be overcome easily. This paper presents a novel strategy for a high-power utility interactive inverter, which is composed of a large power with low-switching-frequency PWM inverter (high-power PWM inverter), an LC passive filter, and a series active filter (series AF). Because harmonic components contained in the utility line current are absorbed by the series AF, the switching frequency of the PWM inverter can be selected to about 1 kHz. In addition because the power capacity and the output voltage of the series AF can be suppressed lower than 10% of the power capacity and the output voltage of PWM inverter, low-voltage and high-speed power devices can be applied to the series AF. Consequently, high power, high efficiency, and high harmonics elimination performance can be realized without increasing the number of inverter units. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Electr. Eng.

With reversible chemical reactions the heat can be stored or released on demand by controlling the flow of the reactive fluid. If they prove to have satisfactory repeatability, the reversible reactions can also be used in a heat storage system for cogeneration systems. In this way it would be possible to even out the load of the cogeneration system: in a period of low heat demand the surplus heat is stored with the chemical reaction in the heat storage and during a peak load period it can be released with the reverse reaction. In this paper we discuss the operation of a chemical heat pump that uses the reaction between magnesium oxide and water. In this case the heat can be stored with a dehydration process at about 300-400 °C and released with a hydration process at about 100-200 °C. In order to test the potential of magnesium hydroxide as a reactive medium for heat pumps we performed reaction experiments over a range of operation pressures between 30 kPa and 203 kPa. For the experiment, a specially prepared reactant with good properties for repetitive operation was packed in a cylindrical reactor. The experimental cycle consisted of an endothermic dehydration of the magnesium hydroxide for the heat storage, and an exothermic hydration of the magnesium oxide for the heat release. The cycle is repeated under various operating conditions that are characteristic for a heat-]storage operation of a cogeneration system. Both directions of the reversible reaction were studied by measuring the reactor-bed temperature distribution and the reacted fraction changes. We conclude with a discussion of a practical application and the mean heat output rate of the reactor. © 2002 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

The smoothness of a frame set is measured in terms of the energy embedded in the frame set, on the analogy of measuring the smoothness of motion data. A frame set with lower energy value is considered to be smoother. Then, the problem of finding a frame set of given frame size which gives the smoothest measure is formulated as an optimization problem that seeks to minimize the weighted sum of the frame energy and the sum of the squared distance errors.","Computer-aided design; Data smoothing; Virtual reality","Computer aided manufacturing; Optimization; Frame reduction; Operations research; computer aided design; smoothing; virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036833010

For interim spent fuel storage, dry casks are one of the most reliable measures to on-site store over-filled assemblies from SFPs. The NUHOMS®-52B System consisting of a canister stored horizontally in a concrete module is selected for thermal evaluation in this paper. The performance of each cask in criticality, radioactive, material and thermal needs to be carefully addressed to ensure its enduring safety. Regarding the thermal features of dry storage casks, three different kinds of heat transfer mechanisms are involved, which include natural convection heat transfer outside and/or inside the canister, radiation heat transfer inside and outside the canister, and conduction heat transfer inside the canister. To analyze the thermal performance of dry storage casks, RELAP5-3D is adopted to calculate the natural air convection and radiation heat transfer outside the canister to the ambient environment, and ANSYS is applied to calculate the internal conduction and radiation heat transfer. During coupling iteration between codes, the heat energy across the canister wall needs to be conserved, and the inner wall temperature of the canister needs to be converged. By the coupling of RELAP5-3D and ANSYS, the temperature distribution within each fuel assembly inside canisters can be calculated and the peaking cladding temperature can be identified.",,"Dry storage cask; Radiation heat transfer; Spent fuel interim storage; Thermal performance; Accident prevention; Computer simulation; Heat conduction; Radiation; Spent fuels; Temperature distribution; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic stability; Containment vessels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036388235

It has been shown that the energy stored in the liquid phase is important in the outcome of such an accident. In order to better understand tank failure and energy storage, it is desired to understand the complex thermo-hydraulic response of the lading prior to a thermally induced rupture. In the summers of 2000 and 2001, a series of controlled fire tests were conducted on horizontal 1890 litre (500 US gallon) propane tanks. The test tanks were instrumented with pressure transducers, lading and wall thermocouples, and an instrumented flow nozzle in place of a pressure relief valve (PRV). A computer controlled PRV was used to control pressure, while high momentum, liquid propane utility torches were used to heat the tank. PRV blowdown and fire conditions were varied in this test series while all other input parameters were held constant. It was found that the lading response and energy storage varied according to the fire conditions and PRV operation. The location and quantity of the burners affected the thermal stratification within the liquid, and the swelling and frothing at the liquid/vapour interface. The blowdown of the PRV affected average tank pressure, average liquid temperature and time to destratify. PRV operation caused enhanced convective cooling on the vapour space wail. The degree of blowdown dictated the pressure drop, and thus the liquid flashing and subsequent swelling were affected. This paper will discuss these thermohydraulic responses and their role in the tank failure.",,"Thermohydraulics; Computer control systems; Energy storage; Failure (mechanical); Flammability testing; Fuel tanks; Hydraulics; Liquefied gases; Pressure relief valves; Pressure transducers; Pressure vessels; Propane; Swelling; Thermocouples; Fluid structure interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036385133

Study of the crystallization behavior of the films is very necessary to the optimization of film composition and dopants. This work dedicates our experimental investigation on the crystallization behavior of oxygen-doped Ge-Sb-Te phase change films, which were prepared by RF-sputtering. The crystallization behavior of the thin films was investigated using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). XRD spectra of the films in the as-deposited and heat-treated states show that the films changed from amorphous to crystalline states due to heat-treatment. By measuring the peak temperature of crystallization at different heating rates we calculated the crystallization activation energies and frequency factors. It was found that the oxygen-doped Ge-Sb-Te sample has a higher value of crystallization activation energy than that without oxygen-doping, it is clear that oxygen-doping can improve the crystallization rate of Ge-Sb-Te phase-change material. © 2002 SPIE.

In facing this problem, we proposed the concept of Force-Balanced Coil (FBC) applied to SMES and fusion devices. The FBC Is a helically wound toroidal coil which balances the centering force with the hoop force. The helical winding of the FBC is modulated in order to reduce the torsional force. However, the winding of the FBC is a three-dimensional complex shape so that it may be difficult to manufacture the modulated helical windings. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a helically winding machine. In this paper, we discuss the winding techniques by using the winding machine and improve the shape of the helical windings from the view point of the reduction of the time consumed in winding the coil. © 2002, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

The magnetization distribution in antidot arrays is examined with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. It is shown that one side of the array makes an angle of about 20° with the easy magnetic axis of the film. Magnetization reversal in the direction close to the easy magnetic axis starts with domain nucleation at the antidot edges that are perpendicular to the applied field and adjacent to the unpatterned region of the film, and propagates as the domain walls move. Magnetization reversal in the direction close to the hard magnetic axis starts with magnetization rotation outside the patterned region at the antidot edges and propagates as the domain walls execute a complicated motion. It is demonstrated that some areas between the edges of adjacent antidots can carry information bits.

Advantages of molecular computing include economic fabrication and design, more data storage capacity (up to 1011 - 1013 bits/cm3 in contrast to 108 bits/cm2 capacity of 2-D memory chip), a higher degree of integration, considerable lower switching energies, enhanced stability of circuits in the presence of radiation, inherent precision, high speed signal processing, etc. Three approaches of molecular computing are discussed in this article which include (i) Enzyme-based Logic Gates (ENLOGS), (ii) Surface DNA Computing, and (iii) Protein-based Optical Computing. The enzyme-based logic gates (ENLOGS) use enzymatic activity to perform recognition operations via lock and key paradigm. The Surface DNA Computing involves the immobilization and manipulation of combinatorial mixtures of DNA on a support to solve complex non-deterministic problems via a series of mark, destroy and unmark operations. The Protein-based Optical Computing provides high speed random access memories, based on bacteriorhodopsin (obtained from balobacterium halobium). This produces conformational changes when struck with different coloured laser beams thus acting as a basis for a molecular switch. Furthermore, it exhibits dectroehromism which is used to develop electronic ink for computer displays. Work is in progress at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur on a model of an ENLOG. This model described in the article uses phenomena of release of NO from nitro-porphyrin through light and a pH gradient.","Biomolecular computers; Enzyme-based logic gates; Protein-based optical computing; Surface DNA computing","Computational complexity; Computers; DNA; Electrochromism; Enzyme immobilization; Logic gates; Optical data processing; Problem solving; Random access storage; Signal processing; Biomolecular computers; Molecular computing; Information retrieval systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036509788

The approach differs from the classical mechanism synthesis methods in that a simple already balanced mechanism is developed into a mechanism of the desired specifications, rather than that an adjustment mechanism is synthesized to match the required transfer function between the energy storage devices. The described methodology uses some idealizations to yield a coherent theoretical framework for designing systems that are perfectly balanced. When real world constraints are to be applied on a system conceived of in this way, numerical approximation may become necessary.

Slotted friction material also has a great effect on the behaviour of the disc brake friction. Mixing between the coated rotor and the slotted material is of importance to improve the frictional behaviour of the disc brake. Slotted material used in this work is divided into two parts; each part has leading and trailing edge to give the advantages of using two pads in a single braking action. Simulating the kinetic energy of a passenger car to measure the friction force between the disc and pad at different operating conditions have been designed in a test rig. The effect of thermal loading at the sliding interface between the different friction material and the rotor of Floating Calliper Disc Brake (FCDB) has been studied in this work. Initial disc surface temperature was measured and controlled through a high quality technique by using a thermal camera that was fixed at suitable place close to the rotor. The signal from the transducer was amplified and displayed on a digital storage oscilloscope and then fed to a computer for the final analysis. The results showed the different values of coefficient of friction depending on the different operating conditions. The maximum coefficient of friction was 0.58 that was recorded at initial disc surface temperature of 150°C while the braking pressure was 20 bar. The minimum value for the friction coefficient 0.30 was also recorded at initial disc surface temperature of 50°C at rotating speed 500 rpm while the braking pressure was 25 bar.

Although ferromagnetic manganites show colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effects around their Curie temperature, the low field and nearly temperature independent magnetoresistance properties important for spintronics are found only at low temperatures. Guided by striking features in the electronic structure of several magnetic compounds, we prepared the Heusler compound Co2Cr0.6Fe0.4Al. Based on our band structure calculations, we have chosen this composition in order to obtain a ferromagnetic half metal with a van Hove singularity in the vicinity of the Fermi energy in the majority spin channel and a gap in the minority spin channel.

Subnanosecond excitation of the magnetic state has so far been achieved by launching current pulses into micro-coils and micro-striplines and by using the high-energy electron beams. Local injection of a spin-polarized current through an all-metal junction has been proposed as an efficient method of switching magnetic elements, and experiments seem to confirm this. Here we introduce a different scheme for the ultrafast generation of local magnetic fields in such a hybrid structure. The basis of our approach is to optically pump a Schottky diode with a focused, ∼150-fs laser pulse. The laser generates a current across the semiconductor-metal junction, which in turn gives rise to an in-plane magnetic field. This scheme combines the localization of current injection techniques with the speed of current generation at a Schottky barrier. Specific advantages include the ability to rapidly create local fields along any in-plane direction anywhere on the sample, the ability to scan the field over many magnetic elements and the ability to tune the magnitude of the field with the diode bias voltage. ©2002 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Diodes; Excited states; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Optical pumping; Pumping (laser); Schottky barrier diodes; Semiconductor diodes; Semiconductor junctions; Semiconductor lasers; Current generation; Current injections; High energy electron beams; In-plane direction; In-plane magnetic fields; Local magnetic field; Semiconductor metals; Spin polarized currents; Magnetic storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017244804

Together with changing chemical composition, the general physical properties of irradiated material layers are also changed. Thereby, we succeeded to transform non-magnetic metal oxides into magnetic metals with characteristics similar to those of bulk metals.

Several approaches are now being studied intensively, such as stabilizing nanoscale magnetic domains in continuous films and patterning magnetic films into isolated dots. In this work we introduce a new type of magnetic medium where the spin configurations are engineered in chemically homogenous magnetic films. Such a medium not only maintains the surface planarity but also the homogeneity of the magnetic materials. Substrates with laterally modulated single-crystal and polycrystalline surface regions were used to induce selective epitaxial growth of a ferromagnetic Ni film. The samples have a structure of GaAs/ Co(1.8nm)/Cu(70nm)/Ni(5nm)/Cu(5nm). Ultrathin NiO (1nm) patterns were used to modulate the GaAs substrate surface. The films that interfaced directly with GaAs grow epitaxially and the Ni magnetization is oriented out-of-plane. The films that interfaced with the NiO patterns have polycrystalline structures and the Ni magnetization is directed in the plane. The co-existence of the polycrystalline and epitaxial features are confirmed by in situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction analyses. Atomic force microscopy was used to examine the sample surface yielding statistical roughness parameters in the range similar to that of epitaxial continuous Cu/Ni/Cu films. The co-existence of the in-plane and out-of plane magnetization regions in the films was imaged by magnetic force microscopy, also further confirmed by magneto-optic Kerr effect and superconducting quantum-interference device measurements.

The critical-mass-free feature of the ceramics was achieved by a certain ratio of Pu and n° poisons given by the physical calculation. The ceramics were produced through impregnation with plutonium sol-gel of a porous matrix, a skeleton, fabricated from various neutron poisons (HfO2, Gd2O3, HfC, HfCxOy) using various methods. The skeleton of hamium oxide with open porosity of 30-35% was produced by activated sintering of hafnium oxide powders of a certain fractional composition using the hafnium oxide sol-gel as a binder and sintering activator. The matrix of gadolinium oxide, Gd2O3, had porosity 60%, was produced by sintering of mixed powders (Gd2O3+11.2 wt. % C(black)) at 1200C. The skeletons made of HfC and HfCxOy had open porosity of 45 - 47%, were produced in one stage through reaction sintering in vacuum of batch composed of mixed hafnium oxide and carbon. To impregnate the fabricated skeletons, the drop method was used allowing introduction to them of a given quantity of PuO2 sol with concentration from 330 to 490 g/l. On drying, heating, thermal destruction, and sintering the produced compositions were comprehensively studied. © 2002 Atomic Energy Society of Japan.

For present plants, improving competitiveness, satisfying increasingly stringent safety requirements, increasing the fuel burnup, facing the ageing of plants, designing compact interim storage, reprocessing, etc. are sources of many needs for new or improved data. For the middle term, replacing the present industrial facilities may include some innovations, mature for industrialisation, like HTRs or inert matrix fuel in LWRs. Using new materials, aiming at ultra high burnups, burning different types of fuel (e.g. thorium cycle), induces new data requirements. For the long term, other innovative technologies must be available, for keeping the fast reactor option open, transmuting wastes, minimising waste production in integrated fuel cycles (e.g. with molten salt reactors), increasing the coolant temperature (> 900°C), etc. For such options, only the data needed for answering key feasibility issues are necessary now. The “Comité Français des Données Nucléaires” is working at a very restrictive high priority list of data needs selected following criteria of importance for industrial applications and feasibility. As advances in nuclear data are resulting from international efforts, such approach, which can guide the research priorities, must be internationalised. © 2014 Atomic Energy Society of Japan.","Industrial needs; Innovation in nuclear energy; International co-operation; MICHELANGELO Network; Request list for nuclear data measurement and evaluation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010572526

As a consequence, the analysis shows that there are inherent limits imposed on the device for achieving successful voltage restoration. Pertinent expressions are derived which relate the limits to the parametric values describing the supply system and loads.

We have been developing a new phase change optical disc, which has much higher data recording rate of up to 140 Mbps (T. Kato et al, Tech. Dig. ISOM2001, pp. 200-201, 2001), based on the DVR system (λ=405 nm, NA=0.85, cover layer thickness=100 μm) (Y. Kuroda et al, 1999; M.J. Dekker et al, 2000; Y. Kasami et al, 2000). As a general rule, the smaller the laser spot size on the disc surface, the more sensitive the disc becomes to scratches or fingerprints on it. In such a system, the distance between the disc surface and objective lens (i.e. working distance) is very narrow due to a high NA. Therefore it is also feared that the objective lens hits the disc surface due to an external impact. To avoid these problems when the disc is taken out of a cartridge, we have developed a new hard-coat. The cartridge-free DVR-blue disc was expected to be accomplished by the following properties: (1) abrasion resistance; (2) scratch resistance; (3) water and oil repellency (low surface free energy). Among these properties, the abrasion resistance is considered to be the most important. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Abrasion; Aluminum; Compact disks; Data recording; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Free energy; Optical disk storage; Optical instrument lenses; Projectiles; Videodisks; Wear resistance; Digital networks; Laser spot size; Nonlinear editing; Scratch resistance; Storage capacity; Surface free energy; Water and oil repellencies; Working distances; Optical data storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962891462

Heanue et al., Science, pp. 749-752, 1994). Various modulation codes have been introduced to mitigate noise problems in HDDS systems (H.J. Coufal et al., Holographic Data Storage, Springer 2000). In this paper, a new 2D modulation scheme, or CCBM (code-word complementing block modulation), is proposed. The CCBM yields a pseudo-random array consisting of codewords with multiple weights (K.

At the next stage, the analysis of the DNA diversity originated from each individual is a very important aspect. It requires a method that can determine the base-pair sequence quickly and easily for fast and effective analysis. Separating the biochemical samples by electrophoresis is one of the analysis processes. Recently, electrophoresis has been performed in the fine channel formed on various substrates. By utilizing a microchannel chip for electrophoresis, the dead volume of the reagent and detection apparatus, and energy are reduced. To improve the separation performance of microchannel chip, the width of the channel should be narrower. On the other hand, the volume of the sample that can be introduced is restricted. Then, the channel is filled with ionic solution, and the top of the substrate is covered with a plate for shallow channel, so as not to cause current leakage induced by applying high voltage during electrophoresis. But, it requires a high quality substrate-cover adhesion. technique. We propose a high-aspect-ratio open-top microchannel plate. The high-aspect-ratio structure increases the sample and reagent volume inside the channel without increasing the channel width, which results in an enhancement of the detection sensitivity. And the buffer solution is introduced only before the measurement and sequential supply from an external source is not needed. The chip is standalone. The deep channel leads to another advantage. Its deep depth prevents overflow of the solution to the uncovered channel. By avoiding the difficult sealing process, the fabrication process become easy and high-throughput is realized. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Aspect ratio; Electrophoresis; Image storage tubes; Microchannels; Nanotechnology; Plates (structural components); Base pair sequences; Detection sensitivity; Effective analysis; Fabrication process; High aspect ratio structures; Human Genome Project; Micro channel plate; Separation performance; Substrates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960453039

It is necessary to increase instruction window size for improving instruction scheduling capability. However, it is difficult to increase the size without any serious impact on processor performance, since the instruction window is one of the dominant determiners of processor cycle time. The instruction window is critical because it is realized using content addressable memory (CAM). In general, RAMs are faster in access time and lower in power dissipation than CAMs. Therefore, it is desirable that the CAM instruction window is replaced by the RAM instruction window. This paper proposes such an instruction window, named the explicit data forwarding instruction window. The principle behind our proposal is to make result forwarding explicit. It is possible to dynamically construct explicit relationships between instructions, since it is expected that each execution result is forwarded to a limited number of dependent instructions. Simulation results show that the explicit data forwarding instruction window achieves a level of performance comparable to that of the conventional instruction window, while also providing benefit in terms of shorter cycle time. © 2002 IEEE.","Associative memory; CADCAM; Computer aided manufacturing; Dynamic scheduling; Logic; Microprocessors; Power dissipation; Processor scheduling; Proposals; Read-write memory","Associative processing; Computer aided manufacturing; Digital storage; Electric losses; Energy dissipation; Memory architecture; Microprocessor chips; Program processors; Random access storage; Scheduling; Systems analysis; Associative memory; CADCAM; Dynamic scheduling; Logic; Processor scheduling; Proposals; Associative storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949650450

They achieve quasi-optimal coding gain, enabling reliable transmission on very noisy channels. Among the different existing turbo-coding schemes, Block Turbo-Codes (BTC) present excellent performances when their constitutive codes are decoded with the Fang-Buda Algorithm (FBA). Their bit error rate (BER) performance does not present any significant error floor down to 10-9. However, the complexity of the FBA is such that currently available block turbo-decoders, even if they achieve throughput up to 155 Mbps, can only handle very simple codes, which do not reveal totally the power of BTC. In order to enable high performing BTC without sacrificing throughput or energy, we have systematically analyzed and optimized the FBA algorithm, applying a Data Transfer and Storage Exploration methodology. We describe in this paper the algorithm transformation steps and detail the resulting architecture. The latter, when mapped in a typical 0.18 μm CMOS technology and clocked at 200 MHz enables high performing block turbo-decoding with throughput ranging from 30 Mbps to 120 Mbps. The memory power consumption, which is dominant for such a data-dominated application, has been estimated to be 480 mW while the memory area estimation led to 3.5 mm2 per FBA module in the BTC pipeline. © 2002 IEEE.","Algorithm design and analysis; Bit error rate; CMOS technology; Decoding; Forward error correction; Performance analysis; Power system reliability; Throughput; Turbo codes; Wireless communication","Algorithms; Bit error rate; CMOS integrated circuits; Codes (symbols); Data transfer; Decoding; Digital storage; Error correction; Errors; Forward error correction; Memory architecture; Optical communication; Reliability analysis; Signal processing; Throughput; Wireless telecommunication systems; Algorithm design and analysis; CMOS technology; Performance analysis; Power system reliability; Wireless communications; Turbo codes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948988963

This paper presents a new cache partition architecture, called paged cache, which is beneficial for area, power and performance. In paged cache, we divide the entire cache into a set of partitions, and each partition is dedicated to only one page cached in the TLB (translation lookaside buffer). By restricting the range in which the cached block can be placed, we can eliminate the total or partial tag depending on the partition size. Furthermore, by accessing only a single partition, instead of accessing the entire cache, both the power consumption per cache access and the average access time can be reduced largely. We use SimpleScalar to simulate the SPEC2000 benchmarks and perform the HSPICE simulations (with 0.18 μm technology and 1.8 V voltage supply) to evaluate the proposed architecture. Experimental results show that the paged cache is very efficient in reducing both power consumption and tag area of the on-chip L1 caches, while the average access time of cache can be improved. © 2002 IEEE.","Clocks; Computer architecture; Costs; Energy consumption; Frequency; Pressing; Random access memory; System performance; System-on-a-chip; Voltage","Application specific integrated circuits; Buffer storage; Clocks; Costs; Electric potential; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Microprocessor chips; Pressing (forming); Random access storage; System-on-chip; Frequency; High performance processors; Hspice simulations; Proposed architectures; Random access memory; System on a chip; System performance; Translation lookaside buffer; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948966095

The Curie temperature (Tc) and dielectric constant at Tc are 196°C and 2065, respectively. The maximum saturated polarization reaches nearly 50 μC/cm2, corresponding to a maximum induced charge of 12.5 nC The complex dielectric constants and ac conductivities of PLZT thin film are measured as a function of frequency (0.01Hz-1 MHz) and temperature (25-200°C) in order to investigate dielectric dispersions and conduction mechanisms. We also observe the strong low-frequency dielectric dispersion at high temperature above 125°C due to the migration of thermally activated oxygen vacancies. The estimated activation energy for conduction is 0.76 eV. The conduction mechanism seems more complicated than simple hopping model.

Based on time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements, the enhancement effect has been linked to a slowly decaying component commonly appearing in the kinetics of the Si:Er PL signal. A model has been developed where the intensity enhancement is ascribed to the MIR-induced energy transfer from shallow traps to Er3+ ions. Taking into account saturation of the optically active erbium centers, the model can successfully describe the amplitude of the enhancement effect and its dependence on delay time of the MIR pulse with respect to the primary excitation in the visible pump pulse. The experimentally observed decrease of the enhancement effect at higher temperatures is ascribed to thermal ionization of nonequilibrium traps.","Erbium; Free-electron laser; Photoluminescence; Silicon","Electron traps; Erbium; Free electron lasers; Infrared radiation; Ionization; Laser pulses; Photoluminescence; Positive ions; Enhancement effect; Midinfrared emission enhancement; Midinfrared pulses; Optical storage effect; Thermal ionization; Semiconducting silicon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19244376133

The details of the methodology, its working principles, and typical results obtained are presented in this work. The method is based on the introduction of a type of visualizing disks which use a layer of magneto-optical material with low Curie temperature to replace the magnetic layer used in the conventional magnetic media. The method and corresponding setup were used successfully in the visualization of potential decay caused by slider-particle-disk contact, slider-disk contact during track seeking operations, and slider-disk impact during loading and unloading operations.","High density magnetic recording; Magnetic disk drives; Thermal decay; Tribology","Magnetic disk storage; Magnetooptical devices; Tribology; Magnetic disk drives; Magnetic recording",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036825575

The processes of poisoning of LaNi47Al0.3 alloy are analyzed in detail by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), second ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), Auger-energy spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The changes of the valence and the concentration distribution of the elements of the alloy LaNi4.7Al0.3 poisoned by CO are studied. The process and the mechanism of CO's poisoning of alloy LaNi4.7Al0.3 are proposed as follows: CO is absorbed on the surface of alloy, part of which reacts with La forming LaC2 and La2O3, or reacts with Ni forming NiO and C in the surface layer, the rest of the CO is decomposed into C and O, which diffuse into the bulk to react with La, Ni and Al. These results in phase-split reaction in surface layer of the particle, and enrichment of La and impoverishment Ni on the surface have taken place. The poisoning effect decreases with a increase of depth. The diffusion depth of C is within 600 Å in the surface layer, and that of O is within 1000 Å. The oxide film and carbonizing film prevent the H-storage alloys from further absorbing hydrogen, which leads to a deceleration of the H-storage capability. Moreover, The formation of a new phase with poor H-absorption capability is caused by the phase split reactions, which is one of reasons for the decrease of H-absorption property of the H-storage alloys.","Analysis; Contamination; Hydriding; Mechanism","Absorption; Auger electron spectroscopy; Carbon monoxide; Contamination; Decomposition; Diffusion; Metallic films; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Surfaces; X ray diffraction analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Carbonizing films; Lanthanum compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036576727

This paper proposes a new architectural technique to reduce energy dissipation of frame memory through adaptive bitwidth compression. Unlike related approaches, the technique utilizes the fixed order of memory accesses and data correlation of video sequences, by dynamically adjusting the memory bitwidth to the number of bits changed per pixel. Instead of treating the data bits independently, we group the most significant bits together, activating the corresponding group of bit-lines adaptively to data variation. The approach is not restricted to the specific bit-patterns nor depends on the storage phase. It works equally well on read and write accesses, as well as during precharging. Simulations show that using this method we can reduce the total energy consumption of the frame memory cell array by 20% without affecting the picture quality. The implementation scheme is simple yet compact.","Adaptive technique; Bit-compression; Low power; Video memory","Computer simulation; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Image coding; Image compression; Image quality; Adaptive bitwidth compression; Picture quality; Video encoders; Video memory; Video sequences; Data storage equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036537815

The 16-bit adder, which uses a negative logic binary look-ahead carry structure based on NOR gates, operates at the maximum clock frequency of 1.67 GHz and consumes 134.4 mW at a supply voltage of 0.6 V. The active area is 1.6 mm2 and there are about 1,230 FETs. A new DC/DC level converter has been developed for use in high-speed, low-power storage circuits such as SRAMs and register files. The level converter can increase the DC voltage, which is supplied to an active-load circuit on request, or supply a minimal DC voltage to a load circuit in the stand-by mode. The power dissipation (P) of the 32-word register file with on-chip DC/DC level converters is 459 mW, a reduction to 25.2% of that of an equivalent conventional register file, while the operating frequency (fc) was 5.17 GHz that is 74.8% of fc for the conventional register file. P for the 512-bit cache SRAM with the new DC/DC level converters is 34.3 mW, 89.7% of the value for au equivalent conventional cache SRAM, with the read-access time of 455 psec, only 1.1% longer than that of the conventional cache SRAM.","Cache SRAM; GaAs; Power dissipation; Register file","Adders; Cache memory; CMOS integrated circuits; Electric loads; Energy dissipation; Gates (transistor); High electron mobility transistors; Semiconducting gallium arsenide; Static random access storage; Read-access time; Integrated circuit layout",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036475574

The utilization of secondary fuels plays an important role not only from the industrial economic aspect but also as a result of the political requirement for CO2 abatement through conservation of primary energy sources and the need for reliable and practical energy utilization of industrial product residues. These secondary fuels, which range from shredded plastics and carpet scraps to animal meal, exhibit differing material and handling properties. A semi-mobile package plant, which can be set up quickly in a cement works close to the burner, has been developed so supply all these different secondary fuels to the burner system of a cement works in the required quantities. Thanks to the semi-mobile design it is possible to dispense with expensive structural measures involving storage silos and unloading and conveying equipment.

All this waste is managed by ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian Federal Agency responsible for waste management, including conditioning, intermediate storage and final disposal. Unfortunately, the actions taken by ONDRAF/NIRAS and the producers in order to reduce waste production have had a negative impact on waste treatment tariffs. It has become necessary to re-examine the relationship between ONDRAF/NIRAS and the producers, in order to control the costs of waste management. This problem concerns not only the treatment costs but also the disposal costs. The volume of waste has fallen from 30M3/Thwh in 1985 to 4.m3/Twh in 2000, not by chance but as the result of a new site organisation geared towards achieving this aim. This paper presents firstly the history of Belgian waste management, taking into account the impact on the associated costs, and secondly the measures that have to be taken in order to be able to decide which new technologies are necessary to go further with the objective of waste volume reduction in a new environment, namely deregulation and consequently high pressure on production costs.

Two thirds of the interviewees regard nuclear power as an option for the future once the waste management problem has been solved safely. In France, as in other countries, strategies for handling and managing radioactive waste were developed at an early stage. Different waste management pathways have been established for different types of waste as function of their characteristics. Between 1969 and 1994, low-level waste was emplaced at the Centre de la Manche; since 1992, the Centre de l'Aube has become available with an aggregate capacity of one million cubic meters planned for the period until 2040. High-level waste and longlived waste from electricity generation by nuclear power arise in France in the reprocessing of nuclear fuel at the La Hague plant, and are held in interim storage in the same place. In France, preference is given to reprocessing because of resource conservation and the minimization of higher-level waste volumes. In 1991, the French parliament adopted legislation for a fifteen-year research and development program and, on the basis of its outcome, a decision about the waste management policy to be taken. Items to be studied within this program are the separation and transmutation of actinides and longlived radionuclides, studies of deep geologic repositories, and of conditioning and final storage. Once the results have become available, the necessary political decision about the waste management strategy and a repository site can be taken in 2006. Technically, there are no reasons for further delays even at the present time.",,"Electric power generation; Geological repositories; Nuclear energy; Radioactive waste storage; Radioisotopes; Waste management; Radioactive waste management; Radioactive wastes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036333457

In experiment 2, only the 0.5 mg/kg dose of guanfacine had significant effects. Resting oxygen consumption on day 29 of treatment was proportionately 0.10 lower in this group compared with controls (P &lt; 0.05). There was no effect of treatment on growth rate. After 46 days, the 0.5 mg/kg treatment group had proportionately 0.35 more body fat (P &lt; 0.01) higher body fat content (P &lt; 0.01), higher total body energy (P &lt; 0.05) and higher total body energy content (P &lt; 0.05). Experiment 1 linked reduced growth rate with increased corticosterone concentrations and experiment 2 suggested the mechanism may be a repartitioning of energy storage to lipid. However, it was not determined whether these consequences were a direct effect of guanfacine or a secondary effect due to corticosterone. In spite of reductions in energy expenditure, guanfacine retards growth in rats and mice, but not in cattle where growth is enhanced. Thus rodents may have a limited usefulness as models for studies of α2-adrenoceptor agonists in cattle.","Corticosterone; Energy expenditure; Glucose; Growth; Guanfacine; Rats","Animalia; Bos taurus; Rattus norvegicus; Rodentia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036323105

But since today, integrated devices with these inductive elements were mainly limited by low inductance and current values. To make optimised new designs and achieve realisation of such inductive elements, we propose a new complete methodology, illustrated through a micro-machined square planar inductor. Indeed, after defining specifications (power, inductance value, frequency, geometrical dimensions), a mathematical method is used to define a first geometrical parameters set.

Evaporators are located in each individual freezer and fresh food compartment. Since the fresh food evaporator's inlet air temperature is normally higher than 5°C, it seems like a good idea to use this warm air for defrosting. The term ""air defrosting"" is used for this process, which is simply circulating the fresh food compartment air through the evaporator while the compressor is in the off position. In order to see the effects of air defrosting, three possible cases are investigated experimentally. These methods are 1) heater defrost on both evaporators, 2) heater on freezer evaporator and air defrosting on fresh food evaporator, 3) heater on freezer evaporator and a combination of heater and air defrosting on fresh food evaporator.

They are generally based on a coupled energy-water budget equation, and the results depend critically on (prescribed) land surface characteristics, notably albedo, soil water storage capacity and aerodynamic roughness. In a recent case - study bi - angular (nadir and forward) observations provided by the ATSR instrument were used to estimate the component soil and foliage temperature. For two images overlying the Netherlands on 14 May 1998 and South-East Spain on 9 September 1998 vegetation and bare ground temperatures were derived from ATSR data, and aggregated to a grid of 25 × 25 km, compatible with a NWP model. This NWP model was equipped with a land surface parameterization scheme in which vegetation and bare ground temperature were calculated separately. In a variational assimilation scheme, the NWP model was forced to match the observed component temperatures by changing both the soil moisture content and the aerodynamic roughness for the heat exchange of the bare ground component. It appeared that the optimal solution differed significantly for the two regions. For The Netherlands, changing the aerodynamic roughness did not affect the correspondence to observations, and soil moisture had to be changed to increase the overall model performance. For the Spanish case, in contrast, aerodynamic roughness had to be changed significantly. The Spain case - study was extended by analyzing a time - series of ATSR - 1 and - 2 data. The evaluation of results focuses on the temporal variability of aerodynamic roughness for heat transport.",,"Aerodynamics; Atmospheric temperature; Calculations; Data processing; Mathematical models; Moisture; Numerical methods; Radiometers; Soils; Time series analysis; Aerodynamic roughness; Land surface temperature; Land-atmosphere interface; Numerical Weather Prediction; Weather forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036030323

Our entire existence is a process of gathering, analyzing, understanding and acting on the information. For many applications dealing with large amounts of data, pattern classification is a key element in arriving at the solution. Engineering applications especially like medical diagnosis require the ability to accurately classify the recorded data for controlling, tracking and decision making. Although, modern technologies enable storage of large streams of data, there is no technology to help us to understand, analyze, or even visualize the hidden information in the data. Data mining is the emerging field that helps us to understand and analyze the hidden information from very large databases (VLDB). In this paper, two important data mining tools, ie, neural networks and genetic algorithm have been used for mining the database through pattern classification. The processing consists of three major phases, network construction and training, pruning; rule extraction and validation. The networks used are namely adaptive resonance theory 1.5, adaptive resonance theory 3 and multi channel ART(MART). These networks belong to the adaptive resonance theory (ART) family, which is a self organizing neural network capable of clustering arbitrary sequence of input patterns into stable recognition codes. The pruning phase aims at removing redundant links and units without increasing the classification error rate of the network. The pruning methods adopted are local pruning and threshold pruning. The final phase extracts the classification rules from the final weights of the pruned network in the form of IF THEN rules and rules are validated using validation algorithm. The genetic algorithm is also used to optimise the performance with regard to the various parameters used in the network. The performance analysis and comparision of all the networks have been done. The proposed networks have been tested on diabetes data application taken from UCI machine learning site. Simulation algorithms have been implemented using C++ language in the Pentium machine. The graphical results have been obtained using Microsoft Excel.","Adaptive resonance theory; Data mining; Genetic algorithm; Neural network",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035521495
