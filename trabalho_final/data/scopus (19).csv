In the present study, incorporation of surfactants in formulations significantly enhanced SB-210661 dissolution in water at 37°C. The role of surfactants on dissolution enhancement was also investigated. As an alternative formulation approach, solid dispersions were also prepared using the melt and mechanical activation methods for PEG 8000 containing dispersions and using the solvent method for PVP containing dispersions. The dissolution of SB-210661 from the solid dispersions was significantly greater than that observed for the surfactant containing formulations. The physical characteristics of these solid dispersions were investigated by X-ray powder diffraction and FTIR. The X-ray powder diffractograms suggest that the PEG 8000 dispersions exist in a partially crystalline state and that the PVP dispersion exists in a totally amorphous state. The FTIR results suggest that SB-210661 does not interact with PEG 8000 but interacts with PVP through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Following storage of solid dispersions at 25°C/60% relative humidity (RH) for 1 year, there was no significant change in the dissolution profile for the PVP dispersion, whereas the PEG dispersions showed a slowing in their dissolution rate. X-ray powder diffraction results indicated that SB-210661 was still amorphous in the PVP dispersion, and the FTIR spectrum still supported the hydrogen bonding of SB-210661 and PVP. The lack of change in the dissolution profile of the PVP dispersion may be related to the hydrogen bonding interaction causing a stabilization of SB-210661 in the higher-energy, faster dissolving amorphous state.

A time-of-flight profile, corresponding to the ion cloud kinetic energy distribution at the instant of trapping potential interruption, has been observed from the subsequent free motion of the ions. Unavoidable residual overshoots of the storage voltage at this instant are taken into consideration in a three-dimensional (3D) simulation of 106 ion trajectories. Experimental profiles obtained with very good reproducibility can be matched with simulations (in the form of a histogram of ion number arriving at an electron-multiplier detector in successive intervals of time). The fitting is achieved by variation of the assumed ion kinetic energy and a coefficient representing the anisotropy of the ion cloud. It was found that experimental profiles obtained by this ejection method has been modeled to a radio frequency of 1.5 MHz corresponding to a confinement voltage of about 700 Vpp. The uncertainty on the fitting of the profiles presented here leads to uncertainties in energy evaluation situated between 0.1 and 0.3 eV.

The Cr-substituted alloy desorbed 0.4 wt.% of hydrogen even at 423 K in the pressure range between 0.01 MPa and 1 MPa, and the enthalpy of hydride formation was calculated as -50 kJ mol-1 H-12. This value is the largest among Mg-based alloys. Therefore, the hydride of this alloy is the least stable among other Mg-based alloys. However, Mn or Co-substituted alloys did not desorb hydrogen at 423 K. The influence of the substitution element on the relationship between the site energy of hydrogen in amorphous alloys and the hydrogenation properties is explained.

Improvement of heart preservation is still the greatest challenge in preservation research. The unchanged severe restriction of acceptable storage periods of heart grafts since the beginning of clinical heart transplantation indicates that technical innovations are necessary if a substantial improvement is to be achieved. Methods. Here, we present the results of hypothermic preservation using the innovative technique of coronary oxygen persufflation (COP). COP simply adds gaseous oxygen to hypothermic graft storage and requires only a 'valve guard' for reversible closure of the aortic valve. Fourteen-hr preservation was followed by orthotopic transplantation and evaluations of functional as well as metabolic recovery. Mature pig hearts, a model with restricted preservation tolerance similar to the human heart, were used to guarantee the clinical relevance of this study. Results. After 14-hr hypothermic storage, COP-preserved hearts were able to recover within 2 hr of cardiopulmonary bypass to a steady cardiovascular function without mechanical or pharmacologic support. The left ventricular pressure amplitude of mHTK-COP-preserved hearts as well as energy charge potential recovered to pregrafting values and the ventricular power output to 66%. Hearts simply stored in University of Wisconsin (UW), modified Bretschneider's histidine-tryptophan-ketoglurate (mHTK), or Euro-Flush with glutathione (EFG) solution had only limited recovery, with significantly lower ventricular power output of 18%, 29% or 30% of pregrafting controls on average. Conclusions. Fourteen-hr oxygenated pig heart preservation using COP results in optimal recovery. Storage preservation in solutions containing hyaluronidase (mHTK and EFG) results in higher recoveries as compared to UW solution, an effect that may support the excellent recovery after mHTK-COP preservation.",,"2 oxoglutaric acid; glutathione; histidine; tryptophan; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cardiopulmonary bypass; controlled study; coronary artery blood flow; heart preservation; heart transplantation; nonhuman; organ preservation; priority journal; survival time; swine; viscosity; Adenosine; Adenosine Triphosphate; Allopurinol; Animals; Creatine Kinase; Glutathione; Glycogen; Heart Transplantation; Humans; Hyperbaric Oxygenation; Immunoassay; Insulin; Isoenzymes; Myocardial Contraction; Myocardium; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Oxygen; Raffinose; Swine; Time Factors; Troponin T",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344718445

The ITO films were also used as transparent anodes of polymeric light-emitting diodes (LEDs) incorporating poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) as the emitter material, with, or without, doped poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as a hole-injection/transport layer. Structures based on a soluble green derivative of PPV, poly(4,4′-diphenylene diphenylvinylene) were also tested. We studied chemical (aquaregia, degreasing, RCA protocol) and physical (oxygen and argon plasmas, Teflon, and paper rubbing) treatments and, in contrast to recently published work, we find that for Balzer Baltracon ITO, oxygen plasma and not aquaregia yields the highest efficiencies and luminances and the lowest drive voltages. For oxygen-plasma-treated anodes, the device efficiency clearly correlates with the value of the ITO surface work function, which in turn depends on the time of treatment. Interestingly, we find that work-function variations induced by our oxygen-plasma treatment are unchanged after long-term storage in air and in the dark. Unexpectedly, we also find that devices incorporating a PEDOT layer benefit from an appropriate treatment of the ITO surface, for both efficiency and lifetime. The results shed light on the physics of conjugated, organic semiconductors and related devices, and in particular on the presence and the role of an anodic energy barrier on the LEDs mechanism of operation.

The higher the organism in evolution the more calcium becomes involved. Inspection of the data while looking for an explanation of the involvement of calcium in metabolism, nuclear functions, control over pumps, external activities, mineralisation and so on leads one to suppose that calcium has an integrating function. The implication is that calcium flow is a large network connecting the environment, the cytoplasm, vesicles, organelles, the nucleus and in higher species, organs. There is the possibility then that calcium ion functions are being analysed, often in vitro, in a bit by bit reductionist manner while in vivo calcium is the equivalent of an electron in complicated electrical circuits. We then should look for its connections to energy, to effects where conformational switching by calcium pulses is equivalent to magnetic triggering by electron flow and where storage in vesicles is equivalent to condenser-like devices and so on. The appearance of pulsing, of time delays in parts of circuits, and other properties of electronic circuits seen in calcium triggering are then explicable as part of calcium circuit design. No other ion can operate in the same way due to the peculiarities of the calcium ion, its size, charge, ionisation potential and its availability which allow it both to flow rapidly yet to bind considerably.

Using a modified admittance analysis method, the absorption profile of the intrinsic layer (i-layer) of a cell is calculated to determine the recombination function, which is then used for calculating the collection efficiency. It is expected that the present results of the collection efficiency are more accurate in comparison with the previous ones calculated either using a constant generation rate or an empirical exponential function for the generation of charge carriers throughout the i-layer. The collection efficiency thus calculated is used to obtain the short circuit current as a function of the thickness of the i-layer. Hence it can be used to determine the optimal thickness of the i-layer of a cell. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Specially designed lightweight concretes (or chemically bonded ceramics, CBC's) with high porosities in excess of 50% were used in the development program. The most efficient (cost and performance) barrier wall design utilizes a composite wall consisting of an exterior reinforced concrete cover and a heavy granular fill material. The CBC which makes up the cover has a strength of 2500 psi, a unit weight of 65 pcf, and a porosity over 50%. This CBC cover mitigates initial shock on impact with acceptors while the heavy granular fill reduces wall velocity (and kinetic energy), disperses momentum, and stops fragments.

In this paper, the main reasons for this problem will be reviewed and a perspective will be provided on the expected near-future evolution. It will be shown that the circuit and process technology advances have been very significant in the past decade.

For dehydrated foods, end of shelf life is usually signaled by an unacceptable loss of sensory attributes. Since the time to reach this level of unacceptability, under normal storage conditions, is targeted to be 12 to 24 months, techniques of Accelerated Shelf Life Testing (ASLT) are employed to determine the shelf life of such products within a reasonable length of time. Use of Weibull Hazard Analysis facilitates the effective application of ASLT with sensory evaluation by allowing the use of a practical panel size and easy quantitation of the results. These can be used to model the shelf life behavior and to extrapolate from accelerated to normal conditions. The degradation of the intense sweetener aspartame was studied in a gelatin-based dessert with a fruity flavor. Tests were conducted at 45, 50 and 60°C and the end of shelf life, expressed as unacceptably low level of sweetness, was determined by sensory evaluation as 70.4, 51.9 and 24.3 days respectively. An activation energy of degradation of aspartame, EA, was calculated as 15.1 kcal/mol, from which a shelf life for the product stored at 20°C of 554 days was estimated. Sensory results correlated very well with HPLC measurements of the aspartame degradation giving practically the same EA, and showing that end of shelf life coincided in all cases with 60% remaining aspartame. © 1998 Elsevier B.V.

The segmentation algorithm presented in this work, the Discrete Surface Model, is an automated three-dimensional segmentation method that attempts to optimize an energy function based on three distinct potentials: a deformation potential mat expands (or contracts) the model, an image potential that causes it to stop at image boundaries, and a topology potential that maintains a smooth curvature. Since the deformation of the Discrete Surface Model is local in nature, a global optimization routine encapsulates the deformation of the model using simulated annealing to avoid local energy minima such as are caused by false edges. In addition, the model has no inherent way of checking for self intersections. Global topology is also maintained using a ray-shooting technique that prevents self intersections for occurring in concave models. This segmentation algoriuim is ideal for the creation of physical three-dimensional models using rapid prototyping.","Deformable models; Global optimization; Image segmentation; Rapid prototyping","3-D segmentations; Automated designs; Computer-aided designs; Deformable models; Deformation potentials; Energy functions; Global topologies; Image boundaries; Image potentials; Local energy minimum; Medical images; Optimization routines; Orthopedic devices; Ray-shooting techniques; Segmentation algorithms; Self intersections; Three-dimensional models; Three-dimensional segmentations; Computer aided design; Concurrent engineering; Curve fitting; Deformation; Digital image storage; Edge detection; Global optimization; Image processing; Image segmentation; Intersections; Job analysis; Model checking; Models; Optimization; Rapid prototyping; Sensors; Simulated annealing; Topology; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58849083691

On June 17, 1995 the Radiology and Nuclear Medicine services became integrated for four medical centers forming the VA Maryland Health Care System creating a single multi-facility imaging department. The facilities consisted of the Baltimore VA (acute and outpatient care, tertiary referral center), Ft. Howard (primarily long term care), Perry Point (primarily psychiatric care), and the Baltimore Rehabilitation and extended care facility (nursing home). The combined number of studies at all four sites is slightly more than 80,000 examinations per year. In addition to residents and fellows, the number of radiologists at Baltimore was approximately seven, with two at Perry Point, one at Ft. Howard, and no radiologists at the Rehabilitation and Extended Care facility. A single HIS/RIS, which is located physically at the Baltimore VAMC is utilized for all four medical centers. The multi- facility image management and communication system utilizes two separate PAC Systems that are physically located at the Baltimore VA Medical Center (BVAMC). The commercial system (GE Medical Systems) has been in place in Baltimore for more than 41/2 years and is utilized primarily in the acquisition, storage, distribution and display of radiology and nuclear medicine studies. The second PACS is the VISTA Imaging System, which has been developed as a module of the VA's HIS/RIS by and for the Department of Veterans Affairs. All of the radiology images obtained on the commercial PACS are requested by the VISTA Imaging System using DICOM query/retrieve commands and are stored on a separate server and optical jukebox. Additionally, the VISTA system is used to store all images obtained by all specialties in the medical center including pathology, dermatology, GI medicine, surgery, podiatry, ophthalmology, etc. Using this two PAC system approach, the hospital is able to achieve redundancy with regard to image storage, retrieval, and display of radiology images. The transition to a 'virtual' multi-facility imaging department was accomplished over a period of two years. Initially, Perry Point and Ft. Howard replaced their general radiographic film processors with Computed Radiography (CR) units. The CR units and subsequently, the CT and Ultrasound systems at Perry Point were interfaced (DeJarnette Research Systems) with the commercial PACS located in Baltimore. A HIS/RIS to modality interface was developed (DeJarnette and Fuji Medical Systems) between the computed radiography and CT units and VISTA Information System at Baltimore. A digital dictation system was recently implemented across the multi- facility network. The integration of the three radiology departments into a single virtual imaging department serving four medical centers has resulted in a number of benefits. Economically, there has been the elimination via attrition of one and a half radiologist FTE's (full time equivalents) and an administrative position resulting in an annual savings of more than $375,000 per year. Additionally, the expenditures for moonlighter coverage for vacation, meeting, and sick leave have been eliminated. There is now subspecialty coverage for primary or secondary interpretation and for peer review. ©2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Hospital Information System; Network; PACS; Radiology; Radiology Information System; Virtual","Communication systems; Digital image storage; Electric instrument transformers; Facilities; Health; Health care; Hospitals; Image communication systems; Image processing; Imaging systems; Information services; Information systems; Medical applications; Medicine; Nuclear energy; Nuclear medicine; Optoelectronic devices; Patient rehabilitation; Radiation; Radiography; Radiology; Ultrasonic imaging; Hospital Information System; Network; PACS; Radiology Information System; Virtual; Medical imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58749090534

An average output power of 740 mW is demonstrated in continuous wave operation while 400 mW of average power is obtained in both passive and hybrid modelocked operation, with subsequent optical amplification in an identical semiconductor optical amplifier. The modelocked laser operates at a repetition rate of 1.062 GHz. Optical pulses are generated with a temporal duration of 5 psec, which implies a pulse energy of 377 pJ, and a peak power of 60 watts. Further reduction of the optical pulsewidth to 1.3 psec is also achieved by using dispersion compensation techniques. These results show the promise of novel semiconductor optical amplifier devices for use as gain elements in external cavity semiconductor lasers. The generated output pulse characteristics from modelocked operation is sufficient for use in novel 3-dimensional data storage applications, and in large scale commercial printing and marking applications. ©2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","High power diode lasers; Modelocked diode lasers; Semiconductor optical amplifiers; Ultrafast pulse generation","Amplification; Applications; DC generators; Diamonds; Diode amplifiers; Diodes; Electric conductivity; Heterojunctions; Laser beam welding; Lasers; Light amplifiers; Optical switches; Optoelectronic devices; Pulse generators; Semiconductor devices; Semiconductor diodes; Semiconductor materials; Semiconductor optical amplifiers; 3 dimensional; Amplifier devices; Average power; Cavity mode (CM); Data storage; Dispersion-compensation (DC) techniques; External cavity (EC); External cavity semiconductor lasers; Gain elements; High power diode lasers; High powers; Mode locked laser (MLL); Modelocked diode lasers; Optical pulses; Output powers; Peak powers; Pulse characteristics; Pulse energies; Repetition rates; Ultrafast pulse generation; Wave operation; Semiconductor lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58649096574

The most suited approach to compute the fractal dimension comes from the power spectra of a fractal Brownian motion: the ratio between energies at different scales is related to the persistence parameter H and, thus, to the fractal dimension D equals 3 - H. The signal-dependent nature of speckle, however, prevents from the exploitation of this property to estimate the fractal dimension of SAR images. In this paper, we propose and assess a novel method to obtain such a fractal signature, based on the multi-scale image decomposition provided by the normalized Laplacian pyramid (NLP), which is a bandpass representation obtained by dividing the layers of the LP by expanded versions of its baseband, designed to exhibit noise that is independent of the signal. Thus, by analyzing SAR image texture on multiple scale through the NLP, it is possible to highlight and assess fractal behaviors of the radar cross-section. Experiments on both synthetic and true SAR images corroborate the theoretical assumptions underlying the proposed approach. ©2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Fractal Brownian motion; Fractal dimension; Image processing; Laplacian pyramid; Multiresolution analysis; Power spectra; SAR images; Speckle; Texture; Wavelet transform","Brownian movement; Deformation; Digital image storage; Fractals; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Image processing; Imaging systems; Laplace transforms; Multiresolution analysis; Natural language processing systems; Partial discharges; Power spectrum; Radar cross section; Speckle; Spectrum analysis; Synthetic apertures; Textures; Wavelet transforms; Bandpass; Base bands; Brownian motions; Different scales; Fractal behaviors; Fractal Brownian motion; Fractal signatures; Image decompositions; Laplacian pyramid; Multiple scales; Multiresolution textures; Novel methods; Power spectra; SAR images; Fractal dimension",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149242505

The algorithm was developed particularly for use in generating samples from priors which define morsel for images. It is shown that by ranking the independent variables in the distribution, an analytic expression for the Cumulative Density function ca be derived. This can be used to generate random samples by transforming a uniformly distributed random variable. Issues of scaling are addressed which make the numerical application of these functions possible on finite precision machines. Some discussion is given about the convergence of the Gibbs sampler using this sampling method compared with using direct methods or the Metropolis algorithm.","Bayesian estimation; Gibbs energy; Gibbs sampler; Image processing; Laplacian; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Markov random field; Metropolis; Sampling; Video processing","Cluster analysis; Convergence of numerical methods; Differential equations; Digital image storage; Gibbs free energy; Hidden Markov models; Image processing; Image segmentation; Imaging systems; Inference engines; Inverse problems; Laplace transforms; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Parameter estimation; Precision engineering; Random processes; Random variables; Sampling; Uncertain systems; Video signal processing; Bayesian estimation; Gibbs energy; Gibbs sampler; Laplacian; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Markov random field; Metropolis; Video processing; Bayesian networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649115606

On the other hand, there are many sites favorable for constructing a pumped-storage power plant utilizing seawater in Japan, which is surrounded by the sea. Seawater pumped-storage power plants have several advantages such as lower civil construction cost and lower power distribution cost due to their proximity to nuclear or steam turbine power plants. Seawater pump turbines are used under the condition where the corrosion environment is noticeably severe, rather than conventional river water pump turbines. In addition, pump turbines have many narrow spaces between parts and their major parts are embedded, so that it would be very difficult to apply proper corrosion prevention measures. This problem cannot be solved only by conventional corrosion-preventive engineering.

PPTs offer several advantages over conventional actuators such as reaction wheels, cold gas thrusters, or small chemical thrusters. These advantages derive from its simple, robust design and high performance capability. A PPT system is composed of electronics which process the power and fire the thrusters, an energy storage capacitor, low inductance striplines, thruster electrode pairs, and solid fuel bars. The only moving part is the fuel bar which is fed by a constant force negator spring. The performance of the PPT is superior to chemical propulsion systems in both minimum impulse bit (10's - 100's of μN-s) and specific impulse (1000 - 1400 sec) attainable. Having these capabilities in an easily integrated package opens new possibilities for spacecraft stabilization and fine pointing. The potential of PPTs in an overall Attitude Determination and Control System (ADACS) was examined in three case studies. Each represents a class of missions broadly grouped as: Low Earth Orbits (LEO); higher orbits such as Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit (GEO); and deep space missions. The results of these case studies are presented and contrasted with conventional ADACS approaches. For these missions the platform is assumed to be 3-axis stabilized. Systems comparisons were made based on mass, power, and cost as the primary trade parameters. Secondary factors also examined included reliability and jitter reduction. In these studies, the PPTs did not replace thrusters for momentum wheel dumping, but were used to replace the wheels, the dumping thrusters, magnetic torquers, and any other associated hardware.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242855860

Our previous clinical results suggest a dally carnitine dosage of 20 mg/kg. However, the stability of carnitine in TPNs and TNAs has not been adequately addressed. Carnitine was added to pédiatrie TPN and TNA formulations at 130 or 200 mg/L and units were studied on day ""zero"" or stored at 4-5°C for 1, 7, 15, or 30 days. Units (including day ""zero"") were then maintained at room temperature (RT)- and exposed to constant fluorescent illumination. Units were sampled at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours. Carnitine concentrations were measured in duplicate by a C-14 radioenzymatic technique that is stability indicating. Units were also monitored for pH change, color change, or observable precipitation. Our results showed no change in pH, no change in color, and no visual precipitation in any of the units, even those stored for 30 days. Zero time recovery of carnitine in six different formulations was 93.9 ± 5.31 % (mean ±SD of theoretical, range of 87.8-101%). The results for all periods of storage at 4-5°C were similar. At 30 days of storage followed by 24 hours at RT, the recovery of carnitine was 93.3 ±7.30 % of theoretical (range of 81.0-102 %). Neither cysteine nor ranitidine appeared to influence the stability of carnitine. A simulateo infusion including Y-site addition of 20 % fat emulsion was also performed. Over the course of a 24 hour infusion, samples were obtained at the bag, distal to the in-line 0.22 micron filter, and after mixing with fat emulsion. Recovery of carnitine was 86.1 to 109 % of theoretical across all sampling sites and time points. Based on this data, we conclude that carnitine is highly stable in TPN and TNA formulations and that no clinically significant loss of carnitine occurs through bag, tubing, or filter absorption.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25544451814

The data storage capability of the TriTrac allows for the long-term estimation of EE. The TriTrac monitors physical activity in movement counts and converts these via software (v2.03) into kcals/min. Prior to the field tests, the subject underwent a maximal stress test to validate the Aerosport with the SensorMedics 2900 metabolic cart. Subsequently, a HR-VO2 regression was developed for backpacking by submaximal treadmill testing with the subject wearing a backpack loaded to 20kg (25% of body weight). The subject hiked in the field wearing the same backpack load on ten different days in order to establish the validity of the TriTrac. Each of these ten hikes were on a measured, level gradient, outdoor course with the subject hiking for one hour at normal walking gait (3 mph) with the Aerosport carried in the backpack. The mean kcals/min (6.39 ±.69) calculated from the Aerosport VO2 during the field tests was significantly different from the TriTrac kcals/min (5.32 ±.50) [t(9) = 3.32, p = .009]. A 2-day field study at Grand Canyon National Park revealed a significant difference [t(212) = 8.34, p &lt;.001] between the mean kcals/min (5.51 ±1.51) calculated from the HR-VO2 regression equation with the TriTrac kcals/min (4.47 ±1.02) when hiking down grade. There was also a significant difference [t(254) = 28.91, p &lt; .001] between the HR-VO2 kcals/min (10.39 ± 3.32) and the TriTrac kcals/min (4.14 ± .78) for the hike back up.

Cholesterol metabolism is affected by nutritional, environmental and genetic factors. Neuropeptide Y (NPY), which is widely expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, has an important role in the hypothalamic regulation of energy balance by stimulating food intake and favoring energy storage through increased lipoprotein lipase activity in white adipose tissue. As a part of ongoing study of the genetic basis of obesity, we screened the NPY gene for sequence variants. We report here the identification of a common Leu(7)-to-Pro(7) polymorphism in the signal peptide of NPY. Presence of this Pro(7) in NPY was associated with higher serum levels of total and LDL cholesterol in obese subjects participating in two independent Finnish and Dutch studies. Furthermore, normal-weight Finns with Pro(7) also had higher serum levels of total and LDL cholesterol than did subjects with Leu(7)/Leu(7), as analyzed in three subsequent determinations at 5-year intervals during a 10-year follow-up period. The NPY polymorphism was not associated with higher cholesterol levels in normal- weight Dutch.

Indeed, during friction, charges are trapped on sites. Two families of trapping sites can be detected and are related to the presence of monoclinic and tetragonal phases.

It is suggested that the charge spreading characteristics may reflect the insulator aptitude to develop water tree. It will be shown that the observations which are made during high voltage can be reproduced under electron irradiation. Also, the correlation is illustrated in the field of Mechanics.

The Committee applies these supports to recommend the parameters to measure and the experimental procedures to follow.

As a result, several works have been devoted to modeling and predicting the transient response of both sensible and latent heat storage devices, over a variety of geometry. Following the current trend, latent heat storage on encapsulated phase change material (PCM) was chosen as the object of the present work. Since the main feature is to take advantage of the high storage capacity offered by the latent beat, this work only deals with situations with small values of the Stefan number (Ste) which allow the solidification to be predicted by a quasi-stationary model. To obtain more general results, all the physical variables are arranged in non-dimensional groups, the influence of which on the response of the storage unit is evaluated in order to provide guidelines to the design and operation of those devices. Several assumptions are made with a view to maintain the model as simple as possible, without disregarding a careful reflection about its accuracy and impact on the reliability of the solution. The transient behavior of the storage unit is described by the evolution of the outlet temperature, as well as the thermal resistance ratio (TRR) through the discharge process. To ratify the model, some comparisons with previously published works are provided, showing not only qualitative but quantitative concurrency as well.",,"Flow of fluids; Flow patterns; Heat resistance; Heat transfer; Mathematical models; Phase transitions; Specific heat; Thermal conductivity; Phase change materials; Stefan number; Thermal resistance ratio; Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11644311415

However, due to the speckle noises and the ill-defined edges of the object of interest, the classic image segmentation techniques are frequently ineffective in segmenting ultrasound images. It is either difficult to identify the actual edges or the derived boundaries are disconnected in the images. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for segmentation of general ultrasound images, which is composed of two major techniques, namely the early vision model and the discrete snake model. By simulating human early vision, the early vision model can highlight the edges and, at the same time, suppress the speckle noises in an ultrasound image. The discrete snake model carries out energy minimization on the distance map rather than performing snake deformation on the original image as other snake models did. Moreover, instead of searching the next position for a snaxel along its searching path pixel by pixel, the discrete model only consider the local maxima as the searching space. The new segmentation algorithm has been verified on clinical ultrasound images and the derived boundaries of the object of interest are quite consistent with those specified by medical doctors. ©2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Discrete snake model; Early vision model; Image segmentation; Snake; Speckles; Texture; Ultrasound","Acoustic waves; Digital image storage; Edge detection; Image segmentation; Imaging systems; Medical imaging; Object recognition; Pixels; Speckle; Textures; Ultrasonic transmission; Ultrasonics; Discrete models; Discrete snake model; Distance maps; Early vision model; Energy minimizations; Local maximum; Medical doctors; Novel algorithms; Object of interests; Original images; Quantitative analysis; Searching spaces; Segmentation algorithms; Segmentation techniques; Snake; Speckle noise; Ultrasound; Ultrasound images; Ultrasonic imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342606699

In this paper we use a simple model of a typical solar car to find a driving strategy that maximises the distance travelled in a single day. We show that the optimal driving strategy is a modified speedholding strategy with an upper holding speed and a lower holding speed. When solar power is high the upper holding speed is maintained and excess power is stored in the energy storage system.

Interstitial pO2 was compared in canine hearts stored for 12 hours in this device (n = 5) and in static hypothermic storage (n = 5), Temperature was maintained at 4°C in both groups. Effluent from microdialysis probes positioned within the left ventricular wall was analyzed for interstitial pH, pCO2, pO2, high energy phosphates, adenosine, and inosine each hour for 12 hours. Initial interstitial pO2 in both groups exceeded 150 mmHg. In perfused hearts pO2 declined 30% by the twelfth hour while complete depletion of oxygen within 6 hours was noted in the static storage group. ATP remained low in this group while ADP and AMP peaked at 2 hours and disappeared by 5 hours. Adenosine peaked at 4 hours and declined to low levels by 8 hours. Inosine levels gradually increased during storage and peaked at 12 hours. In the perfused hearts no ATP, ADP or AMP, adenosine or inosine was found interstitially. 780 liters of oxygen were expended during the 12 hours of operation. There was no significant organ weight gain in either group.

HI-treatment (420 W m-2, 1 h) caused an inhibition of about 40 % in ES(PS2) and an enhancement of about 60 % in ES(PS1). The rate of PS1 cyclic electron transport, measured with 705 nm modulated radiation, also increased in HI-treated leaves. There was a clear state 1-state 2 transition in HI-treated leaves. ES(PS1) increased significantly and ES(PS2) decreased drastically in leaves preadapted to state 1 after HI (600 W m-2, 30 min) treatment. Thus, the increase in PS1 activity observed immediately after HI-treatment in leaves preadapted to state 1 can be due to the coupling of LHC2 to PS1 during the HI-treatment. Further, the dissociation of LHC2 from PS2 during the HI-treatment resulted in apparently (about 15%) greater inhibition than the 'true' inhibition of PS2 activity. The presence of LHC2 with PS2 (state 1) at the time of HI-treatment caused no additional damage to PS2 or its coupling to PSI offered no apparent protection to the photosynthetic apparatus.","Acer saccharum; Light-harvesting complex 2; Photoacoustic spectroscopy","irradiation; photosystem I; photosystem II; stress tolerance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032445043

In this investigation, we compared the negative and positive external work produced at individual limb joints of running dogs to evaluate which muscle-tendon systems contribute to elastic storage and to determine the extent to which the external work of locomotion is produced by muscles that shorten actively rather than by muscles that function as springs. We found that the negative and positive external work of the extensor muscles is not allocated equally among the different joints and limbs. During both trotting and galloping, the vast majority of the negative work was produced by the two distal joints, the wrist and ankle. The forelimb produced most of the negative work in both the trot and the gallop. The hindlimb produced most of the positive work during galloping, but not during trotting. With regards to elastic storage, our results indicate that the forelimb of dogs displays a greater potential for storage and recovery of elastic energy than does the hindlimb. Elastic storage appears to be more important during trotting than during galloping, and elastic storage appears to be more pronounced in the extensor muscles of the distal joints than in the extensor muscles of the proximal joints. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that a significant portion of the external work of locomotion, 26% during trotting and 56% during galloping, is produced by actively shortening muscles. We conclude that, although elastic storage of energy is extremely important to the economy of running gaits, actively shortening muscles do make an important contribution to the work of locomotion.","Dog; Galloping; Locomotion; Locomotor energetics; Muscle; Trotting; Work of locomotion","animal; article; biomechanics; dog; elasticity; energy metabolism; forelimb; hindlimb; joint; physiology; running; skeletal muscle; tendon; Animals; Biomechanics; Dogs; Elasticity; Energy Metabolism; Forelimb; Hindlimb; Joints; Muscle, Skeletal; Running; Tendons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032435110

About 3,580 cubic feet per second annually is recharged to the San Luis Basin. Recharge to the Mesilla Basin in southern New Mexico and western Texas annually is 6 cubic feet per second. Basin-fill deposits, including fan deposits, river alluvium, and unconsolidated to consolidated sediments and some volcanics of the Santa Fe Group or Gila Conglomerate are hydraulically connected and form an aquifer system. Coarse-grained sediments were deposited by the relatively high energy ancestral Rio Grande; whereas, fine-grained lake or playa sediments were deposited in topographically closed basins. Simulation of ground-water flow in the San Luis Basin indicates that of the 535 cubic feet per second of water that was withdrawn from the basin-fill aquifer system in 1980, 80 percent was from salvaged evapotranspiration, 14 percent was from aquifer storage, and 6 percent was from streamflow capture. Ground water in the southeastern part of the Albuquerque-Belen Basin contains calcium and sulfate as primary ions. The ground-water flow model of the Albuquerque-Belen Basin shows that from 1976 to 1979 ground-water withdrawals outside the flood plain were composed of 36 percent intercepted ground-water discharge to the flood-plain system, 32 percent induced recharge from the flood plain; 25 percent aquifer storage; and 7 percent underflow from the Santo Domingo Basin, to the north. Ground water east of the Rio Grande valley in the Socorro Basin contains large percentages of calcium, magnesium, and sulfate. Ground water in the southern part of the Rio Grande valley generally has a larger percentage of sodium and a smaller percentage of sulfate than ground water in the northern part of the valley. Water is a calcium bicarbonate type in the La Jencia Basin, in the principal recharge area to the east. The increase in the percent of sodium downgradient from the recharge area is significant.The Mesilla Basin ground water is a sodium and sulfate type water along the northwest basin margin. The ground-water flow model shows that for nonirrigation ground-water withdrawals in the Mesilla Basin, 80 percent is from the surface-water system, including streamflow capture; 10 percent is from aquifer storage; and 10 percent is from salvaged evapotranspiration. Ground-water movement in the study area is generally from west and east to the center of the valley and then southward. Through much of the study area the Rio Grande flood plain acts as a drain for the basin-fill aquifer system. Temperature of ground water from the San Luis Basin south to the northern end of the Albuquerque-Belen Basin generally ranges from 5 to 15 degrees Celsius. South of the northern end of the Albuquerque-Belen Basin the ground-water temperature generally ranges from 15.1 to 25 degrees Celsius. Ground water generally has a specific conductance less than 750 microsiemens per centimeter at 25 degrees Celsius, north of the Albuquerque-Belen Basin. East of the Rio Grande and south of the Albuquerque-Belen Basin the specific conductance of water is usually in the range of 751 to 2,250 microsiemens per centimeter at 25 degrees Celsius. Chemical processes affecting ground-water quality are dissolution of calcite, dolomite, gypsum, and halite; precipitation of calcite and dolomite; exchange of calcium for sodium; and mixing of local recharge, geothermal, or inflowing ground water from adjacent basins with ground water in the area of study. Recharge to basins is predominantly from uplifted areas east and west of the basins. Runoff from snowmelt and storms infiltrates the alluvial material near the contact of the alluvium and rocks of the uplifted areas. Irrigation is the primary use of surface water in open basins. In closed basins 93 percent of the irrigated acreage uses ground water as a source. In the Albuquerque-Belen Basin from 1975 to 1985, at least 90 percent of ground-water withdrawals were for uses other than agriculture. In the Mesilla Basin from 1975 to 1985, 32 to 45 percent of all ground water withdrawn was for nonagricultural uses.",,"alluvial deposit; basin; basin analysis; groundwater flow; hydrogeochemistry; hydrogeology; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032432443

It is by specific metabolic adaptations that anurans are able to tolerate prolonged exposure to harsh environmental stresses. In this study, it was hypothesized that livers from an aquatic frog would possess an inherent metabolic ability to sustain high levels of ATP in an isolated organ system, providing insight into a metabolic system that is well-adapted for low temperature in vitro organ storage. Frogs of the species, R. pipiens were acclimated at 20 °C and at 5 °C. Livers were preserved using a clinical preservation solution after flushing. Livers from 20 °C-acclimated frogs were stored at 20 °C and 5 °C and livers from 5 °C-acclimated frogs were stored at 5 °C. The results indicated that hepatic adenylate status was maintained for 96 h during 5 °C storage, but not longer than 4 10 h during 20 °C storage. In livers from 5 °C-acclimated animals subjected to 5 °C storage, ATP was maintained at 100% throughout the 96-h period. Warm acclimation (20 °C) and 20 °C storage resulted in poorer maintenance of ATP; energy charge values dropped to 0.50 within 2 h and by 24 h, only 24% of control ATP remained. Lactate levels remained less than 25 μmol/g dry weight in all 5 °C-stored livers; 20 °C-stored livers exhibited greater accumulation of this anaerobic end-product (lactate reached 45-50 μmol/g by 10 h). The data imply that hepatic adenylate status is largely dependent on exposure to hypothermic hypoxia and although small amounts of ATP were accounted for by anaerobic glycolysis, there must have been either a substantial reduction in cellular energy-utilization or an efficient use of low oxygen tensions.","Anaerobic metabolism; Hypothermia; Hypoxia; In vitro liver storage","adenine nucleotide; glucose; lactic acid; anaerobic growth; animal; anoxia; article; body water; energy metabolism; frog; hypothermia; in vitro study; liver; metabolism; physiology; Adenine Nucleotides; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Anoxia; Body Water; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Hypothermia; Lactic Acid; Liver; Rana pipiens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032417866

HI-treatment at 900-4400 μmol m-2 s-1 for 15 min caused an increase in heat emission and a decrease in ES(T). In some leaves, HI-treatment of 900 μmol m-2 s-1 for 1 min induced a rapid increase in heat emission with a marginal decrease in ES(T). Parallel to the increase in heat emission, there was a decrease in fluorescence, and this phenomenon was reversible in darkness. Quenching of thermal energy dissipation and a recovery in ES(T) were observed during the first 15 min after the HI-treatment. This down-regulation of photochemical activity and its recovery may be one of the photoprotective mechanisms in shade grown sugar maple plants. The increase in thermal energy dissipation was greater in the red absorbing long wavelength (640-700 nm) region than in the blue absorbing short wavelength region of photosynthetically active excitation radiation. The photochemical activity was affected more in short wavelengths (400-520 nm) than in the long wavelength region of the spectrum. This can be due to the migration of light-harvesting chlorophyll (Chl) a/b protein complex from photosystem (PS) 2 to PS1 and/or to the disconnection of carotenoid pool from Chls in the pigment bed of photosynthetic apparatus.","Acer saccharum; Fluorescence; Photoacoustic spectroscopy; Photoinhibition; Photoprotection; Photosystems","fluorescence; irradiation; light harvesting complex; photosynthesis; photosystem II; stress tolerance; Acer saccharum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032415540

The activity of lysosomal enzymes reflects the autolytic capacity which could be used during the transfer of reserves between storage and reproductive tissues or for mobilisation of reserves for energy requirements. The peak of lysosomal enzyme activities in mantle tissue in June 1992 probably was related with autolysis of storage cells to support maturation of the developing gametes. A second peak of lysosomal enzyme activity which occurred in mid-August of 1992 and 1993 may help to cover energetic requirements of maintenance metabolism during this period of high temperatures and reduced food quality. Measures of the destabilization of lysosomal membranes in the digestive gland confirmed that mussels showed a significant stress response in mid-August. Mussels from the stock with a higher susceptibility to summer mortality underwent a longer period of stress and accumulated less glycogen between spawning and the stressful period in mid-August than mussels from the more resistant stock. In conclusion, our field observations demonstrate high activities of lysosomes not only in spawning periods but also during stressful periods of high temperatures and reduced food quality.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032414573

By means of electron-spectroscopic imaging and electron-energy-loss spectroscopy it could be shown that these electron-dense particles consist mainly of iron.

The properties of the bridge determine the flexibility of the whole bichromophoric structure. For a bichromophoric molecule the electronic absorption spectrum can be described by a simple superposition of the absorption spectra of the two chromophores. The bridge serves as a molecular spacer unit which does not influence the basic electronic structure of the two chromophores while preventing intrachromophore interaction in their ground state. However, electronic excitation of either chromophore may lead to intramolecular electronic interactions and to the observation of phenomena such as intramolecular complex formation intramolecular proton transfer, intramolecular electron transfer intramolecular electronic energy transfer.

Henriet and J. Mienert). Questions concerning clathrate hydrate as an energy resource, as a factor in modifying global climate and as a triggering mechanism for mass movements invite consideration of what factors promote hydrate concentration, and what the quintessential hydrate-rich sediment may be. Gas hydrate field data, although limited, provide a starting point for identifying the environments and processes that lead to more massive concentrations. Gas hydrate zones are up to 30 m thick and the vertical range of occurrence at a site may exceed 200 m. Zones typically occur more than 100m above the phase boundary. Thicker zones are overwhelmingly associated with structural features and tectonism, and often contain sand. It is unclear whether an apparent association between zone thickness and porosity represents a cause-and-effect relationship. The primary control on the thickness of a potential gas hydrate reservoir is the geological setting. Deep water and low geothermal gradients foster thick gas hydrate stability zones (GHSZs). The presence of faults, fractures, etc. can favour migration of gas-rich fluids. Geological processes, such as eustacy or subsidence, may alter the thickness of the GHSZ or affect hydrate concentratiion. Tectonic forces may promote injection of gas into the GHSZ.

Early, non-destructive, breakdowns on thinner oxides are difficult to detect. The early breakdowns, often called extrinsic breakdowns, may be the more important of the two breakdowns, since the early failures probably determine field returns and fabrication yield. However, when attempting to measure the distributions of these two types of failures it is necessary to consume a lot of time making a large number of breakdown measurements, since in modern IC fabrication very few early failures occur. In this paper we describe two techniques for simplifying the measurement of the early failure distributions. In one technique we purposely trigger the hard-to-measure early failures into a thermal, dielectric breakdown by adding more energy to the breakdown path during the triggering of an early breakdown. The added energy heats the dielectric to the point where a stable melted region is formed between the two electrodes. In the second technique a high-speed storage oscilloscope is used to record (a) the times of all early, non-destructive breakdowns (b) the time of the final, thermal, dielectric breakdown, and (c) the wave shapes of all of the breakdowns. This second measurement technique uses less time and a smaller number of test structures than does the more conventional technique using large numbers of breakdown measurements.",,"Dielectric properties of solids; Electric breakdown of solids; Oxides; Reliability; Thin films; Dielectric breakdown; Integrated circuit manufacture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032320701

Poor integration of the LP cogen system into the college's existing high-pressure (HP) steam boiler plant led to under-utilization of cogenerated steam during the non-space-heating season. To improve steam-plant operations, the college's facilities management staff implemented a plan to convert HP steam loads to LP, replace HP steam boilers with LP equipment, and improve the use of cogenerated steam through the installation of a hot water thermal energy storage (TES) system. A study was commissioned that identified the plant's peak winter steam requirements and the typical steam profile for the non-space-heating season. Data from this work helped draw two conclusions: (1) converting HP steam loads to LP would boost demand for cogenerated steam, and (2) a hot water TES system could further utilize a portion of remaining excess cogen steam for the manufacture and storage of the kitchen's domestic water for use during peak steam demand periods. Combined, these two measures were estimated to improve utilization of cogenerated LP steam by 5,000 kg per day and reduce boiler fuel consumption by 4,220,000 MJ each season. Overall this paper demonstrates the energy and cost inefficiencies that may result if the opportunities to use waste heat from cogeneration systems are incorrectly identified.",,"Boilers; Cost accounting; Efficiency; Heat storage; Hot water heating; Steam engineering; Steam conversion; Cogeneration plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032317518

The current implementation uses form factor and anomalous scattering amplitude data from the Livermore Evaluated Photon Data Library. Interaction probability and angular distribution tables for several human tissues and common detector materials were calculated using the independent atoms approximation and human-tissue composition data from the ICRP Reference Man. These data were also used to generate new tables for photoelectric absorption and Compton scatter, significantly improving the accuracy of SimSET and extending its photon tracking capability to lower photon energy (from 50 keV to 1 keV).

The Army has significant need for lightweight materials in these applications, but the materials have to withstand harsh ballistic and environmental conditions. For projectiles, composite materials are needed as structural members to launch submunitions. These materials must be light, since their mass is parasitic to the limited kinetic energy available for projectile acceleration, and stiff to provide structural support for the submunitions, but they must also be able survive the intense three-dimensional impulse loading associated with launch. Two of these applications, the high capacity artillery shell and the sabot for a kinetic energy penetrator, are described.

Three-dimensional simulations confirm that charge collection is similar in the two cases. Standard lowenergy heavy ion tests are more cost-effective and appear to be sufficient for CMOS technologies down to 0.5 um.

This is a result of the increased sensitivity of modern electrical equipment to power system disturbances, of which voltage sags and momentary interruptions are the most disrupting. Some of the most sensitive equipment are adjustable speed drives (ASDs), which are prevalent in modern manufacturing facilities. Where continuous processes are interrupted due to the inability of ASDs to ride through sags or momentary interruptions, heavy financial losses can be incurred. When the speed and output torque of the machine need to be preserved throughout the disturbance and the power system cannot provide full power to the load, an energy storage system is required. Power quality surveys have shown that the majority of voltage sags and momentary interruptions last less than 3 seconds, therefore the energy storage system is required to effectively provide a short burst of power.

The asset value of storage facilities increased rapidly because of the rapid growth in demand for storage related products. Pumped hydroelectric storage is the most common form of energy storage in the electric power industry today. Asset values for these facilities are likely to increase as wholesale power markets deregulate, resulting in windfalls to current owners.

Third generation synchrotron radiation sources provide a brilliance in the 1020 range, in the usual units, for 10 keV photon beams. Such a performance approaches the ultimate limit imposed by the diffraction limit of synchrotron radiation emission. A gain of up to 6 orders of magnitude, with respect to the brilliance of second generation sources, was obtained by reducing transverse electron beam emittances and by optimising undulator radiation. The horizontal emittance was dramatically decreased by reducing the dispersion function in the bending magnets. As a consequence, the dispersion of the electron revolution time around the ring, as a function of energy, was reduced. Under this quasi-isochronous condition, electron bunch lengths were naturally shortened and reached the few tens of ps range. The quasi-isochronous tuning of storage rings was further tested on third generation rings to evaluate the possibilities of reaching the subpicosecond range and improving the present peak brilliance of 1023. Unfortunately, the nature of the electromagnetic environment, with which the electron bunch interacts, makes the bunch lengthen with increasing current. Best predictions of peak brilliance performances achievable on storage rings will leave them far behind linac driven FEL sources if the principle of Self Amplified Spontaneous Emission works as predicted.",,"Electron beams; Particle beam dynamics; Performance; Synchrotron radiation; X rays; Beam bunching; Storage rings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032308888

In the simplest models, mixing is assumed to be uniform throughout the tank. Other models permit spatial variation of mixing intensity. Published models were developed by adjusting model parameters to achieve qualitative agreement with measured profiles. The literature does not describe quantitative criteria for evaluating the performance of mixing models. This paper describes a method that can be used to determine the relative spatial distribution of mixing effects directly from experimental data. It also illustrates a method for quantitative comparison of experimental and modeled temperature profiles. The mixing calculation procedure may be applied to instantaneous spatial temperature data if temperature sensor spacing is sufficiently small. When sensors are widely spaced, time series data taken at individual sensors provide better accuracy. A criterion for maximum sensor spacing is proposed. The application of these procedures to time series charge-cycle operating data from a full-scale chilled-water thermal storage system serving a large medical center is described.

The AWD technique measures the elastic energy storage and dissipative loss within a SAM adsorbed onto the electrodes of a quartz crystal microbalance. For C12, C14 and C18 SAMs, the storage modulus increases with alkane chain length, but the loss modulus exhibits no systematic correlation. To investigate the origins of energy dissipation, we used a new, high-sensitivity oscillator circuit to simultaneously monitor the adsorption kinetics and acoustic damping during monolayer growth from the gas phase.

When a thermoelectric generator is operated by using heat stored in a thermal accumulator, the temperature of heat source drops and causes decrease of generated power and conversion efficiency. In this case to obtain maximum electricity generated from the limited mass of heat the thermoelectric generator should be controlled as the conversion efficiency could be maximum by monitoring the temperature of the heat medium and the net power which is subtracted the pumping power required for circulation from the gross power.

The coupled vibration modes of the system consist of disk modes, in which the disk dominates the system deformation, and spindle modes, in which the spindle dominates the system deformation. Both the natural frequencies and vibration modes are strongly affected by disk flexibility. If the membrane stresses associated with disk rotation are neglected then the system exhibits flutter instabilities, but these instabilities are not present when membrane stresses are included. Natural frequency veering between disk and spindle frequencies is prominent at low speeds and substantially affects the spectrum and stability. No veering is observed at high speeds where rotational stress stiffening diminishes disk-spindle coupling and causes the natural frequencies to converge to those of a rotating spindle carrying a rigid disk. Changes to the vibration modes are examined in terms of a strain energy ratio measuring the contribution of the disk strain energy to the total modal strain energy.",,"Galerkin methods; Natural frequencies; Rotation; Stability; Strain measurement; Stresses; Vibrations (mechanical); Rotating disk spindle system; Strain energy ratio; Magnetic disk storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032299799

This is combined with a one-hot encoding for the offset. Several improvements to this basic strategy are also described. The approach has been applied to several address streams, broken down into instruction-only, data-only, and instruction-data traces, to evaluate the effect on separate and shared address buses. Moreover, the effect of instruction and data caches is evaluated. For the case without caches, the proposed scheme is specially beneficial for data-address and shared buses, which are the cases where other codings are less effective. On the other hand, for the case with caches the best scheme for the instruction-only and data-only traces is the WZE, whereas for the instruction-data traces it is either the WZE or the bus-invert with four groups (depending on the energy overhead of these techniques). © 1998 IEEE.","Address bus; Encoding for low power; Input-output energy; Low-power; Microprocessor","Buffer storage; Energy utilization; Signal encoding; Working-zone encoding; Microprocessor chips",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032287846

In the dynamic frequency scheme, all units are driven by a single clock line which changes at run time depending on the functional unit active at that time. This feature of dynamic frequency clocking gives enough slack for multiples voltages to be used for energy minimization. DFMVS has been applied to some DSP benchmarks and the results show an average reduction of 31.6% in energy dissipated as compared to using a uni-frequency clocking scheme with a single supply voltage.",,"Algorithms; Digital signal processing; Dynamic frequency clocking and multiple voltage scaling (DFCMVS); Storage allocation (computer)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032285012

The machine will be housed in the existing LEP tunnel and requires 16 m long superconducting bending magnets. The vacuum chamber will be the inner wall of the cryostat and hence at the temperature of the magnet cold bore, i.e. at 1.9 K and therefore a very good cryopump. To reduce the cryogenic power consumption, the heat load from synchrotron radiation and from the image currents in the vacuum chamber will be absorbed on a `beam screen', which operates between 5 and 20 K, inserted in the magnet cold bore. The design pressure necessary for operation must provide a lifetime of several days and a further stringent requirement comes from the power deposition in the superconducting magnet coils due to protons scattered on the residual gas which could lead to a magnet quench. Cryopumping of gas on the cold surfaces provides the necessary low gas densities but it must be ensured that the vapour pressure of cryosorbed molecules, of which H2 and He would be the most critical species, remains within acceptable limits.

The results confirm the impedance calculations for the two types of cavities. The accuracy of the measurements was considerably improved by determining simultaneously the orbits of bunches with different currents.

If large enough, such an energy transfer may eject the particle out of the bunch. If a particle is scattered in the dispersive region, it will induce a horizontal betatron oscillation which will be coupled into vertical motion when it passes through skew components. The amount of coupling is expressed in terms of the coupling coefficient, χ. If the coupling coefficient is large enough, the resulting vertical oscillations may exceed the normally small vertical admittance of the ring. Thus the particles may be lost even though the energy loss is within the momentum acceptance. The lifetime associated with this loss mechanism is called the extended Touschek lifetime.

Each modulator contains over 1300 field-effect transistors (FETs) that quickly connect and disconnect four banks of energy storage capacitors to a magnetic induction core. The FETs are commanded on and off by an optical signal that determines the duration of the accelerating pulse. Further electronic circuitry is provided that resets the magnetic cores in each modulator immediately after the accelerating pulse. The system produces bursts of five or more pulses with an adjustable pulse width that ranges from 200 ns to 2 μs. The pulse duty factor within a burst can be as high as 25% while still allowing time for the induction core to reset. The solid-state modulator described above is called ARM-II and is named for the Advanced Radiographic Machine (ARM) - a powerful radiographic accelerator that will be the principal diagnostic device for the future Advanced Hydrotest Facility (AHF).",,"Capacitors; Electron beams; Energy storage; Field effect transistors; Modulators; Advanced radiographic machines (ARM); Pulse repetition frequency induction accelerators; Particle accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032278104

To detect these modes, experiments were performed where pairs of bunches of positrons were run through at various spacings. It was hoped that constructive and destructive interference of wake fields would produce varying amounts of heating. Data taking was time consuming, and insufficient numbers of data points could be taken to fit to the wake fields. To help solve this, the frequency of the mode was measured on the bench. A single trapped mode and its profile were observed. The trapped mode has a frequency of 3.59 GHz, just below the TM cutoff of the beampipe. Measurements of the mode were used to predict a shunt impedance of 4.9 ohms. The corresponding loss factor is slightly higher than the total loss factor found in previous time domain measurements.

These analog realizations are often used because they are smaller and consume less power than their digital counterparts. However, class-IV signaling allows simplifications during Viterbi detection and thus existing analog decoders have limited applications. The purpose of this paper is to develop efficient analog circuits that can be used for general Viterbi detection. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the analog portions of two analog Viterbi decoders were fabricated in a 0.8-jum BiCMOS process. With an off-chip digital path memory, operation up to 50 Mb/s is demonstrated. However, simulations indicate that with on-chip digital path memory, speeds on the order of 300 Mb/s can be achieved. The power consumption of the proposed approach is estimated to be 15 mW/state drawn from a single 5-V power supply.

The klystron pulse modulators must therefore provide a pulse-to-pulse repeatability of 0.1% in order for the beam to have the required energy stability. The modulators have had difficulty achieving the necessary repeatability since the pulse forming network (PFN) charging scheme does not include a deQing circuit. Several of the major charging circuit components are also less reliable than desired. In order to increase operating reliability and to improve pulse-to-pulse stability, it is planned to replace the high voltage power supplies in all modulators with constant-current power supplies. A new modulator charging supply that contains two EMI series 303 constant-current power supplies was constructed. Each of these EMI supplies delivers 1.5 A at up to 40 kV.

The RTL contains a bunch compressor which introduces a large energy variation across the bunch and hence a larger transverse beam size. Since 1994 the compressor amplitude has been operating at higher than design voltage. While advantageous for shaping the bunch distribution, this increased the bunch energy spread and therefore resulted in more beam loss. Moreover, due to current-dependent bunch lengthening in the damping ring, the higher the beam current, the more the current loss. To avoid such losses, the bunch length may be precompressed in the damping ring. Until recently, bunch precompression with high beam currents was not stable. In this paper we identify the reasons for the difficulties, describe the changes made to accommodate bunch precompression, and discuss performance aspects after implementation.

The project is in the research stage, with construction funding beginning next year. The SNS is comprised of an ion source, a 1000 MeV, H- linear accelerator, an accumulator ring, a neutron producing target, and experimental area to utilize the scattering of the neutrons. The linear accelerator is RF driven, and the peak beam current is 27 mA and the beam duty factor is 5.84%. The peak RF power required is 104 MW, and the H- beam pulse length is 0.97 ms at a 60 Hz repetition rate. The RF pulses must be about 0.1 ms longer than the beam pulses, due to the Q of the accelerating cavities, and the time required to establish control of the cavity fields. The modulators for the klystrons in this accelerator are discussed in this paper. The SNS is designed to be expandable, so the beam power can be doubled or even quadrupled in the future. One of the double-power options is to double the beam pulse length and duty factor. We are specifying the klystrons to operate in this twice-duty-factor mode, and the modulator also should be expandable to 2 ms pulses at 60 Hz. Due to the long pulse length and low RF frequency of 805 MHz, the klystron power is specified at 2.5 MW peak, and the RF system will have 56 klystrons at 805 MHz, and three 1.25 MW peak power klystrons at 402.5 MHz for the low energy portion of the accelerator.

Accordingly, a linear model was chosen and fitted to data obtained from a fuller range (3 hours) of the complete relaxation curve. The relaxation times extracted from this model were approximately 10 minutes and 5 hours. Fourier transform of the relaxation curve allows the storage modulus and the loss modulus of the relaxation spectrum to be shown separately as functions of frequency. Fourier analysis shows that the cervical spine has a wide and smooth distribution of relaxation times. Examination of the higher frequency components of the relaxation in the region of 1 to 20 Hz show the loss modulus to be almost flat and tending towards zero. This work shows that while the disc is capable of dissipating a large proportion of the applied strain energy, it can only do this slowly, and the discs of the cervical spine are inefficient as `shock absorbers' of axial loads.",,"Bone; Fourier transforms; Joints (anatomy); Load testing; Mathematical models; Spectroscopic analysis; Strain; Stress analysis; Stress relaxation; Loss modulus; Storage modulus; Biomechanics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032256014

The high beam currents are achieved by storing a large number of bunches (several hundred to several thousand) into each beam. Two designs, the ones located at SLAC and KEK, also have asymmetric beam energies. This imparts a boost to the nearly stationary B mesons formed from the decay of the 4S resonance and allows precision vertex tracking detectors to look for a difference between the decay profiles of the matter and anti-matter B mesons, thereby observing a violation of CP. Bringing the stored beams into collision is one of the major challenges of any B-factory design. In order to achieve high luminosity the beams must be tightly focused. This pushes the final focusing elements close enough to the interaction point to be inside the solenoidal field of the physics detector. In addition, beam-related detector backgrounds from synchrotron radiation and scattered beam particles must be kept below an acceptable level. The major B-factory designs at Cornell University, KEK, and SLAC have all addressed these problems in various ways that depend on specific accelerator design decisions. This paper discusses the accelerator parameters and detector constraints that influence an interaction region (IR) design, as well as how the various IR designs address the challenges posed by a high luminosity B-factory.",,"Particle beam dynamics; Particle beam tracking; Particle detectors; Synchrotron radiation; Interaction region; Vertex tracking detectors; Storage rings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032255024

The SMES unit is used to improve the dynamic performance of P-f and Q-V loops of a power system. Two independent fuzzy controllers are assigned, one for the frequency control and another for the voltage control. Speed deviation (Δω) and acceleration of a synchronous generator are taken as the input signals to the Fuzzy Frequency Controller (FFC). The terminal voltage deviation (ΔVt) and its derivative are considered as the inputs to the Fuzzy Voltage Controller (FVC). To get the maximum benefit from the SMES unit, a supplementary control is generated by using the output of FFC and the inductor current deviation (ΔIsm) as inputs. ΔIsm is also used as a negative feedback signal to ensure the SMES energy is restored to its predisturbance level. The desired P-modulation from the SMES is obtained by adding this supplementary control signal to the output of FFC while the output of the FVC is the desired Q-modulation. The effective use of the SMES unit is verified for small as well as large disturbances for a single machine infinite bus system, and simulation results are presented and discussed.",,"Electric energy storage; Electric frequency control; Fuzzy control; Superconducting devices; Synchronous generators; Voltage control; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Electric power systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032231195

This paper addresses the scientific issues underlying the challenge of making major improvements in future generations of GMR spin valves, assesses the likelihood of making such improvements, and will outline some of the trade-offs in spin valve properties that will probably have to be made in memory applications. In our research on the underlying scientific issues, we have found that many of the magnetic and magnetoresistive properties of spin valves are strongly influenced by surface and interface effects occurring during film deposition. Some of the most important issues are the balance of surface and interface free energies, surface diffusion, interdiffusion at interfaces, low-temperature deposition, the use of surfactants to modify growth, and specular electron scattering at surfaces. In some cases, it is possible to control these factors or to use them to manipulate the growth or improve post-growth processing of spin valves to improve their magnetic and magnetoresistive properties. If research on these topics can be increased, it is very likely that major improvements can be made in the properties of future generations of GMR spin valves.",,"Deposition; Electron scattering; Interdiffusion (solids); Interfacial energy; Magnetic films; Magnetic properties; Magnetization; Magnetoresistance; Surface properties; Giant magnetoresistance spin valves; Ultrahigh density nonvolatile memory; Nonvolatile storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032226499

Such a technique is useful, for example, in a process of removing distortions on magnetic head components for a better contact between the magnetic disk head and the hard disk surface. Experiments are conducted to study the bending behavior of stainless steel and ceramics due to laser irradiation. A pulsed Nd:YLF laser beam is used to scan over the specimen to create out-of-plane deformation. The amount of deformation from each laser scan is correlated with various laser and processing parameters. A theoretical model of the laser deformation process is presented based on thermo-elasticity/plasticity. The laser deformation process is explained as the result of the laser-induced non-uniform distribution of the residual strain. Numerical simulations are carried out to estimate the laser-induced temperature field, the residual stress field, and the amount of deformation of the specimen. These theoretical studies help to understand the complex phenomena involved in the pulsed laser deformation process.","Curvature modification; Laser bending; Laser forming; Pulsed laser; Thermal stress; Thermo-mechanics","Computer simulation; Deformation; Hard disk storage; Laser beam effects; Neodymium lasers; Pulsed laser applications; Stainless steel; Laser forming; Ceramic materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032225637

A generator with an inductive energy storage and semiconducting opening switch was used for discharge formation. The generator was shown to be very promising for development of efficient discharge HF lasers with high output energy. It produces very uniform discharge in SF6-H2(C3H8) gas mixtures at elevated pressure and increases its stability. Discharge HF laser efficiency up to 5,5% was demonstrated. Radially convergent e-beam was used to pump 30 1 HF laser. Optimal gas mixture SF6:H2 = 8:1 under pressure of 0.45 atm was chosen to provide no more that two-fold specific output power variations across the laser beam area. Output energy as high as 115 J and efficiency with respect to e-beam energy deposited into gas mixture up to 7-8% were demonstrated. Total laser energy and efficiency with respect to deposited energy at pressure of 1.1 atm when the output distribution was non-uniform were found to be up to 200 J and 11%, respectively. The ""jump"" of pressure in SF6-H2 mixture at the instance of e-beam injection was found to be lower than that in excimer laser mixtures due to SF6 high density. This simplifies creation of wide-aperture e-beam HF-lasers. We expect that the use of pulse generators and wide-aperture laser setup available at HCEI enable us to develop 1 kJ non-chain HF laser initiated either by self-sustained discharge or e-beam.","Discharge non-chain HF lasers; e-beam; Generator with inductive energy storage; High efficiency; Semiconducting opening switch","Electric discharges; Electron beams; Energy storage; Excimer lasers; Gas lasers; Magnetic field effects; Pumping (laser); Semiconducting opening switches; Chemical lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032225426

The degree of 'localization' of such charge depends on the nature of this coupling. In this way, trapping at an atomic scale is described as resulting from the evolution of a coupling involving successively: the electronic polarization field, the infrared polarization field, and the quasi-static ionic polarization field. The internal energy stored in the surrounding medium polarized by the charge is high because the charge is so well localized. The maximum of this energy is obtained for the quasi-static polarization field; its magnitude is of the order of 5 to 10 eV per trapped charge. This work addresses the physics of aging and of the breakdown process on the basis of an unsustainable increase in local internal energy within the material, due to charge trapping - the polarization around a trapped charge increases the local energy; the relaxation of the material lattice then follows a rapid detrapping of charges from their sites, releasing the local excess site region energy into the material. Such a release executes transient virtual work on the material, producing macroscopic dielectric damage, and when critical, unstable conditions are achieved in the time domain, this is followed by electrical breakdown. This interpretation of electrical material breakdown is related to bulk breakdown as observed in thin film laminate structures (∼ μm) and surface flashover as seen in large structures (∼ mm to cm). © 1998 IEEE.",,"Dielectric materials; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Polarization; Semiconductor device structures; Thin films; Time domain analysis; Infrared polarization field; Macroscopic dielectric damage; Electric space charge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032182356

The battery consisted of 636 lowresistance, sealed, lead-acid batteries organized in strings that are connected to busbars via small-size contactors. A vacuum breaker serves as a closing switch, while an explosively driven opening switch interrupts the circuit, transferring the coil current to the load. In case of load malfunction, the energy stored in the coil is dumped into a dissipative load. The systems for control and measurement are decoupled from the high-current carrying conductors. In this paper, optimization of the battery-coil matching is discussed. The current sharing between the strings is analyzed. IPS parasitic inductance for different arrangements was calculated and reduced by careful design to 4 iH. PSpice simulations of the IPS accounting for nonlinearity in the components are presented. Main components, such as batteries, contactors, and protective equipment were tested under high current conditions. The IPS was evaluated both with a resistive and an electro-thermal load with stored energy up to 0.5 MJ. Power amplification of 100 was obtained.

Recent innovations in analysis of aging are introduced for predicting component performance and fault tolerance, especially relevant for very high energy storage applications necessary for next generation simulators, electrically energized fusion research machines, and advanced high power electronics for commercial, industrial, and military applications. Included in this study will be developments in capacitor technologies for electronics filtering and resonant energy transfer applications, as well as multisecond energy reservoir applications for uninterruptible power sources and the like. Next generation power electronics, driven by advances in solid state switching technologies, will require reduced capacitor dissipation factor by 1/3 to 1/10 at the same cost, particularly for ac applications. In addition, higher power electronics will require robust high frequency mica capacitor technology for >300°C operation, up to 5 kV. The increasing expansion of the motor drive and industrial switched mode power supply (SMPS) market will be driven in cost by the availability of electrolytic capacitors of 750-850 Vdc ratings, at 450 Vdc cost and size. New formation processes and electrolytes are anticipated to be needed to achieve these extended performance levels. At higher frequencies, advanced power electronics drives the need for lower equivalent series resistance (ESR) < 0.1 % to 100 MHz, multimicrofarad value solid tantalum capacitors, having fail-safe surface mount configurations. Emerging power electronics applications in the millisecond and longer time are projected to have a broad application need for electrochemical chemical double layer capacitors, especially for compact sizes as this technology has the potential of achieving energy densities of many 20 kj/kg for discharge times of tens of seconds. The prismatic power conditioning system, designed to be compliant with the available volume and surfaces into which it is to be placed, is described in some detail. It permits flexibility for the design engineer to optimize the design without having to allocate a specific space for the power conditioning system or subcomponents. Such prismatic geometry power and power conditioning systems are becoming commercially feasible in the low power consumer and industrial regime because of dramatic advances in multichip module switching, energy storage, and planarized interconnections. This work builds on assessing the applicability of these technologies to the megawatt-class average power, power electronics regime. Higher power density prismatic power electronics enables a broad range of applications in the commercial arena in areas such as motor drives, inverters, power quality systems, and mobile power systems. © 1998 IEEE.","Capacitor; Capacitor technology; Electronics capacitors; Energy storage","Capacitor storage; Electric drives; Electric switchboards; High energy physics; Military applications; Nuclear reactor simulators; Power electronics; Research reactors; Solid state devices; Surface mount technology; Tokamak devices; Uninterruptible power systems; Electrically energized fusion; Multisecond energy reservoirs; Capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032181797

The implosions were driven by the Hawk inductive-storage generator at the 0.65-MA level. Initial neutralneon density distributions from the nozzles were determined with laser interferometry. Measured yields are compared with predictions from zero-dimensional (0-D) scaling models of ideal, one-dimensional (1-D) pinch behavior to both benchmark the scaling models, and to determine their utility for predicting K -shell yields for argon implosions of 200 to >300 ns driven by corresponding currents of 4 to 9 MA, such as envisioned for the DECADE QUAD. For all three nozzles, the 0-D models correctly predict the Z-pinch mass for maximum yield. For the 1- and 1.75-cm radius nozzles, the scaling models accurately match the measured yields if the ratio of initial to final radius (compression ratio) is assumed to be 8:1. For the 2.5-cm radius nozzle, the measured yields are only one-third of the predictions. Analysis of K -shell spectral measurements suggest that as much as 70% (50%) of the imploded mass is radiating in the K -shell for the 1-cm (1.75-cm) radius nozzle. That fraction is only 10% for the 2.5-cm radius nozzle. The 0-D scaling models are useful for predicting 1-D-like K -shell radiation yields (better than a factorof-two accuracy) when a nominal ( 10:1) compression ratio is assumed. However, the compression ratio assumed in the models is only an ""effective"" quantity, so that further interpretations based on the 0-D analysis require additional justification. The lower-than-predicted yield for the 2.5-cm radius nozzle is associated with larger radius and not with longer implosion time, and is probably a result of two-dimensional effects.

This technique uses a vibrating-sample magnetometer to measure the viscosity while allowing the applied field to decay logarithmically at a rate consistent frith the measured magnetization decay. The decaying applied field simulates the decaying Ha of a broadening bit transition. The magnetic decay measured using this technique remains logarithmic in time, but is almost a factor of 4 smaller than that measured using a constant applied field. These results imply that the standard viscosity measurement is inappropriate when estimating the amount of thermal broadening due to HA within a transition.

The model predicts logarithmic magnetization decay consistent with that observed experimentally and also indicates that the viscosity measured using this technique may be a measure of the average energy barrier preventing thermal switching.","Bit transition; Demagnetizing field; Magnetic viscosity","Coercive force; Demagnetization; Magnetic recording; Magnetic relaxation; Magnetometers; Remanence; Viscosity measurement; Magnetic viscosity; Thermal relaxation; Magnetic disk storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032119819

These surfaces include bare and lubricated sputtered carbon films and a lubricated Pt(111) surface, as well as sections of a glass disk used in fly-height testing and of an actual 3.5 in disk. In each case, velocity distributions have been obtained for a wide range of scattering angles for different energies and angles of the incident N2. These distributions have been analyzed to yield effective thermal and tangential momentum accommodation coefficients. Analysis indicates that N2 is essentially fully accommodated at the test surfaces for energies characteristic of room temperature gas, with accommodation coefficients close to unity. One important exception is the case of scattering from sputtered carbon films, where the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient appears to exceed unity. A simple model is described to account for this behavior. In this model, a stream of molecules directed at a rough surface at non-normal incidence cannot strike parts of the surface in the shadow of high points. In the abse nee of diffusion, desorption then occurs preferentially from regions of the surface facing the incident stream, leading to net back-scattering. © 1998 IEEE.",,"Desorption; Magnetic bearings; Magnetic films; Magnetic recording; Mathematical models; Molecular dynamics; Sputter deposition; Molecular beam scattering; Tangential momentum accommodation coefficients; Magnetic disk storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032118084

The key issue for controlling the retention time distribution has been clarified and its model has been proposed for the first time. Trench capacitor cell with 0.6-jum ground rule was evaluated. It was found that the retention time distribution consists of ""Tail Distribution"" and ""Main Distribution."" ""Tail Distribution,"" by which DRAM refresh characteristics are restricted, depends on the boron concentration of the memory cell region. As boron concentration of the memory cell region increases, ""Tail Distribution"" is enhanced. This enhancement is due to the increase of the junction leakage current from the storage node. For the purpose of accounting for the nature of ""Tail Distribution,"" the concept of thermionic field emission (TFE) current has been introduced. The high electric field at pn junction of the storage node enhances thermionic field emission from a deep level. The activation energy of the deep level is normally distributed among the memory cells, which leads to the normal distribution of Log(retention time). Two methods for reducing ""Tail Distribution"" are proposed. One is to reduce the electric field of the depletion layer of the storage node. The other is to reduce the concentration of the deep level for TFE current. © 1998 IEEE.",,"Cellular arrays; Electric field effects; Leakage currents; Semiconducting boron; Dynamic random access memory (DRAM); Retention time distribution; Thermionic field emission (TFE); Random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032099759

The idea is to optimize the economic efficiency of power generation by scheduling appropriate parts of those loads in a way that they do consume energy when it is available at lower costs of generation and distribution.

Efficient photon gated holeburning in the 4f7 (8S7/2)-4f65d1 transition of Eu2+ is a result of photoionization of Eu2+ to Eu3+. These holes have a width of &lt;5GHz (2 K), survive thermal cycling of the phosphor up to the room temperature, 300 K, and have no detectable deterioration over more than a day of storage time at low temperature (2 K). Although self-gated holeburning is observed with the reading laser at higher powers, the photon budget for reading these holes is so small that in excess of 1000 reading cycles can be performed without destroying the optical signal. The nature of holes burned by photon-gating is found to be very different from the self-gated holes. The characteristics for the holeburning are the same in singly and doubly doped phosphors, suggesting that under the conditions of our experiments, Sm traps do not play any significant role in spectral holeburning.

The switch offers low resistance of 20 μΩ during charge intervals of several hundred milliseconds, controlled time to opening, minimal fuse size, and a relatively fast opening of 0.25-0.7ms. It serves as a closing switch as well. In a series of experiments, the current of 30-40 kA was commutated routinely from a 0.13 mH inductor into a resistive load at a voltage of 3000 V. Various quenching media were examined. The liquids were found to yield maximum inductively generated voltage and transfer efficiency. A strong correlation exists between the fuse performance and the pressure generated in the fuse. This dependence is used as a guideline in fuse design. It was found that a 2-3 ms fuse conduction time suffices for the recovery of the vacuum switch. A PSpice circuit simulation using an action-dependent fuse model is in good agreement with experimental results.

In both experiments, an electron flow toward the anode, followed by an ion flow, were observed to propagate downstream toward the load side of the plasma during the plasma opening switch (POS) conduction. In the MPOS, ion acceleration was observed to propagate axially through the entire plasma. These results are in satisfactory agreement with the predictions of the electron magneto-hydrodynamics (EHMD) theory and the results of fluid and particle-in-cell (PIC) code simulations. At the beginning of the POS opening, a high-current density (2 kA/cm2) short-duration (10-30 ns) axial ion flow downstream toward the load was observed in both experiments, with an electron beam in front of it. These ions are accelerated at the load side of the plasma and are accompanied by comoving electrons. In the NPOS, the ion energy reaches 1.35 MeV, whereas in the MPOS, the ion energy does not exceed 100 keV.

The associated high electron density leads to beam lifetime reduction due to the ""Touschek effect"", especially in low-energy machines and in the single-bunch operation mode. For this reason, several low-energy third-generation light sources cannot fully exploit their potential to increase brightness by lowering the coupling between vertical and horizontal emittance without arriving at unacceptably short beam lifetime. The ""Touschek lifetime"" can be increased if the energy acceptance of the synchrotron light storage rings could be widened beyond the usual value of ±2% which is normally provided in order to satisfy quantum lifetime requirements. The present article describes the lattice and RF system proposed for the Swiss Light Source project (SLS) that have been further optimized in order to provide energy acceptance of about ± 6%.

The BESS facility has been in operation for the last six y ear s and has been used for load leveling and peaking functions. The BESS power conversion system was built with the then state of the art technology and has a very fast response rate when changing power output of the batteries. SCE recently installed an Energy Source Power System Stabilizer (ESPSS) to test the concept of providing damping of power system swings using the ESPSS. The ESPSS basically modulates the power output / input of the energy storage batteries to respond to system frequency deviations caused by power system oscillations. The ESPSS differs from a conventional Power System Stabilizer. It is designed to change the power output of the power source rather than the voltage or the reactive power output. While installing the ESPSS several upgrades to the BESS were made to improve reliability. Installation of the ESPSS on the battery enables SCE to test the concept of system stabilization using power source output modulation instead of reactive power modulation. The energy storage batteries provide an easy test bed for conducting field tests and response of the ESPSS to system disturbances. This paper discusses the BESS, the ESPSS and presents recently recorded results from system disturbance monitoring and field tests conducted on the ESPSS and the batteries. © 1997 IEEE.",,"Direct energy conversion; Electric batteries; Electric substations; Battery energy storage systems (BESS); Energy source power system stabilizer (ESPSS); Power system stabilization; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032000278

In the charge storage mode, the diodes are periodically biased to a sub-breakdown voltage and then open-circuited. During this integration period, photo-excited and thermally generated carriers are accumulated within the structure. The dynamics of this accumulation and its effects upon the avalanching of the diode warrants a detailed, fully numerical analysis. The salient features of this investigation include device sensitivity to the input photo-current including the self-quenching effect of the diode and its limitations in sensing low light levels, the dependence of the response on the bulk lifetime and hence on the generation current within the device, the initial gain, transient response, dependence of the device uniformity upon performance, and the quantity of storable charge within the device. To achieve these tasks our device simulator, STEBS-2D, was utilized. A modified currentcontrolled boundary condition is employed which allows for the simulation of the isolated diode after the initial reset bias has been applied. With this boundary condition, it is possible to establish a steady-state voltage on the ohmic contact and then effectively remove the device from the external circuit while still including effects from surface recombination, trapped surface charge, and leakage current from the read-out electronics. © 1998 IEEE.","Avalanche photodiodes; Numerical simulation","Avalanche diodes; Boundary conditions; Charge carriers; Computer simulation; Electric breakdown of solids; Electric charge; Electric energy storage; Leakage currents; Numerical analysis; Ohmic contacts; Photoelectricity; Semiconducting silicon; Photocurrents; Self quenching effects; Silicon avalanche photodiodes; Photodiodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031999186

The required efficiency can only be acquired by careful optimization at all levels of the design. System-level power optimizations have a dramatic impact on the overall power budget. We have proposed a system-level step-wise methodology to reduce the power in hardware realizations of data-dominated applications, which is partly supported with our ATOMIUM environment. In this paper, we extend the methodology to the realization of embedded software on processor cores. Starting from a high level algorithm description (e.g. in C), a set of optimizations gradually refine the code and the corresponding memory organization of the array data types. These array data types represent a fully detailed optimized data storage and transfer organization. Instead of creating the physical memories, a mapping can be done either on a general memory architecture, including a cache, or on a custom memory architecture. First, typical optimizations addressed by our methodology are applied on a didactical example. The effectiveness of this methodology is then demonstrated by the optimization of two complex applications in an embedded processor context : a MPEG2 and a H.263 video decoder.

The results clearly showed that the severity of the BLEVE was directly related to the energy stored in the vessel, and this energy storage was significantly affected by pressure relief valve (PRV) behavior. During the tests the PRV operating characteristics were highly variable. Since these valves play a large role in the control of energy accumulation and storage in a pressure vessel, it was decided to study their dynamic behaviours in detail and quantify their effect on energy storage. As an initial step, 60 small (1"" NPT) transport vessel PRVs representing equivalent designs from each of three manufacturers were procured through a third party and tested on an air test bench. These tests were conducted in accordance with the certification procedures specified by various agencies (ASME, UL, CSA, CGA). Four characteristic pressures were measured - simmer (start-to-discharge), pop (full open), reseat, and reseal (bubble-tight reclosure). After initial testing, the valves were stored for various periods of time and re-tested.

These fuels are planned to be put into dry storage followed by disposal in the federal repository. Temperature conditions in storage and disposal systems due to nuclear decay heat sources will promote creep deformation of the fuel elements. Excessive deformation of the Al SNF will cause gross distortion (slump) of the fuels and may cause gross cladding rupture. The stress in the dry stored spent nuclear fuels is due to self-weight and is considerably low (several psi). Even under this low loading, significant creep strains in the fuel elements may take place over long time at elevated temperatures corresponding to geological repository disposal conditions.

A parametric analysis was performed to investigate creep deformation response of the spent fuel assemblies to a range of temperatures. The Materials Test Reactor fuel element is precisely modeled for finite element analysis. Calculations cover temperatures from 100 °C to 350 °C for grain sizes of the aluminum cladding of 10 micro-meter and 50 micro-meter.

This facility, located at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, is an U. S. Department of Energy Site. The 110-ton Large Cell Cask was assumed to be accidentally dropped onto the parapet of the unloading pool, causing the cask to tumble through the pool water and impact the floor mounted crush pad with the cask's top corner. The crush pad contains rigid polyurethane foam, which was modeled in a separate computer analysis to simulate the manufacturer's testing of the foam and to determine the foam's stress and strain characteristics. This computer analysis verified that the foam was accurately represented in the analysis to follow. A detailed non-linear, dynamic finite element analysis was then performed on the crush pad and adjacent pool structure to assure that a drop of this massive cask does not result in unacceptable damage to the storage facility. Additionally, verification was made that the crush pad adequately protects the cask from severe impact loading. At impact, the cask has significant vertical, horizontal and rotational velocities. The crush pad absorbs much of the energy of the cask through plastic deformation during primary and secondary impacts. After the primary impact with the crush pad, the cask still has sufficient energy to rebound and rotate until it impacts the pool wall. An assessment is made of the damage to the crush pad and pool wall and of the impact loading on the cask.",,"Computer simulation; Containers; Energy absorption; Foamed products; Freight transportation; Impact resistance; Crush pads; Spent fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031625455

Multiple subunits of PKA, including RIIβ, RIα, Cα, and Cβ1, are expressed in fat cells but the major holoenzyme assembled under normal conditions contains RIIβ and Cα. Targeted disruption of the RIIβ gene in mice revealed that both white and brown adipocytes are capable of compensating by increasing the level of RIα. Nevertheless, the mice display a lean phenotype, have an elevated metabolic rate due to activation and induction of uncoupling protein in brown fat, and are resistant to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Although the metabolic disturbances in white and brown fat tissue may explain most of the phenotypic changes, the loss of neuronal expression of RIIβ may also contribute to the alterations in energy balance. Specific neuronal defects have been characterized that prevent the normal changes in gene expression seen with drugs that act through the dopaminergic pathway.

Two methods, a chloride mass-balance method and a chlorine-36 (36Cl) isotope bomb-pulse method, were tested for estimating long-term average rates of deep percolation at the site. Deep-percolation rates were estimated by the chloride mass-balance method at 13 locations in 6 areas with natural vegetation, and by the bomb-pulse method at 1 location in each of 4 of the areas. Estimated rates are a small fraction of precipitation. Mean annual precipitation on the test areas of the Hanford Site, which is located in semiarid south-central Washington, ranges from about 160 to 210 mm/yr (millimeters per year). Because the bomb-pulse method typically gives an upper limit of the deep-percolation rate and the mass-balance method may underestimate the rate, the estimates by the two methods probably bracket actual rates. Estimates of deep percolation by the mass-balance method range from 0.008 to 0.11 mm/yr at four locations in two areas covered with more than 4 meters of silt-loam soils and vegetated with sagebrush and other deep-rooted plants and sparse shallow-rooted grasses. Estimated upper limits by the bomb-pulse method at one location in each of these same two areas are 2.1 and 3.4 mm/yr. Rates estimated by the mass-balance method range from 0.012 to 0.30 mm/yr at five locations in three areas where the soils consist of about 0.6 meter of loamy sand or sandy loam over-lying tens of meters of sand and gravel and which have vegetal covers similar to the two areas with deep silt-loam soils. The upper limit estimated by the bomb-pulse method for one location in one of these three areas is 2.6 mm/yr. Estimates of deep percolation by both methods for the two areas with deep siltloam soils are within the range of estimates by previous investigators that used independent methods and data for areas at Hanford with similar soil and vegetal covers. However, the estimates for the three areas with loamy sand or sandy loam soils are less than estimates by previous investigators. Rates estimated by the mass-balance method at four locations in an area with 0.6 meter of loamy sand overlying about 9 meters of sand and with a vegetal cover consisting of only sparse shallow-rooted grasses range from 0.39 to 2.0 mm/yr. These estimates are higher than estimates by this method for locations in the five areas with deep-rooted plants; however, they still are at the lower end of the range of estimates for this area by other investigators. The 36Cl data collected at one location in this area were not from sufficient depth to define the entire anthropogenic 36Cl profile. These data, when used with the bomb-pulse method, were sufficient only to determine that the upper limit of deep percolation probably is greater than 5.1 mm/yr. Estimated atmospheric chloride deposition rates, which are obtained from observed ratios of natural chlorine-36 to total-chloride (36Cl/Cl) (ratios in deep soil water older than the oldest anthropogenic 36Cl), range from 33 to 39 milligrams per square meter per year. These rates are equal to or greater than twice that due to precipitation alone. Average natural 36Cl/Cl ratios in profiles at different locations ranged from 735×10-15 to 876×10-15. Inventoried amounts of anthropogenic 36Cl suggest that most of the anthropogenic 36Cl that was observed in this study is from 1950's nuclear-weapons tests in the Pacific Ocean, as is assumed when using the bomb-pulse method, and not from operations at Hanford. Inventoried amounts at the three locations where the entire anthropogenic 36Cl profile was defined range from 1.1×1012 to 2.5×1012 atoms per square meter. These amounts are similar to amounts found by other investigators at sites in the arid south-western United States that are not near local anthropogenic sources of 36Cl. Observed depths to the centroids of mass of anthropogenic 36Cl ranged from 1.06 to 1.50 meters at the three locations with deep-rooted vegetation, and the depth was greater than 3.46 meters at the location with only shallow-rooted grass vegetation. At each of the former three locations, depths to the centroid and the peak 36Cl concentration were greater than the depth at which the 36Cl/Cl ratio was a maximum; the age of soil water (estimated using chloride mass-balance calculations) at the depth of the centroid was much older than the period of bomb testing.

Collimated soft x rays and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation can be generated using electron beams with moderate electron-beam energies, unlike synchrotron radiators, which require energies of greater than 300 MeV. Earlier work focused on using transition radiation in the 0.5-3.0 keV range with electron beam energies between 17-100 MeV for output wavelength around 1.4 nm. However, tunable quasi-monochromatic emission in the EUV as well as x-ray regions can be also obtained using parametric radiators. We propose that a compact betatron be used to recycle the beam through these radiators for higher x-ray efficiency. Experiments using storage rings and simulations using known betatron parameters are presented here that demonstrate the electron beam can be recycled through the thin radiators up to 300 times. With this increase in efficiency, the source output power is expected in the range of 100 mW.","Betatrons; Electron accelerators; Step-and-scan; Transition radiation; X-ray lithography","Betatrons; Computer simulation; Synchrotron radiation; Ultraviolet radiation; X ray lithography; Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation; Electron beams",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009307963

They form a complete series of ternary alloys which, in principle, makes available any band gap within this range and the fact that they also generate efficient luminescence has been the main driving force for their recent technological development. High brightness visible light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are now commercially available, a development which has transformed the market for LED-based full colour displays and which has opened the way to many other applications, such as in traffic lights and efficient low voltage, flat panel white light sources. Continuously operating UV laser diodes have also been demonstrated in the laboratory, exciting tremendous interest for high-density optical storage systems, UV lithography and projection displays. In a remarkably short space of time, the nitrides have therefore caught up with and, in some ways, surpassed the wide band gap II-VI compounds (ZnCdSSe) as materials for short wavelength optoelectronic devices. The purpose of this paper is to review these developments and to provide essential background material in the form of the structural, electronic and optical properties of the nitrides, relevant to these applications. We have been guided by the fact that the devices so far available are based on the binary compound GaN (which is relatively well developed at the present time), together with the ternary alloys AlGaN and InGaN, containing modest amounts of Al or In. We therefore concentrate, to a considerable extent, on the properties of GaN, then introduce those of the alloys as appropriate, emphasizing their use in the formation of the heterostructures employed in devices. The nitrides crystallize preferentially in the hexagonal wurtzite structure and devices have so far been based on this material so the majority of our paper is concerned with it, however, the cubic, zinc blende form is known for all three compounds, and cubic GaN has been the subject of sufficient work to merit a brief account in its own right. There is significant interest based on possible technological advantages, such as easier doping, easier cleaving (for laser facets) and easier contacting. It also appears, at present, that the cubic form gives higher electron and hole mobilities than the hexagonal form. The dominant hexagonal structure is similar to that found in a number of II-VI compounds such as CdS and they can therefore be taken as role models. In particular, the lower symmetry gives rise to three separate valence bands at the zone centre and exciton spectra associated with each of these have been reported by many workers for GaN. Interpretation is complicated by the presence of strain in many samples due to the fact that most material consists of epitaxial thin films grown on non-lattice-matched substrates (bulk GaN crystals not being widely available). However, much progress has been made in understanding the physics of these films and we discuss the current position with regard to band gaps, effective masses, exciton binding energies, phonon energies, dielectric constants, etc. Apart from a lack of knowledge of the anticipated valence band anisotropy, it can be said that GaN is now rather well documented. Less detail is available for AlN or InN and we make no attempt to provide similar data for them. The structure of the paper is based on a historical introduction, followed by a brief account of the various crystal growth methods used to produce bulk GaN and epitaxial films of GaN and the ternary alloys. This is then followed by an account of the structural properties of hexagonal GaN as measured by x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, phonon properties from infrared and Raman spectroscopy, electrical properties, with emphasis on n- and p-type doping, and optical properties, measured mainly by photoluminescence. A brief comparative account of cubic GaN properties follows. Discussion of alloy properties in the context of their use in quantum well and superlattice structures forms an introduction to the device sections which close the paper. These include details of the technology necessary for etching, contacting and forming laser facets, as an introduction to recent results on LEDs and laser diodes. Having described the current position, we speculate briefly on likely future developments.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002864028

Moreover, operating in an extremely shallow water with fluctuating channels and numerous interfering sources makes it imperative that image compression algorithms effectively deal with background nonstationarity within an image as well as content variation between images. In this paper, we present a novel approach to lossy image compression that combines image- content classification, content-adaptive bit allocation, and hybrid wavelet tree-based coding for over 100:1 bandwidth reduction with little sacrifice in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our algorithm comprises (1) content-adaptive coding that takes advantage of a classify-before-coding strategy to reduce data mismatch, (2) subimage transformation for energy compaction, and (3) a wavelet tree-based coding for efficient encoding of significant wavelet coefficients. Furthermore, instead of using the embedded zerotree coding with scalar quantization (SQ), we investigate the use of a hybrid coding strategy that combines SQ for high-magnitude outlier transform coefficients and classified vector quantization (CVQ) for compactly clustered coefficients. This approach helps us achieve reduced distortion error and robustness while achieving high compression ratio. Our analysis based on the high-frequency sonar real data that exhibit severe content variability and contain both mines and mine-like clutter indicates that we can achieve over 100:1 compression ratio without losing crucial signal attributes. In comparison, benchmarking of the same data set with the best still-picture compression algorithm called the set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) reveals that some weak targets can completely disappear in certain situations because SPIHT is not content adaptive. ©2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Adaptive bit allocation; Classify-before-coding strategy; Hybrid wavelet tree-based coding; Image content classification","Acoustic intensity; Adaptive algorithms; Automatic target recognition; Bandwidth; Bandwidth compression; Compaction; Compression ratio (machinery); Data compression ratio; Data reduction; Digital image storage; Image compression; Mines; Pollution; Remediation; Signal to noise ratio; Sonar; Targets; Telecommunication systems; Trees (mathematics); Underwater acoustics; Vector quantization; Visual communication; Water content; Adaptive bit allocation; As contents; Bandwidth reductions; Classified vector quantizations; Classify-before-coding strategy; Compression algorithms; Compression ratios; Content classifications; Content variabilities; Content-adaptive; Data mismatches; Data sets; Distortion errors; Efficient encoding; Energy compactions; Fluctuating channels; High compression ratios; High frequencies; Hybrid coding; Hybrid image coding; Hybrid wavelet tree-based coding; Image compression algorithms; Image content classification; Imagery datum; Interfering sources; Limited bandwidths; Lossy image compressions; Non-stationarity; Power projections; Processing stations; Regional conflicts; Sanitization; Scalar quantizations; Set partitioning in hierarchical trees; Shallow waters; Signal-to-noise ratios; Sonar imageries; Target informations; Transform coefficients; Underwater mines; Wavelet coefficients; Weak targets; Zero-tree coding; Image coding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001504493

Subsequent electroforming and moulding processes are used to manufacture microstructures from metals, plastics and ceramics. This process, known as LIGA (LIthographie, Galvanoformung, and Abformung), first developed in Germany, is based on a combination of lithography, electroforming and replication processes. The development of the LIGA process for the fabrication of a wide range of precision microstructures has been stimulated by the increasing use of synchrotron radiation sources for lithography. Applications for microstructures exist in many sectors of industry. These include chemical and process engineering, biomedical instrumentation, automotive and aerospace technology, environmental monitoring and information technology. Emphasis is placed on three main areas, micromechanics, micro-optics and microfluidics, which are emerging with the widest range of industrial applications.

A wave packet, correlating with a specific set of internal reactant quantum numbers, α, is propagated forward in time until bifurcation is complete at which time the nonreactive portion of the amplitude is discarded. The autocorrelation function of the remaining amplitude is then computed and Fourier transformed to obtain a reactivity spectrum. Dividing by the corresponding spectrum of the original, unfiltered, wave packet normalizes the reactivity spectrum, yielding the total reaction probability from the internal state, α. The procedure requires negligible storage and just one time-energy Fourier transform for each initial reactant state, independent of the number of open channels of products.

The trans isomer is more stable than the cis one by 6 kcal/mol, and the energy gap decrease upon protonation to 2.4 kcal/mol. Protonation on mtrogen is energetically unfavorable and costs at least 31 kcal/mol more energy than protonation on oxygen. The acidity of the O-protonated form (MH+) soars up on excitation as inferred from the decrease in the proton affinity values. Potential energy surfaces (PES) for the ground and lowest excited states for the O-protonated (MH+) and unprotonated (M) forms of the dye have been constructed to explore the deactivation pathways of the excited states. Upon excitation the protonated form adopts the quinonoid geometry of the central single bond, and the trans ⇌ cis photoisomerization goes through a minimum, referred to as the phantom state, of 90° twisted molecular architecture located on the potential energy surface of its first excited singlet state. For the unprotonated form (M), the cis → trans isomerization is a downhill process of a quite negligible energy barrier, surmountable thermally at room temperature. The photochemical/protolytic cycle Mtrans ⇌ MH+trans ⇌ MH+cis ⇌ Mcis → Mtrans could be utilized in the storage of information and its subsequent carrier retrieval. The optical transitions are xy-plane polarized π-π* transitions and are expected at 372 nm (experiment, 364 nm) and 428 nm (experiment, 426 nm) for MH+ and M, respectively, in aqueous medium. Within the framework of the SCRF model, the unprotonated form (M) exhibits a slight positive solvatochromism.

Isolated perfusion of rat livers was performed in a nonrecirculating fashion. Twenty minutes of preischemic perfusion was performed with or without different concentrations of ANP, followed by 24- hour storage in cold University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. Two hundred nanomoles of ANP prevented hepatocellular damage during a 2-hour reperfusion period as indicated by a marked attenuation of the sinusoidal efflux of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), and by reduced Trypan blue uptake. Furthermore, postischemic bile flow as an indicator of liver function was significantly improved by about 60% with 200 nmol/L ANP. No protection was conveyed by 20 nmol/L ANP nor by pretreatment with 200 nmol/L ANP for only 10 minutes. The effects of ANP seemed to be mediated by the guanylate cyclase-coupled A (GC-A) receptor and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP): whereas expression of both GC-A and GC-B receptors as well as of the GC-C receptor was found, cGMP did protect from ischemia-reperfusion damage, but selective ligands of the B and C receptor did not. To begin to determine the mechanisms of ANP-mediated protection, different parameters were investigated: ANP had no effect on portal pressure as an indicator of hepatic circulation, nor on intracellular energy depletion determined by adenosine nucleotide concentration. However, the marked augmentation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) binding activity during reperfusion was prevented in ANP-pretreated livers. In conclusion, pretreatment with ANP protects the rat liver from cold ischemia-reperfusion damage. This effect is mediated via the GC-A receptor and cGMP, and may be linked to an influence of ANP on NF-κB activation. Thus, ANP signaling via the GC-A receptor should be considered as a new pharmacological target to prevent preservation injury of the liver.",,"atrial natriuretic factor; guanylate cyclase; lactate dehydrogenase; purine nucleoside phosphorylase; university of wisconsin solution; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; binding affinity; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; liver function; liver injury; liver ischemia; liver perfusion; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; reperfusion; target cell; Animals; Atrial Natriuretic Factor; Cold; Cyclic GMP; Guanylate Cyclase; Ischemia; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Liver; Male; NF-kappa B; Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Atrial Natriuretic Factor; Reperfusion Injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031726336

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The regional body fat distribution and sex hormone status of 42 postmenopausal women with NIDDM were compared with those of 42 normoglycemic women matched for age and BMI, who served as control subjects. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and testosterone were measured in serum. RESULTS - Although the levels of total body fat were similar between the two groups, the women with NIDDM had significantly less lower-body fat (LBF) (P < 0.01) than the control subjects matched for age and BMI. This pattern of fat deposition in women with NIDDM was accompanied by an androgenic hormone profile, with decreased SHBG concentration and an increased free androgen index (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS - A reduced capacity to deposit and/or conserve LBF may be an independent factor associated with (or may be a marker of) the metabolic manifestations of the insulin resistance syndrome in women with NIDDM.

The life-cycle is delineated to the part of the production chain prior to purchase by the consumer. The study shows that emissions, expressed in g CO2 equivalents, are highest for pork and rice and lowest for potatoes, carrots and dry peas. The most important stages of emissions in the life-cycle are identified for each of the different food items. Crop farming is the most important stage for rice and tomatoes while rearing of animals is the most important stage for pork and storage is the most important stage for carrots. Comparison with an energy analysis shows that important stages in the life-cycle of food may be under-evaluated when energy only is accounted for. This may lead to a sub-optimisation of pollution control exemplified by the case of transportation. Also, it is shown that the choice of functional unit has a decisive influence on the outcome of the study. The recommendation is to compare whole meals, or diets with the same nutritional qualities. A comparison of four meals composed of the food items under analysis shows that a meal with tomatoes, rice and pork has nine times higher emissions than a meal made from potatoes, carrots and dry peas. Emissions of greenhouse gases from consumption patterns based on the food items analysed are compared with an assumed sustainable limit of greenhouse gas emissions. The conclusion is that current food consumption patterns in the developed countries exceed the level of sustainability by at least a factor of 4. Prospects for achieving sustainable food consumption patterns are questionable in view of current trends in food demand.","Climate change; Food; Food consumption; Greenhouse gases; Life-cycle; Sustainability","climate change; emission; food consumption; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; pollution control; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032467822

It is constructed at the front-end BM02 of the ESRF storage ring, using the X-ray beam from a 0.8 T bending magnet. D2AM entered into routine operation at the end of 1994, and is used either for single-wavelength or for multiwavelength anomalous diffraction studies. The beam is monochromated by an Si[111] two-crystal monochromator with a resolution of about 2 x 10-4. The first crystal is water cooled. The X-ray photon energy covers the range between 6.5 keV (λ ≃ 1.9 Å) and 17 keV (λ ≃ 0.7 Å), a domain of energy with many K or L absorption edges of heavy atoms of interest for biological macromolecules studies and in materials science. The X-ray beam is focused in the vertical plane by two long curved mirrors and in the horizontal plane by the second crystal of the monochromator which is given an adjustable sagittal curvature. A spot size of 0.3 x 0.1 mm (FWHM) is measured at the sample position. Both mirrors are cut out of a 6″-diameter 1.1 m-long Si single crystal, polished and coated with a 400 Å Pt thin film. The rugosity is better than 4 Å r.m.s. and the longitudinal slope error is better than 5 x 10-6 rad r.m.s. The first mirror is water cooled, the second is not. The beam intensity on the sample is about 1011 photon s-1 on a 0.3 x 0.3 mm focus area at 100 mA in the storage ring of the ESRF. The harmonic rejection ratio obtained with the two mirrors is better than 10-5 for λ/3. The combined optical system, mirror/monochromating-crystals/mirror, used on D2AM constitutes altogether a high-intensity point-focusing fixed-exit monochromator, which has the additional property that the energy resolution is not dependent on the beam divergence in use. Its stability and resolution are perfectly adapted to multiwavelength anomalous diffraction studies. The alignment of the mirrors and the monochromator is fully automated, taking 5 min, with the exception of the adjustment of the sagittal focusing. During multiwavelength diffraction experiments the wavelength is changed by a fast single monochromator rotation. Neither realignment of the mirrors nor readjustment of the beam focusing are necessary. The stability and reproducibility of the selected X-ray photon energy is better than 0.5 eV.","Anomalous diffraction; Focusing mirrors; Sagittal focusing; X-ray beamlines; X-ray monochromators",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032215710

The greenhouse was constructed of hollow polycarbonate cladding through which a liquid radiation filter (LRF) was circulated. The LRF absorbed most of the incident near infrared part of the solar radiation while transmitting most of the photosynthetically active radiation. In the cold season, the absorbed energy was transferred via a heat exchanger to a water tank. At night, the heat was returned to the greenhouse via the heat exchanger by circulating the LRF through the cladding. In summer, surplus absorbed energy was rejected to the environment by means of a cooling tower. The greenhouse remained almost closed at all times except for several hours at midday in summer. This enabled long periods of carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization. During these periods air entered the greenhouse at a rate of about one air change an hour via the CO2 generator. When open, ventilation occurred passively through large gable windows. The gable windows and the CO2 generator were fitted with insect screens, inhibiting the entrance of insects. Disease encouraging condensation on leaves was prevented by the thermal blanket effect of the relatively warm LRF circulating in the cladding at night. The structure and the functional elements of the greenhouse are described. Experimental results and the thermal performance of the LRFG during the winter and summer seasons are presented. CO2 fertilization was possible during most of the daylight hours including during the summer when the greenhouse was closed about 7 to 10 out of 14 daylight hours.

The two methods were found to provide generally equivalent results. Because safety, quality assurance, radiological controls, and somewhat complex sample custody arrangements frequently precluded rapid analysis, the long-term stability of the sampling media during storage needed to be addressed. Samples were analyzed with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) using cryogenic preconcentration or thermal desorption sample introduction techniques. SUMMA canister samples were also analyzed for total non-methane organic compounds (TNMOC) by GC/flame ionization detector (FID) using EPA Compendium Method T0- 12. The 31 target organic analytes studied represented compounds with widely varying polarities and volatilities To verify the long-term stability of the sampling media, multiple samples were collected in parallel from a typical passively ventilated radioactive waste tank known to contain moderately high concentrations of both polar and nonpolar organic compounds. Two sets of sorbent trap samples were collected to compare the effects of storage under refrigerated (~20 °C) and room temperature conditions. Analyses for organic analytes and TNMOC were conducted at increasing intervals over a 32-week period to determine whether any systematic degradation of sample integrity occurred.

Central to such management is understanding how people view estuaries. In this article I explore the perceptions and attitudes of people about coastal recreation, environmental problems, and future land use along the New Jersey shore (USA) by interviewing people who attended a duck decoy and craft show on Barnegat Bay. The people who were interviewed engaged in more days of fishing than any other recreational activity and engaged in camping the least. There were significant differences in recreational rates as a function of gender and location of residence, with men hunting and fishing more than women and photographing less than women. Jet skis were perceived as the most severe environmental problem, with chemical pollution, junk, oil runoff and overfishing as second level problems. Birds were perceived as hot an environmental problem at all. Fishing, hiking, preservation, and camping ranked as the highest preferred future land uses for the two sites examined (Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Naval Weapons Station Earle). The preferred future land uses for these two sites, which are not under consideration for land-use changes, were very similar to those of people living near the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site in South Carolina, despite the media attention and considerations of nuclear storage.","Coastal; Environmental problem; Gender; Land use; Perceptions; Recreation","Ecosystem management; Chemical wastes; Coastal zones; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Estuaries; Fuel oils; Land use; Marine pollution; Recreational facilities; Runoff; Social aspects; Environmental protection; environmental management; estuary; land use; perception; public attitude; recreational activity; article; bird; ecosystem; environmental planning; estuary; fishing; human; land use; leisure; recreation; seashore; sex difference; united states; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032212127

These products were microbiologically stable through application of hurdle technology principles and had a target refrigerated shelf life of 2 to 3 months. For such microbiologically stable, complex foods, end of shelf life is usually signalled by an unacceptable loss of sensory attributes. Shelf life testing was conducted at 4 to 15°C. The end of shelf life, was based on overall organoleptic unacceptability and development of rancidity. Use of Weibull Hazard Analysis facilitated shelf life determination and modelling of sensory evaluation data. Relatively low activation energies of shelf life loss were estimated for the two products ranging from 21 to 31.5 kJ/mol. The response of Time Temperature Indicators (TTI) was also kinetically studied. Two types of enzyme based TTIs, having a time temperature dependent colour change, had activation energies of 48.3 and 68 kJ/mol. Simulation studies at variable storage temperatures showed the applicability of these TTI as shelf life monitors of the chilled products understudy. The correlation error was smaller with the TTI that had the lower Ea, closer to the Ea of the foods. Finally a distribution and stock rotation system based on the TTI and using the principle of LSFO (Least Shelf life First Out) instead of the FIFO (First In First Out) was studied. Using temperature distribution data from the chill chain, the advantages of the LSFO system are demonstrated.","Chilled salad; Shelf life; Time-temperature indicator (TTI)","Solanum melongena",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001949869

Although the transcriptional regulation of adipocyte differentiation is relatively well characterized, the subsequent molecular events remain unclear. The activity of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase precipitated with antibodies to phosphotyrosine has now been shown to increase transiently during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-F442A and of 3T3-L1 cells. PI 3-kinase activity precipitated with antibodies to insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and association of subunits of PI 3-kinase with IRS1 were also increased at this stage of differentiation, suggesting that IRS1 contributes to PI 3-kinase activation. Inhibition of the activation of PI 3-kinase by expression of dominant negative mutant subunits of the enzyme prevented adipogenesis, as assessed by lipid accumulation and expression of key adipocyte proteins such as GLUT4, adipsin, and aP2, suggesting that PI 3- kinase activation is essential for adipocyte differentiation. However, these mutant proteins did not affect either the expression of the transcription factor PPARγ at the mRNA or protein level or the increase in the abundance of mRNAs encoding the adipocyte marker proteins. These results demonstrate that adipocyte differentiation is regulated at the posttranscriptional level and that activation of PI 3-kinase is required for this regulation.",,"adipsin; genistein; glucose transporter; insulin receptor substrate 1; messenger rna; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphotyrosine; rapamycin; transcription factor; adipocyte; animal cell; article; cell differentiation; cell strain 3t3; controlled study; energy metabolism; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; lipid storage; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; transcription regulation; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; 3T3 Cells; Adipocytes; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Enzyme Activation; Mice; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032582522

Measurements were carried out over coastal tundra at Prudhoe Bay in 1994, and at wet sedge, moist and dry tussock tundra around Happy Valley in 1995. Sensible heat flux (H) and latent heat flux (lE) were determined by an eddy correlation technique.

Measurements were carried out over coastal tundra at Prudhoe Bay in 1994, and at wet sedge, moist and dry tussock tundra around Happy Valley in 1995. Sensible heat flux, H, and latent heat flux, lE, were determined by an eddy correlation technique. Over the Arctic coastal tundra, the energy partition changed remarkably as a result of air mass conditions. Under cold and humid wild (onshore) from the Arctic Ocean, the temperature gradient over the tundra ecosystem increased, which resulted in a high level of H. Under warm and dry air mass on clear days from the inland tundra (offshore), air and soil temperatures and the water vapour deficit increased, which resulted in an increase in lE. The same effect or air mass condition on energy partition was observed at the tundra ecosystem in Happy Valley located 135 km inland from the Arctic coast. The energy budget at wet sedge tundra was characterized as the heat storage within the water layer on a daily basis, which was partitioned mainly to lE in daytime and lE and H at night. Latent heat flux, lE, was largest at wet sedge tundra and lowest at dry tussock tundra. The Bowen ratio decreased with air temperature over wet sedge and dry tussock tundra ecosystems. The aerodynamic resistance r(a), and canopy resistance, r(c), over the wet sedge tundra at Happy Valley had different levels over four major wind directions. These levels decreased with increase in wind speed. r(a) was slightly higher than over other vegetation, which seemed to be owing to a relatively lower wind speed, while the canopy resistance r(c) was lower than over other vegetation. Global warming will affect the energy partition of the Arctic tundra ecosystem, and the warming and drying climate will increase the lE of tundra, especially in flooded areas. Expanding dry tundra increases H rather than lE, which enhances the warming of the tundra ecosystem.","Alaska; Energy budget; Global warming; Heat flux; Tundra; United States; Water budget","Coastal zones; Global warming; Heat flux; Thermal gradients; Vegetation; Bowen ratio; Eddy correlation method; Latent heat flux; Sensible heat flux; Ecosystems; energy budget; global warming; heat flux; tundra; water budget; Alaska; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032194591

Acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT, EC 2.3.1.20) catalyzes the terminal and only committed step in triacylglycerol synthesis, by using diacylglycerol and fatty acyl CoA as substrates. DGAT plays a fundamental role in the metabolism of cellular diacylglycerol and is important in higher eukaryotes for physiologie processes involving triacylglycerol metabolism such as intestinal fat absorption, lipoprotein assembly, adipose tissue formation, and lactation. DGAT is an integral membrane protein that has never been purified to homogeneity, nor has its gene been cloned. We identified an expressed sequence tag clone that shared regions of similarity with acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase, an enzyme that also uses fatty acyl CoA as a substrate. Expression of a mouse cDNA for this expressed sequence tag in insect cells resulted in high levels of DGAT activity in cell membranes. No other acyltransferase activity was detected when a variety of substrates, including cholesterol, were used as acyl acceptors. The gene was expressed in all tissues examined; during differentiation of NIH 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes, its expression increased markedly in parallel with increases in DGAT activity. The identification of this cDNA encoding a DGAT will greatly facilitate studies of cellular glycerolipid metabolism and its regulation.","Cloning; Expressed sequence tag; Fatty acid; Glycerolipid","acyl coenzyme a; cholesterol acyltransferase; diacylglycerol; diacylglycerol acyltransferase; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; amino acid sequence; animal cell; article; cell differentiation; cell strain 3t3; enzyme mechanism; enzyme substrate complex; gene expression; gene mapping; gene sequence; lactation; lipid absorption; lipogenesis; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein assembly; sequence analysis; sequence homology; sequence tagged site; tissue distribution; 3T3 Cells; Acyltransferases; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Baculoviridae; Cell Line; Chromosome Mapping; Crosses, Genetic; Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase; Humans; Kinetics; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Molecular Sequence Data; Muridae; Recombinant Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Spodoptera; Sterol O-Acyltransferase; Transcription, Genetic; Transfection; Triglycerides; Animalia; Eukaryota; Insecta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13144281703

The objective of this study was to carry out an energy and carbon analysis of different power generation routes using wood fuel from short rotation coppice. Three scenarios of wood fuel production were considered, based on the level of intensification of cultivation practices, in terms of machinery and materials input. Local and regional transportation were distinguished, as well as natural convection or forced ventilation for drying. We also studied three conversion systems: local peak electricity generation, local cogeneration of heat and power (CHP), and centralised power generation by wood and coal pulverisation cofiring. The energy and carbon balances of different wood-energy routes were estimated by calculating direct and indirect energy and carbon costs of all their components (fuel, materials and machinery). Energy ratios of 22, 23 and 26 after storage and drying at the farm were obtained respectively for the different scenarios. An average of 1.7 kg of carbon (kgC) is released per GJ of wood energy produced. Crop maintenance, and chemical fertilisation, account for 40% of total energy costs and 25% of total carbon costs of wood fuel production. Final avoided carbon emissions by fossil fuel subStitUtion reach 6.3 to 8.8 tC ha-1 yr-1 with CHP, 3.8 to 5.4 with peak power production and 3.3 to 4.6 with centralised cofiring.By substituting fossil fuels and storing carbon in biomass and soil, the development of bioenergy can play a significant role in the reduction of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.

Three scenarios of wood fuel production were considered, based on the level of intensification of cultivation practices, in terms of machinery and materials input. Local and regional transportation were distinguished, as well as natural convection or forced ventilation for drying. We also studied three conversion systems: local peak electricity generation, local cogeneration of heat and power (CHP), and centralized power generation by wood and coal pulverization cofiring. The energy and carbon balances of different wood-energy routes were estimated by calculating direct and indirect energy and carbon costs of all their components (fuel, materials and machinery). Energy ratios of 22, 23 and 26 after storage and drying at the farm were obtained respectively for the different scenarios. An average of 1.7 kg of carbon (kgC) is released per GJ of wood energy produced. Crop maintenance, and chemical fertilization, account for 40% of total energy costs and 25% of total carbon costs of wood fuel production. Final avoided carbon emissions by fossil fuel substitution reach 6.3 to 8.8 tC ha-1 yr-1 with CHP, 3.8 to 5.4 with peak power production and 3.3 to 4.6 with centralized cofiring.","Energy and carbon balance; Power generation; Short rotation coppice; Wood energy","alternative energy; carbon dioxide; fuel production; fuelwood; short rotation coppice; Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Combined cycle power plants; Crops; Cultivation; Electric power generation; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Wood fuels; Short rotation coppice; Biomass; alternative energy; carbon emission; coppice; energy resource; woodfuel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031713860

It is important to be able to track an equilibrium configuration as the temperature of the liquid crystals is decreased. The path of the minimal energy configuration at a bifurcation point can be computed from the null space of a sparse symmetric matrix, which typically is very large, e.g., of order 3 × 105. We describe an implicitly restarted block Lanczos method designed for the computation of a few extreme multiple or close eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of a large sparse symmetric matrix and apply this method to determine the desired null space. Our method generalizes the implicitly restarted Lanczos method introduced by Sorensen. The method requires that certain acceleration parameters, referred to as shifts, be chosen. The storage requirement depends on the choice of shifts. We propose a new strategy for choosing shifts. Numerical examples illustrate that the implicitly restarted block Lanczos method with shifts chosen in this manner gives rapid convergence, reliably detects extreme multiple or close eigenvalues, and requires little computer storage in addition to the storage used for the desired eigenvectors. These features make the method well suited for the application of tracking an equilibrium configuration of liquid crystals. © 1998 Academic Press.","Bifurcation; Block Lanczos method; Continuation method; Equilibrium configuration; Polynomial acceleration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005532228

Thermal stability and phase transition in the as-quenched alloy were studied by TEM, DSC, X-ray and electron diffraction. It was found that the as-cast material consists of mainly hexagonal Mg2(Ni,Y) nanocrystals with an average size of 2-3 nm and a significant amount of amorphous phase with similar composition located between them. During heating the alloy crystallizes completely by three dimensional nanocrystal growth, with an activation energy of 140±7 kJ mol-1 . The hydriding properties of the as-quenched nanocrystalline alloy were studied as well. The maximum hydrogen absorption capacity (about 3.0 wt.%) and hydrogenation kinetics of the melt-spun Mg2(Ni,Y) were found to exceed those of the conventionally prepared polycrystalline Mg2Ni alloys and to be comparable to the hydrogen absorption characteristics of nanocrystalline ball-milled Mg2Ni.

Acid Maltase Deficiency (AMD), a glycogen storage disease, is characterized by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme alpha-glucosidase. As a result, glycogen accumulates in various organs and organ systems, including the respiratory muscles. In adults, the disease is associated with progressive muscle weakness which may or may not lead to respiratory failure.1 In the following case, we describe a patient with acute respiratory failure secondary to AMD. Case Presentation: A 34 year old Greek male with Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) presented two years earlier with proximal muscle weakness and mild dyspnea. A muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of IBM. His symptoms remained mild over the ensuing two years. Two weeks prior to the current presentation, he noticed progressive breathlessness and proximal muscle weakness. While playing with his children on the day of admission, he became confused and acutely short of breath. He was taken to an outside emergency department where he was found to be in respiratory distress, necessitating intubation. His exam was remarkable for only confusion and proximal muscle weakness. A chest x-ray demonstrated bibasilar atelectasis, and a head CT scan showed a small, contained basilar tip aneurysm. Laboratory values were remarkable for an elevated white blood cell count without a left shift, creatinine kinase (CK) of 906, and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 1100. His confusion and respiratory distress resolved with mechanical ventilation. He was weaned from the ventilator and extubated, but within minutes he required reintubation secondary to tachypnea and oxygen desaturation. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to our institution for further evaluation. The basilar tip aneurysm was felt to be an unlikely cause of his symptoms. By the following morning the patient had been successfully weaned from the ventilator, but after extubation, he again required immediate reintubation. His maximal inspiratory pressure was -5 cm H2O. A Rheumatology consultant recommended an empiric trial of high dose steroids which did not help. Fluoroscopy revealed bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. Both Rheumatology and Neurology consultants felt IBM, although a known cause of muscle weakness, was an unlikely cause of acute respiratory failure. The patient underwent deltoid and diaphragmatic muscle biopsy. The muscle biopsies were consistent with AMD (the muscle biopsy two years previously had been misdiagnosed upon further review). Skin biopsies obtained for biochemical testing confirmed the diagnosis of AMD. The patient was treated with a high-protein diet to provide an alternative energy source. Within days there was improvement in his PImax and vital capacity. Eventually he was partially weaned from ventilatory support and was discharged home after a two month hospitalization and brief rehabilitation period. Currently, he uses a ventilator at night. Discussion: AMD or Pompe's Disease is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that is characterized by a deficiency in alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase). Glycogen can deposit in many tissues and organ systems including the respiratory muscles. The disease has three variants affecting infants, children, or adults. The adult form is usually more mild in comparison to the other two. In the adult, the proximal skeletal muscles are affected initially, but the disease can progress to involve the respiratory muscles and cause respiratory muscle weakness or failure.1,2 Moufarrej et al found that 21 of 43 adult cases of AMD had respiratory involvement.1 AMD can mimic polymyositis or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The CK, LDH, and aspartate aminotransferase levels are typically elevated. Muscle biopsy reveals large glycogen stores and non-specific vacuolation of the muscle fibers. Biochemical enzyme testing of cultured fibroblasts, skin or urine confirms the diagnosis. Interestingly, there are reports of familial intracranial aneurysms in AMD.3 Treatment is mainly supportive; however, it has been shown that a diet high in branched-chain amino acids may improve muscle strength in this disorder.4,5 Enzyme replacement therapy using a precursor for alpha glucosidase is in the early stages of investigation and appears to be promising.6 Conclusion: AMD is a glycogen storage disease that can affect all ages. Respiratory muscle involvement is common and can have serious ramifications. The disease is not routinely considered in the differential diagnosis of respiratory insufficiency or failure. As a result, AMD can be misdiagnosed as illustrated by this case. Until recently, the treatment was largely supportive, but with dietary modification, there appears to be hope for improved outcomes in the future.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750256330

The yellowing rate was found to follow the zero order kinetics. The yellowing constant value (k) increased exponentially with temperature and increased linearly with water activity. The magnitude of apparent activation energy varied from 130-145 kJ/mol. A predictive equation for determining yellowing rate was In k = α- δa(w)-ε/T + (γa(w))/T where a(w) was water activity (valid from 0.80 to 0.95), T was absolute temperature (valid from 308 to 338 K) and α, δ, ε and γ were constants.

The semimembranosus, gracilis major, gluteus magnus, adductor magnus, cruralis and plantaris longus were consistently active approximately 20-40ms before any perceptible movement, as indicated by simultaneous video recordings. Activity ended before full extension of the hindlimb and take-off. Activity in the semitendinosus was variable among the jumps recorded. Simultaneous measurements of EMG activity and length changes (via sonomicrometry) in the semimembranosus (SM) and gluteus magnus (GM) muscles indicated that the performance characteristics of these two muscles differed. The SM muscle (a hip extensor) shortens and is activated in a manner consistent with its producing power during a significant fraction of the take-off phase. It shortened by a mean of 26.2 % of the resting length during the propulsive phase of the two longest jumps for each frog. The delay between the onset of EMG activity and the beginning of shortening averaged 24 ms, which was brief compared with that found for the GM. The total strain and mean shortening velocity of the SM increased with jumping distance. Contrary to our initial expectations, the GM muscle does not shorten as one would expect of a muscle involved in powering the jump throughout take-off. This muscle has an extensor action at the knee, but also has a flexor action at the hip. A long delay existed between the onset of EMG activity and the beginning of shortening (46-116ms among the individuals tested). Shortening during take-off by the GM (a mean of 16.7% for all jumps) was much less than by the SM, and in many jumps most of this shortening occurred late in the take-off period. Although the GM cannot contribute directly to power output early in take-off, it may contribute to powering the jump indirectly by transferring energy from the hip extensors to the knee joint.

In the heterozygote only a moderate alteration from normal was found in terms of an elevated ATP demand during exercise. In the homozygote, hexose phosphates, indicated as phosphomonoesters, increased dramatically during contraction. Phosphomonoester accumulation resulted in consumption of free inorganic phosphate (P(i)). During ischemic exercise the absence of glycolytic ATP formation resulted in a linear time course of phosphocreatine breakdown and a moderate alkalinization. During the recovery, phosphocreatine resynthesis showed a biphasic time course, indicating that mitochondrial function itself was not directly affected. At first glance, the early depletion of P(i) below initial resting levels and the rate of phosphate splitting from sugar phosphates seemed to become the limiting factor for the rate of the oxidative phosphorylation and creatine kinase reaction. However, the actual concentrations of P(i) and ADP estimated at the onset of delay were too high to exclusively explain the dramatic delay in PCr resynthesis. For this reason, a reduced turnover of the citric acid cycle was assumed, which was caused by the complete absence of glycolysis in PFK deficiency patients. Furthermore, results from PFK deficiency patients were compared with previous findings from myophosphorylase deficiency patients in the literature.

Recently, a gene that encodes such a protein (named leptin) was identified. These findings indicate that adipose tissue performs important biological functions beyond storage of fat. In fact, data indicate that adipose tissue functions very much like other endocrine tissues, releasing a hormone into the circulatory system to relay a message to its target. Although there may be more than one target tissue for leptin, the best accepted component of any leptin endocrine axis is the hypothalamus. Because this integrative center is fundamental to many neuroendocrine axes, classical endocrine feedback circuits must now be extended to include leptin. Leptin deficiency is extremely rare and has been only reported in a mutant morbid obese mouse strain and in two children who also suffer from extreme obesity. Most types of human and murine obesity are accompanied by elevated leptin levels, and the concentrations of this hormone correlate well with degree of adiposity. Thus, it is thought that leptin may serve as a fuel gauge for the hypothalamus. When sufficient fuel is present or when lipid is being synthesized and stored in adipose, leptin levels rise and reduce further feeding behavior. In addition, a signal of abundant fuel reserve also serves as a message that energy can be expended for anabolism of protein and other biological processes such as growth, repair, and reproduction. Our data, together with those reported by others, indicate that leptin inhibits the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and thus antagonizes the catabolic glucocorticoids. A review of available data also supports that leptin stimulates the hypothalamic-growth hormone axis and hence promotes protein synthesis. Energy must be expended to support this anabolic state, and data indicate the energy is derived from metabolism of adipose reserve. Such loss of lipid would tend to decrease plasma leptin levels and thereby signal a state for replenishment of adipose stores.

The trapping of the rare gases in the polymer takes place via X-ray irradiation of the gas and the polymer film by means of an X-ray tube. Concentrations up to about 2×1017 atoms of noble gas per cm2 of the film were obtained. The thermal energy needed for desorbing Xe from a kapton film was found to be about 16 kcal/mol which is large compared with the known values for thermal desorptions on metal surfaces. An energy shift of 1.04±0.48 eV was further observed for the 5p-1s X-ray transition of trapped Xe atoms, which permits to surmise a rather strong interaction between the sorbate atoms and the sorbent molecules. Two interpretations of the observed phenomena are presented, the first involves bond ruptures and bond rearrangements in the polymer whereas the second is based on the assumption that chemisorption or persorption of Xe occurs in the polymeric substrate. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, due to battery power limitation, a wireless mobile computer may often be forced to operate in a doze or even totally disconnected mode. As a result, the mobile computer may miss some cache invalidation reports. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient cache invalidation method for a wireless mobile computer. The new cache invalidation scheme is called grouping with cold update-set retention (GCORE). Upon waking up, a mobile computer checks its cache validity with the server. To reduce the bandwidth requirement for validity checking, data objects are partitioned into groups. However, instead of simply invalidating a group if any of the objects in the group has been updated, GCORE retains the cold update set of objects in a group if possible. We present an efficient implementation of GCORE and conduct simulations to evaluate its caching effectiveness. The results show that GCORE can substantially improve mobile caching by reducing the communication bandwidth (thus energy consumption) for query processing.","Cache invalidation; Energy-efficient caching; Mobile computing; Wireless computing","Cache invalidation; Energy-efficient caching; Mobile caching; Mobile computers; Bandwidth; Cache memory; Communication channels (information theory); Computer simulation; Data handling; Database systems; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Servers; Wireless telecommunication systems; Buffer storage; Client server computer systems; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Mobile computing; Cache invalidation method; Grouping with cold update set retention; Wireless mobile computer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032179315

The numerical scheme solves acoustic and elastic wave equations formulated by velocity and stress for fluid layers and solid spaces, respectively. Spatial variations of velocity and stress fields propagating in general anisotropic and heterogeneous media are calculated by high-accuracy Fourier and Chebyshev differential operators. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is employed for time-marching of the wavefields. The domain decomposition technique divides the full space into several subdomains bounded by discontinuous features with steep velocity gradients. The propagating wavefronts are separately calculated in each subdomain, then wavefield matching procedures subject to the continuity condition for the velocity and traction are imposed at the interface of subdomains. Non-periodic boundary conditions at the free surface and the non-reflected edge at the bottom of the model space are adequately represented by expansion in Chebyshev polynomials. Parallelizing the serial algorithm effectively reduces the computation time. Data locally distributed in many processors for the parallel program provides the large memory storage needed for a 3-D model. The waveforms calculated by this numerical scheme show accuracy comparable with a known analytical solution. The numerical experiments indicate the effectiveness of the multidomain approach in modelling seismic energy partitioning into reflected, refracted and transmitted waves at velocity discontinuities such as the crust/water interface and in generating synthetic seismograms at seafloor affected by water reverberations. We simulate seismic wave propagation in isotropic and anisotropic elastic media with hexagonal, orthorhombic and monoclinic symmetries, which represent possible symmetry systems in the mantle and crust. The propagating wavefields possess observable differences in wavefront geometry, phase arrivals, disturbed amplitude and shear-wave splitting. The azimuthal dependence in traveltimes and variability in synthetic waveforms demonstrates that fine details of anisotropic velocity structures can be resolved by comparing simulated full waveforms with observed seismograms recorded at various distances and azimuths.",,"crust; mantle; oceanic lithosphere; seismic method; wave propagation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15644370818

The intrinsic peak-current capabilities of induction machines, together with their flexible pulse formats, provide a suitable match to the high peak-power requirement of a heavy-ion fusion target. However, as in the RF case, where combinations of linacs, synchrotrons, and storage rings offer a number of choices to be examined in designing an optimal system, the induction approach also allows a number of architectures, from which choices must be made. We review the main classes of architecture for induction drivers that have been studied to date. The main choice of accelerator structure is that between the linac and the recirculator, the latter being composed of several rings. Hybrid designs are also possible. Other design questions include which focusing system (electric quadrupole, magnetic quadrupole, or solenoid) to use, whether or not to merge beams, and what number of beams to use - all of which must be answered as a function of ion energy throughout the machine. Also, the optimal charge state and mass must be chosen. These different architectures and beam parameters lead to different emittances and imply different constraints on the final focus. The advantages and uncertainties of these various architectures will be discussed. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Two models have been employed that are expected to bracket the range of cooling rates that prevail for such ions present in ∼1 mTorr of room temperature helium. A diffuse scattering model that assumes that the helium target atom thermally equilibrates with the high-mass ion upon collision is expected to yield a maximum cooling rate. A random walk algorithm using the exponential model for inefficient colliders and a relatively small average energy down-step size provides an estimate for the lowest cooling rates that might be expected. The two models give cooling rates that differ by about a factor of three and fall within the range of 200-2000 s-1 for the ions and energies considered in the simulations. Unimolecular dissociation rates have also been determined for the same model ions. Random walk simulations employing collisional cooling and dissociation clearly show how a rapid input of internal energy, as with the absorption of an ultraviolet photon, can either result in dissociation of a large fraction of the ions or can lead to an insignificant degree of dissociation, depending largely on the unimolecular dissociation rate of the ion. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.","Collisional cooling; Helium bath gas; Internal relaxation; Quadrupole ion trap",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042941252

Triglycerides (TGs), stored in adipose tissue and within muscle fibres, are considered to be the main source of the free fatty acids (FFAs) oxidised during exercise. It is still unclear, however, how the use of these substrates is regulated during exercise. The regulation seems to be multifactoral and includes: (i) dietary and nutritional status; (ii) hormonal milieu; (iii) exercise mode, intensity and duration; and (iv) training status. On the other hand, the mechanism for FFA transport from its storage as triglycerides in adipose tissue and muscle to its place of utilisation in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney and liver is more clearly understood. It has been determined that the plasma FFA turnover rate is sufficiently rapid to account for most of the fat metabolised during low intensity exercise (25 to 40% VO(2max). However, an exercise intensity of 65% VO(2max) results in a slight decrease in the amount of plasma FFA uptake by muscle tissue. Other studies have found that during prolonged exercise, muscle TGs become the predominant source of energy obtained from fat. Furthermore, it is widely documented that endurance activities increase the energy utilisation from fat while sparing carbohydrate sources. For example, during exercise on a cycle ergometer, nonplasma FFAs and plasma FFAs contribute 40%, and carbohydrates 60%, of the total calculated amount of energy expenditure before exercise and vice versa after exercise (60% nonplasma and plasma FFAs and 40% carbohydrates). Although it was many years before it was fully demonstrated, fat is now known to be transported in the blood as FFA bound to the protein carrier albumin. The mobilisation of FFA is primarily a function of sympathetic nervous activity directed towards the adipocytes, or the 'fat pad'. This nervous activity can be direct or may be an effect of circulating catecholamines such as adrenaline (epinephrine).

However, these stills represent the best technical solution to supply remote villages or settlements with fresh water without depending on high technology and expertise. In the south of Algeria, water resources (underground and geothermal) are available, but water has a salinity of 2-4 g/l. To supply sufficient fresh water for the population, desalination becomes necessary. This paper presents the results of experiments carried out with a capillary film distiller installed in the south of Algeria (in a village near Touggourt where the temperature of the groundwater is about 65°C at the source) for groundwater distillation and to improve the efficiency of the capillary film solar distiller using solar energy and the capillary effect. This type of distiller, called DIFICAP (DIstiller with a FIlm in CAPillary motion) was designed and patented by R. and C. Ouahes and P. Le Goff [1]. A very thin layer of tissue with fine mesh, saturated with water, it maintains itself at contact with a metal plane due to the surface tension which is much greater than the gravitational forces. This plate acts as an evaporator-condenser. In its three-stage version, the DIFICAP is composed of three identical evaporation-condensation cells in thermal series. The heat dissipated by the condensation of steam on the metal plane is used on the back face of the plane for the evaporation of an equivalent quantity of water. Solar energy is thus used three times in succession. The difference in temperature between plates in each cell is 5-10°C. It was found that the efficiency of this distiller increased with increasing the temperature of the brackish water at the inlet and also with increasing the intensity of the solar radiation. It depends also on the heat loss and fabric used. Also, the efficiency can be increased and the cost decreased if the plant works all day long. This requires a large amount of heat storage.The results of experiments carried out with a capillary film distiller installed in the south of Algeria for groundwater distillation and to improve the efficiency of the capillary film solar distiller using solar energy and the capillary effect are presented.

Our investigations indicate that the Al2O3 layers show very low absorption and smooth growth characteristics with a root-mean-square roughness of about 0.2 nm. Therefore, M/Al2O3 multilayers are promising as mirrors for the soft x-ray regime. Here we discuss the interface structure before and after annealing of the multilayers as derived from small angle scattering experiments using a conventional x-ray diffractometer. Our measurements indicate that C/Al2O3 multilayers are stable for at least 1 h at an annealing temperature of 1100 °C. The interface roughness of only 0.3 nm remains nearly constant after annealing. Furthermore, we present simulations and for the first time experimental reflectivities in the soft x-ray regime obtained with synchrotron radiation from the BESSY I storage ring. For C/Al2O3 multilayers without interfacial roughness a normal incidence reflectivity of 61% is expected at the C K edge (E = 284 eV). Measurements with synchrotron radiation and with fixed energy corresponding to the C K edge yielded reflectivities of 31% for an incidence angle of 13° and 5.6% for an incidence angle of 52°. In addition, V/Al2O3 multilayers are promising as mirrors within the water window exhibiting theoretical reflectivities of up to 70% without roughness at the V L resonance (E = 512 eV).

Pharmacological amelioration of IR and understanding its pathophysiology are therefore essential for successful management of these disorders. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms of action of thiazolidinediones (TDs), anew family of insulin-sensitizing agents. Experimental studies of various models of IR and an increasing number of clinical studies have shown that TDs normalize a wide range of metabolic abnormalities associated with IR. By improving insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscles, the adipose tissue and hepatocytes, TDs reduce fasting hyperglycaemia and insulinaemia. Furthermore, TDs markedly influence lipid metabolism they decrease plasma triglyceride, free fatty acid and LDL-cholesterol levels, and increase plasma HDL- cholesterol concentrations. Although TDs do not stimulate insulin secretion, they improve the secretory response of beta cells to insulin secretagogues. TDs act at various levels of glucose and lipid metabolism - ameliorate some defects in the signalling cascade distal to the insulin receptor and improve glucose uptake in insulin-resistant tissues via increased expression of glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4. TDs also activate glycolysis in hepatocytes, oppose intracellular actions of cyclic AMP, and increase intracellular magnesium levels. TDs bind to peroxisome proliferator activating receptors y (PPARγ), members of the steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors involved in adipocyte differentiation and glucose and lipid homeostasis. Activation of PPARγ results in the expression of adipocyte-specific genes and differentiation of various cell types in mature adipocytes capable of active glucose uptake and energy storage in the form of lipids. Furthermore, TDs inhibit the pathophysiological effects exerted-by tumour-necrosis factor (TNFα), a cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of IR. These effects are most likely also mediated by stimulation of PPARγ. In mature adipocytes, PPARγ stimulation inhibits stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) enzyme activity resulting in a change of cell membrane fatty acid composition. Apart from their metabolic actions, TDs modulate cardiovascular function and morphology independently of the insulin-sensitizing effects. TDs decrease blood pressure in various models of hypertension as well as in hypertensive insulin- resistant patients, and inhibit proliferation, hypertrophy and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) induced by growth factors. These processes are considered to be crucial in the development of vascular remodelling, atherosclerosis and diabetic organ complications. TDs induce vasodilation by blockade of Ca2+ mobilisation from intracellular stores and by inhibition of extracellular calcium uptake via L-channels. Furthermore, TDs interfere with pressor systems (catecholamines, renin-angiotensin system) and enhance endothelium-dependent vasodilation. A key role of TDs effects in vascular remodelling is played by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. This signalling pathway is important for VSMC growth and migration in response to stimulation with tyrosine-kinase dependent growth factors. In addition to the vasoprotective mechanisms mentioned above, troglitazone, the latest representative of this pharmacological group, possesses antioxidant actions comparable to vitamin E. In summary, TDs have the unique ability to attack mechanisms responsible for metabolic alterations as well as for vascular abnormalities characteristic for IR. Therefore, TDs represent a powerful research tool in attempts to find a common denominator underlying the pathophysiology of the metabolic syndrome X. A recently reported link between MAP kinase signalling pathway and PPARγ transcriptional activity suggests that this research direction is promising.","Hypertension; Insulin resistance; Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Thiazolidinediones; Troglitazone","ciglitazone; troglitazone; antioxidant activity; drug effect; drug indication; drug mechanism; enzyme activation; glucose metabolism; hypertension; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pathophysiology; review; syndrome X; Antioxidants; Blood Vessels; Chromans; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Microvascular Angina; Thiazoles; Thiazolidinediones; Vasodilator Agents",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031698177

Despite the numerous large apical lipid droplets, the lipid concentration in the digestive glands of S. lessoniana and Photololigo sp. was lower than that reported for most squid species. There was no relationship between lipid concentration and stage of digestion, suggesting that lipid is not stored in the gland after a meal. There was also no relationship between lipid concentration and the sex of an individual or stage of reproductive maturity, suggesting that these squids are not storing lipid in the digestive gland for use in fuelling reproductive maturation or providing an energy source for oocytes.

The most abundant fatty acid in the immature and adult specimens was 18:1 (n-9). In the wax esters this fatty acid accounted for up to 75 % and together with the 18:1(n-7) fatty acid comprised up to 90 % of total wax ester fatty acids. The fatty acid composition of the eggs was very similar to that of the females. The predominance of the 18:1 fatty acids is an extraordinary lipid characteristic within the marine zooplankton community. It was less pronounced in the younger stages, where 16:0, 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) were also important fatty acids. Together with the 18:1(n-9) fatty acid, the above were generally the principal components of the phospholipids. The alcohol moieties of the wax esters consisted almost exclusively of the 2 saturated shorter-chain fatty alcohols 14:0 and 16:0. Fatty acids and alcohols increased linearly with total lipid mass and total lipid content, independent of developmental stage, sex, region, season and food supply. The predominant 18:1(n-9) fatty acid exhibited the highest accumulation rate, triple that of the second most abundant fatty acid 20:5(n-3). The seasonal and ontogenetic lipid compositions suggest that these energy reserves play an important role in metabolic maintenance during the overwintering period and, in particular, allow reproductive processes to take place in late winter/early spring, independent of primary production.","Euphausiids; Fatty acids and alcohols; Krill; Lipid storage; Overwintering; Reproduction; Wax esters","lipid; metabolism; overwintering; reproductive cycle; zooplankton; Weddell Sea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausia crystallorophias; Euphausia crystallorophias; Euphausiacea; Euphausiacea; Euphausiidae; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032480247

Both methods are tested against analytical solutions of the heat-conduction equation for given diurnal cycles of the cylinder-surface temperature. The modified Force-Restore method gives acceptable results when the diurnal change in the surface temperature is not very different from a sinusoidal wave of 1-day cycle. The digital filter method can produce correct results for any patterns of diurnal cycles, if the time series of the surface temperature is given for more than 1-day period centered by the evaluation time of heat storage.

The rating currents of these coils are from 13 to 32 kA and total magnetically stored energy reached 1.6 GJ. These coils are excited by six d.c. power supplies and each coil current is controlled with high accuracy to make a magnetic surface required for various plasma experiments. At the same time, it is required that these power supplies discharge the stored energy quickly when coil quench is detected. This paper introduces the quench protection circuit installed in the power supplies. For this system, a 30 kA and 2 kV class d.c. current breaker using the parallel connection of a small vacuum circuit breaker (VCB) and power fuse is developed. Also, the best discharge resistor set, that dumps stored energy in the wide operation range of the LHD without changing connection, is found using numerical simulation. To confirm the reliability of quench protection and operation delay, operating tests are done using an actual quench protection system and power supply. In this test, more than 400 shots for three deference power systems are finished without any operation failure. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

During these pulses, the toroidal field (TF) coils operate with a constant current. The central solenoid (CS) and poloidal field (PF) coils, on the other hand, are each independently powered. The maximum terminal voltages during plasma operation and protective discharges are 15 kV for CS and 10 kV for TF and PF. The energy stored in the 20 TF coil system is 103 GJ; in each of the other coils it is approximately 10 GJ or less. This paper describes the protection requirements and selected design concepts being considered for the large superconducting coils for the ITER. Ground faults, short circuits and helium leaks are the major serious accidents to be prevented in the coils. All coils use a solid insulation system to avoid ground faults. The electrical circuits including coil and power supply are grounded through resistors that limit current in the event of a ground fault. In the case of a short circuit within the coil winding, a large energy would be dissipated close to the small shorted volume. The impact of the short circuit can be reduced by using a potential screen. Inside the cryostat, helium leakage is most likely at the electrical insulating breaks in the cryogenic cooling lines between the coils and helium manifolds. A double containment (metallic shield and glass-epoxy) is therefore provided for the insulation breaks to allow for the detection of small leaks and to limit the spread of helium to other locations. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

To avoid these perturbations, UV laser crosslinking offers an alternative, although the energies required for significant crosslinking cause extensive DNA damage. We find that a combination of femtosecond laser pulses at two different wavelengths, in the UV and the visible range, increases the crosslinking efficiency while minimizing DNA damage.

The best aeration strategies were determined for eight Brazilian locations based on the simulated results of over drying costs, deterioration, and electrical energy to operate the fan using 10 years of weather data. The computer model simulated one-dimensional forced convection using a non-equilibrium model, heat conduction in the direction of the airflow for periods without ventilation, and grain deterioration during the storage period. The least cost fan control method for wheat aeration was a differential thermostat that operated the fan according to the difference between the average grain temperature and the dry bulb temperature of the outside ambient air. The best aeration conditions with grain at 13% initial moisture content were a differential thermostat setting between 5 and 7°C, a linear airflow rate between 1 and 3 L s-1 m-3, and an air temperature increment between 1 and 5°C. The maximum allowable storage times for storing aerated wheat at 13% initial moisture content in round bins were Curitiba (12 mo), Porto Alegre (11 mo), São Paulo (10 mo), Belo Horizonte (9 mo), Goiânia (8 mo), Florianópolis (8 mo), Campo Grande (7 mo), and Cuiabá (4 mo). These maximum times correlated fairly well with the annual average time that the ambient air temperature was below 15°C. The maximum allowable storage time was up to 3 mo shorter for horizontal grain storage structures than for round bins.","Aeration; Computer simulation; Deterioration model; Economics; Grain",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032167093

A shallow solar pond, which can be built as an integral part of a greenhouse, can be used for both collection and storage of solar energy. The heat given out by the shallow solar pond is used for heating the greenhouse during the day. In addition, the collected heat during the day can also be used efficiently for heating the greenhouse at night. The performance of the shallow solar pond is investigated under different weather conditions for different solar pond areas. The results show, particularly, that using a shallow solar pond in a greenhouse can provide great saving of energy needed to heat the greenhouses in the months between March and October. There is no need to use any auxiliary heat between May and September, as the solar heat alone is sufficient to provide all the necessary heating; the energy stored by the pond during the day is enough to provide the night time heating or the necessary heat under cloudy conditions. The results suggest that there is a huge potential in using shallow solar ponds in greenhouses to save energy. Another obvious attraction is that it would be relatively cheap to implement the novel idea of such application. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A Neel-Arrhenius type model is introduced to calculate the degradation of a square wave magnetization pattern subject to thermal agitation. Because the equivalent external field which reduces the energy barrier is the time and spatially varying magnetostatic field produced by magnetic transitions, an iterative procedure is utilized to obtain the time dependent magnetization. The model takes into account distributions of grain volume and anisotropy axis.

Additionally, organic material, which may represent inhaled threshing residues, was present in the anthracotic areas. As threshing residues and seeds in husk also were detected in the Iceman's belongings, some kind of rustic occupation seems probable.

Em. Rchb.) and compared with related non-wetland species (Senecio jacobaea L., Myosotis arvensis [L.] Hill.) with respect to ethanolic fermentation (PDC activity, ethanol production). In response to 24 h of hypoxic treatment, the pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) activity in roots increased 4-fold in M. arvensis and S. jacobaea, 2-fold in S. aquaticus and only slightly in M. palustris. The rise in PDC activity was accompanied by an increase in ethanol content in the roots. The increase in ethanolic fermentation in roots of intact plants was associated with a slight increase in fructose and glucose and in a clear rise in sucrose content during the first 24-48 h after commencement of the hypoxic treatment. Following 24 h of hypoxia, the content of fructans started to increase significantly for the duration of the experiment (9 days) in the four species.

Specifically, several experiments examined the impact of various 5-HT receptor agonists on NPY stimulated eating and alterations in respiratory quotient (RQ). This included the 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor agonist RU 24969, the 5-HT(1B/2C) agonist TFMPP and the 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist DOI. In feeding tests conducted at the onset of the dark cycle, RU 24969, TFMPP and DOI were administered 5 min prior to PVN injection of NPY and food intake was measured 1 h postinjection. The metabolic effects of NPY following similar pretreatment were monitored using an open-circuit calorimeter measuring the volume of oxygen consumed (VO2), carbon dioxide produced (VCO2) and RQ (VCO2/VO2). PVN injection of NPY (50-100 pmol) potentiated feeding and evoked reliable increases in RQ. DOI (5-20 nmol), but not RU 24969 (5-20 nmol) or TFMPP (10-40 nmol), antagonized NPY induced eating and blocked the peptide's effects on RQ. These findings suggest that 5-HT(2A) receptors within the PVN modulate NPY's effect on feeding and energy substrate utilization at the start of the nocturnal period.","DOI; Energy substrate utilization; Food intake; Hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus; Neuropeptide Y; RU 24969; Serotonin; TFMPP","5 methoxy 3 (1,2,3,6 tetrahydro 4 pyridyl) 1h indole; fenfluramine; flesinoxan; immunoglobulin; neuropeptide y; serotonin agonist; animal experiment; animal model; article; body fat; calorimetry; energy metabolism; feeding; food deprivation; hyperphagia; immunocompetent cell; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; priority journal; rat; reliability; thermogenesis; utilization review; Animals; Drug Synergism; Eating; Indoles; Male; Microinjections; Neuropeptide Y; Oxygen Consumption; Piperazines; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Serotonin Agonists",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032563682

Treated straws were prepared by mixing straw either with water followed by dusting with CaO at 160 g kg-1 DM or with a NaOH solution alone at 3 l kg-1 DM to supply 80 g NaOH kg-1 DM (Na) or pre-soaked with Na exactly as in the previous treatment for 27 h followed by mixing with 130 g H2O2 kg-1 DM (AHP) for 6 h. After 14 days of storage, the treated straws and an untreated straw (U) were fed automatically every 2 h to four individually housed sheep together with a supplement in a 4×4 latin square experiment. Each kilogram supplement DM contained 422 g CP and 10.8 MJ ME. NDF (p&lt;0.001) and hemicellulose (p&lt;0.01) contents were significantly reduced whereas cellulose was increased (p&lt;0.001) in treated compared to untreated straw. ADL was reduced in Ca (p&lt;0.05) but increased (p&lt;0.05) in Na and AHP compared with U. The rumen and total tract digestibility were significantly (p&lt;0.001) greater in sheep fed treated compared with untreated straw. Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) between treatments for pH, NH3 and VFA were also observed. All treatments improved the nutritive value of straws compared with untreated through modification of cell wall with a subsequent increase in digestibility by sheep. Although the digestibility for Ca was lower than that for Na despite reduction in cell wall, its use to treat straws may be more safe and cost effective than Na. AHP was the most effective and could also improve the energy value of other low quality forages for ruminants. However, the need of AHP for a large amount of NaOH to achieve highly alkaline pH limits its farm scale application. Therefore, further studies should either consider reducing the amount of NaOH or finding alternative alkalis that are cost effective and user-friendly. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.","Alkaline hydrogen peroxide; Calcium oxide; Digestion; Rumen fermentation; Sheep; Sodium hydroxide; Wheat straw",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000231950

Since it avoids O(N3) computational effort of matrix diagonalization, it requires only O(N) computational efforts where N is the dimension of the statevector. The use of this O(N) algorithm is very effective since otherwise we have to calculate a large number of eigenstates, i.e. the occupied one-electron states up to the Fermi energy and the unoccupied states with higher energy. The advantage of this method compared to the Chebyshev polynomial method recently developed by Wang [27,28] is that our method can calculate linear response functions without any storage of huge statevectors on external storage. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Based on this study the focus for research and technological improvements should be on conversion yields from wood, harvester equipment capabilities, and plantation yields.","Biomass; Conversion facility size; Factorial design; Harvesting; Wood conversion; Wood deterioration","alcohol production; biomass fermentation; biomass; cost benefit analysis; hydrolysis; mathematical analysis; Algorithms; Costs; Dynamic programming; Energy conversion; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Fermentation; Harvesting; Hydrolysis; Production; Sensitivity analysis; Wood; Conversion facility size; Factorial design; Wood conversion; Wood deterioration; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344110469

Eng., North Carolina State University, Campus Box 7910, Raleigh, NC 27695-7910, United States","Convective heat transfer in porous media is a subject of growing interest. This is because of many important engineering applications of porous media. Such applications can be found in heat exchangers, energy storage units, chemical reactors, heat pipes, electronic cooling and ceramic processing. One of important and fundamental fluid flow situations in porous media is Couette flow which can occur, for example, betwen two parallel flat plates, one of which is at rest, and the other is moving in its own plane with a constant velocity, uw. Since in Couette flow velocity of the moving plate can be large, and also viscous forces in the boundary layer near the moving plate cna be significant, to obtain a correct description of the flow, it can be important to account for non-Darcian effects, namely, for the inertial (Forchheimer) and for the viscous (Brinkman) effects [1]. Investigations of heat transfer in Couette flow throgh a porous medium are limited to the case of a Brinkman-Darcy porous medium [2,3]. In an insight investigation by Nakayama [4], analytical solutions for different situations of Couette flow through an inelastic porous medium, including a porous medium described by the Brinkman-Forschheimer extension of the Darcy law, are obtained. However, results of ref. [4] are limited to the fluid flow analysis only, and no investigation of heat transfer is made in this reference. To the best of the author's knowledge, no attempt to analyze heat transfer in Couette flow through a Brinkman-Forchheimer-Darcy porous medium has yet been made. In [4] it is assumed that the channel is completely filled with a porous medium which is at rest, and there is no gap between the porous medium and the moving plate. Such a geometry can result in large friction forces between the porous matrix and the moving plate. This canlead to a damage of the porous matrix. In practical situations, it is necessary to assume that between a porous medium and a moving plate there is a gap filled with a clear fluid. Even if this gap is small, its influence on heat transfer can be significant. Accounting for this gap essentially complicates the problem, because it is necessary to analyze fluid flow and heat transfer in a composite channel, whcih is partially filled with a fluid saturated porous medium, and partially with a clear fluid. In solving this problem, correct boundary conditions at the porous medium/clear interface are important. In this research we utilize the boundary cnoditions at the interface suggested in Ochoa-Tapia and Whitaker [5,6].The problem of fluid flow and heat transfer in Couette flow through a composite channel, which is partially filled with a fluid saturated porous medium and partially with a clear fluid, is studied. The flow in the porous region is described by the Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended Darcy equation. The analysis of heat transfer insulated fixed plate and isoflux moving plate are considered. The problem is solved under the boundary layer approximation. Analytical solutions for the flow velocity, temperature distribution, and for the Nusselt number are obtained.",,"Approximation theory; Boundary layer flow; Channel flow; Nusselt number; Porous materials; Couette flow; Heat convection; channel; convection; Couette flow; heat transfer; porous medium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032146673

Exfoliation, which occurs after implantation of high doses of 1.6-MeV He-ions (&gt;1.4 x 1017 ions cm-2, corresponding to 5% atomic proportion), could set an upper limit to the concentration of imbedded actinides (about 2 atoms % corresponding to 20 wt. %) or storage age unless significant diffusion of radiogenic He intervenes. This process has been studied by combining He implantation, thermal treatments in the temperature range 124-250°C and measurement of the resulting He profile by an ion beam technique (ERDA) using 8.5-MeV C ions. The diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius' law with an activation energy of 120 (±2) KJ/mole and a frequency factor of 14.5 (±7) x 10-3 cm2 sec-1 in agreement with literature data.

L., Paris-Cedex, France","The initial stage of a HLW disposal will be dominated by a strong thermal gradient that will exist between the hot canister and the 'cold' geological medium. In the case of hot wastes (MOx, direct disposal of used spent fuel, short interim storage), nuclear glass can begin to dissolve in groundwater and to interact with other materials in the presence of a thermal gradient. Moreover, it has already been demonstrated that thermal gradients strongly influence the hydrothermal corrosion of nuclear glass by creating large elemental segregation and subsequent mass transport processes. The aim of this article is to experimentally test whether the presence of a simulated engineered clay barrier affects these mass transport processes. In parallel, experiments were performed with different clays of various Si/Al ratios (smectite, kaolinite and allophane) as Si and Al are often invoked as possible rate limiting species for nuclear glass aging. A simulated nuclear glass was disposed between two layers of various clays, enclosed in a sealed gold tube filled with deionised water. The gold tube was put in a cold-seal vessel and submitted to a thermal field under high temperatures (300-200°C, 140 bars, 100 days). High temperatures were used in order to enhance transformation kinetics as mass transport is supposed to be independent of the temperature. At the end of the experiments, the newly formed phases along the tube as well as the mineralogical transformations of the reactants were studied by integrated in-situ analyses (SEM, TEM, EDS and XRD). Precise descriptions of the mineralogical transformations are presented. The major result is a systematic re-crystallization of the initial clay under the influence of the leached elements from the glass (in particular Si and alkalies). The nuclear glass aging is strongly affected by the composition of the surrounding clay and consumes Al from the clay. The aluminous-rich medium seems to limit the glass corrosion and the crystallinity of the newly formed phases. Furthermore, the cold end of the system is devoted to almost pure Al-Si bearing minerals associated with borate. This finding attests to (i) the migration capacities of Si, Al and B through the clay barrier and (ii) the confining properties of the clay barrier for the heaviest elements (Fe, Zn, Zr) which were mineralogically trapped at the clay-glass interface. In conclusion, the study reveals that interactions between the nuclear glass and the backfill materials are important. Thus, these interactions have to be taken into account in order to predict the long term evolution of the system. Furthermore, backfill materials are an efficient chemical barrier which favors the immobilization of the heaviest elements (Fe, Zn and Zr in our experiments).",,"Backfill materials; Chemical interaction; Hydrothermal corrosion; Mineralogical transformations; Nuclear glass; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Glass; Mass transfer; Radioactive waste disposal; Reaction kinetics; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermal gradients; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction analysis; Geological repositories; backfill; geochemistry; radioactive waste; temperature gradient",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032143451

This paper also examines the use of cool thermal storage equipment for gas turbine inlet air cooling, which can positively enhance its efficiency. It has been observed that the application of TES has been predominantly in North America. However, in the mid-1990 s, applications have begun to appear in Asia, Australia, Europe and South America.

Traditionally, available heat has been stored in the form of sensible heat (typically by raising the temperature of water, rocks, etc.) for later use. In most of the low temperature applications, water is being used as a storage medium. Latent heat storage on the other hand, is a young and developing technology which has found considerable interest in recent times due to its operational advantages of smaller temperature swing, smaller size and lower weight per unit of storage capacity. It has been demonstrated that, for the development of a latent heat thermal energy storage system, the choice of the phase change material (PCM) plays an important role in addition to heat transfer mechanisms in the PCM. Attempts have also been made to utilize technical grade phase change materials as storage media and embedded heat exchange tubes/heat pipes with extended surfaces in order to enhance the heat transfer rate to/from the PCM. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To avoid the possible nonisothermality due to the large heat of reaction between hydrogen and LaNi4.5Al0.5, the reaction rates were measured at the initial stage of hydriding reaction of LaNi4.5Al0.5 in the subdivided sections of the plateau pressure region (a coexistence region of α- and ß-phases). The shrinking unreacted core model could be applied to the analysis of the kinetic data for the hydriding reaction of LaNi4.5Al0.5. The rate-controlling step of this reaction was the dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen molecules on the surface of LaNi4.5Al0.5. The activation energy was 9506 cal/g-mol H2. The rate equation for the hydriding reaction of LaNi4.5Al0.5 was measured in the temperature range from 273 to 343 K and in the pressure difference (Po-Peq) range from 25.3 to 66.9 kPa as shown in the following equation. dX/dt =103(Po - Peq) exp (- 9056/RT) © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

A group of 13 highly skilled male cross-country skiers roller skied at 19.0 (SD 0.1) km h-1 without additional load and with loads of 6% and 12% body mass (m(b)). Oxygen uptake (VO2), knee and ankle joint kinematics, roller-ski electromyogram (EMG) of the vastus lateralis and gas-trocnemius lateralis muscles, and roller ski velocity were recorded during the last 40 s of each 4-min period of roller skiing. One-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the VO2 expressed relative to total mass (m(tot)), joint kinetics, eccentric-to-concentric ratio of the integrated EMG, velocity changes within a cycle, and cycle rate did not change significantly with load. The subsequent analysis of the effect of load on each resistance opposing motion suggested that the power to sustain changes in translational kinetic energy, potential energy, and overcoming rolling resistance increased proportionately with the load. The lack of a significant change in VO2/m(tot) with external loading was associated with a lack of marked change in external mechanical power relative to m(tot). The existence of an EMG signal during the eccentric phase prior to the thrust (concentric phase), as well as the lack of significant delay between the two phases, showed that a stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) occurs in roller ski skating. Taken together, the present results would suggest that external loading up to 12% m(b) does not increase storage and release of elastic energy of lower limb muscles during SSC in roller ski skating.","Energy cost; External loading; Ski skating; Stretch-shortening cycle","oxygen; adult; ankle; article; biomechanics; body mass; electromyogram; energy consumption; gastrocnemius muscle; human; human experiment; knee; male; normal human; oxygen consumption; priority journal; skiing; Adult; Biomechanics; Electromyography; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Lactic Acid; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Skating; Skiing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031872414

The formulation considers the axial conduction of heat, both in the fluid and in the solid wall. The mixing parameters introduced in the boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the tank in the fluid region account for mixing due to inlet and outlet streams with the stored fluid.

Myocardial preservation for heart transplantation relies on hyperkalemic cardiac arrest and hypothermic storage. Our study investigated whether pretreatment with a potassium-channel opener (cromakalim) before prolonged storage in an extracellular fluid improves left ventricular recovery. Methods. Rabbit hearts were submitted to 6-hours' cold storage and assessed on a blood-perfused isolated heart preparation. Hemodynamic recovery, enzyme release (creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase), and adenine nucleotide content were determined. Five groups were tested: control (n = 6), no ischemia; UW group (n = 7), hearts arrested with and stored in University of Wisconsin solution; STH group (n = 5), hearts arrested with and stored in St. Thomas' Hospital solution; cromakalim group (n = 6), hearts pretreated with cromakalim (30 μg/kg) before arrest with and storage in St. Thomas' Hospital solution; and glibenclamide group (n = 5), hearts pretreated with cromakalim followed by glibenclamide (a potassium-channel blocker) before arrest with and storage in St. Thomas' Hospital solution. Results. Hemodynamic recovery was improved and enzyme release was lower in the UW group than in the STH group. Compared with the STH group, the group pretreated with cromakalim had significantly decreased left ventricular end- diastolic pressures, increased left ventricular developed pressures, increased maximal values of positive and negative rates of rise of left ventricular pressure, and increased time constant of isovolumetric relaxation. Hemodynamic recovery was similar in the UW group and cromakalim groups. Glibenclamide did not abolish the effects of cromakalim. None of the protocols affected myocardial energy stores. Conclusions. Pretreatment with cromakalim affords additional protection to that provided by cardioplegic arrest and prolonged cold storage using an extracellular solution.

By storage in ambient, the low rectifying I-V curves become strong rectifying, and C-V curves become MIS-like. I-T characteristics for fresh samples have only one activation energy, in the 0.49-0.55 eV range. After storage, a slightly modified value, of about 0.50-0.60 eV is observed at low temperatures only. At about 280 K, the activation energy suddenly changes to 1.20-1.80 eV. Also, both the number and the positions of maxima in thermally stimulated depolarisation currents change by storage. The annealing at about 50°C induces small reversible changes in I-T characteristics and strong irreversible ones in thermally stimulated depolarisation currents, both for fresh and stored samples. A simplified quantum confinement model is proposed to explain the main aspects of the electrical behaviour of porous silicon films. The surface and/or interface contributions are observed especially in thermally stimulated depolarisation currents. The changes induced by storage are attributed to the oxidation process of the internal surface of porous silicon films. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

However, previous investigations involving only stimulation of the semi-circular canals have been inconclusive. We measured gain and time constant (TC) of horizontal canal-ocular reflex (COR) and magnitude of otolith-ocular reflex (OOR). We found that MS susceptibility was not correlated to COR gain but was negatively correlated to OOR magnitude. Thus, MS susceptible individuals do not have more sensitive vestibular systems. We also found a positive correlation between MS susceptibility and TC. We hypothesize that central vestibular integration (velocity storage mechanism), by increasing low frequency vestibular inputs, would favour MS.","Motion sickness; MSQ; Off vertical axis rotation (OVAR); Vestibular; Vestibulo-ocular reflex","adult; article; clinical article; disease predisposition; energy expenditure; eye movement; head position; human; hypothesis; male; motion sickness; nystagmus; priority journal; questionnaire; semicircular canal; vestibular function",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032514194

Selmi 2, 40126 Bologna, Italy","A combination of variable-temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy and molecular mechanics calculations. have been used to probe the factors that determine the rate of macrocyclic ring rotation in benzylic amide [2]catenanes. The results show that the interlocked macrocycle dynamics are governed by a delicate combination of steric-effects, intricate inter-macrocyclic arrays of hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking, and T herringbone-type interactions. A cascade of hydrogen-bond ruptures and formations is the principal event during circumvolution (complete rotation of one macrocyclic ring about the other) but is accompanied by a series of cooperative conformational and co-conformational rearrangements that help to stabilize the energy of the molecule. The experimental picture is consistent both when activation energies are measured from the coalescence of NMR signals and when rate constants are directly measured by spin polarization transfer by selective inversion recovery (SPT-SIR) methods. The nature of the circumrotational process means that the precise structure of the diacylaromatic units has a tremendous effect on the frequency of macrocyclic ring rotation: a 2,5-thiophene-based catenane rotates 3.2 million-fold faster than the analogous 2,6-pyridine-based system at room temperature! The polarity of the environment also plays a crucial role in determining the inter-ring dynamics: reducing the strength of the ground-state hydrogen-bonding network by employing hydrogen bond-disrupting solvents (methanol, DMSO) increases the rate of rotation. by lowering the activation energy for circumvolution (normally in the region of 11-20 kcal mol-1) by up to 3.2 kcal mol-1. This allows exquisite control over the kinetics of the translational behavior of the individual components of an interlocked molecular system, a key requirement for their development as nanoscale shuttles, switches, and information storage systems.",,"macrocyclic compound; article; calculation; drug structure; in vitro study; model; molecular dynamics; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; quantum mechanics; temperature; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032496950

Intracerebroventricular leptin administration did not result in leakage of the hormone into the peripheral circulation. Thus, its effects were elicited by its presence within the central nervous system. Intracerebroventricular leptin infusion produced marked decreases in food intake and body weight gain relative to vehicle-infused fed ad libitum rats. Because decreases in food intake alter hormonometabolic homeostasis, additional control rats pair-fed to the amount of food consumed by leptin-infused ones were included in the study. Intracerebroventricular leptin-infused and vehicle-infused pair-fed rats were characterized, relative to vehicle-infused ad libitum-fed animals, by decreases in body weight and insulinemia and by increases in insulin- stimulated overall glucose utilization and muscle and brown adipose tissue glucose utilization index. Brown adipose tissue uncoupling protein (UCP)1, UCP2, and UCP3 mRNA levels were markedly decreased in pair-fed animals relative to those of fed ad libitum control animals, as were liver and white adipose tissue UCP2 and muscle UCP3 mRNA levels. In marked contrast, intracerebroventricular leptin administration was accompanied by the maintenance of high UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 expression in all these tissues. Thus, despite analogies between leptin's effects and those of pair-feeding with regard to glucose handling, their respective underlying mechanisms differ. While leptin maintains or favors energy-dissipating mechanisms (UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3), the latter are markedly depressed in pair-fed rats. This effect of leptin may prevent subsequent excessive storage processes, thereby maintaining normal body homeostasis.",,"leptin; uncoupling protein; animal experiment; animal model; article; body temperature; brown adipose tissue; carbohydrate metabolism; central nervous system; controlled study; drug effect; food intake; glucose metabolism; glucose utilization; homeostasis; hormonal regulation; intracerebroventricular drug administration; lipolysis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; rat; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Animals; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Brain; Carrier Proteins; Eating; Gene Expression; Glucose; Glucose Clamp Technique; Insulin; Ion Channels; Leptin; Male; Membrane Proteins; Membrane Transport Proteins; Mitochondrial Proteins; Muscles; Proteins; Rats; Rats, Zucker; RNA, Messenger",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031748933

Changes in the size of the SOC pool have implications for soil productivity and for atmospheric concentrations of CO2, an important 'greenhouse gas'. We reviewed recent findings from long-term research sites to determine the impact of cropping practices on SOC reserves in the region. From this overview, we suggest that: (1) the loss of SOC upon conversion of soils to arable agriculture has abated; (2) significant gains in SOC (typically about 3 Mg C ha-1 or less within a decade) can be achieved in some soils by adoption of improved practices, like intensification of cropping systems, reduction in tillage intensity, improved crop nutrition, organic amendments, and reversion to perennial vegetation; (3) changes in SOC occur predominantly in 'young' or labile fractions; (4) the change in SOC; either gain or loss, is of finite duration and magnitude; (5) estimates of SOC change from individual studies are subject to limitations and are best viewed as part of a multi-site network; and (6) the energy inputs into agroecosystems need to be included in the calculation of the net C balance.

The respiratory costs of different physiological processes in the total respiratory expenditures are estimated for herbaceous plants adapted to growth conditions: growth and maintenance - 55-65%, export from leaves - 15-20%, transport and storage of assimilates - 10-15%, absorption of ions by roots - 5-10%. It is established that, in mature leaves, up to 30% of assimilated carbon is utilized for the renewal of structure and maintenance of assimilate export. Among sinks of different types, the least respiratory costs were attributed to specialized storage organs (tubers), which reflects low energy consumption by the processes of phloem unloading and biomass growth due to the synthesis and deposition of starch. It is found that developmental changes in the respiration to photosynthesis ratio are closely correlated with changes in sourcesink relations, whereas their magnitude depends on the type of morphological and physiological organization of the source-sink system (SSS) of plants. We conclude that plant respiration plays an important role in SSS as a powerful metabolic sink for carbon, which provides energy for substrate conversion into biomass and for specific functions of assimilating, supplying, and utilizing organs.","Assimilate storage; Efflux; Organs; Plant; Respiration; Source-sink system; Transport",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032339062

The available lysine contents were monitored periodically. Highest and lowest reaction rates were observed in the model systems containing glucose and fructose, respectively, at the three temperatures. The two disaccharides behaved very similarly, with reaction rates between those of the monosaccharides studied. The activation energies of glucose, lactose and maltose systems were similar (116-132 kJmol-1), while that of fructose was somewhat higher (166 kJmol-1). This difference was supposed to be in part due to the different mechanism of tautomerization of fructose, highly dependent on temperature. Therefore, though the potential nutritional damage at moderate temperatures is lower when fructose is used instead of other reducing sugars, its higher activation energy can reverse the effect at higher temperatures.",,"casein; fructose; glucose; lactose; lysine; maltose; sugar; article; food processing; food storage; glycation; heating; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032127597

The injected hole originated by the channel electron induced avalanche hot hole generation is believed to be responsible for this degradation. This hole injection phenomena not only result in the interface state generation but also lead to the hole trapping in the tunnel oxide. The increased interface states degrade the conduction of the channel current severely, which leads to abnormal write/erase (W/E) endurance characteristics. The trapped holes in the tunnel oxide increase the tunneling probability and cause the gate disturbance issue. From the concerns of long term reliability, the self-convergence operation by utilizing the DAHE mechanism is not a proper scheme for reliable Flash memory products.","Charge loss; Drain-avalanche hot electron injection; Flash memory; Gate disturbance; Hot-hole injection; Interface state; Self-convergence","Electric currents; Electron energy levels; Electron tunneling; Hole traps; Hot carriers; Interfaces (materials); Drain-avalanche hot electron (DAHE) electron injection; Flash memory; Hot hole injection; Semiconductor storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032114778

The major component was selected among nonconventional or conventional hydride electrode materials; alloys and intermetallic compounds of the AB2 or AB5 type. The minor component was amorphous MgxNi1 - x (x = 0.4, 0.5) or a 1:1 mixture of MgxNi1 - x and LmM5 (where Lm is a La-rich mischmetal and M5 is Ni3.6Co0.8Mn0.3Al0.3).

Linear programming is used for minimization of capital and operation costs. MODEST may be used to find the optimal investments and when to make them. The period under study can be divided into several linked subperiods which may consist of an arbitrary number of years. MODEST is here applied to a municipal electricity and district-heating system during three five-year periods. Each year is divided into three seasons. Demand peaks, as well as weekly and diurnal variations of, for example, costs are considered. The electricity demand is divided into the three sectors households, industries, and service. The electricity demand may be reduced by energy conservation, replacement of electric heating and load management. The profitability of load management, as well as cogeneration with and without heat storage at different prices of purchased power is calculated. At traditional Swedish electricity prices, the local utility should build a woodchips-fired steam-cycle CHP (combined heat and power) plant. Consumers would find it beneficial to reduce their electricity use by conservation and switching from electric heating to oil and biofuel. If just marginal power production costs are paid, the utility should introduce biomass-fired heat-only boilers instead. Electricity conservation is smaller at these lower prices. Load management is mainly profitable at the first price scheme which includes output-power-related charges. The heat storage should be used threefold: to cover demand peaks, as well as to enable increased CHP output when it is limited by the heat demand or to run heat pumps at cheap night electricity instead of in the daytime. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CHP; Energy storage; Linear programming; Load management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000924971

Increased tissue concentrations of the end product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), result in rapid and marked increases in leptin messenger RNA and protein levels (although these levels were much lower than those in fat). Plasma leptin levels and leptin mRNA and protein levels in adipose tissue also increase. Most important, stimulation of leptin synthesis is reproduced by either hyperglycaemia or hyperlipidaemia, which also increase tissue levels of UDP- N-acetylglucosamine in conscious rodents7.

Preneoplastic glycogen storage loci (GSF) occurred mainly upon treatment with NNM, and amphophilic cell loci (APF) were mainly observed in rats treated with DHEA alone or in combination with NNM. The 2 types of lesions belong to 2 different cellular lineages, the glycogenotic/basophilic lineage and the amphophilic lineage, which are characterized by distinct patterns of alterations in key enzymes of energy metabolism. Whereas in GSF enzymes of glucose metabolizing pathways were modified (increase in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, decrease in glucose-6-phosphatase), APF mainly demonstrated alterations in mitochondrial enzymes (increase in cytochrome c oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and, to a lower extent, in peroxisomal enzymes (increase in peroxisomal hydratase and acyl-CoA oxidase).

This study has shown that Hexamita does not depend entirely on exogenous lipid supplies and is able to incorporate [1-14C] acetate, albeit poorly, into its fatty acids, phospholipids and sterols. The major polar lipids detected were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and cerebrosides. Triacylglycerols were identified as the main storage lipids together with sterol esters. The major lipids identified in Hexamita reflect the lipids detected in the culture medium (with the exception of phosphatidylethanolamine); these lipids are believed to have been sequestered directly from the culture medium. It is possible that phosphatidylethanolamine was synthesised by Hexamita via phosphotransferase pathways. Incubation with radiolabelled palmitate, oleate or stearate showed that no further modifications (e.g. desaturation or elongation) had taken place.","Diplomonad; Fatty acids; Free-living; Giardia; Microaerobic; Phospholipids; Protozoa; Sphingomyelin; Steryl esters; Triacylglycerols","Hexamita",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032537625

To assess the destabilizing factors, a poloxamer 188 stabilized Compritol SLN formulation was prepared. Its stability was investigated as a function of storage temperature, light exposure and packing material (untreated and siliconized vials of glass quality T). In general, introduction of energy to the system (temperature, light) led to particle growth and subsequent gelation. This process was accompanied by a decrease in zeta potential from approximately -25 mV to -15 mV. The effect of the packing material was less pronounced. However, siliconization of the vials almost eliminated particle growth. By optimization of the storage conditions (8°C, in the dark, siliconized vials), a stability of the less stable aqueous Compritol SLN over 3 years was achieved.","Block copolymer; Long-term stability; Solid lipid nanoparticles; Zeta potential","glycerol behenate; glycerol derivative; nanoparticle; poloxamer; unclassified drug; article; dispersion; drug packaging; drug stability; light exposure; priority journal; spectrophotometry; storage; temperature; zeta potential",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032526787

The unit is fabricated locally and its performance is evaluated under Beirut Solar conditions. The heat transfer from the heat pipes to the hot-water storage tank took place through a circular end condenser section of the heat-pipe integrated within the collector frame. Tests of single heat pipes showed that the thermal performance of the heat pipe were dependent on its tilt angle, condenser section length and configuration, and type of internal wick used. A circular condenser end of the heat-pipe performed better than a straight condenser due to increased surface area for heat transfer. The R11-charged solar collector with integrated condenser for secondary cooling of water had an efficiency in early operation hours that reached values higher than 60% for the forced circulation mode. The instantaneous system efficiencies varied from 60 to 20%, which are in the range of conventional water solar collectors. System response was fast and sensitive to the incident solar radiation. The thermosyphonic mode of the system operation generated build up of stored energy in the condenser, resulting in oscillating-type flow thus reducing system efficiency below values obtained with forced circulation. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Heat-pipe solar collector; Refrigerant-charged solar collectors; Solar energy","Condensers (liquefiers); Cooling; Energy efficiency; Heat pipes; Heat transfer; Refrigerants; Solar energy; Thermosyphonic mode; Solar collectors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032098565

This study is motivated by the need to increase the performance of a more complex multi-layer latent heat thermal energy storage system used for smoothing daily electrical load profiles. In the first part, it is shown that melting from discrete heat sources may be substantially enhanced by a careful distribution and/or by activating the sources at different times. These strategies render the natural convection flows in the melt more efficient for melting the PCM and preventing overheating of the heat sources. In the second part of the study, passive air side heat transfer augmentation techniques are examined in order to improve heat recovery. It is found that augmented channels prolong the heat recovery period while maintaining the outlet temperature in a comfortable zone. Wire coiled channels proved to be very efficient for air flow Reynolds number Re above 1000.

It is based on the assumption that the phase change does not occur at a fixed temperature point, but within a range of temperatures, which is true for most phase change materials. The effect of the latent heat of melting is included by using an effective heat capacity within the melting range selected.

Possible impacts of climate change and variability on marine life have received some attention, mainly regarding changes in living conditions via changes in water temperature, wind and waves and other physical climate related forcing of the marine environment. There is also a chemical forcing of the marine environment caused by CO2 emissions to the atmosphere penetrating into the oceans. The perturbation of the marine environment through such indirect, i.e. via the atmosphere, storage of CO2 in the oceans may be estimated based on known and predicted atmospheric CO2 levels. Capture of CO2 from the flue gas of power plants and large industries followed by storage directly in the oceans may be a necessary component of a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy for the next century in order to achieve a stabilization of atmospheric CO2 levels. Direct storage of CO2 in the oceans may impose, at least locally, a stronger perturbation of the marine environment than indirect storage via the atmosphere. Storage of waste CO2 in aquifers below the seabed may also affect the marine environment if CO2 leaks out in the water column above. In view of the perturbations of the marine environment that are already ongoing as a consequence of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere and which will accelerate in the business-as-usual scenario as well as in scenarios including realistic CO2 removal options, there is a need to clarify the resilience of marine ecosystems to increased CO2. This paper discusses the large perturbations that are expected in various scenarios. One hypothesis is that direct ocean storage if performed in the most environment-friendly way may be acceptable, while continued emissions to the atmosphere and invasion across the air-sea-interface could lead not only to climate change but could also be harmful to marine food webs and ecosystem functions. Some experimental approaches that may be taken in order to contribute to a wider knowledge base for CO2 policies are briefly described.",,"Greenhouse gases; Ocean storage; Air pollution control; Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Greenhouse effect; Ocean dumping; Research and development management; Marine pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; environmental impact; oceanic sink; atmosphere; carbon dioxide fixation; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; gas waste; marine environment; priority journal; sea; waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031778854

So it is highly appropriate that there should be international collaboration to investigate technologies for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, the root cause of the problem. Sixteen countries, as well as three industrial sponsors, support the IEA Greenhouse Gas R and D Programme and, in many cases, industry is also involved indirectly, through the national memberships. This provides a broad range of interest and expertise to guide the management of the Programme, as well as ensuring that the results reach a wide audience. The IEA Greenhouse Gas R and D Programme has three main activities: (1) evaluation of technologies for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from use of fossil fuels; (2) dissemination of the results of these studies; (3) identification of targets for research, development and demonstration and promotion of these findings. In its first five years of operation, the Programme has studied the major greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane, and various means of of reducing their emissions. The main emphasis has been placed on capture, storage and utilisation of CO2 from power generation. This option is now much better understood and can be compared with more established measures, such as fuel switching, energy efficiency improvements and use of renewable energy. As well as studying abatement of CO2 emissions, the Programme has conducted a series of studies of technologies for reducing CH4 emissions from man-made sources. The Programme's activities are carried out by the Operating Agent, who develops and manages a series of technical studies to meet members' requirements. These studies are carried out by expert contractors, selected by competitive tendering. By these means, the members of the Programme gain access to valuable and topical information at moderate cost. The Programme has so far carried out about 40 separate evaluation studies. These have highlighted some key questions, which must be answered in order to enable application of CO2 sequestration techniques. For example, important issues concern the prediction of the performance and environmental impact of CO2 storage. To improve knowledge of such matters will involve practical investigations. International collaboration on practical research, development and demonstration will form an increasingly important part of the IEA Greenhouse Gas R and D Programme in future.",,"Greenhouse gases; Waste management; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; International cooperation; Research and development management; Waste disposal; Waste utilization; Air pollution control; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; air pollution control; conference paper; exhaust gas; gas waste; greenhouse effect; international cooperation; policy; priority journal; waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031775827

U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) efforts to implement this policy will be described. A secondary objective of this paper is to discuss from a U.S. perspective the social and political efforts which must be initiated in order for ocean storage of CO2 to be considered as a viable CO2 mitigation option. The fact that the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) has not been successful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is now recognized. Thus, U.S. policy has shifted towards the development of binding medium-term emissions targets and long-term atmosphere concentration goals. The U.S. believes these goals can be accomplished through the adoption of cost-effective joint implementation agreements and international emissions trading mechanisms. Studies are currently underway to assess specific targets and timetables for emissions reductions. Voluntary efforts on the part of U.S. industry have proven to be extremely successful in reducing U.S. CO2 emissions. The U.S. electric utility industry has taken the lead in voluntarily lowering greenhouse gas emissions under the DOE Climate Challenge Program. As of August, 1996, nearly 600 utility participants, accounting for over 60% of electric power generation in the U.S. have joined the program. Areas of research interest to DOE include the development of high efficiency advanced power generation cycles and CO2 sequestration technology. The U.S. currently spends $1.6 billion on understanding global climate phenomena and only $1.6 million on CO2 mitigation research. A number of socio-political considarations must be looked at in assessing the feasibility of ocean storage of CO2. Developing public trust appears to be a major concern in establishing the acceptability of ocean storage. Uncertainties in the effects of CO2 on marine life, potential safety hazards associated with pipelining, and ship transport of CO2 are all issues which must be dealt with as soon as possible. Some hidden costs associated with ocean disposal will also be discussed.",,"Climate change program; Ocean disposal; Ocean storage; United States policy; Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Environmental impact; Greenhouse effect; International cooperation; Marine pollution; Ocean dumping; Public policy; Research and development management; Social aspects; Climate change; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; emission; mitigation policy; air pollution control; conference paper; cost; gas waste; greenhouse effect; policy; priority journal; united states; waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031748049

Two criteria were used to select the most favorable binding site: the interaction energy of BHA with the protein and the mobility of BHA in each binding site. Using these criteria, the binding site located on the distal side of the heme and surrounded by His42, Arg38, Pro139, Leu138, Ala140, Phe68, Pro141, Gly69, Phe179, Phe41, Asn70, and Ser73 was found most promising. Computed distances between atoms in BHA and atoms in residues of HRP-C/CN were, in general, in good agreement with a subset of corresponding distances derived from 1H NMR data. In addition, two strong H bonds of BHA, with Arg38 and the N atom of the cyanide ligand, and two polar interactions of BHA, with His42 and Pro139, were found, consistent with the relatively high binding affinity of BHA for HRP-C/CN. The second most favorable binding site identified was located toward the proximal side of the heme at a distance of only 10 Å from the first binding site, as described above, suggesting it as a temporary storage place for the radical produced by oxidation of the first substrate molecule. This small displacement would allow accommodation of a second substrate molecule in the first site and dimerization to occur after the second substrate radical is formed through a second one-electron oxidation step. Although it is not known whether BHA forms dimers due to oxidation by HRP-C, other phenolic substrates that do form dimers may occupy both the primary binding site, where oxidation occurs, and the radical holding site, to facilitate dimer formation.",,"amino acid; benzohydroxamic acid; cyanide; dimer; heme; horseradish peroxidase; article; binding affinity; binding site; energy; enzyme substrate; hydrogen bond; oxidation; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; theory; X ray crystallography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032478975

Soil water also dominates the mass and energy balance of the soil-atmosphere interface. Over the last decade or so, the development and continuing refinement of the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) technique for in situ, nondestructive measurement of water, ionic solutes and air has revolutionized the study and management of the transfer and storage of mass and energy within the soil profile. TDR-measured water content has been applied successfully to water balance studies ranging from the km scales of small watersheds to the mm scale of the root-soil interface. TDR-measured ionic solute status, which applies to the same sample volume as the water content measurement, has been used successfully on soil column, field plot and whole field scales for in situ determination of solute transport parameters, such as pore water velocity and dispersivity. TDR-measurement of air-filled porosity in space and time has given new insights into the mechanisms controlling aeration and gaseous exchange in the crop root zone. The combined water content - solute mass measurement capability of TDR has made this technique a very powerful tool for characterizing solute leaching characteristics, as well as for evaluating solute transport theories and solute transport models. The portability of TDR instrumentation coupled with the simplicity and flexibility of TDR soil probes has allowed the separation of water and solute content measurement error from soil variability, resulting in the capability for determining the mechanisms behind the spatial and temporal variability in field-based soil water content distributions and solute leaching patterns. The usefulness and power of the TDR technique for characterizing mass and energy in soil is increasing rapidly through continuing improvements in operating range, probe design, multiplexing and automated data collection.","Energy; Mass; Root zone; Soil aeration; Solute leaching; TDR; Water content","energy budget; mass balance; solute transport; TDR",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032474538

Engineering Dept., Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States; Hines, R.E., MFS/York, Grand Island, NE, United States","Paddy or rough, unmilled rice is difficult to dry with high-temperature air because of the susceptibility of rice kernels to fissure. A new in-bin high-temperature drying system has been developed specifically for medium-capacity paddy depots in China. The system consists of a series of three drying bins and two storage bins. Each drying bin contains a top-bin dryer and an in-bin-counterflow dryer. Thus, the paddy is dried in six stages, with tempering after each high-temperature drying stage. The throughput of the system is 12 tonnes of wet rice per hour in reducing the moisture content from 24% to 13%. The system is operating near Shanghai, China. The world production of paddy has been relatively stable - i.e., between 400 and 430 million metric tons (MMT) annually (USDA, 1993); the largest producer is China with 180-185 MMT per year followed by India with 105-110 MMT. Although Thailand and the U.S.A. are relatively small producers with 17-20 MMT and 6-7 MMT of paddy, respectively, they are the largest rice-exporting countries with 1992 exports of 4.7 MMT and 2.4 MMT on a milled rice basis. China's rice export is increasing and is expected to reach 1.0 MMT (milled) soon. Due to the decrease in per capita rice consumption, China at present is storing about 25 MMT of rice, or roughly 20 percent of the annual domestic consumption. The bulk of the rice stored in China is of relatively low quality, and is exported as low-quality rice to Africa at low prices. High-quality rice is sold at a premium, mostly in the domestic market. The main difference between high-quality and low-quality rice is the difference in the percentage of brokens (in general, in world trade high-quality rice is considered to have less than 10% brokens, low-quality rice more than 20%). The price-differential on the world market between low-quality and high-quality rice is about $100 per tonne. Thus, it is essential for the competitive position of the Chinese rice industry that the general quality of the rice crop be upgraded from low-/intermediate-quality to high-quality. Improvement of the rice drying and storage facilities will accomplish this task. Along with the color and cooking qualities, the head yield is the major quality characteristic of milled rice which is defined as the percentage (by weight) of whole kernels in a lot milled from rough rice. In a well-designed rice drying system the decrease in head yield should be limited to 3-4 percentage points (Brooker et al., 1992). Paddy is usually harvested in China at an average moisture content between 20% and 26%, wet basis, depending on the type and variety of paddy and location where the crop is grown. Rapid drying after harvest is essential in preventing the wet rice from discoloring and deteriorating. Proper drying is required to limit the percentage of broken kernels after milling. In Southeast Asia and China much of the paddy produced is sun-dried, a labor-intensive practice of spreading the moist rice kernels in a thin layer 3-5 cm thick on hard soil or concrete floor, and exposing them to the energy of the sun. Intermittent stirring of the rice layer increases the drying rate and the uniformity of the layer-drying process. Frequently the rice-kernel temperatures rise to 60-70°C, resulting in fissuring (cracking) of the kernels (Suhargo, 1993). Milled rice produced from sun-dried paddy, therefore, has a low head yield. Bin-drying of paddy is practiced in many rice-producing areas. The paddy can be dried in steel bins with full perforated floors or in flat storage structures in which appropriate air-distribution systems are placed. Drying can be accomplished with natural air at initial paddy moistures as high as 23-24% if the relative humidity of the ambient conditions is sufficiently low. In the humid tropics the practice is limited to rice in the 17-20% moisture content range (Bowrey and Driscoll, 1986). The use of high temperatures in conventional in-bin rice drying systems is restricted because of the destructive effect of overdrying on rice quality. This paper describes the design of a new concept of in-bin paddy drying which allows the use of moderately-high air temperatures. The system consists of a combination of top-bin and in-bin counterflow dryers arranged in series.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346302939

The intensity of the residual birefringence increased almost linearly with the increase of extension ratio. The deformation recovery at the reheating of the thermoformed sheets indicated that molecular rearrangement induced by the uniaxial stretching in the rubbery state was accompanied by little storage of internal strain energy and thus of highly entropic elongation of polymer chains. As expected from these results, specimens cut from the thermoformed sheet in its transverse direction were less ductile than those from an unstretched sheet. Yet, specimens cut in the longitudinal direction were much more ductile in comparison with the unstretched sheet despite the development of tensile stress during the rapid cooling process in the thermoforming. Data of mechanical work consumed in the longitudinal and transverse specimens during their tensile test enabled us to propose a recommendable range of residual strain remaining in the thermoformed PMMA sheet with respect to their tensile ductility.","Birefringence; Chain orientation; Deformation recovery at reheating; Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA); Tensile ductility; Uniaxial thermoforming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039622466

A conductance (β) is conventionally defined as the ratio of the power imparted to a dynamic system by an external drive to the stored energy that this input power generates. The conductance (β) is related to the loss factor (η) by the frequency (ω); β= (ωη). In light of this definition, it is shown that all three loss factors are identical for an isolated master HO at resonance. Differences arise among these loss factors when the master HO is coupled to satellite harmonic oscillators (HO's). The first two loss factors retain their definitive format in the sense that the stored energy is reckoned only in the master HO; the energy stored in the coupled satellite HO's and in the couplings is discounted. The effective loss factor, on the other hand, is defined by accounting for the total stored energy that the external drive applied to the master HO generates in the complex. The complex here is composed of the master HO, the satellite HO's, and the in situ couplings. In those situations in which the portion of the total energy stored in the satellite HO's and in the couplings substantially exceeds the stored energy in the master HO, the I-loss factor and the U-loss factor may substantially exaggerate the true loss factor of the coupled master HO. Situations of this type are illustrated by data obtained in computational experiments, and it is argued that the true loss factor of the master HO in the complex as a whole is the effective loss factor.In this study, an attempt is made to define the three loss factors for a master harmonic oscillator (HO). The factors being considered include the I-loss factor, the U-loss factor, and the effective loss factor. It is shown that all three loss factors are identical for an isolated master HO at resonance.

We compared two different solutions, the University of Wisconsin (UW) solution (intracellular-like) and the modified Kawakami (mK) solution (extracellular-like), for initial flush of coronary vascular beds before simple storage and following coronary perfusion. Methods. After a right thoracotomy in the 4th intercostal space, the donor heart was isolated by ligating the azygos vein and venae cavae, and cross-clamping the aorta. Cardiac arrest was then obtained with a cold GIK solution. Following initial flush of coronary vascular beds, the donor heart was resected, stored utilizing a combination of simple immersion and coronary perfusion, and then transplanted. A total of 48 mongrel dogs was divided into three groups each using different solutions for the initial flush of coronary vascular beds and for coronary perfusion. In group I (n = 10) the UW solution was used for both initial flush and coronary perfusion. In group II (n = 7) the mK solution was used for both initial flush and coronary perfusion, and in group III (n = 7) the UW solution was used for initial flush and the mK solution for coronary perfusion. Intracellular high-energy phosphate was surveyed by 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results. After 12-hour simple immersion and 1-hour coronary perfusion, phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher in group III than in groups I and II. The high-energy phosphate levels of the graft tissue were better in groups I and III than in group II. Orthotopic transplantation was then performed using 10 preserved grafts in group I and seven preserved grafts of group III. After transplantation, left ventricular (LV) pressure of group I animals recovered to 82.3% and group III recovered to 95.8% of the control values. LV dp/dt of group I and III animals recovered to 76.5% and 96.7% of the control values, respectively. Conclusions. The UW solution, which is acceptable for both initial flush and simple storage, is not suitable for continuous coronary perfusion even for a short period due to its high viscosity. A combination of the UW solution both for initial flush and the following cold simple immersion and the mK solution for continuous coronary perfusion is appropriate for long-term preservation of the canine heart.","Cardioplegic solutions; Coronary vessels; Dogs; Heart transplantation; Organ preservation","adenosine triphosphate; cardioplegic agent; creatine phosphate; kawakami solution; unclassified drug; university of wisconsin solution; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; azygos vein; cava vein; comparative study; controlled study; coronary artery blood flow; coronary blood vessel; dog; flushing; heart left ventricle pressure; heart transplantation; high energy phosphate; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; organ preservation; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; thoracotomy; vein ligation; viscosity; Adenosine; Allopurinol; Animals; Cardioplegic Solutions; Dogs; Glutathione; Heart; Insulin; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Myocardial Reperfusion; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Phosphates; Phosphocreatine; Raffinose; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031848521

The electrodynamic model describes dart leaders and return strokes as electromagnetic waves that are guided along conducting lightning channels. According to the model, electrostatic energy is delivered to the channel by a leader, where it is stored around the outside of the channel; subsequently, the return stokes dissipates this locally stored energy. In this report this lightning-energy-flow scenario is developed further. Then the energy dissipated per unit length in lightning channels is calculated, where this quantity is now related to the linear charge density on the channel, not to the cloud-to-ground electrostatic potential difference. Energy conservation is then used to calculate the radii of lightning channels: their initial radii at the onset of return strokes and their final radii after the channels have pressure expanded. Finally, the risetimes for channel heating during return stokes are calculated by defining an energy-storage radius around the channel and by estimating the radial velocity of energy flow toward the channel during a return stroke. In three appendices, values for the linear charge densities on lightning channels are calculated, estimates of the total length of branch channels are obtained, and values for the cloud-to-ground electrostatic potential difference are estimated.",,"electrodynamic model; energy dissipation; lightning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032571957

The detector consists of a low-pressure, two-step avalanche chamber, two layers of silicon strip detectors of 100 and 475 μm thickness and a scintillator. The signals from the separate detector elements are processed by custom-made analog electronics and dedicated VME-based digitizer modules.

The patients were 20±2-yr-old (SD) with 63±8% total body surface area burned. They were studied in a randomized order (a) in the fed state on the seventh day of a control period (C) of continuous high- carbohydrate enteral feeding alone, and (b) on the seventh day of enteral feeding plus exogenous insulin (200 pmol/h = 28 U/h) with extra glucose given as needed to avoid hypoglycemia (I+G). Despite a glucose delivery rate ~ 100% in excess of energy requirements, the following lipid parameters were unchanged: (a) total hepatic VLDL triglyceride (TG) secretion rate (0.165±0.138 [C] vs. 0.154±0.138 mmol/kg · d-1 [I+G]), (b) plasma TG concentration (1.58±0.66 [C] vs. 1.36±0.41 mmol/liter [I+G]), and (c) plasma VLDL TG concentration (0.68±0.79 [C] vs. 0.67± 0.63 mmol/liter [I+G]). Instead, the high-carbohydrate delivery in conjunction with insulin therapy increased the proportion of de novo-synthesized palmitate in VLDL TG from 13±5% (C) to 34±14% (I+G), with a corresponding decreased amount of palmitate from lipolysis. In association with the doubling of the secretion rate of de novo-synthesized fatty acid (FA) in VLDL TG during insulin therapy (P &gt; 0.5), the relative amount of palmitate and stearate increased from 35±5 to 44±8% and 4±1 to 7±2%, respectively, in VLDL TG, while the relative concentration of oleate and linoleate decreased from 43±5 to 37±6% and 8±4% to 2±2%, respectively. A 15-fold increase in plasma insulin concentration did not change the rate of release of FA into plasma (8.22±2.86 [C] vs. 8.72±6.68 mmol/kg·d-1 [I+G]. The peripheral release of FA represents a far greater potential for hepatic lipid accumulation in burn patients than the endogenous hepatic fat synthesis, even during excessive carbohydrate intake in conjunction with insulin therapy.","Carbohydrate; Fat synthesis; Lipogenesis; Lipolysis; Liver","carbohydrate; fatty acid; glucagon; glucose; isophane insulin; lactic acid; linoleic acid; lipid; oleic acid; palmitic acid; protein; stearic acid; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein; adolescent; adult; article; body weight; burn; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; crossover procedure; fatty acid synthesis; female; glucagon blood level; human; insulin blood level; insulin treatment; intravenous drug administration; lactate blood level; lipid blood level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; lipoprotein blood level; male; priority journal; protein metabolism; randomized controlled trial; triacylglycerol blood level",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032524027

A single dose of TCDD (100 μg/kg) to male C57BL mice resulted in a time-and dose-dependent decrease in the level of C/EBPα mRNA in adipose tissue and liver, and a reciprocal increase in C/EBPβ mRNA. Gel shift analysis using hepatic nuclear extracts from control and TCDD-treated mice and an oligonucleotide containing a C/EBP recognition element revealed a time-dependent change in DNA-protein complexes formed. Bands corresponding to C/EBPα, as determined by supershift analysis, diminished in TCDD-treated animals over a 7-day time period, whereas two new bands corresponding to C/EBPβ, not present in control extracts, were increased significantly in treated samples. TCDD induced C/EBPβ mRNA in wild-type mouse hepatoma cells, but not in aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) nuclear translocator-deficient hepatoma cells. Induction in wild-type hepatoma cells was antagonized effectively by a molar excess of α-naphthoflavone. These results showed that TCDD caused rapid, reciprocal changes in C/EBPα and C/EBPβ mRNAs and DNA binding in the adipose and liver of male C57BL mice and induced C/EBPβ in hepatoma cells in an AhR-dependent manner. C/EBPs play vital roles in the coordination of energy homeostasis, and their alteration by TCDD may provide insight into the mechanism by which TCDD perturbs energy storage and utilization in vivo.","Ah receptor; C/EBPα; C/EBPβ; DNA-binding proteins; TCDD","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; alpha naphthoflavone; aromatic hydrocarbon; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; caat enhancer binding protein alpha; caat enhancer binding protein beta; transcription factor; unclassified drug; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; autacoid; CCAAT enhancer binding protein; DNA; DNA binding protein; messenger RNA; nuclear protein; adipose tissue; animal cell; article; chronotherapy; dna binding; dna protein complex; dose response; energy balance; energy metabolism; gene expression; hepatoma cell; liver; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; adipose tissue; animal; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; cell culture; drug antagonism; drug effect; genetics; liver; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; protein binding; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Base Sequence; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; DNA; DNA-Binding Proteins; Inflammation Mediators; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nuclear Proteins; Protein Binding; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; RNA, Messenger; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin; Tumor Cells, Cultured",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032523221

The Peng-Robinson EOS provides a reasonable description of the vapor-liquid equilibrium in HHPCO2 storage tanks at room temperature. Variations in the content of helium in HHPCO2 within the relevant range (between 0 and 5 mol %) are predicted to produce significant changes in the density and solubility parameter of HHPCO2, in the solubility of naphthalene in HHPCO2, and in the chromatographic retention of naphthalene if HHPCO2 serves as the mobile-phase fluid.

The last term, unaccounted for in previous studies of surface-air exchanges, becomes important over tall vegetation and at times when the vertical gradient of the atmospheric constituent (̄C(r) - (1/Z(r)) ∫(Zr)/0 ̄cdz) is large, as is the case with CO2 in forests at night. Experimental evidence is presented to support the postulation that the mass flow component is in large part responsible for the large run-to-run variations in eddy fluxes, the lack of energy balance closure and the apparent low eddy fluxes at night under stable stratifications. Three mechanisms causing the non-zero mean vertical velocity are discussed. Of these, drainage flow on undulating terrain is the most important one for long-term flux observations because only a small terrain slope is needed to trigger its occurrence. It is suggested from the data obtained at a boreal deciduous forest that without proper account of the mass flow component, the assessment of annual uptake of CO2 could be biased significantly towards higher values. It is argued that quantifying the mass flow component is a major challenge facing the micrometeorological community.","CO2; Drainage; Forest; Net ecosystem exchange","atmosphere/vegetation interaction; micrometeorology; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031812295

In this model, fluid and rock cells interact through locally defined rules, including a steady increase of pressure, a threshold dynamics, a fluid redistribution algorithm, and an energy dissipation process. Comparison of the model results and observations for more than 40 simulations provides information on the mechanics of the PF volcano and basaltic volcanoes in general. First, we demonstrate that the multiple lenses magma storage model for the summit reservoir of basaltic volcanoes is consistent with the PF 1920-1992 eruptive pattern, proposing an alternative to the macrochamber model. Second, we show that the great number of interactions between magma storage lenses in a critical state may work as a nonlinear filter, modifying a possible uniform increase of pressure in the input, induced by deep magma supply and gas exsolution during crystallization, into a nonlinear fluid flow emergence in time and size, both unpredictable and organized in nonrandom scaling statistics. The fluid-rock cellular automaton allows us to explore scales ranging from global Earth mantle to porous rock matrix, thus rationalizing the power law volume distribution of total eruptions on the Earth surface [Mc Clelland et al., 1989] and the hierarchical organization that is reported for many types of fluid-induced seismicity [Grasso, 1993; Miller et al., 1996], respectively.",,"fluid circulation; seismicity; volcanism; Piton de la Fournaise Volcano; Reunion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032503212

In the former case, the fibre is spun at approximately 1 cm s-1; in the latter case the rate is an order of magnitude faster. The different spinning rates do not result in identical microstructures, implying that the mechanical properties should not be identical either. However, neither conventional tensile testing, nor the characterisation of storage modulus with DMA, yields reproducible data that could be used to correlate stiffness to the spinning rate. Any correlation is masked by the consequences of MAS having a cross-section that is non-circular, difficult to measure and highly variable along the fibre length. Also, DSC shows that fibres contain bound moisture even after drying in a desiccator; fibre thickness affects the ability of samples to lose this moisture and gain stiffness on heating in the DMA. Thermal expansion data obtained with the DMA are reproducible below the MAS glass transition (approximately 160°C): these results do not depend on the accurate measurement of the sample cross section, they are insensitive to the moisture content of samples and they are not affected significantly by energy loss arising from friction between individual fibres in the specimens tested. The thermal expansion data suggest that the highest intrinsic stiffness of MAS is realised at spinning rates used in web construction. When the spider must elude a predator, it spins MAS that is more compliant.","Differential scanning calorimetry; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Silk; Spider; Thermal expansion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002510237

Junctional tachycardia (JT) is frequently noted during application of radiofrequency (RF) energy and is thought to be a useful marker of successful slow pathway ablation. Fast JT may be a marker of increasing risk of AV block during the procedure. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 42 patients (10 male, 32 female, mean age 42.6 years) undergoing slow pathway (SP) modification for AVNRT was performed. All anti-arrhythmic agents had been stopped at least 5 half lives prior to the procedure. Intra-cardiac recordings were analysed after digital storage. During RF application, the development of JT was noted and the number of beats, maximum, minimum and mean cycle length recorded. Subsequent development of heart block was recorded together with presence of persistent slow pathway conduction and later recurrence of AVNRT. Results: During RF application 41/42 patients developed JT. Five patients had evidence of transient AV block (first degree block: 3 patients, third degree: 2 patients). In each case conduction was normal at 24 hours. The minimum cycle length of JT was <300ms in 4/5 of these patients and mean cycle length 399ms. Three additional patients had evidence of persistent slow pathway conduction without AV block at the end of the procedure. The minimum cycle length in these 3 patients was <420ms, mean 370ms. The mean number of beats of continuous JT in the above 8 patients was 12.0 ± 7.8. There was no recurrence of AVNRT in these eight patients over 7.0 ± 4.8 months. Thirty-three of the 34 remaining patients developed slow JT with RF application with a minimum cycle length >300ms, mean cycle length 531ms, and mean number of beats of continuous JT 12.0 ± 7.8. In these patients, there was no evidence of persistent slow pathway conduction or AV block. Recurrence of AVNRT was seen in one patient with fast JT minimum cycle length <300 ms, mean CL 345ms. There was no evidence of slow pathway conduction at the end of the procedure in this individual. Conclusion: Fast JT with a minimum cycle length <300 ms during slow pathway modification is a predictor of adverse prognosis and suggests proximity to the compact node. RF energy should be terminated immediately to prevent development of AV block.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751403173

These include storage rings with lower electron-beam emittance than present third-generation rings and free-electron lasers (FELs). It now appears that the highest performance sources will be based on linacs rather than storage rings. This is because emittance originates differently and scales differently with electron energy for rings and linacs, so that the lowest electron-beam emittance can be achieved in high-energy linacs equipped with high-brightness electron sources. Such electron beams can be used to provide X-ray beams with very high brightness and coherence in sub-picosecond pulses in a single pass through a small-gap short-period undulator by spontaneous emission, and with even higher beam brightness and coherence by stimulated coherent emission in an FEL.

An 800 lines mm-1 laminar grating produced by aspheric-wavefront holographic recording optics, as well as a mechanically ruled blazed one, were tested. A resolving power of more than 4500 was achieved at 400 eV with either grating, and ∼1010 photons s-1 are available at a resolving power of 2000. High photon flux enables low-concentration samples, such as surface adsorbates, to be studied. A simple scanning mechanism for a wide energy range is quite useful for EXAFS measurements on light elements such as C, N and O.","EXAFS on light elements; Grazing-incidence monochromators; Holographic gratings; Soft X-rays; Varied line spacing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032388338

By longitudinal displacement of the side magnet arrays, the phase between the vertical and horizontal magnetic fields, and therefore the polarization (right-or left-circular, elliptical, linear) can be selected. The helical/linear undulator gives almost perfect circular polarization at 4-40 eV in the helical configuration without changing the phase of the magnet arrays, as well as linearly polarized light at 3-300 eV in the linear configuration.","Compact rings; Helical undulators; Helical/linear switchable undulators; HiSOR; Insertion devices; Linear undulators",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032382113

New electron impact excitation cross sections for NO were combined with a measured IBC II auroral secondary electron energy distribution and the electronic-vibrational populations were determined for conditions of statistical equilibrium. This model predicts an extended vibrational distribution in the NO ground electronic state produced by radiative cascade from the many higher lying doublet excited electronic states. In addition to energy storage in the vibrational population of the ground electronic state, both the a 4Π and L′ 2Φ excited electronic states are predicted to have relatively high number densities in aurora.

Technologies for the desalination of seawater have considerably matured in the last decade. However, the energy required for the desalination is usually expensive in arid areas where fresh water is required. Renewable energy provides a clean, free, and low-maintenance source of energy for desalination, limited only by their initial cost, and the variability of the available energy. In this paper the potential use of solar energy for the desalination of seawater in the Middle East is evaluated Multi-Stage Flash (MSF) desalination requires large amounts of energy, while Reverse Osmosis (RO) desalination is more energy efficient. Solar distillation is a very simple and direct method that may be used, requiring only large flat areas of land, having no running energy costs and being very suitable for remote areas. Photovoltaics is another promising renewable energy source for seawater desalination in the Middle East. It is best suited for the RO and Electrodialysis (ED) methods. The desalination plant doesn't need to run continuously, and therefore no storage batteries are required. Diesel and/or natural gas may be used as a backup energy.",,"Efficiency; Electrodialysis; Evaluation; Photovoltaic cells; Reverse osmosis; Seawater; Solar energy; Desalination; desalination plant; photovoltaic system; reverse osmosis; solar power; water supply; Middle East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032073582

These memories are encoded as modality-specific associable representations. Accordingly, associable representations are confined to cytoarchitectonic modules of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. The proposed sequence of events leading to long-term storage in cholinoceptive dendrites begins with changes in neuronal activity, then in neurotrophin release, followed by enhanced acetylcholine release, muscarinic response, calcium influx, degradation of microtubule-associated protein-2, and finally new dendrite structure. Hypothetically, each associable representation consists of altered dendrite segments from approximately 5000- 15000 cholinoceptive cells contained within one or a few module(s). Simultaneous restructuring during consolidation of long-term memory is hypothesized to result in a similar infrastructure among dendrite sets, facilitating co-activation of those dendrite sets by neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, and conceivably enabling high energy interactions between those dendrites by phenomena such as quantum optical coherence. Based on the specific architecture proposed, it is estimated that the human telencephalon contains enough dendrites to encode 50 million associable representations in a lifetime, or put another way, to encode one new associable representation each minute. The implications that this proposal has regarding treatments for Alzheimer's disease are also discussed.",,"Alzheimer disease; amygdaloid nucleus; hippocampus; human; information processing; mammal; memory consolidation; priority journal; review",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031778575

The investigated distillation units showed constant performance over several years without extensive maintenance. However the efforts towards further efficiency improvement by economic means pointed out the need of supplementing the system with a thermal storage tank. The distillation unit being the most expensive part of a desalination system has to be run 24 hours a day in order to be economic. A cost estimation for storage implementation yields the result, that cost reduction for the produced water by more than a half is possible. In April 1997 a desalination system with 24 hour thermal storage was built up in Sfax/Tunisia. The results of a short term measuring campaign at this site are presented here.

The report focuses on the health effects of low cadmium doses and the identification of high-risk groups. The diet is the main source of cadmium exposure in the Swedish nonsmoking general population. The average daily dietary intake is about 15 μg/day, but there are great individual variations due to differences in energy intake and dietary habits. It has been shown that a high fiber diet and a diet rich in shellfish increase the dietary cadmium intake substantially. Cadmium concentrations in agricultural soil and wheat have increased continuously during the last century. At present, soil cadmium concentrations increase by about 0.2% per year. Cadmium accumulates in the kidneys. Human kidney concentrations of cadmium have increased several fold during the last century. Cadmium in pig kidney has been shown to have increased by about 2% per year from 1984-1992. There is no tendency towards decreasing cadmium exposure among the general nonsmoking population. The absorption of cadmium in the lungs is 10-50%, while the absorption in the gastrointestinal tract is only a few percent. Smokers have about 4-5 times higher blood cadmium concentrations (about 1.5 μg/l), and twice as high kidney cortex cadmium concentrations (about 20-30 μg/g wet weight) as nonsmokers. Similarly, the blood cadmium concentrations are substantially elevated in persons with low body iron stores, indicating increased gastrointestinal absorption. About 10-40% of Swedish women of child-bearing age are reported to have empty iron stores (S-ferritin < 12 μg/l). In general, women have higher concentrations of cadmium in blood, urine, and kidney than men. The population groups at highest risk are probably smokers, women with low body iron stores, and people habitually eating a diet rich in cadmium. According to current knowledge, renal tubular damage is probably the critical health effect of cadmium exposure, both in the general population and in occupationally exposed workers. Tubular damage may develop at much lower levels than previously estimated, as shown in this report. Data from several recent reports from different countries indicate that an average urinary cadmium excretion of 2.5 μg/g creatinine is related to an excess prevalence of renal tubular damage of 4%. An average urinary excretion of 2.5 μg/g creatinine corresponds to an average concentration of cadmium in renal cortex of 50 μg/g, which would be the result of long-term (decades) intake of 50 μg per day. When the critical concentrations for adverse effects due to cadmium accumulation are being evaluated, it is crucial to consider both the individual variation in kidney cadmium concentrations and the variations in sensitivity within the general population. Even if the population average kidney concentration is relatively low for the general population, a certain proportion will have values exceeding the concentration where renal tubular damage can occur. It can be estimated that, at the present average daily intake of cadmium in Sweden, about 1% of women with low body iron stores and smokers may experience adverse renal effects related to cadmium. If the average daily intake of cadmium would increase to 30 μg/day, about 1% of the entire population would have cadmium-induced tubular damage. In risk groups, for example, women with low iron stores, the percentage would be higher, up to 5%. Both human and animal studies indicate that skeletal damage (osteoporosis) may be a critical effect of cadmium exposure. We conclude, however, that the present evidence is not sufficient to permit such a conclusion for humans. We would like to stress, however, that osteoporosis is a very important public health problem worldwide, but especially in the Scandinavian countries. Studies assessing the potential role of cadmium as a risk factor for osteoporosis are already in progress. The results from these studies may lead to a reevaluation of the critical effects of cadmium exposure. It should also be noted that women have a much greater risk of developing osteoporosis. Since women are also at greater risk of achieving a high cadmium dose, they may be particularly at risk for cadmium-induced osteoporosis.",,"cadmium; iron; cadmium; health risk; literature review; medical geography; pollution exposure; risk assessment; bioaccumulation; caloric intake; cigarette smoking; dietary intake; health hazard; high fiber diet; human; intestine absorption; iron storage; japan; kidney; kidney tubule disorder; lung; osteoporosis; priority journal; review; risk assessment; risk factor; sex difference; shellfish; soil pollution; sweden; urinary excretion; Animals; Bone Diseases; Cadmium; Diet; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Environmental Exposure; Female; Food Contamination; Humans; Kidney Diseases; Male; Neoplasms; Prognosis; Reproduction; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sweden; Sweden",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031902862

In this paper, based on the primary parameters of Hefei Storage Ring (NSRL) FEL system, firstly we made the simulation to the electron beam energy modulation process in an optical klystron, the simulation parameters include: γ = 1000, the relativistic factor of the electron beam; the wavelength and power of the injected external laser are, λs = 0.353 μm and 100 MW; the period number and wavelength of the undulators are Nu = 20, and λu = 7.2 cm (we have the same structure for the modulator and radiator); and the normalized amplitude of the magnetic field is K = 4.2. An effective energy modulation can be achieved when the rms energy spread for the electron beam is less than 10-4, i.e., σγ/γ ≤ 10-4. Then density modulation for the energy-modulated electron beam in the dispersive section is also simulated. Under the above-mentioned conditions when the dispersive parameter Nd ≅ 76, a good density modulation results can be obtained.

The emitted electrons have been accelerated in a 1.3 GHz RF linear accelerator operating at an energy of 6 MeV. The quantum efficiency of the Cs-K-Te cathodes at 259 nm decreases exponentially with operation time, but recovers partially during storage in UHV between successive operating sessions. These two effects tend to compensate for long times, so that saturation of the quantum efficiency value at about 2% is reached after 20h of operation.

In the SER case, ANL's Hamamatsu C5680 streak camera was used to characterize stored electron-beam bunch lengths versus rf gap voltage and single-bunch current. Electron-beam bunch lengths were observed in a range from 50 to 300 ps (FWHM). Particle beam energies of 270 and 500 MeV in the storage ring (SR) were used with the OK-4 to generate SER from 500 nm to less than 200 nm. Sensitivity to single-bunch, single-turn SER was shown down to ∼ 4 μA beam current at λ = 450 nm. By operating in the synchroscan mode and at bunch currents less than 1 mA, beam orbit length vs. the resonator round-trip time was investigated by detecting the relative arrival time of the second pass outcoupled from the resonator at λ ≈ 200 nm. These measurements were used in support of first lasing in the UV-visible regime in November 1996. The dual-sweep streak mode was then used to monitor lasing intensity variations on the 1 and 50 ms time scales, to measure a lasing pulse length as short as ∼ 3 ps (σ) at λ = 388 nm at low beam current, and to track the orbit length detuning curve. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

For comparison, similar groups of trout were fed dry pellets with and without top-dressing with fish oil. Inclusion of lipid increased growth rate in a similar manner for both types of diets. For the herring-based diet, increased lipid resulted in increased dry matter consumption but for the dry diet, feed efficiency (dry weight growth per dry weight food consumption) was improved by channelling more nutrients to lipid deposition. If compared within a stated lipid level, fish fed the herring-based diets grew at a slower rate than fish fed the dry diets. This could have been because of high dietary water content and also due to changes in herring protein quality during the frozen storage since the protein retention efficiencies were lower for the herring diets.","Lipid enrichment; Moist diet; Protein retention efficiency; Protein-to-energy ratio; Rainbow trout",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032522271

The latter would represent genuine plasticity in the life history itself, and thus it is important to distinguish which of these two processes underlies the observed plasticity of life history traits. We investigated this issue by examining the effects of temperature and salinity variation during ontogeny on the allocation of biomass and lipid storage in male sailfin mollies, Poecilia latipinna. We raised males from four natural populations from birth to maturity in controlled laboratory conditions. Neither distinct temperatures (23 or 29°C) nor different salinity regimes (2, 12, or 20 parts per thousand) affected body mass, although males from different populations differed substantially in body mass. However, males raised at the higher temperature had a greater allocation of biomass to testis and a lower allocation to viscera mass. The amount of stored lipid was altered by temperature variation but the direction and magnitude of the effect varied substantially among males from the different populations. Salinity variation affected neither biomass allocation nor the level of lipid storage. These results indicate that mate mollies possess a flexible developmental program with respect to temperature that canalizes body size and alters the allocation of biomass among competing demands for reproductive readiness and capacity for energy storage.","Energy allocation; Life history traits; Phenotypic plasticity; Temperature; Triacylglycerol","biomass allocation; life history trait; lipid; sailfin molly; salinity; temperature; Poecilia latipinna",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031955608

Neutrons of velocity vN = 630 ms-1 require tT = 158.5 us for direct transit through the 100 mm-long silicon resonator. This time is long compared with the vibration period TP = 22.3 μs and most of the neutrons experience multiple Bragg reflections in the oscillating Doppler-strain field. Monte Carlo calculations predict that neutrons will be stored in the crystal and released with a time structure determined by the vibration period and by the energy width of the incident beam. For a continuous beam, the usual time modulation of the diffracted neutrons with twice the vibration frequency is expected. If a neutron pulse much shorter than the vibration period impinges on the crystal, the transmitted signal should be a decaying sequence of pulses separated by the vibration period. For pulses which are long compared with the vibration period, the effect of neutron storage should be manifest as a delayed staircase-like intensity variation on both pulse edges. A silicon crystal was set with the (111) lattice planes in backreflection and excited in a λ/2 resonance at 44.78 kHz. A typical deformation amplitude was u0 = 1 μm corresponding to a scattering range of ΔE = ±1.9 μeV. The response of the λ/2 resonator to a quasicontinuous beam and to neutron pulses of lengths ΔtP = 3 ms and 33 μs FWHM was measured. Experiments were performed with neutron beams of two energy widths ΔE= ±0.35 and ±1.23 μeV. In agreement with the Monte Carlo simulations, neutron storage in the silicon crystal was observed. The storage time was 250 μs for both long and short incident pulses. This time equals about 11 vibration periods of the crystal resonator and is in good agreement with the calculations for the Si 111 reflection and chosen vibration parameters. A first indication of the dependence of the time structure on the energy width of the neutron beam was seen in the experiments. The predicted pulsed structure of the transmitted signal in response to neutron pulses shorter than the vibration period could not be resolved. With a shortest incident pulse width of ΔtP = 33 μs, the condition ΔtP ≪ TP was not fulfilled. The measured transmission profile is in good agreement with the calculations for the λ/2 resonator. Compared with vibrating crystals excited into higher harmonics at the same applied strain, the λ/2 resonator has a lower reflectivity.",,"Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0542443281

In temperate and sub-tropical climates, ventilation or aeration with ambient air at night usually results in reducing the wet-bulb temperature of the intergranular air, and this has a beneficial effect on storage. However, the relative humidity of ambient air at night is usually high, and this limits its cooling capacity. This paper describes a device that reduces the humidity of ambient air almost isothermally, and which therefore enables grain to be cooled to lower temperatures than those attainable using ambient air. The grain cooling device is simple to build using readily available materials, and requires only sheet metal working skills for its fabrication. Furthermore, the energy consumption of the device is very low and it uses solar energy to regenerate beds of desiccant. A mathematical model of the device is presented which enables the heat and mass transfer processes that occur in the device to be studied in detail. The model is validated against previously published experimental results. It is indicated that when operating in a subtropical climate the cooling device is capable of reducing the wet-bulb temperature of ambient air from about 17.3°C to about 12.30°C. Under these conditions the cooling device provides typically 50 times more cooling energy than electrical energy consumed. The model demonstrates that the degree of grain cooling that is possible decreases with increasing air flow rate, but the quantity of grain that can be cooled increases. The model is used to explore the effects of aerating grain with air conditioned by the solar cooler on insect population growth, the rate of pesticide decay and seed viability.","Aeration; Cooling; Grains; Insects; Pest management; Solar energy; Storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032053118

To date, three isotypes have been identified, α, β and γ, encoded by three different genes. The α isotype is expressed at high levels in the liver where it has a role in lipid oxidation. Its expression and activity follow a diurnal rhythm that parallels the circulating levels of corticosterone in the bloodstream. The γ isotype on the other hand, is mainly expressed in adipose tissue and has a critical role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage. The function of the ubiquitously expressed isotype, PPARβ, remains to be determined. Besides fulfilling different roles in lipid metabolism, the different PPAR isotypes also have different ligand specificities. A new approach to identify ligands was developed based on the ligand-dependent interaction of PPAR with the recently characterized co- activator SRC-1. This so-called CARLA assay has allowed the identification of fatty acids and eicosanoids as PPAR ligands. Although the evidence clearly links PPAR isotypes to distinct functions, the molecular basis for this isotype-specificity is still unclear. All three isotypes are able to bind the same consensus response element, formed by a direct repeat of two AGGTCA hexamers separated by one base, though with different affinities. We recently demonstrated that besides the core DR-1 element, the 5' flanking sequence should be included in the definition of a PPRE. Interestingly, the presence of this flanking sequence is of particular importance in the context of PPARα binding. Moreover, it reflects the polarity of the PPAR-RXR heterodimer on DNA, with PPAR binding to the 5' half-site and RXR binding to the 3' half-site. This unusual polarity may confer unique properties to the bound heterodimer with respect to ligand binding and interaction with co- activators and corepressors.",,"cell nucleus receptor; fatty acid; icosanoid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; steroid receptor; thyroid hormone receptor; transcription factor; adipocyte; conference paper; diet; fatty acid oxidation; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; ligand binding; lipid storage; nonhuman; peroxisome; protein expression; protein family; protein localization; protein polymorphism; xenopus laevis; Cell Communication; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Homeostasis; Hormones; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Ligands; Liver; Models, Biological; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Transcription Factors; Xenopus laevis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032052816

Described here are characteristics of annual hydrographs and individual storm hydrographs of four basins draining areas of 0.026 km2, 2.2 km2, 142 km2, and 8140 km2; an assessment of the influence that permafrost has on those characteristics; and comparisons to rivers in regions without permafrost. Snowmelt runoff dominated the annual runoff in each basin. A typical storm hydrograph in the Kuparuk River basin had a fast initial response time, long time lags between the hyetograph and hydrograph centroids, an extended recession, and a high runoff/precipitation ratio due to the diminished storage caused by permafrost. The seemingly contradictory results of fast response times and extended recessions can be explained by the presence of a large saturated area occupied by hillslope water tracks. This saturated area provides a partial-source area for fast runoff generation that bypasses the storage capacity of organic soils and tundra vegetation.","Alaska; Arctic; Permafrost; Runoff; Streamflow","Alaska; Arctic; Monitoring; Permafrost; Rivers; Runoff; Watersheds; Hydrology; Arctic environment; streamflow hydrology; USA, Alaska, Kuparuk River Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032051664

This overall approach (called the More Electric Aircraft, MEA) has been analytically determined to provide dramatic improvements in reliability, maintainability, supportability and operations/support cost as well as enhancements in aircraft weight, volume, and battle-damage reconfigurability. Historically, the concept of an electrically-based aircraft had been considered by military aircraft designers since World War II, but a lack of electrical power generation capability and the volume of required power conditioning equipment rendered this approach unfeasible. Advances in switched reluctance configuration electric machines and solid state power electronics have now enabled demonstration of an MEA. A time- and technology availability-phased research and development program has been structured to demonstrate the required electrical component and subsystems performance to allow equivalent or improved aircraft performance over the use of hydraulic power. Generation I of the MEA initiative, scheduled for completion in 1998, officially established electrical capabilities toward the elimination of aircraft hydraulics. Generation II of the initiative, with technology availability in 2005, projects' such dramatic improvements in electrical power capability so as to provide large quantities (hundreds of kilowatts) of excess onboard electrical power for a variety of revolutionary military functions. This paper provides: 1) a brief historical treatment of technology milestones achieved which enabled the MEA approach; 2) a status of United States Air Force and Department of Defense research and development programs in electrical power generation, distribution, energy storage, systems integration and flight testing; 3) a description of some of the Air Force's planned demonstration activities in aircraft electrical power subsystems; and 4) the dual use nature of many of these technologies enabling a variety of electric and hybrid electrically-propelled military weapon systems and commercial vehicles.",,"Aircraft parts and equipment; Electric equipment; Reliability; Technology; More Electric Aircraft; Aircraft",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032046531

The experimentally determined initial increase in the storage modulus per unit time, ΔG′/Δt, for various scleraldehyde concentrations, CSc, degree of aldehyde substitution of scleraldehyde, DAld, and chitosan concentrations, CChi, revealed the existence of a lower critical concentration for gelation for both the two polysaccharides, CSc,0 and CChi,0. The observed power law coefficients m and n, ΔG′/Δt ~ (DAld CSc)m CnChi, were both significantly larger than one in the employed relative concentrations ranges CSc/CSc,0 ∈ (1-20) and CChi/CChi,0 ∈(1-10), which was accounted for by the total wastage reactions and network statistics. The rate of gel formation showed a maximum near pH 7 due to a delicate balance among several competing effects: (1) The free-amine concentration of the chitosan increases in the pH range 4.5-6.5 (pKa of the amino group), (2) the Schiff-base junction formation is acid catalyzed, and (3) the solubility of chitosan decreases when the pH exceeds 7. The increased aggregation resulting from increasing the pH from 7 to 7.6 yielded an increasing fraction of reactive groups involved in wastage reactions, yielding an increase both in CChi,0 and the power law coefficient n from 1.7 to 2.6. The temperature dependence of ΔG′/Δt could be accounted for by incorporating an apparent activation energy Ea = 43 kJ mol-1. The temperature dependence of G′ of the fully cured scleraldehyde-chitosan co-gels was found to give rise to a shift from ΔG′/ΔT &gt; o Pa/min to ΔG′/ΔT &lt; 0 Pa/min, when the crosslink density increased. This suggests a change from entropy dominated elasticity at low crosslink density, to an enthalpy dominated elasticity when this density increases, possibly due to decreasing length of the elastically active chains. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These characteristics of purified AnxVI were used to identify and characterize preliminary nucleotide-binding domain of the protein. AnxVI labelled with 8-azido-ATP was subjected to limited proteolysis and the proteolytic fragments of AnxVI that retained the covalently-bound nucleotide were separated by means of gel electrophoresis and visualized by exposure of the gel to a phosphor storage screen. It was found that the AnxVI proteolytic fragments of M(r) 34-36.000 and smaller retained the nucleotide. In a reciprocal experiment, AnxVI was digested with proteolytic enzymes and in an ATP eluate from an ATP-agarose column protein fragments of similar M(r) to these labelled with 8-azido-ATP were identified. The extent of AnxVI labelling with 8-azido-ATP and the distribution of proteolytic fragments varied upon calcium concentration. These results lead to the conclusion that there is a nucleotide-binding domain within the AnxVI molecule that is functionally similar to the nucleotide-binding domains of other nucleotide-binding proteins. The nucleotide-binding domain is located close to the tryptophan residue 343 of AnxVI and in close vicinity to the Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding sites of the protein. This is confirmed by the observation that the tryptophan fluorescence intensity of AnxVI decreases in the presence of a fluorescence analog of ATP in a calcium-dependent manner, due to the quenching properties of the nucleotide and/or fluorescence energy transfer from AnxVI tryptophan to fluorophore. Both processes were modulated by the presence of phospholipid molecules.","2'-(or 3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine triphosphate; 8-azido-ATP; Annexin VI; ATP; ATP-agarose; Tryptophan fluorescence","adenosine triphosphate; agarose; binding protein; calphobindin ii; liver protein; nucleotide binding protein; phospholipid binding protein; tryptophan; affinity chromatography; article; binding site; controlled study; energy transfer; fluorescence analysis; gel electrophoresis; isotope labeling; nonhuman; photoaffinity labeling; protein analysis; protein degradation; protein domain; swine; Adenosine Triphosphate; Affinity Labels; Animals; Annexin A6; Azides; Calcium; Chromatography, Affinity; Endopeptidases; Fluorescent Dyes; Liver; Peptide Fragments; Sepharose; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Swine; Suidae; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031929670

While many forms of herbaceous and woody energy crops will likely contribute to future biofuels systems, The Department of Energy's Bioenegy Feedstock Development Program (BFDP), has chosen to focus its primary herbaceous crops research emphasis on a perennial grass species, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). The choice of switchgrass as a model bioenergy species was based on its high yields, high nutrient use efficiency and wide geographic distribution. Another important consideration was its positive environmental attributes. The latter include its positive effects on soil quality and stability, its cover value for wildlife, and relatively low inputs of energy, water and agrochemicals required per unit of energy produced. A comparison of the energy budgets for corn, which is the primary current source of bioethanol, and switchgrass reveals that the efficiency of energy production for a perennial grass system can exceed that for an energy intensive annual row crop by as much as 15 times. In addition potential reductions in CO2 emissions, tied to the energetic efficiency of producing transportation fuels and replacing non-renewable petrochemical fuels with ethanol derived from grasses are very promising. Calculated carbon sequestration rates may exceed those of annual crops by as much as 20-30 times, due in part to carbon storage in the soil. These differences have major implications for both the rate and efficiency with which fossil energy sources can be replaced with cleaner burning biofuels. Current research is emphasizing quantification of changes in soil nutrients and soil organic matter to provide improved understanding of the long term changes in soil quality associated with annual removal of high yields of herbaceous energy crops.The environmental costs and benefits of producing bionergy crops can be measured in terms of the relative effects on soil, water and wildlife habitat quality of replacing alternate cropping systems with the designated bioenergy system, and in terms of the quality and amount of energy that is produced per unit of energy expended.

In the first experiment, pure starch fractions introduced at a 200 g/kg dietary level were studied. Digestibility of high amylose pea starch was 75.2%, while that of normal peas and maize was 94.4 and 98.8%, respectively. The digestibility of starch of 3 mm ground unfractionated seeds from normal pea genotype, tested in the same experiment, was 76.1%. In the second experiment, pea cotyledon fractions separated into fine (< 100 μm) and coarse (> 100 μm) particles were studied at 480 g/kg dietary inclusion. Mean starch digestibilities were 95.7 and 84.4% for fine and coarse particle fractions, respectively. In the third experiment, whole seeds were either dehydrated (6.6% final water content) or slightly moistened (17.5% final water content) before grinding, which resulted in a three-fold increase in the mechanical energy supplied by grinding in the case of moistened seeds. After grinding, peas were introduced at a 480 g/kg level in diets. Dehydration resulted in either no change or 10% increase in the pea starch digestibility, while moistening resulted in 6.9-19.8% increases. In the fourth experiment, storage conditions of pea seeds for 5 weeks were tested. Temperature, water content of seeds and their physical state (ground vs. unground) during storage had no effect on their starch digestibility. In all experiments metabolisable energy values were also measured and showed good agreement with starch digestibilities. It was concluded that the variations in starch digestibility of ground peas result from interactions between the resistance of pea starch granules and the accessibility defect in coarse particles, and that these interactions depend on the amount of mechanical energy supplied by grinding. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.","Chickens; Fractionation; Grinding; Peas; Starch; Storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001942512

The C(111) and Si(111) surfaces, with H, F, or CN covalently bonded to the surface, are studied. The incoming molecule simulates the tip of a probe that should be able to differentiate between the atoms or molecules on the surface. A Sc-tipped probe molecule yields a larger difference for the probe-surface H versus probe-surface F interaction energies than our previously studied, electron-rich pyridine (C5H5N) and (CH3)3PO probes. However, it is not always possible to differentiate between the surface H and F atoms because the Sc probe interacts too strongly with the neighboring surface atoms. The difference in the probe-H and probe-F interaction energies is smaller for Si(111) than C(111), making it more difficult to differentiate between these two atoms on Si(111). The larger lattice constant for Si(111) significantly reduces the surface atom-surface atom interaction energy as well as the probe-neighbor interaction energies. This means that the H/CN system, which is not practical for C(111) due to the CN-CN repulsion, is possible for Si(111).

Enlargement of the dorsocervical fat pad ('buffalo hump') has been reported in numerous HIV-1 infected patients. Some investigators have speculated that this finding is associated with protease-inhibitor treatment. Methods. Between June, 1995, and October, 1997, we studied eight HIV-1-infected men who had developed a buffalo hump while otherwise stable on antiretroviral therapy. Measurement of 24 h urinary free cortisol excretion and an overnight low-dose dexamethasone suppression test were done to screen for Cushing's syndrome. In one patient, plasma cortisol concentrations were measured every 4 h for 24 h to assess the circadian rhythm of cortisol. Results of total and regional body composition analysis by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and cortisol concentrations were compared with those obtained in a control population of 15 HIV-1-positive men whose age, body-mass index (BMI), and CD4-lymphocyte count were within the range of values in the eight study patients. Findings. The eight patients with a buffalo hump were clinically stable on various antiretroviral regimens, four of which included a protease inhibitor. No other signs of Cushing's syndrome were observed, and plasma cortisol values did not differ significantly from those of controls. 24 h urinary free cortisol excretion was normal in seven patients and slightly raised in one (248 nmoles). In this patient, a repeat 24 h urinary free cortisol was 175 nmoles and plasma cortisol concentrations over 24 h showed a normal circadian pattern (nadir 83 nmol/L at 2400 h). All eight patients had normal suppression of cortisol values after dexamethasone 1 mg (plasma cortisol less than 83 nmol/L). When compared with HIV-1-positive controls, men with a buffalo hump had a significantly greater proportion of fat in the trunk region, suggesting central fat accumulation. Triglyceride but not cholesterol values were higher in the patients than in controls but this difference was not significant. Fasting glucose values did not differ significantly. Interpretation. The development of a buffalo hump cannot be attributed to hypercortisolism in these eight men. Furthermore, its occurrence is not unique to patients on protease inhibitors. Although the mechanism for dorsocervical fat accumulation is unclear, we speculate that regional abnormalities in lipogenesis and lipolysis occur, possibly influenced by the hormonal and metabolic changes seen with HIV-1 infection and its treatment.",,"antiretrovirus agent; CD4 antigen; cholesterol; dexamethasone; glucose; hydrocortisone; proteinase inhibitor; triacylglycerol; absorptiometry; article; body mass; buffalo hump; circadian rhythm; clinical article; controlled study; Cushing syndrome; differential diagnosis; disorders of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hydrocortisone blood level; hydrocortisone urine level; lipid storage; lymphocyte count; priority journal; X ray analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032554569

These alterations are magnified following nerve-repair grafting (NRG). The purpose of this investigation was to test whether diminished GLUT-4 glucose transporter content, decreased storage of glucose (glycogen content), or decreased oxidative capacity (citrate synthase (CS) activity) contribute to the diminished contractile function of SMA-control (SMA-C) and SMA-NRG compared to non-surgical control (NSC) MG muscles in rats. Following a 120 day recovery period, muscle mass (mg) of the SMA-C muscle was dramatically increased compared to NSC muscle, but the SMA-NRG muscle hypertrophy was 17% less than the SMA-C group. Compared to NSC, normalized power was diminished in the SMA-C muscle and further impaired in the SMA-NRG muscle. GLUT-4 protein content was elevated in the SMA groups compared to the NSC group. Glycogen content was dramatically diminished in both SMA groups compared to the NSC group. CS activity was slightly lower in SMA-NRG compared to control groups (P=0.08).

Thus, the diminished contractile function of the SMA muscles is probably not due to diminished glucose transport. However, further studies must be done to assess the activity of the GLUT-4 transporter. We conclude that the diminished contractile function of the SMA muscles may be explained, in part, by a decrease in energy available from glycogen stores. A decrease in oxidative capacity may contribute to the greater impairment in SMA-NRG.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749320018

During the exercise period, power output oscillated slightly around a mean value of 64±6 (±SE) Js-1 whereas total heat production increased progressively throughout exercise in a curvilinear fashion [fitting equation y =0.256 log(x) + 0.497; r2 = 0.93]. Thus, total heat production was about 50% higher during the last compared to the first 5 s, with half of the increase occurring during first 30 s. Accordingly, mechanical efficiency declined exponentially from 50±3% after 5 s to 29±2% after 180 s of exercise [P&lt;0.05; y = -14.68 log(x) + 62.3; r2 = 0.96].

Box 12000, Jerusalem 91120, Israel","Background: A solution for prolonged cold storage of the heart has been developed. The Jerusalem-Cape Town Solution (JCT) is an 'intracellular' type cardioplegic solution and is formulated to (1) minimize hypothermic-induced cell swelling, (2) diminish intracellular acidosis, (3) prevent the expansion of the interstitial space during the reperfusion, (4) protect against oxygen free radical injury during early reperfusion, and (5) provide substrates for regenerating high-energy phosphates. Methods: With a Langendorff model, rat hearts were subjected to 15 minutes of perfusion with Krebs-Henseleit, 10 minutes of cardioplegic infusion and 20 hours of cold storage (5°to 6°C). Hearts were reperfused for 60 minutes and hemodynamic recovery was assessed. The hearts were assigned to three groups (eight hearts in each), according to the cardioplegic solution used: group 1, JCT; group 2, Bretschneider's HTK cardioplegic solution; and group 3 University of Wisconsin cold storage solution. Results: After 60 minutes of reperfusion, the recovery of the coronary artery flow in group 1 (JCT) was significantly better than in group 2, and slightly better than in group 3 (64% ± 8.9%, 47.2% ± 11.6%, 52.5% ± 19.9%, mean ± SD, respectively; group 1 versus group 2, p < 0.01). The recovery of the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) was significantly better in group 1 compared with group 2 and group 3 (60.2% ± 14.5%, 41.1% ± 12.6% and 36.5% ± 10.1%, respectively; p < 0.01). The recovery of the heart contractility expressed by the product of LVDP and the heart rate (LVDP x heart rate) was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 and group 3 (47.5% ± 3.4%, 23.6% ± 9.6%, and 28.7% ± 8.3%, respectively, p < 0.001). In hearts stored for 12 hours in JCT or HTK, the recovery of the heart contractility did not differ significantly (73.4% ± 12.7% or 70.8% ± 30.8%, respectively). Modified reperfusion aimed to improve postischemic heart recovery did not bring significant changes in cardiac mechanical function but resulted in an increase in postischemic coronary artery flow recovery in hearts reperfused with amino acid-enriched buffer. Conclusions: The JCT solution is effective (as well as HTK) in preserving the ischemic hearts for up to 12 hours. It is superior to HTK or University of Wisconsin solution at 20 hours of isolated ischemic storage.",,"amino acid; buffer; cardioplegic agent; htk solution; jerusalem cape town solution; new drug; oxygen radical; preservation solution; st thomas hospital solution; unclassified drug; university of wisconsin solution; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; coronary artery blood flow; cryopreservation; heart left ventricle pressure; heart preservation; heart transplantation; hemodynamics; high energy phosphate; isolated heart; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; reperfusion injury; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Cardioplegic Solutions; Cold; Heart; Heart Transplantation; Hemodynamic Processes; Male; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardial Reperfusion; Organ Preservation; Oxygen Consumption; Phosphocreatine; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031915754

Based on the assumption of factorization, several new features of the pomeron flux factor are determined from simultaneous fits to our UA8 data and lower energy data from the CHLM collaboration at the CERN Intersecting Storage Rings. Prominent among these is that the effective pomeron Regge trajectory requires a term quadratic in t, with coefficient α″ = U.079 ± 0.012 GeV-4. We also show that the data require a pomeron-proton cross section that first decreases with increasing diffractive mass (corresponding to the PPR term in the triple-Regge expansion) and then increases at larger mass (the PPP term), similar to real particle total cross sections. We measure the product kσ0 = 0.72±0.10 mb GeV-2, where K is the normalisation constant of the pomeron flux factor in the proton and σ0 is the scale constant in the pomeron-proton total cross section.

A valid alternative could be a process based on partial oxidation of methane, since the process is mildly exothermic and therefore not energy intensive. Consequently, great interest is expected from conversion of methane into syngas, if an autothermal, low energy intensive, compact and reliable process could be developed. This paper covers the activities, performed by the CNR Institute of Transformation and Storage of Energy (CNR-TAE), on theoretical and experimental studies for a compact hydrogen generator, via catalytic selective partial oxidation of methane, integrated with second generation fuel cells (EC-JOU2 contract). In particular, the project focuses the attention on methane partial oxidation via heterogeneous selective catalysts, in order to: demonstrate the basic catalytic selective partial oxidation of methane (CSPOM) technology in a subscale prototype, equivalent to a nominal output of 5 kWe; develop the CSPOM technology for its application in electric energy production by means of fuel cells; assess, by a balance of plant analysis, and a techno-economic evaluation, the potential benefits of the CSPOM for different categories of fuel cells. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.","Fuel cell; Hydrogen; Methane; Partial oxidation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346615667

The critical wavelength is 61 Å. Using the wiggler, spectral flux can be enhanced at 10 Å. Hence our research work is oriented to: (i) development of master masks both for contact and proximity printing, (ii) a study of the effects of VUV and soft X-rays from synchrotron source on photoresists in SXRL. Mylar is chosen in this region as a master mask substrate for its excellent optical properties. Using the conventional photoresist system in UV lithography, pattern details of 5 μm were printed on Mylar deposited with Au-Cr films. Later on, by depositing Ti-Pd-Au films and Waycoat resists, pattern delineation by optical lithography gave resolution features as small as 1.2 μm. Resists of both positive and negative tones were used. UV exposure (10 mW/cm2 for 7 s) was done under ambient conditions. Contrast details of pattern were estimated by measuring the optical densities. To investigate the fundamental aspects of resist decomposition by SR radiation, (5 to 20 Å) from Indus-2, mass spectrometric analysis of residual gases is performed. It is most probable, that the PMMA and Novolac-based resists with light sensitive resins may be changed to a chemically different layer for example a highly cross linked layer. Resist coated Si wafers were held inside a multiport UHV chamber fitted with QMS and gauge heads, which was evacuated to 1 × 10-6 Pa by TMP and sputter ion pump. Unfiltered UV radiation excited the resists whose energy is measured using a thermopile. Chemical reactions of the resists, when exposed by DUV, soft X-ray or electron beam are discussed. Resist annealing may be essential to withstand SR radiation. The above experimental data from the resists irradiated by synchrotron radiation is of paramount importance especially when we do SXRL work in Indus-2.

The hydrogen storage material (MH) has been synthesised through normal casting and melt-spinning techniques. In LaNi5/MmNi5 family various substitutions like Al, Mn, Co have been studied. The substitution of metalloid like Si is known to be very helpful in improving several hydrogenation properties. In the present study, the Si substituted versions of AB5-type storage materials typified by LaNi5 - xSix (x = 0.1,0.3,0.5) have been investigated. A comparison between the present material and the conventional AB5-type material MmNi4.3Al0.3Mn0.4 has also been made which has been previously studied. The main features revealed by XRD characterisations are the existence of the free Ni and Si together with AB5 material for all the three compositions. These free Ni and Si were found to disappear and yield, giving rise to a singular material after hydrogenation. The melt-spun version of the material was found to grow invariably in a direction perpendicular to the c-axis. The kinetics and activation process was better for the melt-spun version of the LaNi4.7Si0.3 alloy than its thermally-melted counterpart (bulk) as well as to the alloy MmNi4.3Al0.3Mn0.4. For example, the kinetics of the melt-spun version of LaNi4.7Si0.3 is 60% faster than its bulk version and 70% faster than the melt-spun version of MmNi4.3Al0.3Mn0.4. Similarly, the melt-spun version of the alloy LaNi4.7Si0.3 gets activated in the 2nd cycle itself where as the alloy MmNi4.3Al0.3Mn0.4 attains this stage only in the 6th cycle. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.","Hydrogen in metals; Hydrogen storage material; LaNi5; Melt-spinning; Si substitution","Cathodes; Chemical activation; Hydrogenation; Melt spinning; Metalloids; Nickel; Reaction kinetics; Silicon; Synthesis (chemical); X ray diffraction analysis; Hydrogen storage materials; Lanthanum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032489303

Gametogenic activity was characterized on the basis of stereological analysis of the gonads. In both sexes, ripe gametes were continually present and continually released between April and August; spawning efficiency over this period was 60% in females and 83% in males. Again in both sexes, major spawning occurred in August/September (spawning efficiency 94% in females, 86% in males). In parallel with monitoring of gametogenic activity, energy storage was also monitored, by staining the visceral-gonadal mass for glycogen a (rapid-access glycogen), glycogen β (protein-bound glycogen), and acid and neutral lipids. The principal storage areas are muscle tissue, vesicular cells and the digestive gland. Muscle tissue stores and utilizes protein-bound glycogen during the resting period and at the start of gametogenesis, while rapid-access glycogen appears in this tissue only during the gamete ripening period. In vesicular cells, protein-bound glycogen bodies (diameter 1-3 μm, up to 6 per cell) accumulate throughout the resting period; as gametogenesis progresses, these are transformed to triacylglycerides (bodies of about 5-9 μm in diameter, up to 5 per cell), which are subsequently transferred to oocytes (bodies of up to 14 μm in diameter). In the digestive gland, rapid-access glycogen is present throughout the year, while triacylglyceride bodies (diameter 2-15 μm) accumulate over the period of gamete ripening. Acidic lipid inclusions (about 1 μm in diameter, probably corresponding to membrane phospholipids) are observed along the borders of muscle fibres, gonadal follicles, vesicular cells and their nuclei, haemocytes and cells of the gastric diverticles. Haemocytes transport both glycogen fractions, and are observed: (a) between muscle fibres, (b) adhering to the external wall of gonadal follicles and within follicles, (c) adhering to the external wall of gastric diverticles and within diverticles, and (d) adhering to ripening oocytes. Stereological analysis likewise allowed evaluation of seasonal variation in the volume fraction (VF) occupied by vesicular cells. The period of peak vesicular-cell VF (October/November; VF 32% in females, 36% in males, 30% in indeterminate individuals) coincided with that of peak intracellular glycogen levels. Minimum vesicular-cell VF were observed during the gamete ripening period (VF 2-8% in females, 0% in males).","Gametogenesis; Glycogen; Histochemistry; Phospholipids; Stereology; Tapes decussatus; Triacylglycerides",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345698962

The air chemistry is modeled by five species with a 17 steps chemical reaction scheme. The relaxation procss for the vibrational energy mode storage of the N2 and O2 molecules is modeled via the Landau-Teller theory for V-T energy transfer. Particular attention is focused on the ability of the defect method to reproduce the dissipative flow properties obtained from the Navier-Stokes calculations more efficiently, i.e. utilizating less CPU time. Two test cases upstream Mach numbers equal to 8.53 and 15.3 of nonequilibrium hypersonic flow over axisymmetric blunt bodies are investigated. The effects of the temperatures and mass fraction profiles all along the body is performed. The predicted heat flux and wall pressure of both methods are in agreement and compared with experimental data. Good predictions can be obtained with the first order defect boundary layer approach in the nose region. However, the defect approach seems to give less accurate results far from the nose when the inviscid meshis coarse close to the wall. Due to the well known fact that a two-dimensional (2D) Euler computation cannot retrieve the equilibrium conditions at the stagnation point as well as the correct inviscid wall values, the influence of such a singularity on Prandtl solutions as well as the influence of the Euler grid on the defect solution have been studied.The coupled Euler/defect boundary-layer and full Navier-Stokes models for high enthalpy laminar viscous air flow past a blunt body were numerically solved and compared.

An average output power of 700 mW is demonstrated in continuous-wave (CW) operation while 400 mW of average power is obtained in both passive and hybrid mode-locked operation, with subsequent optical amplification in an identical SOA. The mode-locked laser operates at a repetition rate of 1.062 GHz, owing to the interplay between the gain and saturable absorber dynamics. Optical pulses are generated with a temporal duration of 5 ps, which implies a pulse energy of 376 pJ, and a peak power of 60 W. Further reduction of the optical pulsewidth to 1.3 ps is also achieved by using dispersion compensation techniques. These results show the promise of novel SOA devices for use as gain elements in external cavity semiconductor lasers. The generated output pulse characteristics from mode-locked operation is sufficient for use in novel three-dimensional data storage applications, and in large-scale commercial printing and marking applications.","High-power diode lasers; Mode-locked diode lasers; Semiconductor optical amplifiers; Ultrafast pulse generation","Laser pulses; Light; Light amplifiers; Optics; Ultrafast pulse generation; Semiconductor lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032023273

Methods: Rat livers were flushed and stored for a maximum period of 24 hr at 4°C, and tissue energetics, substrate, and anaerobic end-products were assessed; the group exhibiting the best results during storage was recovered in a 60-min period of warm reperfusion. Relative buffering capacities of the experimental solutions (measured over physiological pH range, in mM H+/L) were: UW, 4.1; histidine+UW, 9.8; Tris+UW, 19.0; bicine+UW, 22.5; tricine+UW, 26.8. Results: In the UW group, ATP levels dropped rapidly over the first 4 hr; 1.0 μmol/g (40% of initial) remained after 4 hr of storage. By 2 hr, ATP levels in bicine- and tricine- treated groups were 0.5 and 1.1 μmol/g grater than in the UW-stored livers and by 10 hr, ATP in bicine-treated livers ere twofold that of the control (UW) group. Total adenylate levels also reflected a superior elevation of cellular energetics; even after 24 hr, quantities were 1.4 and 2.0 μmol/g higher than the UW group in bicine- and histidine-supplemented organs. The increase in energetics occurred as a result of increased flux through the major anaerobic energy-producing pathway, glycolysis. The glycolytic rate was significantly greater at storage times &gt;10 hr with solutions supplemented with bicine, histidine, and tricine. Final values for net lactate accumulation over the entire 24-hr storage period were: UW, 101. μmol/g; histidine, 14.3 μmol/g; bicine, 15.2 μmol/g; tricine, 13.8 μmol/g. Activities of glycogen phosphorylase revealed that the activity of this enzyme dropped by 50% within 2 hr of storage in UW. However, histidine and bicine supplementation resulted in a substantial elevation of phosphorylase 'a' over 4 hr and 10 hr, respectively. The best buffer of the four examined in this study was bicine; energetics, glycolytic flux, and patterns of adenylate regeneration upon reperfusion were markedly superior to modified UW solution. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that supplementing the 'gold standard' UW solution with an additional buffering agent (in order of efficacy: bicine&gt;tricine&gt;histidine) may improve the metabolic status of livers during clinical organ retrieval/storage.",,"university of wisconsin solution; animal tissue; article; drug effect; graft survival; liver metabolism; liver transplantation; nonhuman; organ preservation; priority journal; rat; supplementation; Adenine Nucleotides; Adenosine; Adenosine Triphosphate; Allopurinol; Animals; Buffers; Cold; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Glutathione; Glycine; Histidine; Insulin; Lactates; Liver; Male; Models, Biological; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Raffinose; Rats; Rats, Inbred Lew; Time Factors; Tromethamine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032570533

Two binary mixtures melting near the ambient temperature were studied: (a) 0.925 Ca(NO3)2 · 4.06 H20 + 0.075 CaCl2 · 6.11 H2O melting at 35.6°C and (b) 0.9 CH3CONH2 + 0.1 Ca(NO3)2 · 4 H2O, melting at 27.7°C. The melting temperature, the enthalpy of fusion and the heat capacity of both mixtures were determined from DSC measurements. Both mixtures showed to be suitable solvents for the formation of consecutive cobalt(II) chloride complexes. The compositions of the complex compounds were adjusted in each mixture so that the absorption spectra in visible spectral range exhibited low absorbance at the melting temperature and a pronounced increase of the absorbance and/or change of color with the increase of temperature in the range relevant for passive solar energy receivers. The combined latent heat storage and the outstanding reversible change of the optical properties of the dissolved complex compounds with temperature is proposed to be applied in solar heated agricultural greenhouses in areas with fluctuating climate conditions.

Details of the BREB + apparatus are given. The results obtained over maize canopies at the short 5-min signal averaging time are examined in several aspects. One aspect is the fact that on days when net radiation (R(n)) changed rapidly because of cloud movement, latent heat flux (λE) fluctuated nearly in unison at 5-min intervals with the fluctuations in independently measured R(n), Bowen ratio, and canopy temperature. The direction of the fluctuations is consistent with the principles of energy balance and gradient transport. Hence, the results support the use of the short signal averaging time. Another aspect is the coincidental fluctuations in the measured differential in water vapor (Δq) and in carbon dioxide (ΔCO2) at two heights above the canopy on clear days when the trend in radiation was steady, which appeared to be the result of measurement noise at first glance. It turned out that Δq and ΔCO2 fluctuated largely in unison, indicating the likelihood of real accumulation of water vapor and depletion of CO2 near the top of the canopy at times of low turbulence, and the opposite effects of reduced accumulation and depletion at times of high turbulence. The calculated values of eddy transfer coefficient for water vapor, K(w), is consistent with this interpretation. In spite of the fluctuations in Δq, the time trend in λE was steady on clear days. In contrast, the time trend in the 5-min canopy CO2 flux (A(cf)) often exhibited substantial short term peaks and dips. Parts of these fluctuations in A(cf) may be attributed to the measurement noise in ΔCO2 and the inherent larger errors in calculating A(cf). The error contributed by the changes in CO2 and water vapor stored within the canopy air volume from one measurement interval to the next were evaluated. The limited results show that the errors due to storage were largely minor and were similar in relative size for λE and for A(cf). The 5-min mean data were compared with the 30-min mean data to evaluate whether the shorter averaging time is sufficient to make horizontal divergence of energy components insignificant. The comparison indicates negligible mean horizontal movements in λE and sensible heat H and demonstrates the fulfillment of the assumption of one-dimensional transport underlying the BREB + technique. On days of variable clouds, it is shown that the 30-min mean values distorted or obliterated the expected responses of the canopy to sudden changes in radiation. Some limitations and other inaccuracies of the BREB + technique are discussed. Overall, the results are strongly supportive of the validity of the BREB + technique in general, and the use of the novel averaging time of 5 min for λE and H over field crops in particular. The necessary averaging time for A(cf) is less certain and further study is desirable.","Bowen ratio-energy balance technique; Heat flux; Maize canopies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032548971

Experiments have been carried out using inert boxes and a propane diffusion flame on a line burner located at the bottom of the rack. Reasonably good correlation is found between the theoretical model and the experiments. The model calculates the flow within the rack with the aid of the equations of continuity, and conservation of momentum and energy. The model distributes fractions of the total convective heat from the burner along a calculated flame height in accordance with an empirical relationship obtained from measured convective heat. The flame height is calculated by comparing the amount of available airflow and fuel at each height for different heat release rates and widths of regular spaces between noncombustible boxes. The theoretical results were compared to experimental results based on an approximately two dimensional, four box high rack storage with a total height ranging from 1·14 m to 1·34 m and with a 0·59 m long diffusion line burner placed at the bottom of the vertical flue.

Such microstructural changes usually lead to inelastic response. This paper is devoted to the study of one such microstructural change, attributed to deformation induced twinning, from a macroscopic point of view, within the framework of a general continuum theory originally developed for polymers by Rajagopal and Wineman [1] and modified appropriately to model crystalline materials by Rajagopal and Srinivasa [2, 3]. In this paper, we elucidate the intricate interplay between the storage and dissipation of energy due to deformation and their influence on the propagation and arrest of twinning. The onset of twinning is determined purely by energy considerations. We show that the entire constitutive structure of the material can be reduced to the specification of three scalar functions to model ""quasi equilibriated twinning"": the Helmholtz free energy potential ψ, the rate of dissipation function ξ and the activation function g. For the dynamical case (when inertial effects cannot be ignored), an additional constitutive function for the kinetic energy associated with the process of twinning must be specified. © 1998 Acta Metallurgica Inc.",,"Continuum mechanics; Crystal microstructure; Crystalline materials; Deformation; Energy dissipation; Free energy; Kinetic energy; Continuum theory; Twinning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031988608

The data were collected with a conventional gas discharge light source at the University of North Carolina and at the SuperACO synchrotron storage ring of LURE in Orsay, France. The 2-bromobutane ion dissociates via Br and HBr loss within 0.3 eV of the ionization limit. The Br loss channel produces the sec-butyl ion C4H9+ via a simple bond cleavage and is found to proceed at a fast rate. At lower ion energies, the HBr loss channel produces the 2-butene ion via a concerted mechanism with rate constants in the microsecond range. A model that involves tunneling associated with the proton transfer is proposed. Asymmetric time-of-flight distributions and breakdown diagrams are fitted to the statistical RRKM theory with the aid of GAUSSIAN ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the MP2/6-31G* level.

L5L 1C6, Canada","The purpose of this paper is to describe a quantitative method of trophic dynamic analysis derived from a systems ecology theoretical foundation. This method was devised to provide a solution for the problem of how to deal with mixed trophic and non-trophic processes in cyclic ecosystem networks, a problem that has vexed trophic ecology since Lindeman first presented a formal concept of trophic dynamics in 1942. The author's initial attempt to solve this problem was presented in Whipple and Patten (1993, J. theor. Biol. 163, 393-411). The path-based network unfolding method described in this paper provides a quantitative method for conducting trophic dynamic analysis of cyclic ecosystems containing non-living storages and non-trophic flows to produce a true energy-transformation trophic macrochain. This method solves the 'trophic-level inflation' problem described in Whipple and Patten (1993, J. theor. Biol. 163, 393-411). The results of the analysis of an oyster reef ecosystem model demonstrate that the dual trophic macrochain produced by path-based network unfolding may be used to compare the relative contribution of grazing and detrital sub-webs to the trophic dynamics of ecosystems. It was found that the standing stock and flow contribution of the detrital sub-web was quantitatively dominant in the oyster reef ecosystem model. This method might be used to compare the contribution of grazing and because a true energy transformation trophic chain is produced, the progressive efficiency concept of the Lindeman-Hutchinson paradigm may be applied in comparative trophic analyses of ecosystems. In comparing the oyster reef model results of three quantitative trophic analysis methods, the path-based network unfolding method was found to produce a trophic macrochain with progressive efficiencies intermediate between those produced by the original Higashi et al. method and the Burns et al. unfolding analysis of a modified version of the oyster reef model.",,"cyclic ecosystem; path-based network unfolding method; trophic dynamic analysis; article; dynamics; ecology; ecosystem; food chain; mathematical model; oyster; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032492207

Evolutionary theory predicts chat particular body components should be differentially enlarged in the two sexes. For example, we might expect the reproductive success of females to be enhanced by enlargement of organ systems involved in the processing and storage of energy (e.g. alimentary tract, liver, fat stores) whereas males would benefit from the enlargement of systems important for mate-searching, male-male combat and sperm competition (e.g. larger mass of skeletal muscles, tail, and kidneys). Dissection of 243 specimens of three snake species (117 Vipera aspis, 43 Elaphe longissima, 83 Coluber viridflavus) broadly supported these predictions. Strong sex differences were apparent in relative sizes (masses) of all the non-gonadal body components that we weighed. For example, males consistently had more musculature (relative to body length) than did conspecific females. Dimorphism in relative muscle mass is likely to be one of the most fundamental and widespread morphological differences between males and females in the Animal Kingdom.","Body composition; Muscle mass; Sexual dimorphism; Sexual selection; Snakes","body size; morphology; reproductive success; sexual dimorphism; snake; animal tissue; article; body composition; body size; evolution; female; male; muscle mass; nonhuman; priority journal; reproduction; sex difference; snake; species; Animalia; Coluber; Coluber viridflavus; Elaphe longissima; Elaphe longissima; Serpentes; Vipera; Vipera aspics; Vipera aspis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032492139

The observations revealed that the synthesis of Mg2Ni progresses homogeneously rather than topochemically, and not through an intermediate phase, with acceleration by liquid generation of the eutectoid phase. The result was that the most reasonable expression is a second-order irreversible equation, k(1 -f)2, with an activation energy of 165 kJ/mol.","Combustion synthesis; Hydrogen storage alloys; Intermetallic compounds; Kinetics; Solid-solid reactions","Activation energy; Combustion; Differential scanning calorimetry; Differential thermal analysis; Magnesium alloys; Powder metals; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); X ray diffraction analysis; Combustion synthesis; Electron probe x ray microanalysis; Reaction rate; Reaction kinetics; alloy; magnesium; nickel; article; chemical reaction kinetics; combustion; controlled study; differential scanning calorimetry; energy; mathematical model; microanalysis; powder; scanning electron microscopy; solid; synthesis; technique; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032472935

The model is drawn as a sideways figure-eight i.e. @?. There are two dimensions in this model, connectivity (abscissa) and the amount of capital stored in the system (ordinate). This conceptual model has been suggested as a guide to thinking about the impact of climate change on biodiversity, but the two dimensions are insufficient and the alignment of the figure-eight model is problematic when compared with actual data. Kay has adjusted the dimensions of the figure-eight model and renamed the abscissa as exergy stored and the ordinate as exergy consumed. We realign the original figure-eight model, labeling the abscissa as carbon stored and the ordinate as nutrients, such that the relative values of both axes are in qualitative agreement with data from four different studies. This new alignment is then shown to fit relatively well with Holling's original labels. This revision of the figure-eight model brings Holling's model into agreement with observations and provides insight into the linkages between biodiversity and climate change.","Biodiversity; Carbon storage; Climate change; Conservation; Creative destruction; Ecological succession; Ecosystem stability; Holling figure-eight; Nitrogen; Resilience","Biodiversity; Carbon storage; Creative destruction; Ecological succession; Holling figure eight model; Two dimensional; Climate change; Conservation; Ecosystems; Energy storage; Management science; Mathematical models; Natural resources; Environmental impact; biodiversity; biodiversity Holling's model; climate change; climatic change; ecosystem dynamics; Holling's model; model validation; biodiversity; climate; conference paper; ecosystem; model",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032007887

By calculations of the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of nucleic acid bases, it has been found that guanine is the strongest nucleophile, making the C-G base pair a preferential site among all base pairs for covalent bond formation by an electrophile (e.g. alkylating agent, aziridinium ion and carbonium ion).

In the present era of inexpensive digital storage, however, such algorithms are increasingly being used to flag signal segments in continuously recorded digital data streams for subsequent processing by automatic and/or expert interpretation systems. In the course of our development of an automated, near-real-time, waveform correlation event-dectection and location system (WCEDS), we have surveyed the abilities of such algorithms to enhance seismic phase arrivals in teleseismic data streams. Specifically, we have considered envelopes generated by energy transient (STA/LTA), Z-statistic, frequency transient, and polarization algorithms. The WCEDS system requires a set of input data streams that have a smooth, low-amplitude response to background noise and seismic coda and that contain peaks at times corresponding to phase arrivals. The algorithm used to generate these input streams from raw seismograms must perform well under a wide range of source, path, receiver, and noise scenarios. Present computational capabilities allow the application of considerably more robust algorithms than have been historically used in real time. However, highly complex calculations can still be computationally prohibitive for current workstations when the number of data streams become large. While no algorithm was clearly optimal under all source, receiver, path, and noise conditions tested, an STA/LTA algorithm incorporating adaptive window lengths controlled by nonstationary seismogram spectral characteristics was found to provide an output that best met the requirements of a global correlation-based event-detection and location system.",,"algorithm; earthquake; seismic event detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031714909

The dissociative recombination rate is found to be weakly dependent on the N⊃+⊃2 vibrational level. At 0 eV collision energy, the v = 0 product branching is found to be 0.37(8):0.11(6):0.32(4) for N(4S) +N(2D):N(⊃2⊃P)+N( 4S):N(⊃2⊃D)+N(⊃2⊃D) fragments. The dissociative recombination cross section does not have a high-energy peak as was found in a number of lighter molecular systems. The dissociative excitation signal starts only slightly above the energy threshold for dissociation, and peaks near 25 eV. From the dissociative excitation data and literature data, information is retrieved on the dissociative ionization of N⊃+⊃2. The comparison of these results with earlier DR measurements is extensively discussed. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001434873

From our experiment, the discharge capacity of AB2 type Laves phase hydrogen storage alloy ZrCr0.4Mn0.2V0.1Ni1.3 decreased sharply from 324 mAh g-1 to 25 mAh g-1 after amorphization by mechanically milling the crystalline (as-cast) alloy with stainless steel balls. We believe that for the as-cast alloy, hydrogen atoms stored in the tetrahedral interstitial sites of Zr2B2 (B = Cr, Vor Ni) all contribute to its electrochemical capacity. However for the amorphous alloy only hydrogen atoms in low-energy Zr3B and Zr4 tetrahedral interstitial sites contribute to its electrochemical capacity. We also believe that only half of the total sites in the crystalline or amorphous alloys can absorb and desorb hydrogen atoms reversibly, and that the process of ball milling manages to lower the barrier potential for the hydrogen discharge reaction by about 60 kJ (mol H)-1. We resolve the phenomenon into the finer particles including abundant hydrogen diffusion channels and the formation of a looser tetrahedral interstitial structure in the metal glass. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.","Crystal characteristics; Electrochemical capacity; Zr-based hydrogen storage alloy","Amorphization; Amorphous alloys; Ball milling; Crystalline materials; Diffusion in solids; Electric discharges; Electrochemical electrodes; Hydrogen; Electrochemical capacity; Hydrogen storage alloys; Tetrahedral interstitial sites; Zirconium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031704208

Crystals containing these defects have the characteristics of local pbotorefractive materials in that their refractive index is modified in proportion to the local optical energy absorbed. This refractive index change, which results from the release of electrons from the DX deep trap states into the conduction band, is persistent at low temperatures due to a capture barrier. Ecap, which limits reformation of the DX centers. The effect is reversed by heating above an annealing temperature, which scales with Ecap and varies with the crystal host and active dopant. A number of DX materials have now been identified with long-term persistence temperatures ranging from 50 to 180 K. In this paper, we briefly review the physics of the DX center and present theoretical estimates of several important optical properties of these materials based on a simple model. We calculate spatial resolution, maximum refractive index shift, and sensitivity, and compare our predictions with measurements on one member of the DX family. AlGaAs:Te. In a 345 μm thick sample of this material doped at 9 × 1017 cm-3, we find a refractive index shift, Δn, of 2 × 10-3 and an exposure sensitivity. S. of 0.012cm3/J. Our expectation that the maximum refractive index change scales linearly with the doping density is consistent with our previous measurement of Δn = 1.1 × 10-2 obtained for a sample of AlGaAs:Si doped at 4 × 1018 cm-3. The measured values of Δn and S. are. respectively, two and three orders of magnitude larger than corresponding values for the photorefractive material LiNbO3. and are shown here to be independent of exposing irradiance from 10-3 to 108 W/cm2. At the latter irradiance, the refractive index shift is shown to occur with a material response time shorter than our measurement limit of several picoseconds. Thus, this material exhibits high sensitivity, large refractive index change, and fast write time, all desirable properties of an optical holographic storage medium. Phase gratings written in AlGaAs:Te using low-power (mW) beams from infrared diode lasers give diffraction efficiencies from 30% to 55% for grating periods from 0.13 to 15 μm. No degradation of sensitivity is observed after large numbers of exposure-erasure cycles. Experiments with multiple-hologram exposures show that the DX materials require no exposure schedule, equal strength holograms are obtained using equal exposures. Binary data have been stored in the form of multiplexed two-dimeasional arrays of pixel bits. Required material and system parameters are estimated for a 1 Tbyte holographic storage device based on angle multiplexing in a DX material. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.",,"Annealing; Crystal defects; Diffraction gratings; Holography; Irradiation; Mathematical models; Optical bistability; Optical resolving power; Refractive index; Semiconductor lasers; Sensitivity analysis; Doping density; Holographic storage materials; Photorefractive materials; Optical data storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031672339

In this paper it is shown how the equations that describe the technique can be derived through a geometrical construction. The new formulation is presented in conjunction with an overview of the earlier derivation of Wu [1994] in order to emphasize the similarities and differences between the two approaches. The geometrical derivation provides for a formulation in terms of interfaces (steps) rather than slabs. It also leads quite naturally to the incorporation of backscattered energy in the model. An algorithm to implement this important capability is developed in some detail and includes a backpropagation technique, which improves storage efficiency by removing the need to store the backscattered field at each screen independently. Numerical results are presented for some simple backscattering models, first of all to validate the theory, but then more specifically to illustrate the frequency response of the model and the implications it has for the choice of a suitable source spectrum.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001744191

Force-generating mechanisms produce a specified quasi-static force or torque as a function of input position with resisting energy supplied to the mechanism from an external energy-storage device, such as a spring or load weight. Multiple-degree-of-freedom forcegenerating mechanisms provide the tailored resistance force along a design path while incorporating additional mobility, which allows the mechanism to deviate from the path within a local workspace. Although many potential applications for these mechanisms exist, the focus of this research has been on the design of weight-loaded machines for personal strength training, where the additional freedom of motion is valuable for reasons of ergonomic and exercise efficiency. A variety of open- and closed-chain mechanisms are considered as potential candidates for design. Techniques are developed for the closed-form synthesis of simple, two link, open loop chains that are able to produce a specified force component along a prescribed path. This result provides a foundation for designing more useful mechanisms, including doubly weighted symmetric and singly weighted asymmetric 5R linkages. In all cases, closed-form solutions are developed using Burmestertype synthesis procedures and equations of static equilibrium. © 1998 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

If priority is given to the former function, then its water level varies; if reserve function is a primary consideration, then the reservoir water level remains stably high. In actual reservoir operation it is important to maintain an adequate balance between the two functions. Demand forecasting seems helpful in meeting this need. Since the storage capacity of distribution reservoirs is no greater than several to 10-odd hours in terms of discharging time, shorter demand forecasts than before should desirably be made in hour units. We developed a method for making hourly forecasts of water demand, using the theory of chaos control and evaluated its usefulness in solving distribution reservoir problems through simulation. The future water level of a reservoir was predicted based on the data obtained by demand forecasting and water pumps were operated to keep the reservoir water level in the goal range. As a result, an adequate balance could be maintained between the two reservoir functions so that the frequency of pump operation could be reduced to improve energy efficiency. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

This model describes the steady state as well as the transient behavior of the flow and heat transfer during the trap regeneration processes. The trap temperature profile was determined by numerically solving the 2-D unsteady energy equation including the convective, heat conduction and viscous dissipation terms. The convective terms were based on a 2-D analytical flow field solution derived from the conservation of mass and momentum equations (Opris, 1997). The reaction kinetics were described using a discretized first order Arrhenius function. The 2-D term describing the reaction kinetics and particulate matter conservation of mass was added to the energy equation as a source term in order to represent the particulate matter oxidation. The filtration model describes the particulate matter accumulation in the trap. This model includes the diffusion, direct interception, and inertia mechanisms, and are linked together to capture the overall filtration characteristics of the trap (Opris and Johnson, 1998). The effect of trap material proper-ties on trap regeneration behavior was studied with and without a Cu fuel additive for controlled and uncontrolled regeneration tests. The theoretical results compared well to the experimental data. The regeneration model indicated that the fundamental difference between SiC and Cordierite is to be found in the trap design (wall thickness = 0.8 mm for the tested SiC vs. 0.43 mm with Cordierite), and trap material properties (thermal conductivity, density and specific heat where 11 W/m/K, 1600 kg/m3, and 750 J/kgK with SiC, and 0. 1 W/m/K, 1000 kg/m3 and 600 J/ kgK with Cordierite). These differences are largely responsible for the regeneration behavior difference. Using the regeneration model, it was determined that the temperature gradients (dT/dt) for similar conditions, were up to five times larger with Cordierite, when compared to SiC. The regeneration times with SiC were more than twice as long for the tested conditions. These results were also confirmed experimentally (Gantawar et al., 1996 and Awara et al., 1996), and are consistent with the difference in trap design and material properties. For all tested conditions (SiC and Cordierite, with and without the fuel additive, controlled and uncontrolled regeneration tests), the computed results indicated that the regeneration process is driven by the local exhaust gas temperature. Since all regeneration processes were initiated by ramping the engine (flow rates and temperatures) from a low reaction rate condition (∼300°C) to a higher reaction rate condition (&gt;450-500°C), the regeneration process was always initiated at the trap inlet. However, as the local reactions increased the local gas temperatures, and as some of the released energy was convected downstream in the channel, the maximum temperatures were always calculated (and measured) towards the end of the inlet channel indicating a local energy storage. Consequently, the reaction rates increased locally even more, yielding a local particulate oxidation rate higher than the rest of the inlet channel. For all tested cases, the particulate matter was first oxidized towards the end of the inlet channel. As regions of the inlet cell were partially or completely oxidized, the reaction front moved to upstream regions where there was availability of particulate matter. Consequently, the reaction front moved from downstream to upstream locations. The parametric study performed in this research indicated that an optimum trap configuration can be achieved by changing the material properties (e.g. thermal conductivity similar to SiC's and density and specific heat similar to Cordierite's). From a filtration/trap pressure drop point of view, the trap pore size could be increased to approximately 30 μm and a trap porosity of approximately 45%.

Flywheel energy storage systems can provide extended operating life and significant reduction in weight and volume compared to conventional electrochemical systems. In addition, flywheels can provide momentum or reaction wheel functions for attitude control. This paper describes the design, fabrication, and spin testing of two 10 MJ composite flywheel energy storage rotors. To achieve the demonstrated energy density of greater than 310 kJ/kg in a volume of less than 0.05 m3, the rotors utilize flexible composite arbors to connect a composite rim to a metallic shaft, resulting in compact, lightweight, high energy density structures. The paper also describes the finite element stress and rotordynamics analyses, along with a description of the fabrication and assembly techniques used in the construction of the rotor. A description of the experimental setup and a discussion of spin testing of the rotors up to 45,000 rpm (965 m/s tip speed) are also presented. Accurate measurements of rotor centrifugal growth made with laser triangulation sensors confirmed predicted strains of greater than 1.2% in the composite rim. Due to the weight penalty associated with flywheel designs requiring containment structures, there is a strong need to develop flywheel systems which operate safely in space, preferably without dedicated containment structures.

The cooler provides thermal control for an electromechanical actuator motor drive. These aircraft actuator motor drives do not have an available high performance heat sink, and thus must rely on the quiescent air in an actuator bay or the aircraft structure, as heat sinks. Thermal loads on the power electronics of these motor drives can be quite high for short durations, suggesting the use of phase change energy storage to store the heat until it can be rejected to the available heat sinks. The present experiment used Fluorinert®1 compound FC72®2 for the refluxing fluid, and Shellwax®3 paraffin wax with either a 51° C or 61° C melt temperature as a PCM for high power transients. Critical heat flux was not detected in the present test series, although the peak fluxes at the base of the power die and at the boiler surface were 80 and 20 W/cm2, respectively, with a boiler wall superheat of 16K. The motor drive peak heat load of 1,000 W was applied for up to ten minute intervals.

Flywheel energy storage systems offer the potential for making these systems concepts practical. However, current concepts for flywheel energy storage systems rely on energy conversion and power generation approaches that limit the available energy for aircraft use to near 60% of the fully charged capacity of the fly wheel, with efficiencies below 90%. With useable specific energy capacities below 50 Whr/kg, these systems are in capable of enabling solar-powered HALE UAV technology. In this paper, the performance of a high-power, ultra-low loss, ""ironless"" motor/generator design is outlined as part of a supercritical self-balancing flywheel energy storage module (FESM). The super high-speed ""ironless"" generator design enables a 99% energy conversion efficiency and a 90% depth-of-discharge (DOD). The design approach outlined combines the ironless stator design with a super sonic magnet array (&gt; Mach 1.5) to achieve a cruise power output of 9 kW for 10 hours, and peak power output capability of 275 kW over the full range of the module. Analytical trade studies indicate stator power losses well below 10's of watts at cruising power, with maximum losses of 4 kW associated with 275 kW pulse output at minimum generator speed. Stress analyses indicate critical components affecting energy storage capacity are flywheel hub stress, hub-to-rotor interface stresses, and magnet contact stresses. Analysis indicates a low stress flywheel hub approach provides a flywheel specific energy of 120 Whr/kg, and unit specific energy of 84 Whr/kg. Electromagnetic analyses indicate useable specific energy of 75 Whr/kg, which is enabling for HALE UAV technology.

Heavy vehicles are defined as Class 7 & 8 trucks (> 118,000 pounds GVW), and transit buses that have a fuel usage greater than 10,000 gallons per year and driving range of more than 300 miles. The key in making LNG market-competitive with all types of diesel fuels is in improving energy efficiency and reducing costs of LNG technologies through systems integration. This paper integrates together the three LNG technologies of: (1) production from landfills and remote well sites; (2) cryogenic fuel delivery systems; and (3) state-of-the-art storage tank and refueling facilities, with market end-use strategies. The program's goal is to develop these technologies and strategies under a ""green"" and ""clean"" strategy. This ""green"" approach reduces the net contribution of global warming gases by reducing levels of methane and carbon dioxide released by heavy vehicles usage to below recoverable amounts of natural gas from landfills and other natural resources. Clean technology refers to efficient use of energy with low environmental emissions. The objective of the program is to promote fuel competition by having LNG priced between $ 0.40-$ 0.50 per gallon with a combined production, fuel delivery and engine systems efficiency approaching 45%. This can make LNG a viable alternative to diesel. © 1998 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cryogenics; Diesel fuels; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Liquefied natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Brookhaven national laboratory; Clean technologies; Department of Energy; Efficient use of energy; Environmental emissions; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Liquid natural gas; Systems integration; Natural gas vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072470552

A better understanding of these flows and of their interactions with the car underbody, may contribute to the future improvement of the car drag characteristics. This paper reports the results of a parametric study carried out in the Pininfarina wind tunnel, on a full scale simplified car model, by using the Ground Effect Simulation System built in 1995. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the aerodynamic coefficients produced by important geometric changes which affect the flows under the car, in proximity of the ground, and are often difficult or impossible to be modified when tests are made on real cars. The model chosen for this research program is that defined by the SAE ""Open Jet Interference Committee"" as a reference model to be used for investigating wind tunnel interference and for comparison between wind tunnels. In particular it has no wheels. The model built in full scale by Pininfarina is, in reality, a super-set of the SAE model, as it includes a number of additional parts, which are necessary to investigate the behavior of this model in various conditions of ground effect. These add-on parts include: Front and rear wheel-housings of three different sizes. Wheels of 2 different sizes / covers Some different wheel tracks Three different front and rear overhangs. Three different rear diffusers. These parts have been interchanged, to cover a great number (not all) of the possible different configurations. In addition, each of these configurations has been tested: At various ground clearances, from 200 to 50 mm In the four classical GESS conditions, namely Moving Ground and Rotating Wheels Moving Ground Only Rotating Wheels Only All Static In addition, pressures have been measured along the underbody centerline, including the diffuser and the model base. Furthermore the flow field under the model has been measured for some selected configurations, to achieve a better understanding of the data obtained by the balance. The analysis of all this large number of measurements has been rather engaging. A multiple regression analysis has been used to estimate the change which can be expected for each coefficient, CD, CL, CLF, CLR, CMY, when the model configuration and /or its ground clearance is changed. These results are reported in the paper, together with some selected surface pressure diagrams. It is worth noting that this is the first time that the results of a systematic study into ground effect at full scale, have been published. Although these results are specific for this model shape, they can contribute to a better understanding of the effect of the underbody layout changes as well as of the differences which can be expected for the various GESS testing conditions. It is well known that the largest component of car aerodynamic drag arises from the energy losses in the flow along the car underbody, the flow within the wheel-housings, and the flow around or through the wheels. Evidence of that was shown by flow maps published several years ago (1) (2). One of these maps, reprinted in fig.1, shows clearly that most of the momentum loss at the back of the car, i.e. the most important contribution to the car CD, is located at a height over the ground between 0 and 500 mm. The car shown in the map, although designed about ten years ago, had a remarkably low drag coefficient (CD ∼ 0.29), not too different from the CD values of the best cars which are sold nowadays. Therefore the flow conditions shown behind this car are still representative of those of many present passenger cars. This also means that any realistic possibility of further significant improvement to the aerodynamic drag of a modern car is strongly dependent on reducing the losses from the underbody flows. However, working on improving underbody flows has been historically difficult, for a number of reasons. Car manufacturers are reluctant to invest money (or too much money) for streamlining the car underbody. The Opel Calibra (3) launched in 1986 is probably the first example of a mass production car where underbody aerodynamics has been taken into account (fig. 2), and that has certainly contributed to the excellent CD value of this car (0.26 - 0.28, depending on the wind tunnel). The reluctance of car manufacturers to accept aerodynamic development of the car underbody is due to several factors, namely the increase of cost and weight associated with fitting the shields to the underbody, the cost of redesigning some parts of the underbody, the possibility of thermal problems, and eventually a more difficult maintenance of the drive line. Beside these reasons, which are certainly partly true, an additional important reason which discouraged aerodynamic work on car underbodies was the lack of experimental facilities able to reproduce flow conditions under the car which are sufficiently similar to the conditions existing on the road. In reality the possibility of reproducing in full scale the car to ground relative motion and, at the same time, the spinning of the car wheels, is relatively recent. DNW reported tests of this type on passenger cars in 1989 (4), and FIAT in 1990 (5) (6). Both used (and still use) a large belt, and that is certainly an excellent way to provide a good simulation of the road condition. However the system to support the car over the belt is relatively complex in both wind tunnels, and require lengthy preparation of the car and /or the wind tunnel. This last point has somehow discouraged the use of these large moving grounds for every day development work. More recently, in 1995, Pininfarina has built in its Wind Tunnel a Ground Effect Simulation System (GESS) of new design. It includes various sub-systems, namely a narrow moving belt (MB) to cover the area under the car between the wheels, separate rotating rollers (RR) to spin the wheels, a boundary layer suction system (BLSS) followed by a tangential blowing system (TBS), both upstream of the belt. The latter feeds the belt with a correct boundary layer and reduces as much as possible the boundary layer displacement thickness on that part of the test section floor not covered by the moving belt. Details on the GESS and on its latest upgrades are reported in (7) (8) (9). Fig. 3 shows the various sub-systems and in particular the new rollers. The main advantage offered by this new type of GESS is its high level of practicality. Almost any passenger car can be tested in conditions of moving ground and rotating wheels, with a very short preparation. And that has made possible and practical the aerodynamic development of the car underbody. The research program which is reported in this paper is the logical follow-up to the availability of this Ground Effect Simulation System, and demonstrates the possibility of performing a large number of tests, easily and with a good simulation of the underbody flows. Beside that, the following points have been taken in account. 1.In three years of operation the GESS has been used to test and/or develop more than 100 cars having different body shapes, underbody layouts (from very rough to very clean), ground clearance (from the 200 mm typical of passenger cars to the 40 - 45 mm of some racing cars).While these tests have certainly provided important information for the specific development of each one of these cars, the possibility of extracting from these results information of more general value is quite limited. In reality, underbody flows are in general quite complex due to the many different details existing on the underbody. Even using the best techniques which are available to map the flow under the car (pressure probes, hot wire, ldv) any attempt to make a complete reconstruction of these flows gives often only modest results. Consequently it is rather difficult to propose significant underbody configuration changes or to establish clear trends of any type, starting from sets of results measured on real cars. 2.On the other hand, as everyone knows, important configuration parameters, like wheel-base, track, front and rear overhangs, wheel-housing size, etc are virtually impossible to be modified during the wind tunnel tests on real cars. Therefore, the potential of aerodynamic improvement related to this type of configuration changes is practically unknown, at least for tests on full size cars and when an appropriate simulation of the ground motion and wheel rotation are considered. The research program started in 1996 at Pininfarina, and partly funded by the Italian National Council for Research, in the ""Progetto Finalizzato Trasporti 2"" program, intends to investigate this specific field of aerodynamic effects which are associated with important geometric changes of a car underbody. And this, by carrying out tests on a full scale simplified model and using the Ground Effect Simulation System mentioned before, to provide a correct simulation of the underbody flows. A second important aim of the research program is to define, in a systematic way, the differences which can be expected for the various GESS testing conditions.

After preconditioning, the post-rigor muscle response was repeatable but significantly less stiff than live passive muscle due to an increase in no-load strain. Failure properties of postmortem muscle were found to be significantly different than live passive muscle with significant decreases in failure stress (61%) and energy (81%), while failure strain was unchanged. These results suggest that the post-rigor response of cadaver muscle is unaffected by freezing but sensitive to even a few cycles of mechanical loading. © 1998 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Accidents; Digital storage; Freezing; Refrigerators; Failure properties; Freeze-thaw process; Freezer storages; Mechanical loading; New Zealand White rabbit; Post-mortem muscles; Skeletal muscle; Tibialis anterior; Muscle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072450671

Especially the batteries play an important role within the life cycle assessment of electric vehicles. Based on our work within the ""Rügen project""/IFEU 1997a/we now have derived full energy and mass flow analyses for the production, supply, and recycling of four types of batteries: lead/acid, Ni/Cd, Na/NiCl2, and Na/S. The assessments were made in accordance with the present state of the discussion concerning the standardization of life cycle assessments (ISO/DIS 14040-14043) and considering the following impact categories: Resource demand, greenhouse effect, ozon depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human and eco toxicity, and photosmog. In a second step also the usage of the batteries has been assessed. The results show that there are significant differences between the batteries if the usage of them is very low. Also it is important to include the disposal or recycling processes of the batteries into the assessment. If the use of the batteries is very high, the results depend mainly on the energy sources used for power generation which varies in different countries.

In 1996, Saft undertook a Phase I Research and Development program, funded by the US Department of Energy, under the sponsorship of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV), to determine lithium-ion applicability for HEV energy storage. During this program Saft determined that properly designed lithium-ion cells could exhibit outstanding power handling characteristics, excellent cycle life and concurrently, relatively high capacity. Using portable size cell hardware, Saft was able to demonstrate power handling capability of over 1200 W/kg, over 120,000 cycles of 3% DOD increment, and energy densities of 65-85 Wh/kg. The results of the Phase I program which were published during the EVS-14 Conference1 have shown that lithium-ion technology has the potential to be used as the primary energy storage device for HEVs. Saft has since begun a Phase II PNGV program to scale-up technology into full size cells and modules and to demonstrate their resilience under abuse test conditions.

For fast switching current in inductive and inductive-capacitive energy storage, the circuits are used in which a sharp increase of transient impedance of the circuit element occurs. The possibility is considered of using for switching purposes the jump in magnetization of a coil core under external action. In the initial state the core should be deeply saturated, and at the required moment the material of the core should transit into the unsaturated state, which is accompanied by the sharp increase in the inductance, and transition of the current into the load. The control of the process should be performed in such a way that the inductance jump and the time of its realization were determined by the external action and not by the current in the storage circuit.

In such systems, the POS first acts as a low series resistance while charging a vacuum inductor with energy from a capacitive store, and then rapidly transitions to a high resistance to transfer the energy quickly and at high power to a parallel load. Because of the implications to size and cost of a pulsed power generator, improvement of the POS in terms of scaling the switch to higher voltage and current operation has been a major emphasis of research over the past several years. To improve and better understand the operation of plasma opening switches, it is highly desirable to have data from a variety of diagnostics that provide a clear and internally consistent description of switch operation. © 1998 Beam Organizing Committee.","Costs; Current measurement; Elementary particle vacuum; Energy storage; Inductors; Plasma measurements; Power generation; Pulse compression methods; Switches; Vacuum systems","Costs; Digital storage; Electric inductors; Electric resistance; Electric switches; Energy storage; Particle beams; Plasma guns; Power generation; Switches; Elementary particle vacuum; Inductive energy storage; Plasma measurement; Plasma opening switch; Power amplification; Pulse compression methods; Pulsed-power generators; Vacuum system; Electric current measurement",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051187098

The application of geoscience to these ends, especially engineering geology, has occurred from pole to pole and included every conceivable environment and natural condition. In the conduct of such projects, the geosciences have advanced, and vice versa. Desert trafficability, most notably regarding playa surfaces, is temporary and variable and not a persistent condition as some early authors believed. Playas in Australia, Iran, and the United States show that saline efflorescence is removed following surface water dissolution and subsequent deflation, resulting in very hard crusts. Magadiite, a hydrous sodium silicate and possible precursor of bedded chert, was first discovered in North America at Alkali Lake, Oregon, during a military project. Pleistocene Lake Trinity, a small and mostly buried evaporite basin in the northern Jornada del Muerto, New Mexico, was discovered during exploratory drilling in support of a military test program. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), operated by the U.S. Department of Energy, has underground cavern storage of -600 million barrels of crude oil in five Gulf Coast salt domes. The geologic characterization of the SPR sites is a major component of these comprehensive engineered works-unparalleled in modern times and on a comparable scale with the Panama Canal.

So, it does not depend on the amount of a single component (for example, the activity of a particular enzyme). In particular, there is a multitude of factors affecting the activity of the enzymes involved, with pH, ions, coenzymes, and metabolite effectors modulating the activity of every enzyme studied thus far. The role of metabolite transport in the cell, particularly between chloroplast and cytosol, but also to and from mitochondria, vacuole, and other organelles, is now considered to be fundamental to the regulation of photosynthesis. This chapter looks at the factors considered to be of major importance in the determination of the nature of the products of photosynthesis, and at the partition of carbon and energy between sucrose and starch. The chapter discusses the reductive pentose phosphate pathway, the chloroplast as a transporting organelle, the control of carbohydrate metabolism, regulation of the ADPGlc pathway in the chloroplast, starch synthesis in young leaves, and synthesis of starch and sucrose in C4 plants. There are notes on the regulation of starch synthesis in C4 plants and starch in cam plants. There are details on the three phases of Benson-Calvin cycle. Autocatalysis is a crucial property of the reductive pentose phosphate pathway (RPPP). The product, triose phosphate, can be recycled, generating more substrate for carboxylation. If the cycle turns over five times, the amount of the primary acceptor, Ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate (RuBP), doubles. Some of the triose phosphate available for product synthesis is transported into the cytosol and converted into sucrose. The choloroplast keeps a delicate balance among recycling, export, and internal storage. The availability of mutant and transgenic plants now facilitates the study of how plant metabolism is controlled. © 1998, Elsevier Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023101261

Experimental observation of significant cracking of the Lill during cooling mitigates the first of these issues by providing a leakage path into the interior void as melting occurs at the salt-containment interface, thus allowing use of thin shells.

A developmental heat pipe element was constructed that contains axial arteries and a distribution wick connecting the toluene heater and the TES units to the solar insolation surface of the heat pipe. Tests were conducted to demonstrate the heat pipe, TES units, and the heater tube operation. The heat pipe element was operated at design input power of 4.8 kW. Thermal cycle tests were conducted to demonstrate the successful charge and discharge of the TES units. Axial power flux levels up to 15 watts/cm2 were demonstrated and transient tests were conducted on the heat pipe element. Details of the heat pipe development and test procedures are presented. © American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., 1988.

The proposed DVR restores the end-user voltage to its normal level by rapidly injecting a compensating voltage onto the line against the upstream power disturbances. The control strategy has adopted the concept of reference voltage tracking control. A control law is derived to maintain the downstream voltage in a pure sinusoidal waveshape with constant amplitude, no matter what kind of upstream power disturbances occur. Test results on 230 V mains are presented to demonstrate that the Cryo-MOSFET can be used as the power switching device for the converter, and to validate the control strategy.

TES-2 originally flew with TES-1 as part of the OAST-2 Hitchhiker payload on the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS- 62) in early 1994. The two experiments, TES-1 and TES-2 were identical except for the fluoride salts to be characterized. TES-1 provided data on lithium fluoride (LiF), TES-2 provided data on a fluoride eutectic (LiF/CaF2). Each experiment was a complex autonomous payload in a Get-Away-Special payload canister. TES-1 operated flawlessly for 22 hours. Results were reported in a paper entitled, Effect of Microgravity on Materials Undergoing Melting and Freezing -- The TES Experiment, by David Namkoong et al. A software failure in TES-2 caused its shutdown after 4 seconds of operation. TES-1 & 2 were the first experiments in a four experiment suite designed to provide data for understanding the long duration microgravity behavior of thermal energy storage salts that undergo repeated melting and freezing. Such data have never been obtained before and have direct application for the development of space-based solar dynamic (SD) power systems. These power systems will store energy in a thermal energy salt such as lithium fluoride or a eutectic of lithium fluoride/calcium difluoride. The stored energy is extracted during the shade portion of the orbit. This enables the solar dynamic power system to provide constant electrical power over the entire orbit. Analytical computer codes were developed for predicting performance of a space-based solar dynamic power system. Experimental verification of the analytical predictions were needed prior to using the analytical results for future space power design applications. The four TES flight experiments were to be used to obtain the needed experimental data. This paper will address the flight results from the first and second experiments, TES-1 & 2, in comparison to the predicted results from the Thermal Energy Storage Simulation (TESSIM) analytical computer code. An analysis of the TES-2 data was conducted by Cleveland State University Professor, Mounir Ibrahim. TESSIM validation was based on two types of results; temperature history of various points on the containment vessel and TES material distribution within the vessel upon return from flight. The TESSIM prediction showed close comparison with the flight data. Distribution of the TES material within the vessel was obtained by a tomography imaging process. The frozen TES material was concentrated toward the colder end of the canister. The TESSIM prediction indicated a similar pattern. With agreement between TESSIM and the flight data, a computerized representation was produced to show the movement and behavior of the void during the entire melting and freezing cycles. © 1997, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Aerospace engineering; Diffusers (optical); Energy storage; Eutectics; Flight simulators; Fluorine compounds; Forecasting; Freezing; Heat storage; Lithium; Melting; Microgravity; Microgravity processing; Orbits; Salts; Space shuttles; Spacecraft power supplies; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Analytical predictions; Analytical results; Cleveland State University; Experimental verification; Material distribution; Space shuttle Columbia; Temperature history; Tomography imaging; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983122050

Size and weight constraints require that the energy and power densities of the source be as large as possible. Chemical double-layer (CDL) capacitor technology offers an excellent combination of the desirable energy and power density characteristics required in a source for these applications. For most actuation systems, the actuation process is typically pulsed with high peak-power requirements but with relatively modest average power levels. The power-time requirements for electrical actuators are characteristic of pulsed power technologies where the prime source is sized for the average power levels while an intermediate store provides the capability to achieve the peak requirements. Among the options for the power source are battery systems, capacitor systems or battery-capacitor hybrid systems. A battery-capacitor hybrid system uses the battery to supply the average power and the capacitor to meet the peak demands. Prior work has demonstrated that the hybrid power source results in a lighter weight power system (approximately 60% mass savings are realizable) while minimizing the voltage sag during the actuation pulse. While, in general, it is not possible to optimize both power and energy parameters simultaneously, the composite electrode structure developed at Auburn University, when used to construct chemical double layer capacitors, offers an excellent combination of the desirable energy and power density characteristics required in a source for these applications. The research effort described here focused on developing the procedures to form a sinter-bond between aluminum fibers in a carbon/aluminum composite electrode structure. The successful completion of this task enables the use of organic electrolytes in capacitors made using the composite electrode structure. Thereby increasing the energy storage density of the capacitor since it can operate at approximately three volts per cell as opposed to the approximately one volt per cell with the aqueous electrolytes currently being used in such capacitors. By increasing the energy density of the CDL the weight of the hybrid source will be lower offering more weight savings than that of a conventional source alone. © 1998, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Low loss performance of magnetic bearings in aerospace equipment such as jet engines and flywheel energy storage systems is especially critical. Two basic magnetic bearing designs are employed in industrial practice today: the homopolar design, where the flux paths are of a mixed radial/axial orientation, and the heteropolar design, where the flux paths are primarily radial in nature. The stator geometry and flux path of a specific bearing can have a significant effect on the rotor losses. This paper describes the detailed measurement of rotor losses for experimentally comparable homopolar and heteropolar designs. The two test bearing configurations are identical except for geometric features that determine the direction of the flux path. Both test bearing designs have the same air gap length, tip clearance ratio, surface area under the poles, and bias flux levels. An experimental test apparatus was used where run down tests were performed on a test rotor with both bearing designs to measure power losses. Numerous test runs where made for each bearing configuration by running multiple levels of flux density. The components of the overall measured power loss, due to hysteresis, eddy currents, and windage, were determined based on theoretical expressions for power loss. It was found that the homopolar bearing had significantly lower power losses than the heteropolar bearing.

The idea behind this proposal is to overcome the major drawbacks of the previous solution (large oxygen consumption and re-design of the gas turbine unit), by means of a semiclosed cycle using air as the oxidizer. Consequently, combustion gases are largely diluted by nitrogen and cannot be simply compressed to produce liquefied CO2 for storage or disposal. However, CO2 concentration remains high enough to make separation possible by a physical absorption process. It requires a re-pressurization of the flow subtracted from the cycle, with relevant consequences on the plant energy balance. The configuration and the thermodynamic performance of this plant concept are extensively addressed in the paper. As in the first part, the influence of the pressure ratio is discussed, but values similar to the ones adopted in commercial heavy-duty machines provide here acceptable performance. Proper attention was paid to the impact of the absorption process on the energy consumption. The resulting net overall efficiency is again in the 38-39 % range, with assumptions fully comparable to the ones of Part A. Finally, we demonstrated that the present scheme enables the use of unmodified machines, but large additional equipment is required for exhausts treatment and CO2 separation.

In particular, within the thriving family of liquid fuels, the class of volatile products opens interesting prospects for clean and efficient power generation in CCGT plants. Therefore, it has become a necessity for the gas turbine industry to extensively evaluate such new fuel candidates, among which: naphtha's; kerosines; gas condensates; Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) and alcohols are the most prominent representatives. From a technical standpoint, the success of such projects requires both a careful approach to several specific issues (eg: fuel handling & storage, operation safety) and a clear identification of technological limits. For instance, while the purity of gas condensates meets the requirements of heavy-duty technologies, it generally appears unsuitable for aeroderivative machines. This paper offers a succinct but comprehensive technical approach and overviews some experience acquired in this area with heavy duty gas turbines. Its aim is to inform gas turbine users/engineers and project developers who envisage volatile fuels as alternative primary energies in gas turbine plants.

Catalytic shift reactors convert most of the CO b the syngas into CO2, which is subsequently removed by physical absorption and then compressed to make it suitable for transport and permanent storage. Energy balances, performance and cost of electricity are evaluated for two plants based on a Texaco gasifier and a large, heavy-duty gas turbine giving an overall IGCC power output between 350 and 400 MW. In one plant the raw syngas exiting the gasifier is cooled in a high-temperature, radiative cooler; in the other it is quenched by the injection of liquid water. With respect to ""conventional"" Texaco IGCCs, the reduction of specific CO2 emissions by 90% reduces LHV efficiency from 5 to 7 percentage points and increases the cost of electricity of about 45%.

With these improvements, CHAT will provide an alternative approach to achieving the goals of the Department of Energy's Advanced Turbine Systems (ATS) project of a 60% thermal cycle efficiency for natural gas fired combined cycle power plants. The traditional approach to increasing the efficiency of simple cycle and combined cycle power plants was to increase the firing temperature and pressure of the basic Brayton cycle. However, every increase in the CT firing temperature required progressively higher development cost, associated with new materials and cooling techniques, and increased NOx control challenges. CHAT is a gas turbine based cycle with intercooling, reheat, recuperation and humidification. It is based upon the integration of an existing design heavy duty combustion turbine with an additional high pressure shaft comprised of industrial compressors and expander. The current CHAT plant design includes an HP expander inlet temperature of 871 C (1600 F), which represents the level of the combustion turbine technology of the late 1960's - early-1970's. The expander on the power generation shaft (LP) is based upon current combustion turbine technology with turbine inlet temperature of 1400 C (2550 F). One of the most effective ways to increase the CHAT plant efficiency is to increase the HP expander inlet temperature. By increasing this temperature to a relatively low 1150 C (2100 F), and maintaining the current inlet temperatures on the LP expander, the CHAT plant could achieve the ATS program target efficiency. The paper presents the current CHAT plant's performance and cost characteristics, and the initial findings of a project co-sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and Energy Storage and Power Consultants, (ESPC) for the development of an HP expander with increased inlet temperatures.

Options available today can help reduce emissions at relatively little overall cost but may be able to achieve only moderate reductions. If it becomes necessary to reduce emissions ñuther, it is likely there will be opportunities for new technologies as well as making greater use of existing ones. Bearing in mind the time required to develop and deploy new energy supply technologies on a large-scale, it is only sensible to adopt a precautionary stance. This requires better understanding of the potential of technologies not yet in widespread use and stimulation of the development and deployment of promising ones. The IEA Greenhouse Gas RM) Programme is working to improve understanding of technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. This is an example of effective co-operative action between different countries and industries. Membership is worldwide; through this work, members are able to learn about new technologies and share experiences. This paper reviews the work of the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme. The established options for reducing emissions include improving energy efficiency, substitution of lower-caibon fuels for high-carbon fuels, and introduction of alternative energy sources. If deep reductions in emissions are required, discussion tends to focus on alternatives to fossil fuels even though the latter provide a veiy large proportion of the energy used today. To avoid disruptive changes, the world will need to be able to continue using fossil fuels but in a climate-friendly way. Capture and storage of caibon dioxide could deliver deep reductions in emissions from fossil fuels but the technology is still in its infancy - this is the subject of on-going work by the IEA Greenhouse Gas RM) Programme. Enhancement of natural sinks, such as forests, could also help by sequestering atmospheric caibon dioxide. Use of biomass for power generation has also been examined to see how it compares as a large-scale mitigation option compared with capture and storage. Methane is another important greenhouse gas, produced by many human activities. Technology can help reduce emissions of methane; examples of some of these technologies will be described. The mechanism of Activities Implemented Jointly is potentially important for application of all of these options and the Greenhouse Gas Programme is working to improving understanding about viable options and methods of delivering successful projects.

Cartesian grid methods are potentially the most suitable numerical methods for LES because of its economical storage requirement, less computational effort per computational cell, fast numerical convergence and feasibility for constructing higher order finite difference schemes. An uniform Cartesian grid with high order interpolations is employed to handle the curved walls. The small cell limitation on the time steps is remedied by using an implicit scheme based on an efficient Multi-Grid (MG) acceleration method and local grid refinement technique. Application of the numerical method to LES of isothermal and reactive flows shows that the low order piecewise constant wall approximation affects the energy flux in the cascade near the walls. This affects the overall turbulence level and even affects the mean of the whole flow field. Numerical experiments show that 3rd order Lagrangian interpolation near the walls results in a stable LES, while higher order interpolations may trigger numerical instability. ©1998 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

GAT is an organic salt with a high percentage of nitrogen. It was selected because of the high energy content and low heat of degradation. GAT was mixed with the standard hybrid rocket fuel, Hydroxyl- Terminated Polybutadiene (HTPB), in concentrations of 15%, 20%, 25% and 30% by mass. It was found that GAT reacts with the normal HTPB curative, N100. Therefore, an alternative curative, PAPI, was used. The PAPI induced a rapid polymerization, which made casting the fuel grains more difficult. However, once the fuel grams were cured, no special care was needed for storage or firing. The fuel grains with the GAT additive were fired for 3 second runs with oxygen flows of 0.04, 0.06, 0.08. 0.10 and 0.12 Ibm/sec.

The results (a,b) for each mass concentration are: for 15% a=0.099 b=0.435; for 20% a=0.113 b=0.416; for 25% a=0.107 b=0.418; for 30% a=0.156 b=0.559. GAT is found to increase the regression rate of HTPB when it is used as an additive. The resultant pressure and thrust from firing even the highest GAT concentrations at high oxygen flows still remained within safe operating parameters of the UALR hybrid rocketmotor facility. AminoGuanidinium Azo-Tetrazolate (AGAT), a homologue of GAT, was also investigated as a fuel additive. Results for the AGAT study are presented in a separate paper1. © 1998 by M. K.

These mechanisms gain their bistable behavior from the energy stored in the flexible segments which deflect to allow mechanism motion. This approach integrates desired mechanism motion and energy storage to create bistable mechanisms with dramatically reduced part count compared to traditional mechanisms incorporating rigid links, joints, and springs. This paper briefly reviews bistable mechanism theory, introduces some additional bistable mechanism characteristics, and integrates this theory with compliant mechanism theory. The resulting theory of bistable compliant mechanisms is validated by measuring the force and motion characteristics of several test mechanisms and comparing them to predicted values. © 1998 by ASME.",,"Compliant mechanisms; Energy storage; Bistable mechanisms; Bistables; Flexible segments; Mechanism motions; Motion characteristics; Reduced part count; Rigid links; Mechanisms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963539516

Recent developments as well as upcoming standards like MPEG-4, use not images but so-called video objects having an arbitrary shape. The contour of this shape has to be transmitted and therefore compressed as well. In mobile video communication transmission errors and loss of data will occur and this means that the compression has to be error-robust. This paper discusses the errorrobustness of a technique for contour coding using polar coordinates and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The recently proposed [11] polar technique transforms the Cartesian x and y contour coordinate functions to the domain of polar coordinates yielding an r and a φ function. Subsequently these functions are transformed using a DCT and quantised. We investigate the impact of not-received DCT coefficients on the reconstructed intra- and intercoded contours. When inter-coding, the contour with respect to which the current contour is coded, is composed of a weighed sum of N previous contours to reduce the impact of errors. Results show that for intercoded contours, this technique can be considered error-robust, except for errors in the header. For highly compressed intra-coded contours this is only partly so due to the high energy in most of the transmitted coefficients, which have to be well protected like the header of the contour information. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.",,"Bandwidth compression; Codes (symbols); Coding errors; Computer graphics; Digital storage; Errors; Image coding; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Multimedia services; Multimedia systems; Contour information; Coordinate functions; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Mobile video communication; Polar coordinate; Storage capacity; Transmission error; Transmitted coefficient; Discrete cosine transforms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957637416

It has gained momentum over the last decade owing to the accelerated increase in loads sensitive to service quality, e.g. computers, industrial drives, communications and medical equipment, etc. From the PQ perspective, these loads are quite perverse since they are not only sensitive to poor service quality but are also responsible for affecting adversely the quality of power supply. To aggravate matters, a wide range of so-called energy saving devices are being installed, quite sparingly, throughout the low voltage distribution network; inside the customers' premises. These are power electronics-based devices, which, once installed, will actually reduce the kWh consumption of the load to which the energy saving device is attached. However, the downside of this energy saving measure is that such devices achieve their objective at the expense of generating very considerable waveform distortion. In order to characterise the waveforms resulting from the operation of energy saving devices, these authors have developed a digital data acquisition system suitable for monitoring voltage and current waveforms and associated harmonic information over long time spans. A selection of PQ measurements carried out in circuit buildings containing energy saving devices is presented. © 1998 IEEE.","Data Acquisition; Energv Saving; Power Quality","Data acquisition; Digital devices; Digital storage; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Harmonic analysis; Power quality; Quality of service; Voltage distribution measurement; Digital data acquisitions; Energv Saving; Energy-saving devices; Energy-saving measures; Low voltage distribution network; Quality of power supply; Voltage and current waveforms; Waveform distortions; Energy conservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950156194

Four full-size exterior envelope test specimens, two opaque wall systems and two fenestration systems, were built for determining simultaneous conductive and convective heat loss. The two opaque clear wall sections were metal-faced sandwich panel and cold formed steel frame. The steel frame system was a conventional lightweight cold formed steel-framed wall tested before and after foam air-sealing in the cavity prior to installing conventional fiberglass batts. The second opaque wall system was a metal panel system, which is used for commercial cold storage facilities as well as exterior curtain walls for multifamily residential and commercial buildings. The window systems were tested for energy loss both with and without the addition of storm windows. The measurements were made in a specially modified guarded hot box that can maintain both heat and mass flow across the test specimen. Thus, both heat and mass flow were measured. A proposed methodology for taking data from hot box tests and deriving a simple design tool suitable for inclusion in a simplified prediction tool (instrument) is presented, and the methodology is tested with data from the hot box measurements. Further envelope tests will be required since the limited number of systems tested are not sufficient to confirm the applicability of the proposed methodology. At this time the method has only been applied to a few different types of windows. The paper concludes that the methodology developed for quantifying the airtightness for windows is promising and proposes that additional opaque wall details be laboratory tested and the methodology expanded to the entire exterior envelope. © 1998 American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).

On a DC bus many energy sources and storage systems can be easily coupled in parallel and an electronic DC/AC converter can feed the AC grid in optimum conditions. In such a system an internal-combustion engine (ICE) can be used as an energy source and the ICE does not have to run at a speed synchronized with the AC grid frequency. At low load it will be better to run the ICE at low speed. For building a cost-effective and energy-efficient system it is important to make use of off the shelf components with minor modifications and to know their energy efficiency. These efficiencies are difficult to calculate and hard to find. Therefore a test set up was built for accurate efficiency measurements. This paper includes a trade off and research results for different topologies. For the experiments a three phase synchronous generator with brushless excitation system was used, only the field excitation control system was replaced and modified. Different types of rectifiers are evaluated: a diode rectifier with DC voltage feed back control to the field excitation, a constant AC voltage regulator with thyristor rectifier and finally an active boost rectifier with IGBTs. The efficiency of a diesel engine was measured in the torque versus speed plane. The results show that with a variable load a generation system with common DC bus can increase system efficiency. The results are useful for evaluating new concepts for renewable energy systems, mobile generating sets, cogeneration systems, hybrid vehicle traction and variable-speed windmills. © 1998 IEEE.",,"Combustion; Cost effectiveness; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Flight control systems; Hybrid vehicles; Ice; Power electronics; Rectifying circuits; Speed; Synchronous generators; Voltage regulators; Wind power; Ac voltage regulators; Brushless excitation system; Cogeneration systems; Efficiency measurement; Energy efficient systems; Off-the-shelf components; Renewable energy systems; Thyristor rectifier; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885275165

With this aim a modified, closed, mound culture system is operating in Geisenheim. The soil surface in the glasshouse is covered with a plastic sheet and substrate is heaped in the form of mounds. Vegetable transplants were planted out into the substrate mounds and supplied with water and nutrients by drip irrigation. In order to determine the exact time of irrigation and the amount of water required, substrate humidity or alternatively the solar radiation energy were measured. The amount of fertigation was limited by the water storage capacity of the substrate mound. The mound system can be used for many kinds of vegetables and is demonstrated here in trials with sweet pepper. Cultivation of sweet pepper in substrate mounds is compared to cultivation in thin-layer culture. Trials showed significantly higher yields under mound cultivation. The advantages of mound culture include more efficient water and nutrient distribution. The effects of water management were investigated. Scheduling was determined in the one case by soil moisture measurement and in the other by the amount of solar radiation. Best yields were obtained when using nominal deficits that corresponded with the largest possible supply of water and nutrients determined by the substrate's water storage capacity. No waste water results as irrigation is limited by demand. Hence, there is no need to disinfect or recirculate the nutrient solution in mound systems. The mound systems allows environmentally friendly cultivation of sweet pepper in glasshouses. Leaching of nutrients and pollution of ground water can be prevented.

It is shown that an inductive storage system capable of storing energy equal to the nominal power times two seconds results in a considerable reduction of power variation. The same storage is also sufficient to keep the WT running during the period of clearance of a fault in the grid. This may be of importance for the dynamic behaviour of power systems with significant wind power penetration. © 1998 IEEE.","Energy Storage; Power Quality; Windturbines","AC-AC power converters; Energy storage; Power quality; Wind power; Wind turbines; Ac power; Dynamic behaviours; Inductive storage; Inductive storage systems; Power variations; Variable power; Wind power penetration; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876548171

Strong magnetic field is very favorable for SMES because it promises a compact device. However, the huge electromagnetic forces caused by strong magnetic fields and coil current becomes a serious problem. We propose the Force-balanced Coil (FBC) concept for the SMES which drastically reduces the huge centering forces by balancing it with the hoop forces induced by the toroidal current. Superconductor stress, length, maximum field and stored energy were surveyed. The results were compared with the toroidal type configuration and ordinary helical type one, It is shown that Force-balanced Coil is more compact than the others in view point of electromagnetic force and per-unit length stored energy of the superconductor and has a potential for simplifying the supporting structure, making the facility compact. © 1998, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

It is impossible to examine a control strategy for levelling load power fluctuation using a SMES, because we can not realize a large capacity of SMES. So we build a SMES simulator as a trial that operates coordinately as a superconductive coil. In this paper, a superconductive coil composed of a coil and a inverter curcuit is realized by numerical expression and experiment. The contorol strategy based on an auto-tuning of scailing factors with neural network can realize levelling the fluctuating active power and compensating the reactive power using the SMES simulator.

At intermediate C1- concentrations, e.g., 0.028-0.4 M, the repassivation potential of alloy 625 is greater than that for alloy 825 and is dependent on the C1- concentration.

Although high energy ball milling is a useful technique to produce new metastable nanocrystalline alloys, the specific surface of these materials is usually less than 1m2/g due to cold welding of particles during the milling process. Nanophase materials prepared by the gas phase condensation technique do not have this drawback and their typical specific surfaces are usually of the order of 40-50m2/g. However, this fabrication technique does not allow fine adjustment of the chemical composition as in the case of ball milling. In this paper, we will describe new methods to increase the specific surface of ball milled nanocomposites and nanocrystalline alloys. These methods have been applied to improve the properties of hydrogen storage materials (nanocrystalline metal hydrides) and electrode materials for fuel cells.","Ball milling; Fuel cells; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Leaching; Nanocrystalline alloys; Porous","Ball milling; Condensation; Fuel cells; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Leaching; Mechanical alloying; Porous materials; Gas phase condensation; Hydrogen storage materials; Nanostructured materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843126540

However, most of these publications do not treat the critical case of loads changing abruptly from generating to consuming and vice versa without prior notice. Control algorithms well suited for handling passive loads may lead to instabilities in case of generating loads. The paper discusses this issue on the basis of a three-phase system containing a parallel compensator (shunt controlled filter). The control of the filter is based on the calculation of an equivalent conductance according to the so-called FBD-method. In the basic version the control scheme may lead to instability in case of generating loads. Simple countermeasures preventing instability are analysed theoretically and verified using simulations. Additionally a modified algorithm for the calculation of the equivalent conductance is described, which considerably reduces the required energy storage capability of the compensator in the worst case of stepwise changes of the load power. © 1998 IEEE.",,"Control schemes; Critical case; Modified algorithms; Parallel compensators; Power compensators; Stability problem; Storage capability; Three phase system",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843072619

At all locations, 14C-GBT was rapidly taken up into particulate material (&gt;0.2 μm). Formalin treatment, autoclaving, or prefiltration of water through 0.2-μm membranes completely inhibited 14C-GBT uptake, indicating the process was biologically mediated, probably by bacteria. During the first several hours of uptake, &gt;80% of the label found in particulates was recovered as untransformed 14C-GBT. This fraction diminished over longer incubations but never fell below 16%, indicating some longer term storage of GBT in microorganisms. Respiration of the added label to 14CO2 was typically &lt;5% of the total uptake during 5-10-min incubations but increased to approximately 40-60% after 24-48 h. Increasing the salinity of an estuarine water tiltrate culture from 14 to 25 or 35 resulted in greater retention of 14C-GBT in particulates and less production of 14CO2, suggesting that GBT may be used as an osmolyte by microorganisms. Uptake, retention, and degradation patterns were similar in &lt;0.8-μm filtrates and whole seawater, and size fractionation experiments showed that most GBT uptake was by organisms of &lt;1 μm, suggesting bacteria as the microbes most likely responsible for GBT uptake. Uptake rates followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with saturation at &lt;20 nM added GBT in most cases and K(t) + S(n) values ranging from 1.2 to 49 nM. Turnover times for S(n) were short, ranging from 0.52 to 11 h.

GBT uptake displayed temperature optima from 20°C to 30°C, with optima close to the in situ temperature on the day of sample collection. Together, the results indicate that nanomolar levels of GBT are rapidly scavenged by seawater microorganisms for use as an osmolyte or carbon and energy source. The relative proportion of retention vs. degradation is likely to depend on the composition of the microbial community and environmental factors such as osmotic stress and the availability of alternative osmotic or carbon and energy substrates.",,"biological uptake; glycine betaine; microorganism; organic compound; seawater; Alabama; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Maine; Gulf of Mexico; Mobile Bay; United States; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3743153091

Several mechanisms have been suggested, e.g, strain induced boundary migration (SIBM) and ordinary nucleation of recrystallisation by growth of highly misoriented subgrains. The objective of the present work was to give some insight on the formation and characteristics of such boundary zones. Substructure evolution nearby pre-exsisting grain boundaries was studied as a function of orientation differences or Taylor factor differences between neighbouring grains and of pre-deformation grain size, i.e., amount of shear deformation (grain boundary sliding) occuring in grain boundary areas. Slabs of high purity aluminium with different initial grain sizes were cold rolled to strains of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0. The substructure, i.e., subgrain size and sub-boundary misorientation, were measured along grain boundaries with different orientation relationships and in the interior of the neighbouring grains. It was observed that the misorientations between subgrains were larger in the grain boundary regions than in the interior of the grains. The high misorientations and high stored energy in the grain boundary regions makes them preferential as nucleation sites for recrystallised grains. This was also shown indirectly by the fact that smaller initial grain size leads to smaller recrystallised grains in samples deformed to identical deformation strains.","Deformation; Local Texture; Misorientation","Cold rolling; Crystal orientation; Energy storage; Grain boundaries; Grain size and shape; Nucleation; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Shear deformation; Strain; Textures; Taylor factor; Aluminum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3743125054

A secondary recovery scheme of gas re-injection into the original gas cap was initiated to maintain reservoir energy and minimise pressure decline. Hence accurate detection of gas movement is very critical. Several difficulties to monitor gas-oil contacts were encountered in a considerable number of wells. Some of these difficulties were, gas channelling behind the casing, gas coning, wellbore fluid changes, porosity and lithology changes, wellbor fluid invasion into the reservoir and the presence of formation stimulation fluid (HCl). The application of conventional methods using the response of gas indicator curves could result in a false indication of formation gas-oil contacts. This paper discusses the approach adopted in order to determine the gas-oil contact in wells where such problems occur. A database was established including more than 70 TDT runs, open hole log and pressure data of 12 infill wells, and production performance records of all Zeil Bay wells. The approach follows the Polyachenko model of functional relationship between count rates and gas saturation. Several cross plots for the same range of porosity and connate water saturation, e.g. formation capture cross section (SIGM), total selected near detector counts (TSCN), total selected far detector counts (TSCF), the capture cross section of the bore hole (SIBH), and inelastic far detector counts (INFD). Each crossplot gives a definite diagnostic shape around the depth of the formation gas-oil contact. By using these crossplots it would be possible to calculate gas saturation from a stand alone run. The model was validated by RFT and open hole log data from infill wells. Also it was successfully applied in wells which showed an ambiguity in the detected formation gas-oil contact. The field gas-oil contact in Zeit Bay was revised using the results of the model. This revision lead to an accurate definition of the oil leg and to the drilling of three additional wells in the field.

However, the serious problem of huge electromagnetic forces caused by high magnetic fields and large coil current, still remains. Electromagnetic stresses, reaching as much as several hundred bars, thus become a major factor in determining whether a large sized strong magnetic field system could be established. In order to solve this problem, we propose the fo rce-bal anced coil(FBC) concept that reduces the huge centering electromagnetic forces by balancing it with the hoop forces caused by toroidal current. Then we designed and fabricated a small size superconducting FBC system to demonstrate the FBC concept. It was successfully excited up to near rated current. It is shown that the FBC system has a potential for simplifying the supporting structures and making the facility compact. © 1998, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

The basic heat-releasing characteristics and the effects of reactant particle amount and heat recovering condition on the characteristics are studied experimentally. It is found that the electric energy stored as densely as 1.86 MJ/kg-CaO in the form of thermochemical energy is released in the form of thermal energy as cold heat at around 273 K and hot heat at around 500 K. The heat is recovered as cold heat for air-conditioning at around 275 K and hot-water at around 350 K. The total amount of reactant particles should be determined with a balance of heat-loss, although heat releasing is improved by using a shallow bed with a small amount of particles. Furthermore, the recovered heat amount is found to be enlarged because of increased reactivity of reactant particles when the heat-recovering rate is properly controlled.

An application of rotor system, for example, a flywheel energy storage system, is recently focused on. Therefore the analysis of the rotor vibrations at the critical revolution speed still seems to be a substantial topic. In the mechanical engineering field, the dynamical behavior of the rotor is discussed by means of the simplified model, that is Jeffcott rotor. Most of the studies deal with the amplitude of the whirling motion of the rotor under the assumption that the revolution speed of the rotor is regarded as a input. In general, however, the input from a drive (i.g., motor, engin, and so on.) to the rotor is torque. So it seems important to discuss the behavior of the system under the situation that torque is engaged as a input to the rotor. In this paper, a whirling motion in a DC motor-rotor-DC generator system used as a rotor system is experimentally discussed based on the output voltage of the generator. The results show that at the mechanical resonant state, the hunting appears to the revolution speed of the rotor even in the constant input torque situation. Furthermore it is clarified that the output voltage shows quasi-periodicity, multifractal, mode-lock and chaotic oscillations, and the existence of hysteretic jumps at the appearance and the disappearance of the oscillation. © 1998, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

The calculated transient behaviour of the model corresponds well to the measured unit function response of the investigated coil. The coil was designed with respect to the fast repetitive ramping of the SMES. Resonant oscillations are well damped by the mixed matrix Cu/CuNi/NbTi wire used. Due to the high safety margin of the insulation the maximum overvoltages could not endanger the winding.

Box 30197, Nairobi, Kenya","The ever increasing energy demand to match the rapid growths in the industrial, agricultural and other sectors together with the increasing awareness of the environmental problems have led to the search for alternative natural sources of energy like the solar and wind power. There are however large diurnal and seasonal variations in these natural energy resources at some locations, which lowers their utilization potential. Good knowledge of the space-time characteristics of maximum and minimum solar power expectations are crucial in the design of solar energy conversion systems and optimum utilization of available power at any individual location. In this study attempts are made to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of the extreme solar energy values over 40 Kenyan locations using daily maximum and minimum total radiation energy values. The results from the study indicated that the maximum radiation power values were relatively large at most of the locations throughout the year. The maximum values ranged from about 300 to over 400 WM-2. The minimum values were however below 50 WM-2 at some of these locations indicating large diurnal and seasonal ranges between the maximum and minimum power values. The utilization of the large solar power values which have been observed in these regions would therefore require supplementary power sources or power storage facilities for use when the available solar power falls below the rating levels of any solar powered systems which are being used in these locations. It was further observed that while the maximum power values were moderate at certain locations, the diurnal and seasonal ranges were relatively small signifying the stability of the utilization of solar power resources in such areas. The observed time-space characteristics of the maximum and minimum radiation power values can be used to delineate regions of high, moderate, and low solar power potentials in Kenya. These results, can also be used for the optimum planning and development of systems which are dependent on Solar energy resources. The substantial power which is available in the arid and semi arid parts of Kenya should be considered in providing alternative energy resource for new settlements which are increasing significantly in these region. This could minimize severe desertification processes which are linked to the destruction of vegetation for charcoal, wood fuel and other land degradation activities by man. The use of this environmental friendly power source would also minimize the negative impacts which are generally associated with the use of fossil fuels. These are currently some of the major global issues.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042859471

This distinction enables greater variety in how a presentation can be adapted to best convey these underlying concepts in a given situation. What is often confusing for those applying this distinction is that although both levels of structure often share similar components: transformation form the storage of a document to its presentation sometimes occurs directly between these similar components and sometimes does not These similarities typically fall in the categories of space, time and relationships between document portions. This paper identifies some primary similarities between the structure of hypermedia storage and presentation. It also explores how the transformation from storage to presentation often does not follow these similarities. This discussion is illustrated with the Fiets hypermedia application, which addresses the issues of storage, presentation and transformation using public domain formats and tools.

These nonunity power factor linear and nonlinear loads cause low efficiency of the power supply system, poor power factor, destruction of other equipment due to excessive stresses and EMI problems. Active filters have been considered an effective solution to reduce these problems. This paper presents an active power filter (APF) based on a simple control technique to provide reactive power and harmonics compensation for linear and nonlinear single-phase loads. A voltage source inverter with carrierless hysteresis PWM current control is used to form the APF. A simple PI DC bus voltage controller with a reduced energy storage capacitor is employed in the APF. A set of lagging/leading power factor linear loads and a diode rectifier-fed capacitive load and AC voltage regulator-fed inductive load as nonlinear loads are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed APF for reactive power and harmonic compensation.

This extra reactive N is readily transported through the environment, and there is increasing evidence that it is changing ecosystems through eutrophication and acidification. Rothamsted Experimental Station, UK has been involved in research on N cycling in ecosystems since its inception in 1843. Measurements of precipitation composition at Rothamsted, made since 1853, show an increase of nitrate and ammonium N in precipitation from 1 and 3 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively, in 1855 to a maximum of 8 and 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in 1980, decreasing to 4 and 5 kg N ha-1 yr-1 today. Nitrogen inputs via dry deposition do, however, remain high. Recent measurements with diffusion tubes and filter packs show large concentrations of nitrogen dioxide of c. 20 μg m-3 in winter and c. 10 μg m-3 in summer; the difference is linked to the use of central heating, and with variations in wind direction and pollutant source. Concentrations of nitric acid and particulate N exhibit maxima of 1.5 and 2 μg m-3 in summer and winter, respectively. Concentrations of ammonia are small, barely rising above 1 μg m-3. Taking deposition velocities from the literature gives a total deposition of all measured N species to winter cereals of 43.3 kg N ha-1 yr-1, 84% as oxidized species, 79% dry deposited. The fate of this N deposited to the very long-term Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted has been simulated using the SUNDIAL N-cycling model: at equilibrium, after 154 yr of the experiment and with N deposition increasing from c. 10 kg ha-1 yr-1 in 1843 to 45 kg ha-1 yr-1 today, c. 5% is leached, 12% is denitrified, 30% immobilized in the soil organic matter and 53 % taken off in the crop. The 'efficiency of use' of the deposited N decreases, and losses and immobilization increase as the amount of fertilizer N increases. The deposited N itself, and the acidification that is associated with it (from the nitric acid, ammonia and ammonium), has reduced the number of plant species on the 140-yr-old Park Grass hay meadow. It has also reduced methane oxidation rates in soil by c. 15 % under arable land and 30 % under woodland, and has caused N saturation of local woodland ecosystems: nitrous oxide emission rates of up to 1.4 kg ha-1 yr-1 are equivalent to those from arable land receiving &gt; 200 kg N ha-1 yr-1, and in proportion to the excess N deposited; measurements of N cycling processes and pools using 15N pool dilution techniques show a large nitrate pool and enhanced rates of nitrification relative to immobilization. Ratios of gross nitrification: gross immobilization might prove to be good indices of N saturation.","Air pollution; Atmospheric deposition; Mineralization; Nitrification; Nitrogen cycling; Trace gas fluxes","nitrification; nitrogen metabolism; soil degradation; United Kingdom; acidification; eutrophication; nitrogen cycling; precipitation; soil process; England; Hertfordshire; Rothamsted; UK",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642676869

The fluorosensors are based on ion pairs composed of an inert fluorophore and a pH-sensitive absorber dye and are embedded in sol-gel glass. Upon exposure to ammonia, deprotonation of the pH-sensitive dye bromophenolblue occurrs, and consequently, energy is transferred from the fluorophore rhodamine B or tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester to the absorber. The response of the fluorosensors using different ratios of precursors, such as tetramethoxysilane and phenyltrimethoxysilane, is investigated. Detection limits for sol-gel layers composed of 50% tetramethoxysilane and 50% phenyltrimethoxysilane are as low as 0.1 mg/L of aqueous ammonia. Response times are of the order of 3 to 6 min for forward response. The reversibility of the sensor is related to the composition of the organically modified sol-gel glasses and is fastest for sensor layers composed of pure phenyltrimethoxysilane.

Exposure of barley leaves to 45 °C in low light induced a rapid and complete disruption of the O2-evolving complex of PSII, as shown by the suppression of the photobaric component of the photoacoustic signal. The photoacoustically measured loss of O2 evolution during heat stress (i) was confirmed by polarographic measurements of O2 exchange by the leaf samples, (ii) was shown to be independent of the activity of the carbonic anhydrase, and (iii) was not correlated with a concomitant suppression of the photochemical energy storage and the electron transport activity of PSII. The maintenance of a significant PSII photochemical activity in the absence of O2 evolution is indicative of cyclic electron transport around PSII which bypasses the O2-evolving complex. The modulation-frequency dependence of the energy stored during cyclic PSII activity, its inhibition by the herbicide diuron, and its insensitivity to the plastoquinol antagonist DBMIB (2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone) indicated that QB, the secondary electron acceptor of PSII, is involved in the electron cycle and that the rate-limiting step of the cycle is a reaction with a half-time of ca. 1.5 ms. In the absence of heat stress, overreduction of the plastoquinone pool by strong illumination or by leaf infiltration with DBMIB was not sufficient to induce appreciable cyclic electron transport around PSII. The electron cycle was insensitive to preferential excitation of carotenoids with a blue-green light and was not significantly affected by the operation of the xanthophyll cycle. Interruption of the electron cycle by diuron during prolonged heat treatment in moderate light was accompanied by a marked peroxidation of the chloroplast thylakoid membranes, as revealed by the appearance of chlorophyll thermoluminescence bands in the temperature range 70-120 °C, demonstrating the photoprotective function of electron cycling around PSII.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22444452637

We considered neutron-star masses, radii, and accretion rates HJ in the ranges 0.1-2.8 Mȯ, 7-150 km, and 1010-1016 g s-1, respectively. We also investigated the effects of variations in in resulting from periodic passages of the neutron star through the Galactic midplane and/or occasional encounters with molecular clouds. We found, consistent with earlier work, that pycnonuclear reactions lead to the development of density inversions in the crust; the strongest inversions (of order 2% in density), which occur at the interface between 16C and heavier nuclei, store ∼1041 ergs of gravitational potential energy. If an instability can trigger the overturn of such an inversion, the released energy would ignite a powerful thermonuclear flash, and the resulting starquake might result in magnetospheric effects that lead to the emission of a γ-ray burst or other energetic astrophysical phenomenon. Although the isotropy of the distribution of γ-ray burst sources, as determined by the BATSE experiment, precludes the possibility that all γ-ray bursts are associated with neutron stars in the Galactic disk, it remains possible that a subset of the observed bursts have their origin in events of this type. From our calculations, we determined that the total nuclear energy that can be stored in the crust of a neutron star is limited by the 16C + 16C pycnonuclear reaction, which converts the accreted material at a density of ∼5 × 1010 g cm~3 into nuclei substantially closer to nuclear equilibrium. As a result, the total (nuclear plus gravitational) energy, that can be stored is quite generally limited to less than ~ 1046 ergs, irrespective of neutron-star mass, radius, mean m, or variations in m. For H'J = 1010 g s1, it takes ~1010 yr for maximum energy storage to be achieved; for higher accretion rates, the required time decreases very nearly as m1. For H'J 3 x 1015 g s1, thermonuclear flashes in the helium shell greatly reduce. Irrespective of the y-ray burst emission mechanism, the upper limit that we have obtained on tot places a strong constraint on any model that ascribes a subset of y-ray bursts to the emission of energy stored in the crusts of neutron stars. Our results are also relevant to any other energetic celestial phenomenon that might be associated with a Galactic-disk population of isolated neutron stars. © 1998.

Energy is required not only to accelerate the ejected mass, but also to lift it against solar gravity and, additionally, to open the coronal magnetic field. That energy is widely believed to be magnetic. However, a considerable body of research shows that energy stored in force-free magnetic arcades is sufficient only to open the field. Thus a magnetic explanation for coronal mass ejections involving simple magnetic arcades must include cross-field currents and therefore thermal pressure gradients. But in such models, the addition of crossfield currents can result in a large negative gravitational energy whose magnitude exceeds that of the available magnetic energy. The model corona then becomes more tightly bound to the Sun and is thus a poor candidate for the pre-CME coronal state. This paper introduces more complicated coronal pressure and density profiles that model the observed structure of the coronal helmet streamers in which most CMEs originate. In particular, our model includes a relatively low-density polar corona, a higher density arcade corresponding to the streamer helmet, and a low-density cavity in the equatorial region underlying the helmet. Solution of the resulting nonlinear equation for the pre-CME corona shows that it is indeed possible to build up net positive energy in excess of that needed to propel and lift the associated excess mass. Assuming that force-free currents (which are not included here) store sufficient energy to open the magnetic field, our results provide viable models for energy storage in the pre-CME corona. © 1998.

The impacts of both diffusion and reaction on biocatalyst efficiency were determined to enable prediction and optimization of the biocatalyst performance. The kinetic rate parameters and activation energies of pure OPH, free cell suspensions, and the immobilized cell biocatalyst were compared. Diffusion was a determining factor for paraoxon hydrolysis because of the very rapid OPH kinetics for its model substrate. Both the paraoxon diffusion through the PVA matrix and the diffusion associated with microbial transport of paraoxon were shown to impact the biocatalyst reaction. However, the enhancement in storage stability resulting from diffusional limitations provides an advantage to diffusion-limited operation. This research may serve as a guide to define the influence of diffusion in biological reaction systems. The broad substrate specificity and hydrolytic efficiency of OPH coupled with the ability to genetically engineer the enzyme for specific target OP neurotoxins enhance the suitability of OPH-based technologies for detoxification of these compounds. Cryoimmobilization provides a suitable vehicle as a cost-effective, efficient technology for bioremediation of environmental media contaminated with OP compounds.","Diffusion; Immobilization; Neurotoxins; OPH; Organophosphates; Organophosphorus hydrolase; Polyvinyl alcohol cryogel","Neurotoxins; OPH; Organophosphates; Organophosphorus hydrolase; Polyvinyl alcohol (pva); Activation energy; Bioremediation; Cell immobilization; Detoxification; Environmental technology; Escherichia coli; Genetic engineering; Hydrolases; Polyvinyl alcohols; Radioactive waste vitrification; Diffusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2142642765

A Weibull distribution which was fitted to the pixel failure data indicated a shape parameter of 0.97. An Arrhenius analysis showed that an activation energy of 0.76 eV is driving the aging process. Once such a device-specific degradation was characterized, a lifetime was projected for the FPA. Secondly, it was determined that under certain conditions the FPA was expected to outlive the package it was in. The model developed offered a trade-off tool to pass this 'excess' reliability of the FPA to a more life-limiting component, namely the package, thus increasing the overall product reliability of the FPA-package combination. Thirdly, a relationship between reliability and cost was established which allowed grading the price of individual units based on their expected field reliability, before they leave the factory. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Accelerated life; Activation energy; Dormant; Focal plane arrays (FPA); HgCdTe (MCT); Infrared (IR); Storage life","Life cycle; Reliability; Service life; Weibull distribution; Accelerated life; Infrared focal plane array; Failure analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20944441346

Since the 3,5-CSchE involves the 5-RDM, its solution is indeterminate without N-representability conditions. However, the indeterminacy of the 3,5-CSchE may be removed through a reconstruction strategy for building the 4- and 5-RDMs from the 3-RDM. We present a systematic procedure for obtaining corrections for Valdemoro's reconstruction functionals from two complementary approaches, the particle-hole duality and the theory of cumulants. With the cumulants we are able to demonstrate that we have obtained all terms in the reconstruction functionals which may be written as antisymmetric products of the lower rdms. The cumulants allow us to understand the reconstruction functionals in terms of a renormalized many-body perturbation theory. The reconstruction functionals also lead to a natural generalization of Wick's theorem for evaluating expectation values of fermionic annihilation and creation operators with respect to correlated reference states. Previous work [Phys. Rev. A 57, 4219 (1998)] has explored the determination of correlation energy and 2-RDMs through the 2,4-CSchE, also known as the density equation. Because the reconstruction functionals employed with the 3,5-CSchE depend only on the antisymmetric products of lower RDMs in constrast to those used with the 2,4-CSchE, the 3,5-CSchE method presented here does not require the solution of systems of linear equations during reconstruction or the storage of the reconstructed ROMs. Application of the 3,5-CSchE technique to a quasi-spin model generates ground-state energies and 2-RDMs similar in accuracy to single-double configuration interaction (SDCI). We employ a simple iterative procedure for the solution of the 3,5-CSchE without traditional diagonalization. The CSchE techniques offer an approximate solution of the N-representability problem and a new approach to electron correlation. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Cumulants; Electron correlation; N-representability; Particle-hole duality; Reduced density matrices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642276545

An electrochemical cell has been constructed to measure the equilibrium cell voltages as function of the degree of charging in the temperature range from 278 K to 323 K. The first system studied is the disproportion reaction of VO2+ ions with the two half cell reactions VO2++H2O⇌VO2+2H ++e- and VO2++2H+ + e-⇌V3+ + H2O. The second system is the All-Vanadium battery reaction with the two half cell reactions VO2++H2O⇌VO2++2H ++e- and V3+ + e-⇌V2+. The third system is the disproportion reaction of V3+ ions with the half cell reactions V3++H2O⇌VO2+ + 2H++e- and V3+ +e-⇌V2+. The molar reaction Gibbs energy, the molar reaction enthalpy, and the molar reaction entropy of each system has been obtained from these data. Additionally the molar reaction enthalpy of the two disproportion reactions and of the reaction V2++2VO2+ + 2H+ → 3VO2++H2O has been measured directly by titration calorimetry. The results agree with those obtained from the electrochemical data for the disproportion reactions. No direct calorimetric measurements of the molar reaction enthalpy of the All-Vanadium battery reaction is possible, but the sum of the molar reaction enthalpies of the two disproportion reactions gives the molar reaction enthalpy of the All-Vanadium battery reaction.

Electric Vehicle (EV) is more than just another means of powering the vehicle. But EV requires energy storing system which is one of the concerns of today's EV technology. Batteries are the energy storage means of EV's. Specific energy and specific power of electrochemical batteries are generally much smaller than those of gasoline. Large number of batteries are required to assure a desired level of performance, which leads to increase in the vehicle weight, cost and the degradation of vehicle performance. This paper discusses the battery technology for the electrical vehicles in which discussions are made on the set of criteria including specific energy, specific power, energy efficiency, charging rate, cycle life, operating environmental, cost, recycling and safety. Various advanced batteries recommended for recent EV systems, have been discussed in this paper which gives clear concept and idea of selection of batteries and its associate circuits.

We consider the time-dependent axisymmetric incompressible Poiseuille and extrudate-swell flows of an Oldroyd-B fluid. We assume that slip occurs along the wall of the die following a slip equation which relates the shear stress to the velocity at the wall and exhibits a maximum and a minimum. We first study the stability of the one-dimensional axisymmetric Poiseuille flow by means of a one-dimensional linear stability analysis and time-dependent calculations. The numerically predicted instability regimes agree well with the linear stability ones. The calculations reveal that periodic solutions are obtained when an unstable steady-state is perturbed and that the amplitude and the period of the oscillations are increasing functions of the Weissenberg number. We then continue to numerically solve the time-dependent two-dimensional axisymmetric Poiseuille and extrudate-swell flows using the elastic-viscous split stress method for the integration of the constitutive equation. Again, oscillations are observed in the unstable regime; consequently, the surface of the extrudate is wavy. However, the amplitude and the period of the pressure drop oscillations are considerably smaller than in the one-dimensional flow. The most important phenomenon revealed by our two-dimensional calculations is that the flow in the die is periodic in the axial direction. © 1998 The Society of Rheology.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11644324069

As expected, the microwave small signal performance is much better on semi-insulating substrates (ft = 6 GHz, fmax = 20 GHz) than on conductive ones (ft = 4 GHz and fmax = 10 GHz). Unfortunately, for devices on semi-insulating substrates the drain current continuously decreases with time under DC bias conditions. As a consequence, the RF high power performance is still modest (Pout = 3 W at 2 GHz for a 6mm periphery transistor), even lower than on conductive substrates (Pout = 1,7 W on a 1 mm periphery transistor). Traps, whose location in the bandgap is not clearly identified yet, are probably responsible for this phenomenon.

Two types of carrots, Asian and European, containing large amount of lycopene and β-carotene, respectively, were tested. The dried powder was stored under an atmosphere with O2 and at three different temperatures, 5, 20 and 35°C. The surface colour of the powder was monitored during storage by a Hunter colour ratio a/b. In the proposed model, the rate of oxidation was assumed to be represented by the product of the fraction of concentration of oxidized pigment at arbitrary time and a specific rate of oxidation of pigment. The rate parameters in the proposed model were calculated by fitting the experimental data with smooth curves by trial and error at the end of the induction period but before discolouration took place. The frequency constant and activation energy, expressing the temperature dependence of the rate parameters, were expressed by the Arrhenius relation. The simulation results of a Hunter colour ratio a/b of dried powder at 25°C showed good agreement with the experimental data, suggesting that the proposed model was effective for the prediction of discolouration of dried powder of both types of carrot. The use of the induction period in the manner described may enable the shelf life of dried powder to be predicted. © 1998 Silsoe Research Institute.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11544365666

The damaged pericarp releases latex which causes pericarp hardening, spoils the flesh and shortens the shelf life. In order to maintain good quality, the mangosteens require careful handling in every step from the orchards to the consumer. It is essential to establish the limit of mechanical force or energy allowed in the handling processes. In this study, impact damage in mangosteens was investigated. It was found that the degree of damage can be related to the impact velocity, impact energy and energy absorbed by the fruit. The degree of damage was presented in the terms of the mass of hardened pericarp, damage depth ratio of the pericarp, weight loss and withering of the aril. Two types of packaging materials, the polystyrene foam and card board, were tested for their protective abilities. It was found that the packaging material for the mangosteens should be soft and have low stiffness. Deterioration of damaged mangosteens with storage time was also presented.

We show that in a certain interval of solid angles the photon emission is enhanced several orders of magnitude because of the presence of the thermal bath. Notwithstanding, the overall depolarization induced by the background thermal bath at LEP conditions is much smaller than the one induced by plain acceleration at zero temperature and can be neglected in practical situations.

Major work horses are those derived from polypyridine complexes and metalloporphyrins. The low-lying metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and ligand-centered (π-π*) excited states of these complexes are fairly long-lived to participate in electron transfer processes. The emissive nature and high quantum yields allow development of applications. In this paper we review some of the recent applications of these coordination complexes in photochemical systems for the direct conversion and storage of solar energy. Mesoporous membrane type films with large surface area can be prepared from nanosized colloidal semiconductor dispersions. By suitable molecular engineering, the metal complexes can be readily attached to the surface. These films with anchored complexes are finding increasing use in energy conversion devices such as dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cells, intercalation batteries, optical display and optical sensors. Principles of operation of these optoelectronic devices are reviewed here. Various approaches to anchoring molecules on surfaces are first reviewed followed by an overview of the methods of preparation of mesoporous films. This is followed by a comprehensive discussion of the design details of the dye-sensitized solar cells and associated mechanistic studies.

Carbohydrates have been suggested as the primary substrate mobilized. Analysis of the content of glycogen in adductor muscle of Argopecten purpuratus at different stages of gametogenesis showed an inverse relationship between the content of glycogen in muscular tissue and gonad index. The contents of dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin were measured in the muscle of scallops allowed to proceed with gametogenesis after spawning. These monoamines increased as the gonad attained its complete ripeness. Measurement of cyclic AMP (cAMP) content in the muscle showed a temporal course similar to that of the monoamines. Increases of cAMP levels when muscular tissue was incubated with dopamine were obtained only when gametes were nearly ripe. These results suggest an important role of muscle as a supplier of fuels for gametogenesis, mainly when the process is attaining its completion. It is hypothesized that a point of control of gametogenesis may be through the control of mobilization of substrates that supply energy for this process. This control could be through monoamines, which would increase the levels of cAMP, which in turn would induce the phosphorylation of glycolytic enzymes, increasing the catabolism of substrates.","Adductor muscle; Argopecten purpuratus; Gametogenesis; Reproduction; Scallops","Argopecten purpuratus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345055324

Triplicate groups of salmon parr, initial weight 15 ± 0.5 g , were fed, diets containing 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 13 mg P and 20 KJ of digestible energy (DE) per g of diet (dry matter basis, DMB) to satiation for 16 weeks. The basal diet containing 4 mg P g-1 (0.15 mg available P per KJ DE) was supplemented with graded levels of calcium phosphate, Ca(H2PO4)2·H2O to formulate the eight experimental diets. The fish were reared in fresh water at a temperature of 15°C on a 12 h photoperiod. Vertebrae ash increased from 316 to 516 mg g-1 fat-free dry matter with an increase in dietary P content. P requirement was estimated by using a four-parameter sigmoidal equation. The data suggests that a diet of 0.28 mg available P per KJ DE is needed for Atlantic salmon. Phosphate and calcium levels in plasma and bone increased, whereas levels of magnesium and liver cholecalciferol decreased, with an increase in dietary P. Phosphate excretion in urine and apparent availability of P were determined in deficient and replete fish. In deficient fish, the urine phosphate concentration was 0.10 mmol L-1 before feeding and 0.25 mmol l-1 after feeding, whereas in replete fish these concentrations were 1.09 and 5.11 mmol l-1, respectively. The increase in urine phosphate concentration was higher in replete fish than in deficient fish, however, the apparent absorption of P was found to be significantly lower in replete fish than in deficient fish. These results suggest that similarly to terrestrial vertebrates, P homeostasis in Atlantic salmon is controlled by absorption in the intestine, conservation in the kidney and storage in the bones.","Atlantic salmon; Diet; Intestinal absorption; Phosphorus; Renal excretion","Salmo salar; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344928540

Wax esters are stored extracellularly in certain fishes, such as the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), and therefore buoyancy appears to be their sole function. Some myctophid fishes have wax-invested swimbladders, where the non-compressible wax esters may aid in diurnal vertical migration, by replacing compressible swimbladder gases. Squalene is metabolically inert in the livers of certain sharks, and therefore probably has buoyancy as its only function. Alkyldiacylglycerols (DAGE) are abundant components of liver oil of certain deep sea sharks and holocephalans, where they may have an important role in buoyancy. Triacylglycerols and cholesterol are lipids that have an indirect role in buoyancy of marine fish. Many fishes in the ocean have oil-filled bones (mostly triacylglycerols). Although this oil aids buoyancy, its major function is as an energy storage lipid which can be utilized during starvation. Cholesterol, which is found in high amounts in the lipid-rich membranes of the swimbladder of deep sea fishes, may aid buoyancy by combining with oxygen gas in the swimbladder membranes to facilitate gas secretion in fish at great depths in the ocean. Further research is needed to understand the physical state of lipids, such as wax esters at deep sea temperatures and pressures, and more evidence is needed to clarify the role of cholesterol-rich membranes in swimbladders of deep sea fishes.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344583863

The vibrational spectrum of lumi is recorded 2.5 μs after the 3-ps, 500-mm excitation of Rh(RT). Complementary to Fourier transform infrared spectra recorded at Rh sample temperatures low enough to freeze lumi, these PTR/CARS results provide the first detailed view of the vibrational degrees of freedom of room-temperature lumi (lumi(RT)) through the identification of 21 bands. The exceptionally low intensity (compared to those observed in batho(RT)) of the hydrogen out-of-plane (HOOP) bands, the moderate intensity and absolute positions of C-C stretching bands, and the presence of high-intensity C=C stretching bands suggest that lumi(RT) contains an almost planar (nontwisting), all-trans retinal geometry. Independently, the 944-cm-1 position of the most intense HOOP band implies that a resonance coupling exists between the out-of-plane retinal vibrations and at least one group among the amino acids comprising the retinal binding pocket. The formation of lumi(RT), monitored via PTR/CARS spectra recorded on the nanosecond time scale, can be associated with the decay of the blue-shifted intermediate (BSI(RT)) formed in equilibrium with the batho(RT) intermediate. PTR/CARS spectra measured at a 210-ns delay contain distinct vibrational features attributable to BSI(RT), which suggest that the all-trans retinal in both BSI(RT) and lumi(RT) is strongly coupled to part of the retinal binding pocket. With regard to the energy storage/transduction mechanism in Rh(RT), these results support the hypothesis that during the formation of lumi(RT), the majority of the photon energy absorbed by Rh(RT) transfers to the apoprotein opsin.",,"lumirhodopsin; opsin; rhodopsin; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; cattle; energy transfer; environmental temperature; Fourier transformation; geometry; nonhuman; photoreceptor; photostimulation; protein analysis; Raman spectrometry; vibration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344447065

The four analyzed data sets are gathered from over 600 different solar flares and include about (1) 104 HXR pulses at ≥25 and ≥50 keV, (2) 4000 radio type III bursts, (3) 4000 pulses of decimetric quasiperiodic broadband pulsation events, and (4) 104 elements of decimetric millisecond spike events. The time profiles of resolved elementary time structures have a near-Gaussian shape and can be modeled with the logistic equation, which provides a quantitative measurement of the exponential growth time τG and the nonlinear saturation energy level WS of the underlying instability. Assuming a random distribution (Poisson statistics) of saturation times ts (with an e-folding constant tSe), the resulting frequency distribution of saturation energies WS or peak energy dissipation rates FS = (dW/dt)t=ts has the form of a power-law function, i.e., N(FS)∝FS-α, where the power-law index α is directly related to the number of e-folding amplifications by the relation α = (1 + τG/tSe). The same mathematical formalism is used to generate power-law distributions, as in Rosner &amp; Vaiana, but the distribution of energies released in elementary flare instabilities is not related to the global energy storage process. We assume Poissonian noise for the unamplified energy levels in unstable flare cells, implying an exponential frequency distribution of avalanche energies WS or fluxes FS in the absence of coherent amplifications. Also, in the case of coherent amplification, the Poissonian noise introduces exponential rollovers of the power law at the low and high ends of the frequency distributions. We fit both power-law and exponential functions to the observed frequency distributions of elementary pulse fluxes N(F) in each flare separately. For HXR pulses, one-half of the flares are better fitted with power-law frequency distributions, demanding coherent amplification of the underlying energy dissipation mechanism, e.g., current exponentiation occurring in the magnetic tearing instability. The majority of type III burst flares are best fitted with power-law distributions, consistent with the interpretation in terms of beam-driven coherent emission. The frequency distributions of decimetric pulsations and decimetric millisecond spikes are found to fit exponential functions, in contrast to the expected power laws for coherent emission mechanisms generally proposed for these radio burst types. A coherent emission mechanism can be reconciled with the observed exponential frequency distributions only if nonlinear saturation occurs at a fixed amplification factor for all elementary pulses or spikes, for example, if it is produced by an oscillatory compact source (in the case of decimetric pulsations) or by a fragmented source with similar spatial cell sizes (in the case of decimetric millisecond spikes). © 1998.

Typical problems are the formation of wet and hot spots within the stored grain mass, with mould growth and mycotoxin contamination. A prototype device that provides a supply of dehumidified air at night, using desiccant which is regenerated by solar energy during the day, has been built and tested in Kenya, where ambient conditions often demand dehumidification for 16 h out of 24 h. The desiccant was solid bentonite CaCl2, which is cheap and has a high moisture adsorption capacity, packed beneath a glazed cover for solar regeneration. Airflow was maintained by a small electric fan, powered by a photovoltaic panel and a 12 V battery. Field measurements verified that the system is fully sustainable, with complete restitution of the effectiveness of the desiccant by day. A night-time airflow of 2 m3/min m2 of the collector area, with a relative humidity of 40% below ambient levels, could be maintained continuously.

The heat regained from exhaust gases and/or from the coolant is stored in a heat storage system connected to the cooling system. The pre-warming taking place a few minutes prior to starting is also realised through the cooling system by applying a battery-fed water pump. The mass and the volume of the heat storage installation is limited, thus in order to attain the adequate heat capacity a storage material of high energy density is needed. It has been shown during the theoretical examination of systems with phase-changing storage materials that the traditional heat storage construction does not let the phase changing end in a few minutes, thus only a part of the stored latent heat can be regained. Rapid pre-warming can be attained by using an experimental installation of the sensible heat storage system containing a mixture of water and glycol, mounted in an Ikarus bus and by applying intensive circulation, which results in an efficient way of utilising the stored heat. It is mainly at the pistons that the rapid pre-warming of the engine leads to an increase of temperature. As a consequence, the friction at the pistons decreases and the starting of the engine requires less starting power. The higher temperature of the cylinder walls is also more favourable for burning and the end temperature of compression needed for self ignition is more easily attained. During the experiments in the cold wind tunnel, the Diesel engine started firmly every time after the pre-warming procedure of the heat storage system had taken place.","Cold-starting; Diesel engine; Engine pre-warming; Heat storage","Cooling systems; Heat storage; Starting; Waste heat utilization; Cold-starting; Engine pre-warming; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039988465

The stored low-energy ions collided occasionally with [Formula Presented] molecules in the ultrahigh-vacuum environment of the trap, capturing one or two electrons and reducing the charge state of the ions. The number of ions was monitored nondestructively by ramping the axial oscillation frequencies of the ions through resonance with a tuned circuit composed in part of trap capacitance and an external inductor. This produced resonance signals whose square is proportional to the number of ions in each charge state. These signals were recorded vs storage time to determine the electron-capture rates.

Electrorheological fluids can have their behaviour modified by the application of an external electric field. Because an ER fluid consists of a liquid containing small particles, the oscillatory response of the material differs widely from a material subjected to a steady uni-directional shear, due to the effect of the oscillatory motion breaking down the structure formed within the material. The application of a three element model to the oscillatory behaviour of an electrorheological fluid is given. The model consisting of a mechanical three element analogy was proposed in order to provide a parametric description of the behaviour, suitable for use in the design of engineering systems, which will possibly utilise these materials in the future. This model consists of an irreversible yielding type element, a non-linear softening elasticity and viscous energy loss terms. The combination of the elastic, viscous and yielding type elements model the form of the stress-strain rate and stress-strain diagrams very well. These diagrams were obtained experimentally from an oscillatory electrorheometer. Application of the model is shown for a variety of strain amplitudes, oscillatory frequencies and electric field strengths. From these data the variation of energy storage (elasticity) and loss (yielding and Newtonian flow) mechanisms are shown to vary in a complicated manner, dependent for a given field strength on strain amplitude, frequency and hence strain rate.",,"Elasticity; Electric field effects; Mathematical models; Rheology; Rheometers; Shear flow; Steady flow; Strain; Viscosity of liquids; Yield stress; Electrorheological fluid; Stress strain diagram; Stress strain rate; Suspensions (fluids)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032661170

In practice, however, the air/fuel mixture oscillates near the balanced composition. These oscillations are partly compensated by introducing ceria into TWC. This function of ceria is based on its ability to store oxygen. We have derived kinetic equations describing different scenarios of oxygen transport from ceria to the Pt catalyst particles and used the surface-science based data to choose the kinetic parameters for the most appropriate schemes. Our analysis shows that the energy of oxygen atoms on Pt is nearly the same or only slightly above (from 0 up to 5 kcal/mol) than in the surface layer of ceria. The lowest possible value of the activation barrier, E a , for jumps of oxygen atoms from ceria to Pt over the Pt-CeO x boundary is 10 kcal/mol. The rate of oxygen transport is strongly suppressed by the site-blocking effect on Pt. The effective rate constant calculated for this process is of realistic magnitude if Ea is about or higher than 25 kcal/mol. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The amount of light energy supplied and the pattern of supply not only condition the physiological status of the cells, but can also switch the mitotic cycle into meiosis. Previous studies have dealt with monoecious species. Here, the transition to sexual reproduction was studied in the dioeciously reproducing species Nitzschia lanceolata, where a compatible partner must be present for vigorous auxosporulation. Successful completion of auxospore development is ultimately dependent on light energy captured through photosynthesis, although sufficient storage material can be accumulated before sexual interaction or the shift to meiosis to allow initial cells to be formed without any further supply of energy. However, if the gametes lack sufficient stored energy then auxospore development ceases. The fact that the cells can exit from the mitotic cycle in the beginning of the Gl phase indicates that possession of a particular material stock is not essential for sexual induction. Factors inducing gametogenesis do not influence the growth of the auxospores or initial cell formation. In N. lanceolata, the lengths of the initial cells are correlated with the lengths of the gametangia. However, for a given parent pair, initial cell size is ± constant and appears to conform to the principle “all or nothing”. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"gametogenesis; light effect; sexual reproduction; Nitzschia lanceolata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032460675

Diabetes was induced in rats by streptozotocin. The diabetic rats were assigned to two TPN groups to receive either long chain triglyceride (LCT) or medium chain triglyceride (MCT)/LCT(1:1) as a fat source. The TPN solutions were isonitrogenous, isocaloric and identical in nutrient composition except for the fat emulsion. All rats received the TPN solution at an energy level of 35 kcal/100 g of body weight. The LCT and MCT/LCT groups were further divided into two subgroups, depending on whether they were treated with insulin. The results demonstrated that, between the MCT/LCT and LCT groups, no differences were observed in body weight and nitrogen retention, as well as the concentrations of plasma glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, and total cholesterol. Diabetic TPN rats without insulin treatment had weight loss and negative nitrogen balance during the experiment. Diabetic TPN rats treated with insulin, however, demonstrated less weight loss and positive nitrogen retention. Insulin treated groups had significantly higher liver fat content than did those without insulin treatment. Furthermore, liver fat content was significantly higher in the LCT group than in the MCT/LCT group among insulin treated TPN rats. These results suggest that compared with the LCT emulsion, infusion of the MCT/LCT emulsion ameliorated liver fat deposition in insulin-treated diabetic rats receiving TPN.","Diabetes mellitus; Fatty liver; LCT; Lipid emulsions; MCT; Parenteral nutrition","3 hydroxybutyric acid; cholesterol; fatty acid; glucose; insulin; lipid emulsion; lipofundin; long chain triacylglycerol; medium chain triacylglycerol; nitrogen; streptozocin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; body weight; caloric intake; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; fatty acid blood level; glucose blood level; infusion; insulin treatment; lipid blood level; lipid liver level; lipid storage; male; nitrogen balance; nitrogen urine level; nonhuman; nutrient; rat; total parenteral nutrition; weight reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032454427

Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. cv. 'Algonquin') seedlings were inoculated with Rhizobium meliloti (strain Balsac), and grown in controlled conditions. Seedlings were also grown aseptically to obtain spontaneous pseudonodules. Nodule slices were fixed in a paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde mixture and processed for embedding in Spurr's medium after OsO4 treatment and en bloc staining, with p-phenylenediamine (pPD) in 70% ethanol, for oleosomes. As a control, hexane extraction of lipids was employed. In pseudonodules, oleosomes were present in the vascular parenchyma, the meristem region and in the five to seven layers of cortical cells adjacent to the vascular tissue. The allocation of energy stored as triacylglycerides, in the form of oleosomes, and starch indicates that pseudonodules are a sink for carbon, possibly functioning as storage organs. In mature nodules, oleosomes were distinguished clearly in nodule parenchyma but were absent in infected cells. Young nodules were devoid of oleosomes. The prevalence of oleosomes in the mature nodules may indicate that the triacylglycerides are stored for overwintering, as alfalfa nodules are known to be perennial.

A portfolio of these methods is required to achieve the large reductions required; of which utilization of carbon sinks (i.e. material, geosphere and biosphere) will be an important player. Material sinks will probably only play a minor role as compared to biosphere and geosphere sinks in storage of CO2. Biosphere sinks are attractive because they can sequester CO2 from a diffuse source whereas geosphere sinks require a pure waste stream of CO2 (obtained by using expensive separation methods). On the other hand, environmental factors and storage time favor geosphere sinks. It is expected that a combination of the two will be used in order to meet emission reduction targets over the next 100 yr. A critical look is taken at capacities, retention/residence times, rates of uptake and relative cost of utilization of biosphere and geosphere sinks at three scales - global, national (Canada) and provincial (Alberta). Biosphere sinks considered are oceans, forests and soils. Geosphere sinks considered are enhanced oil recovery, coal beds, depleted oil and gas reservoirs and deep aquifers. The largest sinks are oceans and deep aquifers. The other biosphere and geosphere sinks have total capacities approximately of an order of lower magnitude. The sinks that will probably be used first are those that are economically viable such as enhanced oil-recovery, agriculture, forestry and possibly enhanced coalbed methane-recovery. The other sinks will be used when these options have been exhausted or are not available or a penalty (e.g. carbon tax) exists. Although the data tabulated for these sinks is only regarded as preliminary, it provides a starting point for assessment of the role of large sinks in meeting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon sink; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; Alberta; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032447823

Improved understanding of the melt dynamics of shallow snowpacks is necessary to fully assess the implications for water quality. The objective of this study was to measure the energy balance components of a corn (Zea mays L.) stubble field during the melting of its snowcover. Net radiation (Rn), soil (G), sensible (H), and latent (Q) heat fluxes were measured in a field near Ames, Iowa, during the winter of 1994-1995. Energy consumed by melting including change in energy storage of the snowpack was determined as the residual of the measured energy balance. There was continuous snowcover at the field site for 71 days (maximum depth = 222 mm) followed by an open period of 11 days before additional snowfall and a second melt period. The net radiation and snowmelt/energy storage change (S) terms dominated the energy balance during both measurement intervals. Peak daily sensible and latent heat fluxes were below 100 W m-2 on all days except the last day of the second melt period. There was good agreement between predicted and measured values of H and Q during the melting of an aged snow layer but poorer agreement during the melt of fresh snow. Both snowpacks melted rapidly and coincident changes in soil moisture storage were observed. Improved estimates of Q and H, especially for partially open surfaces, will require better characterization of the surface aerodynamic properties and spatially-representative surface temperature measurements.Transport of agricultural chemicals in runoff and recharge waters from snowmelt and soil thawing may represent a significant event in terms of annual contaminant loadings in temperate regions.

Among the changes associated with the loss of ovarian function is an increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. The present review focuses on changes in energy expenditure, body composition and body fat distribution during the postmenopausal transition. Previous work indicates that the most important component of total daily expenditure, resting metabolic rate, may be reduced by the menopause, independently of the effects of the normal aging process. This effect is mainly attributable to a decrease in fat-free mass. The energy expenditure associated with physical activity is the most variable component of total daily energy expenditure. However, small changes in this component may have a substantial impact on body composition. Longitudinal data from our laboratory indicate that the menopause transition also leads to significant decreases in physical activity energy expenditure. The changes in body composition that accompany the menopause transition have been studied by several groups and, although some studies suggested increases in body mass index or total body fat mass with the menopause, currently available cross-sectional data preclude a firm conclusion. Nevertheless, results from our longitudinal study showed significant increases in fat mass with the menopause. The accumulation of abdominal fat, which may be a better correlate of the comorbidities associated with obesity, has also been shown to be accelerated by the menopause transition. In this regard, it has been shown that treatment with hormone replacement therapy prevents the increase in the rate of abdominal adipose tissue accumulation that was noted with the menopause. Thus, it appears that the loss of ovarian function induces a reduction in resting metabolic rate, physical activity energy expenditure, fat-free mass, and an increase in fat mass and abdominal adipose tissue accumulation. These modifications probably contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease of postmenopausal women.",,"hormone; abdomen; adipose tissue; aging; body composition; body fat; body mass; cardiovascular risk; comorbidity; energy expenditure; female; hormone substitution; human; lipid storage; longitudinal study; menopause; metabolic rate; obesity; ovary function; physical activity; postmenopause; priority journal; short survey",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032439942

ATP and glycogen depletion often have been demonstrated during cold storage of the liver prior to transplantation. Suppression of events that lead to metabolic depression and to lipid peroxidation could contribute to improvement of liver preservation. A new method of liver preservation for transplantation is therefore suggested, an oscillating oxygenated hypothermic liver perfusion. Methods. Biochemical analysis of liver tissue samples and perfusate after 10 h of perfusion by the presented oscillating perfusion model were compared with results after continuous liver perfusion for 10 h as well as with data derived from cold-stored livers over a period of 10 h. Particular reference was made to nucleotide metabolites, glycogen content, lipid peroxidation, glutathione content, glycolytic metabolites, and enzyme release before and after preservation. Results. Glycogen depletion occurred to the same degree in hypothermic storage and machine perfusion (oscillating as well as continuous perfusion), but the energy charge was significantly increased after oxygenated perfusion, whereas cold storage resulted in a significant energy charge depletion. In addition, perfusion by an oscillating technique yielded superior energy charge loading compared to the continuous perfusion technique and diminished the other hand lipid peroxidation. Conclusions. Hypothermic oscillating oxygenated perfusion could be important for the improvement of the quality of energy-depleted organs prior to transplantation.","Energy charge; Lipid peroxidation; Oscillating liver perfusion","adenosine phosphate; glutathione; glycogen; lactic acid; preservative; animal tissue; article; controlled study; cryopreservation; energy consumption; energy metabolism; enzyme release; glycogen liver level; glycogenolysis; lipid peroxidation; liver ischemia; liver metabolism; liver perfusion; liver preservation; liver transplantation; male; metabolic inhibition; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; portal vein blood pressure; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032431308

This is a new method that allows recording of oral movements without introducing any extrinsic element between the nipple and the mouth of the baby. The advantage of displaying suckling activity after fast Fourier transform (FFT) is that this algorithm allows storage, quantification and frequency analysis of the oral movements throughout a suckling bout, which enables the total oral activity to be measured. Two types of oral movements are found: slow high amplitude (SHA) and fast low amplitude (FLA). FLA movements may be derived from peristaltic movements of the tongue that result in tickling stimuli to the mechanoreceptors of the nipple and milk expression. The frequency bandwidth of oral movements is wider (0-8 Hz) than has been described previously (0-3 Hz) and this is due to the presence of the FLA oral movements. An indirect measurement of the energy of oral movements during suckling is obtained by the pattern of energy distribution used in each individual frequency band by oral movements. This pattern changes in relation to the periods of continuous and intermittent suckling activity. SHA and FLA oral movements are more intense during continuous suckling. Statistical analysis showed a correlation between the energy of SHA and FLA waves throughout the suckling bout, and also that the highest level of energy during suckling activity is displayed during the first 2 min. The novel tools described in this paper allow investigation of the role of suckling stimulus in reflex hormone release and other mother-infant interactions.",,"adult; algorithm; article; breast feeding; controlled study; correlation function; female; Fourier transformation; human; human experiment; infant; kinetics; mechanoreceptor; mouth; nipple; normal human; priority journal; statistical analysis; stimulus; suckling; tongue",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032421538

Metabolism refers to the material and energetic input-output processes of societies, i.e. the extraction of natural resources, their processing, storage within society, and finally their release as wastes and emissions. 'Colonization of nature' refers to activities which deliberately alter natural systems and keep them in a societally desired state. We empirically analyse the metabolism of five industrial countries. Their per capital material consumption is similar enough to support the notion of a 'characteristic metabolic profile' of industrial society, which can be viewed in a historical perspective against the metabolism of hunter-and-gatherer and agrarian societies, revealing an impressive increase. We then analyse the inter-relations between a society's energetic metabolism and the need as well as the limitations of its colonization strategies. For example, we discuss how the biomass productivity of plants limits the energy flow of agrarian societies and globally may limit population growth. Finally, we discuss how industrial societies might perceive their sustainability problems and respond to them.",,"colonization; conceptual framework; man-environment relations; sustainable development; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032405540

The model, developed here, applies a theory of three-dimensional reconnection to the inferred magnetic field configuration for 7 January. In the model field a new bipole (∼ 1021 Mx) emerges amidst pre-existing active region flux. This emergence gives rise to two current ribbons along the boundaries (separators) separating the distinct, new and old, flux systems. Sudden reconnection across these boundary curves transfers ∼ 3 × 1020 Mx of flux from the bipole into the surrounding flux. The model also predicts the simultaneous (sympathetic) flaring of the two current ribbons. This explains the complex two-loop structure noted in previous observations of this flare. We subject the model predictions to comparisons with observations of the flare. The locations of current ribbons in the model correspond closely with those of observed soft X-ray loops.

The 4 (SD) were: Control (immediately after opening-without any storage or zero time storage); one month storage period; two months storage period and three months storage period. Both (CT) and (SD) had significant effects (p < 0.05) on CP and ash contents of the CDF, however there were no significant effects (p > 0.05) due to (CT) and (SD) on CF and nutritive value. High retention value (> 80%) for nitrogen was reported for the treated CDF, immediately after opening the incubated material (zero SD). However, nitrogen retention decreased with increasing (SD) to 67% after one month (SD) but tended to stay at a fairly constant level of 67% until 3 months of storage.

Untreated CDF had a similar feeding value to Rhodes grass hay. However treatment of CDF with urea alone or with urea + DS depressed animal performance of both goats and sheep, apparently due to depression of feed intake (appetite).

The technology of the solar pond is based on storing solar energy in salt-gradient stratified zones. Many experimental and numerical investigations concerning the optimum operational conditions and economical feasibility of solar ponds have been published in the last few decades. In the present study a modified solar pond with a rock bed inserted at the bottom is suggested and investigated. In order to conduct this study and predict the thermal performance of the combined system, a one-dimensional transient numerical model is developed. The boundary conditions are based on measured ambient and ground temperatures at Kuwait city. The model is validated for standard plain salt-gradient solar ponds and is then used to examine the thermal performance of the combined storage system for different rock material and bed geometry. It has been shown that the storage temperature is remarkably increased when low thermal diffusivity rocks (such as Bakelite) are used in the packed bed. Meanwhile, when high conductive rocks are used, the thermal storage temperature considerably deteriorates and the temperature variations amplitudes are almost flattened out. The bed geometry also plays a significant role in the storage process. As expected, an appreciable gain in the storage temperature was obtained for thicker rock beds.

The effects of varying factors such as Sn content, Zr content, etc. were studied. While the compositions in the AFET region demonstrate clear double hysteresis loops, there is always some remanent polarization when the electric field is removed. The remanent polarization decreases when compositions are chosen farther away from the ferroelectric-antiferroelectric phase boundary. On the other hand in the AFEO region all the compositions show zero remanent polarization, especially those with higher Zr content which have previously seldom been studied. The results also show that these high Zr AFEO compositions have high energy storage densities making them suitable for energy storage applications such as decoupling capacitors in high speed multichip modules.","Antiferroelectric; Composition dependence; Lanthanum doping; Lead ziconate stannate titanate; Phase diagram; Thin films","Composition effects; Doping (additives); Electric field effects; Ferroelectricity; Hysteresis; Lanthanum; Lead compounds; Phase diagrams; Polarization; Thin films; Antiferroelectricity; Lead zirconate stannate titanate; Remanent polarization; Dielectric films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032316582

The process has become known as Electrochemical Ion Exchange (EIX). By making multiple and complete use of ion exchange capacity in this way, large volume reduction factors can be achieved for only <5% (depending on the feed concentration) of the energy required for evaporation. AEA Technology has developed EIX over the last decade from concept to pilot demonstration, and duringthe last five years has gained vast experience in the design, build and operation of pilot systems (often as one stage integrated into a larger processing plant) for a variety of applications. The principal application areas for EIX relate to the removal/recovery of metals from aqueous streams [1]. These include: the decontamination of streams produced by Pressurised Water Reactors (PWRs) and the separation of radioactivity from tank waste storage facilities, the selective removal and recovery of precious metals from metal refining operations and base metals from electroplating rinse waters, the treatment of hospital waste (active) streams and the removal of silver from photographic wash waters [2]. The process has also been used successfully to remove toxic heavy metals, such as arsenic, from drinking water supplies. The technology has proven to be both robust and reliable.

The proposed containment thus eliminates the need to employ active features for containment cooling, and conformes to guidelines set forth for passive reactor systems. [EPRI, 1987] The design is based in part on a currently operating PWR containment (Waterford 3). A series of modifications and additions are necessary to make passive heat rejection possible. The modifications are an increase in free volume and primary shell surface area. The additions are the perforation of the secondary containment structure to form an air-convection annulus, and allow the submersion of the lower part of the containment into an external pool; an internal pool increases in-containment heat storage.

The first section is devoted to the synthesis by 'endlinking' processes of homogeneous model networks of well-defined architectures, which can be characterized by their structural parameters. In most of the methods developed in our Institute over the past two decades, linear polymer 'precursor' chains, fitted at both chain ends with reactive groups, are first synthesized. Under selected experimental conditions, the addition of an appropriate compound to this α, ω-functional polymer, allows the formation of model networks, provided no 'syneresis' has occurred. In such a way, various polymer 'precursors' of known molar mass and narrow polymolecularity have been used, such as 'living' poly(styrene), poly(isoprene), poly(alkyl methacrylates), poly(2-vinylpyridine), as well as poly(dimethylsiloxane), poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(1,3-dioxolane), which become the elastic chains of the model networks. Among all these materials, 'labeled' model networks with deuterated molecules are of great interest, since they allow one to perform small-angle neutron scattering experiments, as is described in the second section of the review. 'Labeled' poly(styrene) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) have been used to characterize the spacial distributions of the crosslinks and the conformations of elastic chains in the dry, the equilibrium swollen and uniaxially stretched states. As shown in the third section, uniaxial deformation and equilibrium swelling data are compared with those arising from rubber elasticity theories and from swelling equations. Alternately, interpretation of the experimental data based on 'scaling' concepts is developed using the analogy between semidilute solutions and permanent model networks swollen to equilibrium in a 'good' solvent. In the fourth section, it is shown that the use of branching theories allows one to evaluate the number of effective crosslinks, as well as the extent of the reaction, knowing experimentally the amount of the sol-fraction in the network. The theories of the equilibrium elastic response of a collection of v network chains have been tested using equilibrium swelling and elastic modulus data obtained from poly(ethylene oxide) model networks. Systematic departures from the predictions of the classical theories of rubber elasticity are observed. However, satisfactory agreement between theory and experiments is found by the introduction of two additional contributions to the elastic free energy, namely the limitation of free fluctuations of the junctions and the entanglement effect. In the last section, a new approach based on rheology, kinetics and branching theory is developed. In these studies, poly(urethane) model networks are used. The rheological behavior of the reaction medium is evaluated by measuring the storage and the loss moduli at various stages of the process, over a wide range of oscillatory shear frequencies. For stoichiometric systems, at a given conversion (determined by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy), the two moduli become congruent and proportional to the root square of the frequency over the entire frequency range. The method used allows one to determine precisely the time at which crosslinking occurs (gel point). This experimental value is in excellent agreement with that arising from branching theory.

Two representative HDPEs were used for the blends; one was a low molecular weight HDPE (1-HDPE) and the other was a high molecular weight HDPE (h-HDPE). Investigation by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and light scattering revealed that the surface area of an injection molded sample in h-HDPE/paraffin blend had compact spherulites of about 7 μm radius. On the other hand, the morphology of the coarse spherulite of about 15 μm radius is observed in the 1-HDPE/paraffin blend.

The BESSY I electron storage ring is optimized for radiometry and is used as a primary source standard with calculable spectral photon flux with relative uncertainties below 0.4%. A cryogenic electrical-substitution radiometer is used as a primary detector standard with a relative uncertainty in the determination of the radiant power of about 0.2%. Various experimental stations allow for the use of undispersed, calculable synchrotron radiation from bending magnets up to a photon energy of 15 keV and of monochromatized synchrotron radiation in the 3 eV to 1500 eV spectral range, respectively. Major activities comprise the calibration of radiation detectors and radiation sources as well as the characterization of optical components in the VUV and soft X-ray spectral range with low uncertainty. Among radiometric calibrations for different applications, extended work has been performed for solar and astronomical missions like SOHO, AXAF and XMM. To complement and extend these calibration facilities into the hard X-ray spectral range and for the utilization of highly brilliant undulator radiation, the PTB currently commissions new experimental stations at its radiometry laboratory at the third generation BESSY II 1.7 GeV electron storage ring. There monochromatized synchrotron radiation and undulator radiation of high spectral purity will be available at different stations for detector characterization and for reflectometry within the spectral range from 3 eV to 10 keV. Undispersed synchrotron radiation from bending magnets with calculable photon flux can be used up to a photon energy of about 50 keV for the calibration of e.g. energy-dispersive detectors or, in conjunction with monochromator-detector systems, for the calibration of radiation sources.

When a PWM inverter is used to feed the load, a L-C low-pass filter must be employed to eliminate the switching frequency component of output voltage harmonics. But, it may be observed that the high Q L-C low-pass filter causes oscillation of the output voltage on light load because the inverter is not able to decide on the one optimum control gain on all region of the output power. Therefore, it is proposed to develop High-Gain Control which is accomplished by increasing of the controller gain without additional sensors to avoid such problems and achieve a high reliability.

The types of fuel vary according to what is available on site; the technologies employed are also different, according to specifics of each country. Of all the final uses, water heating is responsible for a significant part of the consumption of residential energy. The different types of energy or fuel available in different countries, and the different technologies prevent us from asserting which would be the best option for heating water. One of the most employed technologies is the heating by means of electric boilers - storage tanks. This type of heating is widely used, yet consumes large amounts of energy as a result of heat losses, the installation costs are high and the process may cause the development of Legionella pneumophila. This somehow is not quite accurate since other intervening variables ought to be taken into account. Another type of water heating system used, but less known, is the electric showerhead that consists of instantaneous water heater equipment. This type of equipment, widely used in some developing countries, has a reasonable energetic efficiency at a very low cost. Therefore its advantages canceled out when the issue of high demand of electric energy arises and the bacterium proliferation case is questionable.

The establishment of the scientific principles allowing regulation of its properties, determining the potential application areas (alternative energy sources and transformers, media for erasable optical information storage, non-linear optics, membranes, etc.) is an important scientific problem. We have shown for the first time that the behavior of this polymer is subject to the same basic principles as the polymerization process itself. Both the polymerization of aniline and the subsequent transformations of polyaniline have to be regarded as typical redox processes, where the direction and establishment of equilibrium are dependent on the oxidation potentials and concentrations of the reactants (and also on pH of the medium, affecting the values of oxidation potential of the reactants). Such an approach allows us to identify the oxidative polymerization of aniline (and presumably of thiophene and pyrrole) as a new area in cationic polymerization, wherein the conditions of initiation, propagation and termination of the chains can be expressed by means of the electrochemical potential of the system. Furthermore, this allows an elucidation of the key problems related to the main types of transformations of this polymer (the so-called oxidative and non-oxidative doping of polyaniline).

The method introduced is especially accurate for radionuclides with multiple gamma energy peaks. Multiple detectors positioned as closely as possible to the waste barrel are used to measure the radiation field emanating from the distributed radiation sources. The total source activity is reconstructed by using the conjugate gradient with nonnegative constraint method or the maximum likelihood expectation maximum method based on measured detector responses. The maximum measurement error bond and its associated confidence level for the developed gamma scanning system are determined statistically by performing a large number of numerical experiments that take into consideration the counting statistics, the nonuniformity of source distribution, and the heterogeneous density of the self-absorbing medium. The accuracy and reliability of the system are verified through a series of real measurements with randomly distributed 192Ir sources in a 208-l waste barrel. The results of these measurements are in full agreement with the estimated error and the confidence level that are predicted by the numerical simulation.","Gamma scanner; Nondestructive assay; Nuclear waste characterizations","Constraint theory; Error analysis; Gamma rays; Maximum likelihood estimation; Nondestructive examination; Particle detectors; Radiation counters; Radioisotopes; Stability; Conjugate gradient method; Gamma scanning systems; Nuclear waste barrels; Radioactive waste storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032294751

Two mechanisms can be identified. First, moisture at an interface can reduce the interface bonding strength dramatically by altering the chemical bonds. Second, when an interface with a crack or a crack-like defect is under tensile stresses, stress corrosion may allow crack growth at stresses much lower than critical fracture would require. To avoid wet interfaces, wafers should be briefly baked or exposed to a plasma in situ before the next film deposition step. However, moisture can also reach interfaces by diffusion along interfaces from unprotected edges during a wet process, such as CMP, or during storage in the ambient. In this work, the effect of moisture induced interface strength reduction was utilized to determine the diffusion distance. By using a mechanical peel technique, the diffusivity of moisture along the interface between Al and a poly(arylene ether) based low-K material (PAE2) was measured to be 4-6 μm2/s. Stress corrosion was studied using a special 4-point bend technique so that both strain energy release rate and crack velocity can be obtained. It was found that the mechanism of stress corrosion at this interface is more complicated compared to that in a bulk material: while the chemical reaction took place at the crack tip, moisture diffusion was also occurring along the interface ahead of the crack tip, preconditioning the interface. There appeared to be a region that kinetics was limited by interfacial moisture diffusion and reaction, from which the reaction time for interface weakening was estimated to be approx. 10 seconds. It was also found that even for samples saturated with moisture, the relative humidity of the test environment was still very important.",,"Aluminum; Calculations; Chemical bonds; Diffusion; Integrated circuits; Interfaces (materials); Moisture; Polymers; Silica; Strain rate; Stress corrosion cracking; Tensile stress; Interconnect structure; Interface bonding strength; Polyarylene ether; Semiconductor device structures",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032292682

The structural changes occurring during intercalation were studied by real-time neutron diffraction. At moderate pressure, the intercalation of large molecules such as n-butane, n-pentane and n-hexane simultaneously leads to a mixture of a second-stage ternary phase and a first-stage binary phase ""CsC8"". Under increased pressure a pure first-stage ternary phase is finally formed. The intercalation of cyclopentane occurs in two steps: a pure second-stage ternary phase is first observed, whereas CsC8 only appears at about half filling. For the smallest alkane, CH4, complete ternarization leads to a second-stage ternary phase together with a small amount of an enriched second-stage binary derivative. Owing to the formation of binary domains rich in alkali metal during the ternarization, the cesium density is smaller in the second-stage ternary phase than in the starting binary compound. The in-plane cesium concentration of the ternary phase strongly depends on the projected surface area of the alkane molecule. During invasion of the interlamellar space, large molecules induce a decrease of the average distance between cesium ions. Electrostatic repulsive energy between cations is minimized through expulsion of cesium in binary domains. A pleated-layer model with canted fronts is presented, in order to account both for the various phases existing within each grain, and for the structural transformations caused by the intercalation reaction. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A weak positive relationship between G' and density was apparent, but only for the osmotically adjusted specimens. This was true regardless of whether specimens were fully turgid or flaccid. However, no such relationship was observed for the control (normal turgor) specimens, which was probably due to slight variation in turgor pressure affecting G′ independently of the effect of density on G′, and so masking the effect of density on shear stiffness.

Four cows were continuously infused in the rumen or abomasum with partially hydrolyzed starch (1500 g/d) or were not infused (control) for three 14-d periods during wk 4 to 12 postpartum. Milk yield averaged over 40 kg/d throughout the experiment. Milk and milk lactose yields tended to increase when starch was infused and DMI was decreased, regardless of the site of infusion. Starch infusion increased mean insulin concentration and tended to decrease the concentration of serum nonesterified fatty acids. Ruminal starch infusion did not affect glucose irreversible loss rate but tended to increase glucagon concentration and decrease glucose oxidation. The increased milk yield that occurred when starch was infused ruminally relative to the milk yield of control cows could be a result of increased microbial protein supply or increased energy availability. Compared with ruminal starch infusion, abomasal starch infusion tended to increase the irreversible loss rate of glucose and to increase glucose oxidation. Abomasal infusion tended to increase plasma insulin concentration and to decrease the nonesterified fatty acid concentration relative to ruminal infusion. Infusion of starch abomasally resulted in increases of most uses of glucose, including milk lactose production, glucose oxidation, and the possible storage of glucose as body fat which indicates that the early lactation dairy cow has a greater capacity for glucose metabolism than is provided by voluntary feed intake of average diets, but that not all available glucose is partitioned to the mammary gland. These data should be useful in testing current concepts and equations in nutritional and metabolic models of dairy cattle.","Dairy cows; Glucose metabolism; Starch infusion","fatty acid; glucagon; glucose; insulin; lactose; starch; animal; article; blood; cattle; digestion; drug effect; eating; female; glucose blood level; kinetics; lactation; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; physiology; ruminant stomach; Abomasum; Animals; Blood Glucose; Cattle; Digestion; Eating; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Glucagon; Glucose; Insulin; Kinetics; Lactation; Lactose; Oxidation-Reduction; Rumen; Starch",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032252913

The ASD was prepared with the addition of 2.5% (wt:wt) formic acid (cone. 85%) and 200 mg kg-1 antioxidant (ethoxyquin) to the raw ground fish. The FSD was produced with the addition of the commercial biopreservative Marisil®, (Finn Sugar) (1%) and extruded wheat (15%) to the raw ground fish. In the digestibility trial, consisting of three, 11-d periods, each having a 6-d adjustment followed by a 5-d collection, 12 mature standard type mink were confined to metabolism cages. Using the total collection (TC) method, where graded levels (0, 15, 30 and 45%) of the test feedstuff were substituted into a basal diet, an extrapolation using regression analysis was done to estimate digestibility of each test feedstuff. The AD of DM, CP, CF and GE was RGD: 81.8, 92.2, 96.2 and 89.6%; ASD: 87.1, 92.6, 100.0 and 93.2%; FSD: 86.0, 93.3, 98.1 and 90.4%, respectively. The AD of AAs was generally highest in the fermented dogfish feedstuff. A quality evaluation of the silages was conducted in a completely randomized design with four replications (two replications for AAs), to determine storage stability of the silages, on 10 different sampling days (days 1, 3, 6, 9, 15, 30, 90, 180, 270 and 360), (three sampling days for AAs) post-manufacture. The ASD was stable up to 180 d, after this storage time it underwent increases in pH and total volatile nitrogen (TVN) and decreases in N and AA content. The preservation of dogfish with a fermentation method (FSD) was judged to be unsuccessful with this feedstuff having a high initial pH (6.4) and large increases in TVN content early in storage.

While explanations for the fat layer of human neonates have commonly assumed that it serves as insulation to compensate for hairlessness, empirical support for this hypothesis is presently weak. Whether the tissue's abundance at birth and growth changes in adiposity during infancy and childhood might be explained in light of its role as energy buffer has not been assessed, and this possibility is explored through development of a model of fat function and growth centered on two related hypotheses. The first is that the greater adiposity of human neonates is at least partially explainable as an accompaniment of the enlarged human brain, which demands a larger energy reserve to ensure that its obligatory needs are met when the flow of resources from mother or other caretakers is disrupted. The second is that age-related changes in the likelihood of experiencing such disruption have influenced the pattern of investment in the tissue, reflected today in peak adiposity during infancy and a decline to a leaner childhood period. Nutritional disruption is common at birth and until lactation is established, during which time human newborns survive from fats deposited prenatally, suggesting one possible explanation for the early onset of fat deposition. At weaning, the transition from breast milk to supplemental foods and the parallel transition from maternal to endogenous immune protection interact to increase the frequency and impact of nutritional disruption, and this may help explain why newborns devote roughly 70% of growth expenditure to fat deposition during the early postnatal months. Evidence is presented that fat stores are mobilized during infections hinting at one possible mechanism underlying the association between nutritional status and infectious morbidity and mortality among infants in nutritionally stressed human populations. Consistent with the proposed hypothesis, well-fed infants acquire peak fat reserves by an age of peak prevalence of malnutrition, infectious disease, and fat reserve depletion in less-buffered contexts, and childhood - characterized by minimal investment in the tissue - is a stage of reduced risk of energy stress. The model presented here foregrounds energy storage in adipose tissue as an important life-history strategy and a means to modify mortality risk during the nutritionally turbulent period of infancy. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Adaptation; Body fat; Brain size; Energetics; Insulation; Life-history theory; Mortality; Weaning","adipose tissue; child; energy metabolism; evolution; growth, development and aging; human; immunology; infant; infection; newborn; nutritional disorder; physiology; review; weaning; adaptation; body composition; body fat; brain size; childhood mortality; nutritional status; physical anthropology; Adipose Tissue; Child; Energy Metabolism; Evolution; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infection; Nutrition Disorders; Weaning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032251471

Isolated isovolumic rat hearts were arrested with a preservation solution which was developed in our laboratory and then submitted to 5 h of cold storage (4°C, group I; and 7.5°C, group II) in the same solution. After an additional period of 50 min of ischemia at 15°C with intermittent cardioplegic infusion, hearts were reperfused for 60 min at 37°C. Function was assessed during the control period and reflow. High-energy phosphates and intracellular pH were followed by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Analyses of metabolites and enzymes were performed by biochemical assays and HPLC in coronary effluents and in freeze-clamped hearts to assess cellular integrity. The energetic pool was better preserved at 4°C during ischemia (ATP at the end of 4°C ischemia, 59 ± 7% in group I vs 31 ± 5% in group II, P &lt; 0.01) and reflow (P &lt; 0.05) but membrane protection was higher when increasing the temperature to 7.5°C (reduction of creatine kinase leakage, 89 ± 16 IU/min in group I vs 51 ± 5 IU/min in group II, P &lt; 0.05). As a result, functional recovery, represented by the rate pressure product, was higher in hearts preserved at 7.5°C (52 ± 6% recovery in group I vs 77 ± 7% in group II at the end of reflow, P &lt; 0.05). Altogether, cold storage at 7.5°C provides a better protection than storage at 4°C. © 1998 Academic Press.",,"cryoprotective agent; phosphorus; animal; article; comparative study; cryopreservation; cytology; energy metabolism; heart; heart muscle; hemodynamics; in vitro study; male; metabolism; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; organ preservation; pathophysiology; perfusion; pH; physiology; rat; reperfusion injury; Sprague Dawley rat; temperature; Animals; Cryopreservation; Cryoprotective Agents; Energy Metabolism; Heart; Hemodynamic Processes; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; Myocardium; Organ Preservation; Perfusion; Phosphorus; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032248205

Intrusion of the radioactive materials into the electron storage ring or to the outside of the evacuated beamline components can be avoided by a specially devised RI protection/ inspection mechanism. The combination of a variably polarizing undulator and a varied-line-spacing plane-grating monochromator provides linearly or circularly polarized soft X-rays with a high resolving power in the energy range 0.28-1.5 keV The beamline will become operational in December 1997.","Actinides; Circular polarization; Radioactive materials; Soft x-ray spectroscopy; Variably polarizing undulators",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032221678

In a CCHN, an arbitrary number of modules (Hopfield networks) can be mutually connected via feedforward networks called internetworks, whose output generates interactions among module networks. To evaluate the CCHN as a modular neural network, it has previously been applied to associative memory. Although its excellent association performance is supported by many simulation results, it is still difficult to compute the memory capacity exactly or to examine the dynamic properties rigorously, because CCHN information processing includes strong nonlinearity. Hence, as the first step to an analytical approach, this paper focuses on a single-module CCHN whose interaction is realized by a two-layered feedforward internetwork. In this case, the connection matrix of the CCHN degenerates into a single square-matrix, as does a conventional auto-association type of associative memory. Using eigenvalue analysis for the connection matrix, we reveal that the essential differences between the association characteristics of a CCHN and a conventional autocorrelation associative memory originate from dynamics in the noise-space that is the orthogonal complement of the subspace generated from memory patterns. ©1998 Scripts Technica.","Associative memory; Energy function; Modular structure; Neural network; Noise-space dynamics","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Feedforward neural networks; Models; Neural networks; Performance; Noise-space dynamics; Associative storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032210568

SMES is composed of a superconducting coil, vapor-cooled leads, and a power conditioning system. The electrical specifications for SMES are discussed on the basis of input and output power depending on size and application. As breakdown voltage in helium gas is low, an internally cooled magnet system is preferable to a pool boiling one. A model coil for a 100 kWh SMES, which is a typical forced cooled magnet system, was developed in Japan and then successfully tested. A glass-polyimide-glass tape insulation system was investigated in view of electrical and mechanical strength prior to fabrication. The breakdown voltage measurement of a sample with an artificial crack showed sufficient strength. The insulation critical fracture strength has a good agreement with the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This excess energy problem is illustrated in this paper by a simplified cooling plant model employed in a simulation environment that allows the assessment of the control performance of various conventional and optimal strategies. The optimal control strategy of minimizing operating cost only is introduced and subsequently is modified to allow the simultaneous consideration of operating cost and energy consumption. This proposed optimal control strategy could be valuable if ice storage systems are to stand on their own merits in a deregulated utility environment.

The nickel-metal hydride battery (Ni/MH) is one of the more promising types, because of its high capacity, high-rate charge/discharge capability and non-polluting nature. This type of battery uses a hydrogen storage alloy as its negative electrode. The characteristics of the Ni/MH battery, including discharge voltage, high-rate discharge capability and charge/discharge cycle lifetime are mainly determined by the construction of the negative electrode and the composition of the hydrogen-absorbing alloy. The negative electrode of the Ni/MH battery described in this paper was made from a mixture of hydrogen-absorbing alloy, nickel powder and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). A multicomponent MmNi5-based alloy (Mm0.95Ti0.05Ni3.85 Co0.45Mn0.35Al0.35) was used as the hydrogen-absorbing alloy. The discharge characteristics of the negative electrode, including discharge capacity, cycle lifetime, and polarization overpotential, were studied by means of electrochemical experiments and analysis. The decay of the discharge capacity for the Ni/MH battery (AA size, 1 Ah) was about 1% after 100 charge/discharge cycles and 10% after 500 charge/discharge cycles. © 1998 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.",,"Absorption; Electrodes; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Nickel; Performance; Nickel-metal hydride batteries; Electric batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032207297

The fuzzy and fuzzy neural network control strategy of superconducting magnetic energy storages (SMES) was proposed for this purpose. The control results depend on the values of coefficients of learning rate in fuzzy neural networks. Therefore, it is desirable to obtain better control results by tuning the coefficients of learning rate to their optimum values. In this paper, the control strategy based on an autotuning of scaling factors with neural network and tuning of coefficients of learning rate of neural network with genetic algorithm is proposed for leveling load fluctuations. Encoding and decoding of coefficients of learning rate and selection, crossover, and mutation within genetic operations are shown, and crossover rate and mutation rate are discussed. Through these methods, we can achieve a better leveling of load power fluctuation by using fuzzy neural network with genetic algorithm. © 1998 Scripta Technica.","Fuzzy inference; Genetic algorithm; Neural network; Power leveling; SMES","Fuzzy control; Genetic algorithms; Magnetic storage; Neural networks; Superconducting devices; Superconducting magnetic energy storages (SMES); Electric load management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032188403

The temperature dependence of the viscosity exhibits a slight jump near 9.5°C, corresponding to the phase change temperature. This deviation is interpreted in terms of a change in the particle state near the phase change temperature.

Currently, utilities are using conventional gas turbines and hydraulic pumped storage, HPS. The latter has high capital cost and requires a difference in geodetic height. Therefore, compressed air energy storage CAES plants are being recognized as a technically feasible and economically attractive for load management. In this work, the performance of a CAES plant comprising: generated energy Egen, energy ratio ER and primary energy efficiency ηpe, is evaluated over a wide range of pressure ratio Rc and load, which depends on the rate of air discharged mt. The latter is relevant to the charging-discharging ratio CD. A computer program was specially designed to evaluate performance. The results show that the CAES plant produces about 30% more power than that consumed during the off peak period. It produces about three times the power of a conventional gas turbine plant. It also enjoys economic superiority at part load. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

On a seasonal timescale (summer to winter), storage of hydrogen in liquid organic hydrides was equivalent to other carbon free alternatives and superior to zero emission systems like batteries. Seasonal energy storage is illustrated by the methylcyclohexane toluene-hydrogen (MTH) system. Low cost summer electricity is used for water electrolysis to yield hydrogen for hydrogenation of toluene. Dehydrogenation in winter gives hydrogen for heat and power generation by fuel cells with an estimated overall electrical efficiency of 41%. Recent laboratory results using commercial, dehydrogenation catalysts in fixed bed reactors show how catalyst efficiency was increased (low by-products) to reduce the carbon emissions to 0.01 kgC/kWhc. Hydrogen separation membranes and new molecular reactions are being investigated to further increase efficiencies.

Also, CICC has advantages when applied for pulsed operation coils, such as the fusion magnets and superconducting magnetic energy storage coils, because of its thermal and hydraulic performance. Superconducting coils made from CICC have a cooling path and the coolant of the supercritical helium circulates through the inside of the CICC. When the coil has heat generation due to the AC losses, the CICC has the advantage of being able to remove heat due to the large wet perimeter. The inlet flow reduction is caused by the heat generation of the conductor. The inlet flow reduction provides a limit to the stable pulsed operation of the coil. The inlet flow reduction is measured and discussed for the CICC in this paper. The design criteria of the inlet flow reduction is introduced for the CICC. The zero flow temperature is defined to achieve this purpose. The initial flow rate can be estimated by this criteria, which is applicable for the forced flow conductor, as well as for CICC. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The populations differ up to 8.5-fold in desiccation resistance and up to 10-fold in starvation resistance. We used these populations to search for evolved physiological changes that might explain the differences in stress resistance. We examined two hypotheses for increased stress resistance that had been proposed previously in the literature: (1) that increments in starvation resistance are principally the result of differential lipid accumulation, and (2) that changes in glycogen accumulation play a role in evolved increases in resistance to desiccation stress. By quantifying desiccation resistance, starvation resistance, lipid content, and carbohydrate content in each of our populations of flies, we were able to demonstrate strong correlations between the capacity of the flies to resist starvation and the quantity of lipid or carbohydrate that the flies had stored. The strongest correlation (R2 = 0.99) was observed when the total energy content of both the lipid and carbohydrate stores was regressed against starvation resistance. These results demonstrate that the flies responded to selection for starvation resistance through a genetically determined increase in both lipid and carbohydrate storage. Similar analyses of the correlation between lipid storage or total energy storage and desiccation resistance revealed no significant correlations. Carbohydrate storage was significantly correlated with desiccation resistance in female but not in male flies. These results suggest that different forms of stress are resisted with distinct physiological mechanisms and that the evolutionary response of the flies to stress selection is specific to the stress imposed.",,"desiccation; ecophysiology; environmental stress; selection; starvation; Diptera; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophilidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032168032

A substantial levitation force was generated by the repulsive force between like poles of coupled magnets. However, the repulsion system with magnets is essentially unstable without control. Thus, HTSCs are applied for control elements of the PM-HTSC hybrid magnetic levitation system. In this system, the levitation force becomes stronger than in the system without PM, and we can expect sandwich-type magnetic bearing capable of sustaining greater force. © 1998 Scripta Technica.","High-temperature superconductors; Magnetic bearing; Magnetic levitation carrier system; Permanent magnets","Energy storage; Flywheels; High temperature superconductors; Magnetic bearings; Permanent magnets; Flywheel energy storage system; Hybrid magnetic levitation systems; Magnetic levitation carrier system; Magnetic levitation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032167169

A commercially available low temperature (80-90°C) adsorption cooling system for air-conditioning application had to be modified for operation at cooling temperatures below the freezing point of water. Methanol instead of water was investigated as a refrigerant. Because of the inferior thermodynamic properties of methanol and the lower operation temperature, the efficiency is reduced. Calculations showed that the COP for a commercial adsorption cooling system is about 30% when operating the system with methanol/silicagel at a chilled water temperature of T0= -2°C, a heating water temperature of Th = 85°C and a condenser temperature of Tc = 30°C. A laboratory test facility with heating and cooling capacities of about 2 kW was set up. By comparative experiments with water and methanol, the calculations could be validated, though the specific power density is only 1/10 of the commercial system. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It then concentrates upon the ten subsystems of LST which process matter/energy, and analyzes how knowledge of these subsystem processes can be applied to our model of social ecology.

Kinematic and force plate data, synchronised in time and space, were collected for the right forelimb of 6 Warmblood horses moving at a trot. The 3-D kinematic data were collapsed onto a sagittal plane, and were combined with the vertical and longitudinal ground reaction forces and with segment morphometric data to calculate net joint moments in the sagittal plane across the distal interphalangeal (coffin), metacarpophalangeal (fetiock), carpal, elbow and shoulder joints. The joint mechanical power was calculated as the product of the joint moment and the joint's angular velocity. Major peaks on the moment and power curves were identified. Each joint showed consistent and repeatable patterns in the net joint moments and joint powers. During most of stance the net joint moment was on the caudal/palmar side of all joints except the shoulder. At the coffin joint the power profile indicated an energy absorbing function that peaked at 74% stance, which coincided with the maximal longitudinal propulsive force. The fetlock joint behaved as an elastic spring; energy was absorbed in the first half of stance as the flexor tendons and SL stored elastic energy, which was released in the second half of stance as a result of elastic recoil. The carpus did not appear to play an important role in energy absorption or propulsion. Both the elbow and shoulder joints showed what appeared to be phases of elastic energy storage and release in the middle part of the stance phase, followed by a propulsive function at the shoulder in the later part of stance. The fetlock, carpus and elbow showed virtually no net generation or absorption of energy. The net energy generation at the shoulder joint was approximately equal to the energy absorption at the coffin joint. In human subjects specific gait pathologies produce characteristic alterations in the shape of the power profile as well as changes in the amount of energy absorbed and generated at the joints. In horses evaluation of net joint moments and joint powers will further our understanding of the mechanics and energetics of lameness, and may prove to be a useful diagnostic tool. An understanding of the function and dysfunction of different anatomical structures will facilitate the interpretation of clinical findings in terms of mechanical deficits.","Biomechanics; Horse; Locomotion","Equidae; Equus caballus; animal; article; biomechanics; forelimb; gait; horse; joint; physiology; weight bearing; Animals; Biomechanics; Forelimb; Gait; Horses; Joints; Weight-Bearing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032158670

Because a mechanical switch has the advantage of infinite OFF resistance, it can operate without generating Joule losses during the coil excitation and energy transfer process. However, it will cause an energy storage loss as long as the ON resistance, which mainly depends on contact resistance, is not decreased to zero. In this study, firstly case studies on energy losses due to the ON resistance of a mechanical switch and OFF resistance of a superconducting switch are carried out so as to show the necessity of a mechanical switch as a PCS in a large-scale SMES system. Secondly the contact resistance characteristics of a mechanical switch with NbTi bulk contact pieces are experimentally investigated as a function of switch driving force, switch pressing force, and ON-OFF operation number. Additionally, the effects of contact piece shape and its surface roughness on the contact resistance are examined. It was found that a superconducting connection at contact can be realized even if the switch is repeatedly opened and closed many times. The developed mechanical PCS, which has zero contact resistance, supports a superconducting current flow of more than 200 A. The formation mechanism of the superconducting connection at contact is modeled and analyzed based on theoretical considerations. © 1998 Cryogenic Association of Japan.

The measurements were carried out at the frequencies f0 = 30 MHz and fE =110 Hz, respectively. The experimental results were interpreted using the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) theory. Glass transition temperatures Tg and correlation times τg corresponding to this temperature were calculated using conditions for the minimum and maximum of the temperature dependences of the relaxation times 7"", and loss modulus E′. Two sets of the polypropylene fibers drawn within the range of draw ratios 1 -5 were investigated. One of them was prepared from polypropylene containing 8 wt% of the polymer modifier, which gives rise to the plastification of polymer, and the other was made from unmodified polypropylene. Underdrawing, the former set of fibers was found to give a shift of the Tg towards the lower temperatures whereas the opposite effect appeared in the measurements of the latter set. The values of an isothermal apparent activation energy £a estimated on the basis of WLF theory lead to the same conclusions as the activation energy values obtained from the Arrhenius relation.

Moreover, it is likely that hydrogen will be applied first and mainly for transportation at least until an efficient storage of electricity on-board of vehicles is available. Based on the experience of the Industrial Gases Industry and of chemical process engineering, on space technology and new developments, different methods of hydrogen storage have been proposed and partly investigated in the past. An important result is that the most favorable type of fuel tank system depends on the kind of vehicle and the mode of its operation. The paper gives a review of on-board storage methods with examples of applications. Requirements for storage systems with respect to the various means of transportation are discussed, emphasizing ground transport by car and bus and mentioning aviation. Further development is necessary which has to be undertaken now as long as we are not under constraint regarding economy, safety and common acceptance. It is shown that the development of hydrogen technology can benefit the introduction of natural gas powered vehicles, in particular if it is stored as cryogenic liquid. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the International Association for Hydrogen Energy.",,"Fuel tanks; Liquid fuels; Natural gas; Transportation; Mobile storage systems; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032156395

However, much attention on the effect of the weight of vehicle on the driving performances has not been called and no study has ever been carried out. It is also true that the total weight of fuel and fuel tank of future vehicles such as electric vehicles and hydrogen fueled cars has a large influence on the weight of the vehicles. A study has been carried out scientifically to clarify the effect of the total weight of fuel and fuel tank on the driving performances of the vehicle, whose weight excluding the weight of fuel and fuel tank is 1500 kg. The following have been found in our study. (1) Adopting the practical maximum total weight of fuel and fuel tank of 300 kg, the driving range of electric vehicle was about 55 km and the driving range of the hydrogen vehicle with metal hydrides storage was about 100 km. But, the hydrogen vehicle with liquid hydrogen storage accomplished the driving range of about 400 km even when the total weight of fuel and fuel tank was 100 kg. (2) Regarding the acceleration ability, the climbing ability, the total weight of fuel and fuel tank had a large influence. Hydrogen vehicles with liquid hydrogen storage are most superior to electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles with metal hydrides storage because of the light total weight of fuel and fuel tank. (3) As a result, hydrogen vehicles with liquid hydrogen storage is most practical for passenger cars, trucks and buses compared with electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles with metal hydrides storage. © 1998 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.",,"Buses; Fuel tanks; Hydrogen; Liquid fuels; Passenger cars; Trucks; Driving performance; Fuel weight effects; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032156213

It involves combining oversized wind farms, large-scale electrical storage and long-distance transmission lines to deliver 'baseload wind power' to distant electricity demand centers. Baseload wind power is typically more valuable to the electric utility than intermittent wind power, so that storage can be economically attractive even in instances where the cost per kWh is somewhat higher than without storage. The prospective costs for this approach to developing wind power are illustrated by modifying an oversized wind farm at Huitengxile, Inner Mongolia. The site has an average power density of 580 W/m2 at 50 m hub heights and is located 500 km noth of Beijing. Using locally mass-produced wind turbines there are good prospects that wind power would be cost-competitive with coal power, on a lifecycle cost basis, while providing substantial net environmental benefits. Finally, the institutional challenges related to the prospect of large-scale wind energy development are addressed. Especially important are policies aimed at developing the capacity for mass production of as much of this technology in China as is feasible. Promising instruments for speeding up the introduction of this technology include: i) international joint ventures between foriegn vendors and developers and Chinese manufacturers; and ii) wind resource development concessions.",,"developing world; Wind power; alternative energy; developing world; development strategy; energy; wind power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032147540

However, even the uncalibrated VIC model requires knowledge of the maximum and minimum observed storage capacity to derive soil water status. The results also show that a calibrated VIC model performs better than the uncalibrated SiSPAT, but that minimum storage calibrated against the observed runoff does not retain its physical significance, since it is larger than the mean storage capacity. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Hydrology; Infiltration; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Moisture determination; Random processes; Runoff; Soils; Catchments; Soil vegetation atmosphere transfer model; Watersheds; catchment; soil water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032144933

The reactor described in the ITER Draft Interim Design Report is used as the basis for the radioactive inventory assessments that are carried out using ONEDANT for the neutron transport calculations and ACAB for the activation calculations. The radioactive material produced by operation of the reactor is rated according to the protocols for waste management in each nation and at specific disposal sites currently operating in those nations. Results of the assessments vary drastically between disposal sites-even between near-surface-burial sites within the U.S. Department of Energy. One disposal site (Westinghouse Hanford Company) could accept all of ITER's wastes after a storage and cooling period (all wastes are assessed at 30 yr after shutdown). Other sites (the Savannah River and the Nevada Test Sites) could not accept any components within the toroidal field coils, similar to the restrictions in Germany. Blanket modules would be excluded from near-surface burial in France and Japan, but other components may qualify.","Fusion; International; Radioactive waste","Experimental reactors; Fusion reactors; Laws and legislation; Neutrons; Radioactivation analysis; International thermonuclear experimental reactors (ITER); Radioactive inventory assessment; Radioactive waste disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032139916

The polar interactions may be augmented by inclusion of polar additives such as maleic anhydride to the cement monomer. However, maleic anhydride is slowly converted to maleic acid when exposed to an aqueous environment. This may affect mechanical properties of such a cement in a negative way. It was the aim of the present investigation to analyze the role of maleic anhydride dissolved in the monomer of resin cements. The resin cement monomers used were common methacrylates, to which maleic anhydride in amounts of up to 30 mol% was added. Polymerization initiators were included to make the materials dual curing. Finally, the preparations were mixed with silanated fillers. The adherence energy of the cements bonded to a chromium-cobalt alloy was assessed by means of the double cantilever beam test. The strength and stiffness of the resin cements were recorded at base line and after two months storage in water. The initial adherence energy increased by a factor of about two as a result of addition of maleic anhydride. However, resin cements containing maleic anhydride suffered significant reductions in long-term adherence, strength and stiffness. These reductions were particularly pronounced in non-irradiated specimens. The use of resin cements containing maleic anhydride is not a viable means of conveying adhesiveness to resin cements. © Eur J Oral Sci, 1998.","Adhesion; Interfacial interactions; Prosthetic dentistry; Resin cements","2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate; adhesive agent; aldehyde; chromium derivative; macrogol derivative; maleic acid; maleic acid derivative; maleic anhydride; methacrylic acid derivative; polymer; polymethacrylic acid derivative; polyurethan; propionaldehyde; resin; resin cement; silane derivative; triethylene glycol dimethacrylate; water; adhesion; article; chemistry; dental bonding; elasticity; human; materials testing; mechanical stress; physical chemistry; time; Adhesiveness; Adhesives; Aldehydes; Chemistry, Physical; Chromium Alloys; Composite Resins; Dental Bonding; Elasticity; Humans; Maleates; Maleic Anhydrides; Materials Testing; Methacrylates; Polyethylene Glycols; Polymers; Polymethacrylic Acids; Polyurethanes; Resin Cements; Silanes; Stress, Mechanical; Time Factors; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032136681

Isolated rat hearts were stored for 12 h at 4°C with University of Wisconsin (UW), St Thomas Hospital (ST) and Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solutions, and were reperfused for 1 h. Cellular volumes were measured by 1H NMR of water and 59Co NMR of the extracellular marker cobalticyanide, and energetic profiles by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Storage in ST solution reduced ischemic swelling from 2.50 ± 0.06 to 2.73 ± 0.09 (P &lt; 0.001 v 3.56 ± 0.10 ml/g dry weight in KH), while UW solution caused cellular shrinkage to 2.12 ± 0.08 ml/g dry weight. Intracellular ATP concentrations and pH values were higher in UW as compared to ST solution. At reperfusion, hearts stored in ST shrank while those stored in UW expanded, resulting in similar intracellular volumes. Storage with UW was superior to ST in post-ischemic function 65 ± 5% (P &lt; 0.01 v 49 ± 4% with ST) and in recovery of ATP 46 ± 3% (P &lt; 0.001 v 25 ± 4% with ST). Storage with both ST and UW solutions did not prevent interstitial edema. Sarcolemmal membrane integrity, as assessed by cellular swelling in response to a hypo-osmotic shock (210 mmol/l), was significantly improved by ST and UW solutions as compared to ST (P &lt; 0.05). Creatine kinase efflux was reduced by ST and UW as compared to KH (P &lt; 0.05), and by UW as compared to ST (P &lt; 0.05).

The bond energy reached is close to that of thermal silicon oxide itself. For hydrophilic wafer pairs bonded in air, a high bond energy at the bonding interface can also be realized by a low vacuum storage prior to the annealing, or a low vacuum annealing at 150°C after bonding. These low vacuum effects appear to be associated with a significant reduction of trapped nitrogen at the bonding interface. Trapped nitrogen prevents an intimate contact of the bonding surfaces during annealing and thus prevents formation of covalent bonds. Because a difference in thermal expansion coefficients is usually present between different wafers, in order to avoid excess thermal stresses the low vacuum bonding approach is crucial for bonding of dissimilar materials in applications such as microelectromechanical systems and has been applied to bonding silicon to materials other than silicon which have hydrophilic surfaces. © 1998 The Electrochemical Society, Inc.",,"Annealing; Bonding; Silica; Hydrophilic compounds; Wafer bonding; Silicon wafers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032122725

The cyclic nature of the present problem is relevant to latent heat thermal energy storage systems used to power solar Brayton engines in space. Specifically, a physical and numerical model of the solar heat receiver component of NASA Lewis Research Center's ground test demonstration (GTD) system was developed and results compared with available experimental data. Multiconjugate effects such as the convective flow of a low Prandtl number fluid, conduction in the PCM, containment tube, and working fluid conduit were accounted for in the model. An ideal-body thermal radiation model was also included to quantify reradiative effects inside the receiver along with losses through the aperture and receiver shell. A high-temperature eutectic mixture of LiF-CaF2 was used as the PCM and a mixture of He/Xe was used as the working fluid. A modified version of the computer code HOTTube was used to generate results for comparisons with GTD experimental data in both subcooled and two-phase regimes. While qualitative trends were in close agreement for the balanced-orbit modes, excellent quantitative agreement was observed for steady-state modes.

Three viable technologies for storing hydrogen fuel on cars are: compressed gas, metal hydride adsorption, and cryogenic liquid. However, each of these has significant disadvantages: volume, weight, boiling losses, or energy to compress or liquefy the hydrogen. Insulated pressure vessels can reduce these problems for hydrogen-fueled light-duty vehicles. Insulated pressure vessels can be fueled with liquid hydrogen (LH2), with low-temperature (80 K) compressed hydrogen (CH2) or with ambient-temperature CH2. In this analysis, hydrogen venting losses are calculated for insulated pressure vessels fueled with LH2 or with low-temperature CH2, and the results are compared to those obtained in low-pressure LH2 tanks. Hydrogen losses are calculated as a function of daily driving distance during normal operation, as a function of time during long periods of vehicle inactivity and as a function of initial vessel temperature during fueling. The number of days before any venting losses occur is also calculated as a function of the daily driving distance. The results show that insulated pressure vessels with packaging characteristics comparable to those of conventional, low-pressure LH2 tanks (low weight and volume), have greatly improved dormancy and much lower boil-off. Insulated pressure vessels used in a 17 km/l (40 mpg) car can hold the hydrogen indefinitely when the car is driven at least 15 km/day in average. Nearly all cars are driven for greater distances, so most cars would never need to vent hydrogen. Losses during long periods of parking are also relatively small. Due to their high-pressure capacity, these vessels would retain about a third of their full charge even after a very long dormancy, so that the owner would not risk running out of fuel. If an insulated pressure vessel reaches ambient temperature, it can be cooled down very effectively by fueling it with LH2 with no losses during fueling. The vessel has good thermal performance even when inexpensive microsphere insulation is used. Finally, the vessel eases fuel availability and infrastructure requirements, since it would be compatible with both compressed and cryogenic hydrogen refueling. © 1998 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.",,"Hydrogen; Passenger cars; Pressure vessels; Tanks (containers); Hydrogen storage; Fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032108842

After irradiation of test diodes by protons (Ep = 24 GeV) with a fluence of l 5-1011 cm""2, no additional radiation induced deep traps have been detected.

The characterization of power dissipation in on-chip cache memories reveals that the memory peripheral interface circuits and bit array dissipate comparable power. To optimize performance and power in a processor's cache, a multidivided module (MDM) cache architecture is proposed to conserve energy in the bit array as well as the memory peripheral circuits. Compared to a conventional, nondivided, 16-kB cache, the latency and power of the MDM cache are reduced by a factor of 1.9 and 4.6, respectively. Based on the MDM cache architecture, the energy efficiency of the complete memory hierarchy is analyzed with respect to cache parameters in a multilevel processor cache design. This analysis was conducted by executing the SPECint92 benchmark programs with the miss ratios for reduced instruction set computer (RISC) and complex instruction set computer (CISC) machines. © 1998 IEEE.","Cache architecture; High performance; Low power; Multilevel; Processor","Computer systems programming; Optimization; Reduced instruction set computing; Complex instruction set computer (CISC) machines; Buffer storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032097825

This guidance reflects the fact that at the heart of an environmental impact statement is a comparative analysis of alternatives, including the proposed action; this analysis should address the environmental impacts in proportion to their potential significance, avoid addressing insignificant impacts in detail, and focus analysis resources to be as cost-effective as possible. Accordingly, a probabilistic risk analysis-based methodology to satisfy DOE guidance was developed and implemented for the DOE Waste Management Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (WM PEIS). The methods are described and illustrated, and an outline of the computational framework is presented. This methodology, although developed for the WM PEIS, is, of course, applicable to general safety analyses. The implementation of the methods for the WM PEIS is summarized, and the extension of the methods to site-specific applications is explained.","Environmental impact statements; Risk analysis; Waste management","Accident prevention; Computational methods; Cost effectiveness; Environmental impact; Probability; Risk assessment; Radioactive waste management facilities; Radioactive waste storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032097138

It is shown that the total hydrogen storage capacity is unchanged, but the plateau pressure is increased in the lower hydrogen concentration range of the pressure composition isotherm curve after annealing. The annealed alloy has a higher rate capability and a higher discharge capacity than the as-cast one. In order to analyze the above phenomena, the reaction surface area and surface reaction kinetics were examined by Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller method (BET) and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses, respectively. The measurement of the fully activated electrode surface area by BET analysis shows that there is little difference between as-cast and annealed alloy. The higher rate capability is due to the decrease of charge-transfer resistance for the hydrogenation reaction in the KOH electrolyte after annealing. It is well known that the Ni component plays a role in improving the electrocatalytic activity of the alloy electrode. The microstructures of the as-cast and annealed alloys were investigated by scanning electron microscope and energy-dispersive spectroscopy analyses. The second phase (Zr-Ni phase) is widely distributed in as-cast alloy, but this second phase disappears after annealing, resulting in the homogenizing of the alloy and an increased Ni content in the matrix. The annealed alloy has a higher exchange current density than any single phase of as-cast alloy. Consequently, it is concluded that the improved rate capability of the annealed alloy is due to increased Ni content in the matrix resulting from the disappearance of the secondary phase.",,"Annealing; Catalysis; Charge transfer; Composition effects; Current density; Electric discharges; Reaction kinetics; Surface phenomena; Zirconium alloys; Brunauer Emmett Teller method; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032094762

The overall model consists of the following basic components: a compressor, a condenser, an expansion valve, an evaporator, an evaporative cooler and a cool storage. The integrated system is referred to as chilled water cooling system with storage (CWCS). The mathematical modelling of the CWC system undertaken in this study predicts the change in state of refrigerant in the system with respect to time. A computer program is developed to solve the dynamic equations along with empirical correlations describing refrigerant properties. Open-loop tests are carried out to study the performance characteristics of the system under varied cooling load and compressor speed. The model is intended to serve as an analytical design tool and to provide a basis for control analysis. Based on a heuristic method, 'sub-optimal on-off control strategies for the chilled water cool storage system are developed using a reduced order model. The methodology of generating such control profiles is illustrated and the tests for optimality show that the control profiles are near optimal. The on-off control scheme is simulated on the full order CWC system. The operating performance of the system is described under several simulated cases. The results show that the control scheme is capable of maintaining the chilled water temperature in the chosen range. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Chilled water cooling systems; Energy storage; On-off control; Sub-optimal control","Computer software; Correlation methods; Heat storage; Heuristic methods; Mathematical models; Numerical methods; On-off control systems; Optimal control systems; Refrigerants; Thermodynamic properties; Chilled water cooling system with storage; Sub optimal control; Water cooling systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032091835

The problem involves a fluid flowing inside a long tube surrounded by a phase-change material (PCM). The fluid temperature at the tube inlet cycles above and below the freezing temperature of the PCM, causing alternating liquid and solid layers to form and propagate from the tube outside surface. The objective of this paper is to predict the dynamic performance, temperature distribution, and phase front distribution along the tube. The problem is modeled as axisymmetric and two dimensional. Axial conduction is neglected and the problem is discretized into axial segments. Each of these axial sections is modeled as a transient, one-dimensional problem involving phase change with the possibility of multiple phase boundaries. The boundary element method (BEM) is used to obtain the transient solution in each axial section. Each axial segment communicates with downstream segments through the fluid flowing inside the tube. In order to ensure numerically stable results, a fully implicit discretization is used in both the axial and time variables. Results are presented for the time and axial evolution of the phase fronts and temperatures in response to a fluid inlet temperature that periodically alternates between values above and below the freezing temperature. This BEM is tested against the thermal network method (TNM) and the negligible sensible heat approximation (NSH) by comparing the outlet temperature and the latent state of charge. Results are found to be consistent and accurate. © 1998 by ASME.","Moving boundaries; Phase-Change Phenomena; Thermal Energy Storage","Boundary element method; Freezing; Mathematical models; Melting; Temperature distribution; Thermal effects; Phase changing material (PCM); Pipe flow; fluid flow; melting; phase change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032078568

Continuous hypothermic perfusion of donor hearts may provide extra protection for long ischemic times and suboptimal donors. The aim of three separate studies was to assess the effect of continuous hypothermic perfusion during simulated donor heart storage and implantation. Methods. In study 1 twelve isolated rat hearts underwent 10 minutes of normothermic ischemia to simulate the effect of brain death on the heart and 5 hours of cardioplegic arrest, using University of Wisconsin solution. Six hearts were statically stored in University of Wisconsin solution at 2°C, and six were perfused with University of Wisconsin solution. To assess the effect of simulated implantation, in study 2 an additional 12 hearts were statically stored for 5.5 hours in University of Wisconsin solution, six of which were rewarmed to a mean of 16°C over the last 30 minutes of arrest. To assess the effect of simulated perfusion, in study 3 during implantation 12 hearts were rewarmed to a mean of 16°C over the last 30 minutes of arrest, during which time six were perfused with 2°C solution. Results. Hearts perfused during storage demonstrated greater recovery of prearrest power, 85.8% ± 1.8%, than hearts preserved by static storage, 72.7% ± 3.0% (p < 0.01). The simulated warm implantation period reduced recovery of power from 68.3% ± 5.1% to 40.2% ± 2.0% (p < 0.001). Perfusion during warm implantation improved recovery to 61.8% ± 3.9% (p < 0.01). In all experiments improved function was accompanied by improved metabolic energy status. Conclusions. During the implantation period of heart transplantation the donor heart sustains injury that could amount to 50% of total ischemic injury. Continuous perfusion during the cold storage phase and during simulated implantation improves recovery of the donor heart.",,"adenine nucleotide; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; oxygen; University of Wisconsin solution; animal model; animal tissue; article; brain death; cardioplegia; controlled study; heart; heart muscle ischemia; heart preservation; heart transplantation; male; nonhuman; perfusion; priority journal; pump; rat; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032076038

The loss and recovery of hydrophobicity of the surface have been characterized by contact angle measurements. Immediately after exposure to corona discharges, samples showed a low surface hydrophobicity and, on storage in dry air, a continuous increase in hydrophobicity finally approaching the hydrophobicity of the unexposed material. The activation energy of the hydrophobicity recovery was two to four times greater than the activation energy of the diffusivity of low molar mass PDMS in PDMS elastomers, indicating that the diffusivity properties of the oxidized surface layer were different from that of the bulk. PDMS elastomers quenched in liquid nitrogen or subjected to small mechanical deformation ( < 1% strain) after exposure to corona discharges for 1 h or more recovered their hydrophobicity faster than untouched specimens kept under identical conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the early formation of a silica-like surface layer, with a thickness cf at least 10-12 nm. The atomic composition of the oxidized surface layer remained essentially unchanged after the first hour of corona discharges. It is suggested that the silica-like surface layer delayed the recovery of hydrophobicity by inhibiting the transport of low molar mass PDMS to the surface. It is also suggested that thermally or purely mechanically induced stresses lead to a cracking of the brittle silica-rich layer and that this in turn facilitates the transport of low molar mass PDMS to the surface and to a more rapid recovery of the hydrophobicity. Data obtained by reflection infrared spectroscopy assessing the outermost micrometer, confirmed the oxidation and the formation of hydroxyl groups at a progressively higher concentration with increasing exposure time of corona discharges. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The size, intensity and energy distribution of the focused beam produced by such capillaries are compared with those of beams generated by means of straight borosilicate capillaries, indicating that beam sizes of ca. 4 μm at the sample surface can be obtained with a total flux density that is ca. ten times higher than when a collimated beam is employed. Synchrotron radiation with energies up to 60 keV is focused, leaving the original energy distribution of the white synchrotron beam virtually unchanged. The analytical characteristics of the μ-XRF set-up at Beamline L of Hasylab, when equipped with a lead-glass capillary, were investigated by means of NIST SRMs and indicate that interference-free absolute/relative detection limits in the 1-10 fg/0.8-2 ppm range are achievable from 100 μm silicate-type samples for the elements from Mn (Z=25) to Gd (Z=64) using their Ka lines within 1000 s counting time.

Such wallboard is able to store or release a significant amount of thermal energy. The major energy storage factor is the latent heat of the PCM, which is endothermic as PCM melts and exothermic as it crystallizes. A short presentation of the results obtained in the evaluation of such wallboard points out that flammability tests represent almost the last stage in this evaluation. The flammability tests evaluated the surface burning characteristics: flame spread and smoke development classifications determined in a Steiner tunnel, as well as heat and smoke release rates determined by cone calorimeter. The tests indicated that the energy-storing wallboard does not meet all requirements in the National Building Code regarding fire characteristics for building materials. Therefore, the possibility of reducing its flammability is discussed. Comparison of the test results with similar data for other building materials indicates the possibility of reducing the flammability of energy-storing wallboard by the incorporation of a flame retardant.",,"Building codes; Flame research; Flame retardants; Flammability testing; Gypsum; Heat storage; Smoke; Surface properties; Phase change materials (PCM); Wallboards; Building materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032071641

The loadings consist of static predeformations which are superimposed by small sinusoidal oscillations. The frequency was varied between. 0.1 Hz and 100 Hz, the deformation amplitude between 0.006 and 0.06, the temperature between 253 K and 373 K and the storage and dissipation moduli measured. The data show that the frequency dependence of the moduli is of the power-law type. They also depend on the deformation amplitude and the temperature. If the temperature is constant, increasing amplitudes lead to decreasing moduli. As discussed by Payne (1965), this behaviour can be interpreted in terms of a thixotropic change. If, on the other hand, the deformation amplitude is kept constant, increasing temperature levels lead to decreasing moduli. In the second part of this work we develop a constitutive theory to represent the material behaviour observed. We consider the dissipation principle of thermodynamics and formulate the model for three-dimensional finite deformations. To describe thermal expansion effects, we decompose the deformation gradient into a thermal and a mechanical part as proposed by Lu and Pister (1975). We prescribe the thermal part by a constitutive function and assume the mechanical part to be the driving force for the stress tensor. As motivated in earlier works we split the total stress into an equilibrium stress and a rate-dependent overstress. We represent the equilibrium stress using a modified Mooney-Rivlin strain energy function and the overstress by a series of Maxwell elements whose springs are of Neo-Hookean type. Both the kinematic tensors and the associated stress measures are defined by using the concept of dual variables proposed by Haupt and Tsakmakis (1989). In order to represent the thixotropic effects, the viscosities depend on the temperature and the deformation history. The history dependence is implied by an internal variable which is a measure for the deformation amplitude and has a relaxation property as discussed by Payne (1965). To determine the material parameters, we linearise the constitutive equations with respect to the static predeformation and take the analytical solution for harmonic strain-controlled loadings into account. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the constitutive theory describes all phenomena experimentally observed with a fairly good approximation. The model is compatible with the second law of thermodynamics in the form of the Clausius Duhem inequality. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.","A. Thermomechanical processes; B.

Case studies of two tanks are presented - one broad and one slender tank, both anchored with torsional-beam steel dampers, which dissipate seismic energy by inelastic deformations induced by uplifting of the tank wall. Numerical results show that tanks anchored with steel dampers experience significantly less foundation overturning moment than similar fully anchored tanks. Relative to unanchored tanks, the tanks anchored with steel dampers experience small values of base uplift, plastic rotation at the plate boundary, hoop stress in the wall, and radial separation between the plate and foundation. In general, tanks anchored with dampers exhibit performance superior to that of similar unanchored or fully anchored tanks. Due to savings in the material of tank wall, foundation, and full base anchorage, the use of energy dissipating anchors is likely to be cost-effective.",,"Anchorages (foundations); Cost effectiveness; Damping; Deformation; Earthquake resistance; Energy dissipation; Structural analysis; Energy dissipating anchors; Liquid storage steel tanks; Steel tanks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032051340

The key parameters that affect the rate of UO2 oxidation are examined systematically and their importance to the reaction rate is evaluated. The formation of U3O7/U4O9 on unirradiated UO2 powders follows the discrete-layer mechanism and displays diffusion-controlled kinetics. In contrast, U3O8 formation on unirradiated UO2 displays sigmoidal 'nucleation-and-growth' kinetics. Low-temperature oxidation of used fuel tends to proceed by rapid grain-boundary oxidation followed by simultaneous intragranular oxidation throughout the sample. The best estimates of the activation energy for the formation of U3O7/U4O9 are 95.7 kJ mol-1 for UO2 powders, 98.6 kJ mol-1 for sintered pellets and ∼ 106 kJ mol-1 for used fuel. The activation energy for the formation of U3O8 is temperature dependent. The best estimate of the activation energy below ∼ 325°C is 154 kJ mol-1, but all the kinetic data incorporate substantial approximations so that further study is required to properly predict the behaviour of used fuel under low-temperature (&lt; 150°C) dry-air storage conditions, based on high-temperature (200 to 350°C) laboratory data. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",,"Activation energy; Approximation theory; Diffusion; Grain boundaries; Oxidation; Powders; Reaction kinetics; Spent fuels; Thermal effects; Diffusion controlled kinetics; Discrete layer mechanism; Intragranular oxidation; Sigmoidal nucleation and growth kinetics; Uranium dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032046220

In-depth Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) on device cross-sections and back-etching have been adopted as failure analysis techniques. Main reliability problems have been detected in Schottky gate and ohmic contacts due to thermally activated metal-metal and metal-semiconductor interdiffusion. After thermal storage, Al/Ti gate contacts show a decrease of barrier height with an activation energy Ea=1.3eV, while the Al/Ni Schottky contacts shows an increase of barrier height with Ea=1.8 eV. An increase of source and drain parasitic resistance has been detected in devices of two suppliers with Ea=1.5-1.6 eV. For both Schottky and ohmic degradation phenomena, the observed failure modes and mechanisms are not affected by the properties of the substrate structure, i.e. we did not observe, as far as metallurgical interactions were concerned. any difference between AlGaAs/GaAs and AlGaAs/InGaAs HEMTs. As a general result, our data show that recently manufactured HEMTs and PM-HEMTs can attain excellent levels of metallurgical stability even during very high temperature accelerated stress.

It is more economical to minimize insulation costs, to store more energy from the same input conditions, to lenghthen the time of charging that the energy could be kept stored with acceptable losses, to obtain higher storage capacity . These are the focus of thts work. A cylindrical bed is formed from three layers of different materials, equal in length, as heat-absorbing media. The bed is charged with flowing hot air in the axial direction, the hot air representing the heat source. A transient one-dimensional model is used to describe the thermal behavior of the system. The partial differential equation that govern the flow and heat transfer for both the air and the solid, constituting the bed and their boundary condition, are driven. The numerical solution of two partial differential equations is obtained using the finite difference method through a computer program especially constructed far this purpose. The temperature field for the air and the solid are obtained, and the energy stored inside the bed is computed. A wide range of layers of storage media of different materials with different thermal properties is selected. Comparison is made between the present system and packed bed systems using one storing medium. The results show that the bed packed with different layers has higher storage capacity and there is step stratification of the temperature between the material layers. Also, the bed that includes metal material (such as steel) has a maximum storage capacity, and less considerable temperature than other beds, so such a bed can realize the claimed function.","Computer program; Layer; Packed bed model; Storing media; Thermal energy storage; Thermal properties","Boundary conditions; Computer software; Energy dissipation; Finite difference method; Heat transfer; Mathematical models; Numerical methods; Packed beds; Partial differential equations; Thermal stratification; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic properties; Packed bed storage systems; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032041266

A variable frequency DC/AC converter steps up the voltage to drive the 15 hp motor for the hydrogen compressor. Up to 400 standard cubic meters (SCM) of solar hydrogen is stored, and storage of up to 2300 SCM of commercial hydrogen is collocated. As the hydrogen storage is within 5 km of Los Angeles International Airport, pilot operation of a hydrogen fuel cell bus for airport shuttle service has been demonstrated with fueling at the CAN facility. The truck engine conversions are bored to 2.91 displacement, use a Roots type supercharger and CVI (constant volume injection) fuel induction to allow performance similar to that of the gasoline powered truck. Truck fuel storage is done with carbon composite tanks at pressures up to 24.8 MPa (3600 psi). Two tanks are located just behind the driver's cab, and take up nearly half of the truck bed space. The truck highway range is approximately 140 miles. The engine operates in lean burn mode, with nil emissions of CO and HC. NOx emissions vary with load and rpm in the range from 10 to 100 ppm, yielding total emissions at a small fraction of the ULEV standard. Two Xerox fleet trucks have been converted, and one for the City of West Hollywood.

We present the logic that inexorably leads to the prediction that recurrent feedback interactions result in the storage of information and the creation of systemic memories in dynamic systems at all levels in nature. The complex nonlinear interactions that naturally accumulate through the circulation of information and energy in systems are shown to be dynamic memories that reflect the evolving identity of systems as emerging wholes. The theory provides a highly plausible mechanism for understanding numerous seemingly implausible and controversial observations in contemporary science and medicine, including memory in water and homeopathy.","Homeopathy; Logic; Systemic memory; Systems theory","article; history; homeopathy; logic; memory; theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032033988

One of the alternatives considered to decrease the net emissions of CO2 are the cultivation and combustion of solid biomass, or the thermal utilization of sewage sludge. There are different types of biomass which could be used as energy source in power production: (a) surplus and by-products from agricultural activities within the European Union (EU), e.g., straw, (b) fast growing energy plants from reutilization of areas which become available by a necessary reduction of agricultural overproduction within Europe, and (c) wood waste from forestry or wood processing. In order to achieve a noticeable CO2 reduction, as well as fossil fuel substitution, it is desirable to use fairly large quantities of biomass for energy production. However, an exclusive biomass utilization would consequently lead to the construction of many decentralized plants, which is time-consuming and would require high financial investments as well as large storage capacities due to the seasonal fuel availability. Co-combustion, in contrast, is considered to be a cheap option for utilizing the existing biomass resources. For these reasons, an EU-project, 'Combined Combustion of Biomass/Sewage Sludge and Coals of High and Low Rank in Different Systems of Semi-industrial and Industrial Scale' was launched in 1993. Under the coordinatorship of the Institut fur Verfahrenstechnik und Dampfkesselwesen (IVD), University of Stuttgart, partners from eight European countries investigated the effects of burning sewage sludge, agricultural residuals, such as straw and manure, as well as especially cultivated energy plants in combination with coals of various ranks and origin. Both the pulverized fuel (PF) and the fluidized bed (FB) mode were tested, ranging from laboratory rigs to large scale utility boilers. This paper provides an overview of the activities of the various partners involved and will, in particular, show the synergetic cooperation towards a common aim. The results of the 2-yr project will be summarized.","Biomass; Co-combustion; Coal; Sewage sludge","Air pollution control; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Fluidized beds; Pulverized fuel fired boilers; Sewage sludge; Waste utilization; Clean coal technology; Coal biomass cocombustion; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032028147

The growth of TES was driven by electric utility demand-side management (DSM) programs, which provided capital incentives and rate structures favorable to TES. The success of DSM and the pending deregulation of electric power production have all but eliminated external support for TES. Unless TES can adapt to the new economic climate, its use is likely to decline significantly. The market forces behind the TES boom and recent changes in these forces are reviewed. Strengths and weaknesses of TES are discussed relative to these redefined space conditioning market priorities. Potential future roles for TES are considered, and new developments in TES technology that may contribute to its sustainability are described. Although the future use of TES is likely to be focused more narrowly in its most competitive niches, it can survive and continue to play an important role in HVAC systems despite recent developments.",,"Air conditioning; Competition; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Heating; Industrial economics; Laws and legislation; Marketing; Ventilation; Electric utility deregulation; Thermal energy storage (TES); Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032023738

The CHICSi collaboration has been developing thin ΔE detectors for study of reaction products from intermediate energy heavy ion collisions in an ultra high vacuum storage-ring environment. In this paper, we highlight these developments from an ion beam analysis (IBA) viewpoint. The initial part of the paper outlines the characteristics for these detectors for, nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), elastic recoil detection (ERD) using ΔE-E detector telescopes and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Quasi-empirical estimates of the maximum ΔE detector thickness and separating power for the limit of low energy particles (down to 0.1A MeV) reveal that energy straggling is an important limiting factor. Subsequently different methods are presented for fabricating both self-supported and vertically integrated ΔE detectors including recently developed wafer bonding techniques which open up the possibility of producing ΔE-E detector telescopes where the ΔE element is in the hundreds of nm range. Ultimately consideration is given to special requirements for the readout electronics because of the high capacitance presented by the thin ΔE detectors. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.","Accelerator mass spectrometry; Elastic recoil detection; Energy loss; Integrated detectors; Nuclear reaction analysis; Particle identification; Self-supporting membranes; Si p-i-n diodes; Straggling; ΔE detectors","Energy dissipation; Ion beams; Mass spectrometry; Nanotechnology; Readout systems; Semiconductor diodes; Silicon sensors; Storage rings; Telescopes; Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS); Elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA); Ion beam analysis; Nuclear reaction analysis; Particle identification; Particle detectors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032020657

Since a combined external and internal oxidation of the zircaloy cladding tube occurs during the reactor processing, iodine diffusion parameters in zirconia are needed. In order to obtain these data, stable iodine atoms were first introduced by ion implantation into zirconia with an energy of 200 keV and a dose equal to 8 × 1015 at cm-2. Diffusion profiles were measured using 3 MeV alpha-particle Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry at each step of the annealing procedure between 700°C and 900°C. In such experiments a reduced iodine concentration was observed, which correlated to a diffusion-like process. Similar analysis has been performed using radioactive 131I implanted at a very low dose of 109 at cm-2. In this case the iodine release is deduced from gamma-ray spectroscopy measurements. The results are discussed in this paper. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",,"Alpha particles; Annealing; Diffusion; Gamma rays; Iodine; Oxidation; Radioactive waste storage; Radioisotopes; Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy; Uranium; Zirconia; Zirconium alloys; Gamma ray spectroscopy; Ion implantation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032019607

Dynamic mechanical analysis revealed that pectin controls exhibited no thermal transitions, whereas PVOH controls exhibited a glass transition temperature (Tg) over a broad temperature range commencing at about 0°C and ending about 50°C. A mixture of 49% pectin, 21% PVOH and 30% glycerol exhibited lower storage moduli and more flexibility than comparable mixtures of either pectin/PVOH or pectin/glycerol. Scanning electron microscopy and phase contrast optical microscopy indicated that the mixture was biphasic and a compatible composite either of PVOH in pectin or pectin in PVOH depending on which macromolecule was in excess. Elongation to break measurements revealed that pectin/PVOH films underwent a brittle to ductile transition with increasing PVOH composition. The addition of glycerol to pectin/PVOH films increased ductility significantly when films were relatively brittle. Initial moduli (IM) as a function of composition gave complex curves which exhibited either one or two local maxima depending on such factors as degree of hydrolysis and molar mass of the PVOH in addition to the moisture content of the film. Solubility studies in water revealed that, at 30 and 50°C, only films with 30% PVOH or less were soluble. At 70°C, all compositions were soluble but films containing pectin dissolved more rapidly than those without. The solution kinetics of pectin/PVOH films with 30% or less PVOH were approximated with zero-order kinetics and activation energies were about 3-5 kcal mol-1. In general, addition of PVOH to pectin films resulted in films with more PVOH-like properties and addition of pectin to PVOH films resulted in films with more pectin-like properties. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The metabolic responses of the frog, Rana castabiena, were compared to those of a mammalian system (rat) throughout a prolonged period of organ storage. Livers from rats and frogs were flushed and stored in UW solution at 5°C for periods of 24-96 h. In frog livers, ATP was maintained high and constant over the first 24 h of storage; values ranged from 2.7 to 3.0 μmol/g. Even after 96 h cold storage, ATP remained &gt; 1.0 μmol/g. In contrast, ATP levels in stored rat livers dropped rapidly, and by 4 h ATP was 1.2 μmol/g. In terms of anaerobic endproduct accumulation, lactate levels rose 5.8 μmol/g in frog liver (over 96 h) and by 8.6 μmol/g in rat liver (over 24 h). This difference in flux through glycolysis was also reflected in relative rates of carbohydrate catabolism (i.e., glucose + lactate production). The rate of carbohydrate catabolism for frog liver was 0.74 μmol/g/h compared to 2.26 μmol/g/h for rat liver; a Q10 value of 6.2 was estimated for livers from R. castabiena. An assessment of glycolytic enzyme activities revealed that key differences in the responsiveness of pyruvate kinase to allosteric modifiers may have been responsible for the marked drop in the rate of anaerobic energy production in frog tissues. Although the concept of depressed metabolism in a lower vertebrate is not new, the data presented in this study demonstrate that a depressed metabolic state can be achieved in isolated livers from R. castabiena simply through cold exposure. With respect to clinical relevance, the results of this study indicate that energetics of stored livers can be maintained effectively through an efficient reduction in energy use in combination with a slow, yet continuous, rate of energy production facilitated by glycolysis. © 1998 Academic Press.","Anaerobic/depressed metabolism; Hypothermia; Hypoxia; Liver; Organ preservation","Anura; Mammalia; Vertebrata; adaptation; animal; article; cell hypoxia; cryoanesthesia; frogs and toads; liver; organ preservation; rat; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Anura; Cell Hypoxia; Hypothermia, Induced; Liver; Organ Preservation; Rats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032013645

The application of forskolin to stimulate adenylate cyclase or a membrane-permeable cyclic adenosine monophosphate mimicked the effects of ISO when the myocytes were stored with pyruvate. Pyruvate did not alter the open-channel kinetics or single-channel conductance and lacked any apparent direct effect on the Ca2+ channel activity.

This flux cannot be measured directly due to the complexity of the urban surface. The Grimmond et al. Objective Hysteresis Model (OHM) [C.S.B. Grimmond, H.A. Cleugh, T.R. Oke, An objective urban heat storage model and its comparison with other schemes, Atmos. Environ., 25B (1991) 311-326] of local-scale ΔQs combines empirical equations for individual surface types in the proportion that they are present within the urban area. One surface type for which there is very limited field data is the urban canyon, which consists of the walls of adjacent buildings, the horizontal street-level area separating them (roadways, gardens, parking lots, etc.) and the enclosed air volume. Here the storage heat flux of an urban canyon and the resulting OHM parameters are investigated with a numerical model of a dry urban canyon energy budget. Substrate heat fluxes are derived from simulated surface and substrate temperatures; the latter evolve through time according to the finite difference form of the Fourier heat conduction equation. When compared against measured fluxes, the model performed satisfactorily. Numerical experiments show significant effects on the OHM parameters due to changes in the ratio of building height to separation distance and building wall thermal properties. Effects of intermediate significance were attributable to canyon orientation, wind speed and the timing of the between-building air temperature regime. Air temperature and the timing of the wind speed curve showed only minor significance. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science S.A.","Climate; Energy budget hysteresis; Heat transfer; Objective hysteresis model; Simulation; Storage heat flux; Urban building canyon","Buildings; Computer simulation; Energy dissipation; Finite difference method; Heat transfer; Mathematical models; Urban planning; Urban building canyon; Heat flux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032002087

Two methods of preservation were compared using physiological and biochemical parameters: simple storage and oscillating perfusion. By measuring the nucleotides after preservation the calculated energy charge was significantly higher after 10 and 24 h of oscillating perfusion compared to the simple storage group. In addition, a significant energy charge loading was demonstrated by 10 h oscillating perfusion compared to the initial value prior to perfusion. The oscillating, computer-controlled perfusion permits continuous monitoring of perfusate temperature, O2 consumption, pCO2, portal vein pressure, and pH and also automatic sample collection and pH compensation. In addition, the perfusate can be easily exchanged by using two different pumps or be rewarmed by a heat exchanger. For measuring of short-lived metabolites (interleukins, oxygen radicals, prostaglandins) sampling can be performed directly out of the vena cava outflow. pH and temperature stability was maintained by a data acquisition and controlling system. Because of a special designed liver chamber a combination of storage and perfusion with or without substrates was possible.

Three rheological models, Newton, power law and Herschel-Bulkley, were applied to fit the flow behavior of milk concentrates depending on the concentration level. The resulting flow behavior indices and consistency coefficients were correlated to concentration by a single term exponential equations, with only two concentrates, 42.4 and 48.6% solids contents exhibiting yield stress. The effect of the temperatures studied on the flow behavior index was minimal, though noticeable on the consistency coefficient, and at the three selected temperatures (5, 15 and 25°C) the flow behavior index decreased with storage time while the consistency coefficient increased. The energy of activation for flow (evaluated with an Arrhenius type equation) increased with concentration and storage time and ranged from 2.42 to 11.8 kcal gmol-1. A nonlinear model accounting for temperature and concentration effects on the consistency coefficient was identified. The constants of the aforementioned nonlinear model were different for each week of storage.

An Aasted temper AMT 250 is compared to a newly developed high shear crystallizer. The main features of the high shear crystallizer are the compact design, the improved heat and mass transfer, and the highly efficient homogeneous energy dissipation. Starting from the same chocolate recipes, the differences in precrystallization between the conventional and the high shear crystallization technique are compared. Several analytical methods were used for comparison of the chocolate at process outlet and storage temperatures. In the liquid state, viscosity function and temper curves were established. The final chocolate bars, after moulding and cooling, were compared by calorimetric and color measurements. The comparison of the two processes shows that with a high shear crystallizer the same chocolate crystallization quality can be achieved at a significantly reduced residence time and lower outlet temperature. Furthermore, the new process can be easily adapted to different chocolate recipes by changing the rotational speed. Due to the improved secondary nucleation in shear flow, even lower temper values produce bloom stable chocolates. © 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

The liver corresponded to various phenomena in both the natural and social orders, according to the scheme of yin-yang and five phases. These interrelationships provided the basis for the diagnosis and treatment of liver dysfunctions. The disorders fell into three general groups: (i) hepatic qi stasis; (ii) hepatic yang excess with yin deficiency; and (iii) hepatic yin insufficiency. The signs and symptoms represented the logical outcomes of the disturbed physiology. Acupuncture, moxibustion and herbal drugs were used to redress the imbalance of hepatic qi and yin-yang.

It has been hypothesized that because body fat has a higher fitness cost than caches, small food-hoarding birds respond to increased starvation risk by increasing the number of their caches rather than their fat load. This hypothesis predicts that when birds cannot cache they should compensate for the loss of external energy storage by (1) shifting the time of their daily body mass accumulation toward earlier in the day and (2) increasing the overall level of their fat reserves. During the winter of 1995-1996, we tested these predictions with a caching species, the tufted titmouse (Parus bicolor). Each of six experimental birds was fed a diet of uncachable sunflower seed powder for 6 days, preceded and followed by 6-day control periods during which they were fed cachable sunflower seeds. The daily pattern of body mass gain was unaffected by the opportunity to cache. Furthermore, when unable to cache, the birds did not increase either their mean daily body mass, body mass in the middle of the day, or evening body mass compared to the two control periods. These results argue against the hypothesis of a trade-off between fat reserves and food caches in tufted titmice, and suggest that fat reserves are managed independently of external food caches.","Energy management; Fattening; Food-caching; Starvation risk; Trade-off","bird; body fat; caching; trade-off; Parus bicolor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031966033

We tested these predictions under laboratory conditions with variable food access (four 15-min intervals/day). Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis) were subjected to two environments: under pilferage conditions, one-quarter of their cached seeds were stolen every 0.5 h, and under no-pilferage conditions, seeds were left in place. Haft the birds started with pilferage conditions and were then switched to the no-pilferage condition; the other haft started with no pilferage and were then switched to pilferage conditions. The experiment was conducted over the course of a year to test for seasonal variation in the response to seed pilferage. The birds responded to seed pilferage by taking more seeds from a feeder, suggesting that they monitored cache availability. Alternatively, the birds may have taken additional seeds from the feeder in response to increased hunger caused by a loss of cached food. Contrary to our prediction, birds cached a higher percentage of seeds from the feeder when cached seeds were pilfered than when caches were left in place. Treatment order also affected caching behavior for all but the summer birds: chickadees initially subjected to pilferage stored a higher proportion of seeds than those initially subjected to no pilferage. Caching percentages in the summer were unaffected by cache pilferage. Caching rates (number cached/day) also followed the same trends: rates were higher when seeds were pilfered than when seeds were not pilfered, and there was a treatment-order effect for all but the summer birds. Variation in body mass also failed to match predicted trends. All birds exhibited a monotonic increase in mass as the experiments proceeded, irrespective of treatment order. Controlling for this monotonic increase in mass, an analysis of residual variation in body mass indicated that birds gained less weight when seeds were pilfered than when seeds were left in place. Finally, birds tested in the fall and spring were heavier than those tested in the summer. These results fail to support the relationship between cache maintenance and body mass regulation predicted by current models of energy regulation. We discuss the applicability of three hypotheses for the observed trends.","Body mass; Cache behavior; Cache pilferage; Chickadees; Energy regulation; Fat regulation; Food storing; Foraging behavior; Hoarding behavior; Poecile carolinensis; Seasonal variation; Tits","body mass; caching; Carolina chickadee; food stealing; seasonal variation; Animalia; Aves; Carolinensis; Paridae; Parus carolinensis; Parus carolinensis; Passeriformes; Poecile carolinensis; Poecile carolinensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031959001

Absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy have been utilized to investigate the photophysical and photochemical properties of nitrospiropyrans, both inserted in the polypeptide chain and in solution as 'free' dye. Conformational variations produced by dark storage and light exposure of the photochromic polypeptides have been studied by means of circular dichroism. Dark-kept 'free' dyes in hexafluoro-2-propanol solution in the merocyanine form ('open' form) give rise to molecular aggregates, which have been characterized as merocyanine dimers. The equilibrium constant between the monomer and the dimer, K, and their molar extinction coefficients, ε, at several wavelengths have been determined. Fluorescence measurements on 'free' and polypeptide-bound nitrospiropyrans suggest that the dimerization process between merocyanines is favored when the photochromic units are inserted in the polypeptide chain and that under these conditions an efficient energy transfer from the monomer (donor) to the dimer (acceptor) occurs. By varying 'local' as well as total nitrospiropyran concentration, it has been shown that the dimeric species result from intermolecular interactions between photochromic groups inserted in the same polypeptide chain. The α-helix → random coil transition of the polypeptide structure after dark storage has eventually been shown to be the result of the dimerization process and not of the dark isomerization per se from the 'closed' spiropyran form to the 'open' merocyanine form of the dye.",,"dimer; dye; glutamic acid derivative; merocyanine; polypeptide; pyran derivative; absorption spectroscopy; article; biological model; circular dichroism; conformational transition; darkness; dimerization; energy transfer; fluorescence spectroscopy; molecular interaction; photoreceptor; protein conformation; protein synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031957668

To assess the effect of N fertilization on N dynamics, the movements of water and nitrate were determined in a rendzina near Chalons-en-Champagne (eastern France) cropped with oilseed rape with three levels of fertilizer N and in a bare control. From in situ micrometeorological measurements, actual evapotranspiration rates were computed with an energy budget and used to calibrate an evapotranspiration model based on meteorological data and crop leaf area index. Water flow below 120 cm was then deduced from periodic measurements of soil moisture contents and precipitation, and the associated nitrate leaching fluxes were calculated from the NO3 concentration measured at the same depth. Denitrification rates and ammonia volatilization were monitored in the field after fertilizer applications, and crop assimilation of nitrogen was determined frequently during the growth cycle. A nitrate budget gave an approximation of the in situ net mineralization fluxes. The water balance was influenced by the crop and its fertilization: the crop's canopy and roots enhanced the water loss by evapotranspiration and contributed to diminish the soil water storage, whereas drainage volumes were about the same for all cropped treatments, and significantly greater in the bare soil. The rainy winter was particularly favourable to leaching, and losses were much greater (+ 41%) under the over-fertilized crop than under the non-fertilized one, but remained less (- 42%) than those under the bare control soil.",,"ammonia; denitrification; evapotranspiration; fertilizer; France; growth cycle; leaching; micrometeorology; nitrate; pollution; rapeseed oil; rendzina; water analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031957663

Treatment with pharmacological doses of insulin reduces metabolic fuel availability and suppresses both ovulatory cyclicity and pulsatile luteinizing hormone release in females of several mammalian species, but little attention has been paid to the effects of insulin treatments on reproductive behaviors. Ovariectomized Syrian hamsters were injected with long-acting insulin every 12 h for 72 h and were prevented from overeating by limiting their intake to ~110% of pretreatment levels. When given estradiol and progesterone, insulin-treated hamsters exhibited significantly reduced levels of sexual receptivity compared with saline-treated controls. This insulin-induced inhibition of estrous behavior was prevented by lesions of the area postrema. Insulin treatments also caused changes in the number of detectable estrogen receptor immunoreactive cells in the hypothalamus and preoptic area. Therefore, insulin-induced repartitioning of metabolic fuels induces changes in estrous behavior and neural estrogen receptors that are indistinguishable from those caused by food deprivation, cold exposure, or treatment with metabolic inhibitors.","Estrogen receptor; Medial preoptic area; Nutritional infertility; Obesity; Ventromedial hypothalamus","estradiol benzoate; estrogen receptor; long acting drug; luteinizing hormone; progesterone; recombinant human insulin; sodium chloride; animal experiment; animal tissue; area postrema; article; controlled study; estrus; female; insulin treatment; medial preoptic area; metabolism; nonhuman; ovariectomy; ovulation; priority journal; pulsatile hormone release; reproduction; sexual behavior; signal transduction; subcutaneous drug administration; Syrian hamster; zona incerta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031957156

Iron-absorption studies from single meals have shown that many dietary factors can influence nonheme-iron bioavailability. However, little is known about the association of these dietary factors with iron stores in free-living elderly populations. To address this question, we investigated the consumption of various dietary components and iron stores in an elderly sample of The Framingham Heart Study participants. Serum ferritin was used as a measure of body iron stores in 634 free-living elderly (67-93 y of age), and dietary intake during the previous year was assessed by a food- frequency questionnaire. The relation between serum ferritin and various dietary factors was assessed by multiple regression analysis. Subjects whose ferritin concentrations might be pathologically elevated because of infection, inflammation, liver disease, or genetic hemochromatosis were excluded from the analysis. After we controlled for sex, age, body mass index, total energy intake, smoking, and use of aspirin and other medications known to affect blood loss, we found five significant dietary factors associated with iron stores. Heme iron, supplemental iron, dietary vitamin C, and alcohol were positively associated with serum ferritin, whereas coffee intake had a negative association. As expected, sex was a strong predictor of serum ferritin-women having significantly lower mean concentrations than men. However, age was not related to serum ferritin in our elderly population. Our results suggest that in typical Western-style diets, a small number of dietary factors probably modulate the bioavailability of dietary iron and influence the accumulation of iron stores.","Aging; Dietary pattern; Heme; Iron absorption; Iron bioavailability; Meat intake; Serum ferritin; The elderly; Vitamin C","ascorbic acid; ferritin; heme; iron; aged; alcohol consumption; article; coffee; diet; diet supplementation; female; ferritin blood level; food intake; human; iron absorption; iron storage; male; meat; normal human",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031955074

Starch concentrations in root and stem tissues were determined regularly during shoot extension growth, dormancy and resprouting after dormancy. We used light microscopy (LM) combined with image analysis (IA) to determine the cellular localization and amount of starch in different cell types of stem and root tissues. Chemical analysis confirmed that starch concentrations were lower in plants receiving a high-N supply rate than in plants receiving a low-N supply rate. In all plants, the highest concentration of starch was in the roots. Light microscopy and IA showed that starch accumulated mainly in the phloem and cortical cells of both root and stem tissues. Starch grains were also regularly found in ray parenchyma cells. The amount of starch as well as the size of the grains showed strong seasonal fluctuations. In both roots and stems, starch concentrations were highest during predormancy and lowest during periods of shoot extension growth. At the time of resprouting, root cells of decapitated plants were more depleted of starch than root cells of intact plants, supporting the hypothesis that starch reserves in roots are important during the early phase of resprouting in coppice systems.","Accumulation; Decapitation; Energy forestry; Mobilization; Nutritional status; Resprouting; Storage compounds","Salix; Salix viminalis; Salix viminalis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031949656

However, fatty acid (FA) oxidation is limited, especially during intense exercise, and CHO remains the major fuel for oxidative metabolism. In the search for strategies to improve athletic performance, recent interest has focused on several nutritional procedures which may theoretically promote FA oxidation, attenuate the rate of muscle glycogen depletion and improve exercise capacity. In some individuals the ingestion of caffeine improves endurance capacity, but L-carnitine supplementation has no effect on either rates of FA oxidation, muscle glycogen utilisation or performance. Likewise, the ingestion of small amounts of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) has no major effect on either fat metabolism or exercise performance. On the other hand, in endurance-trained individuals, substrate utilisation during submaximal [60% of peak oxygen uptake (V̇O(2peak))] exercise can be altered substantially by the ingestion of a high fat (60 to 70% of energy intake), low CHO (15 to 20% of energy intake) diet for 7 to 10 days. Adaptation to such a diet, however, does not appear to alter the rate of working muscle glycogen utilisation during prolonged, moderate intensity exercise, nor consistently improve performance. At present, there is insufficient scientific evidence to recommend that athletes either ingest fat, in the form of MCTs, during exercise, or 'fat-adapt' in the weeks prior to a major endurance event to improve athletic performance.",,"caffeine; carnitine; fatty acid; glycogen; medium chain triacylglycerol; aerobic metabolism; athlete; caloric intake; diet; diet supplementation; endurance; exercise; glycogen muscle level; human; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; normal human; oxidation; oxygen consumption; performance; physical capacity; rat; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031947773

Small bowel segments were isolated from rats, flushed with either UW or Celsior solution, and cold-stored for 18 h at 4°C in the respective solution. After ischemic storage, some preparations were freeze-clamped for analysis of tissue metabolites while other preparations were tested for structural and functional integrity by isolated perfusion in vitro using a previously validated model. After 18 h of ischemic storage no significant differences were seen between Celsior and UW with regard to the development of edema, energy charge, or creatine phosphate, but lactate accumulation was significantly reduced in the Celsior group, although glucose catabolism was not inhibited. Histological evaluation of the cold-stored organs showed no differences with regard to structural integrity between the two groups. Total vascular resistance upon reperfusion was significantly lower in the Celsior group (666 ± 126 vs 827 ± 88 MPa s m-3*), as was the intestinal release of LDH (9.7 ± 4.4 vs 18.2 ± 4.6 U/l*).

Although iron deposition was distributed as in Hallervorden Spatz syndrome, no spheriod was detectable. On the other hand, multiple system degeneration was observed mainly in the pallido-nigral and dentato-rubral systems which resembled pallido-nigro-luysian degeneration. However, the clinical course and manifestations, and the neuropathology of this case were not completely consistent with any previous report. Differential diagnosis and classification of the case axe discussed, and the genetic diagnostic procedures are presented. We also investigated the subcellular localization of elemental iron in glial cells using energy- dispersive X-ray spectral analysis. A small amount of elementary iron was clearly demonstrated in some regions of membrane-bound electron-dense material presumably derived from lysosomes. Further accumulation of clinical and neuropathological data in such cases will provide some clues to discover the etiology and classification of multiple system degeneration that occurs in association with iron deposition.","Energy-dispersive X-ray spectral analysis; Hallervorden Spatz syndrome; Iron deposition; Multiple system degeneration; Pallido-nigro-luysian degeneration","iron; adult; article; cellular distribution; dentate gyrus; globus pallidus; hallervorden spatz disease; human; human tissue; iron storage; male; nigroneostriatal system; priority journal; X ray analysis; Cytoplasm; Humans; Iron; Male; Microscopy, Electron; Middle Aged; Multiple System Atrophy; Nerve Degeneration; Neuroglia; Spectrum Analysis; Subcellular Fractions; Trinucleotide Repeats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031938749

The mutant exhibits several morphological alterations and a permanent activation of the strategy I reactions of iron uptake as well as iron accumulation in roots and leaves. The electron microscopic energy loss technique of energy spectroscopic imaging (ESI) was used to localise the iron accumulated in the organs of wild-type and mutant plants. Iron-containing particles were detected in the chloroplast stroma and in vacuoles of mutant leaves, and in root cells in vacuoles and in mitochondria. In wild-type organs such particles were found at the same sites but they were smaller in size and occurred less frequently. The findings indicate that these compartments are preferential sites of iron storage or deposition in tomato tissues. It is discussed that the iron-containing particles detected are the result of iron release by oxidative stress. Application of nicotianamine to mutant plants, which reverts the mutant phenotype, led to a significant decrease of the iron-containing particles. This is seen as an indication that they may serve as intermediate iron stores and emphasises the crucial role of nicotianamine for the normal iron distribution in cells and organs.","Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Iron-containing particles; Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.; Mutant chloronerva; Oxidative stress; Subcellular localisation","cellular distribution; chloroplast; electron microscopy; mitochondrion; mutant; plant genetics; spectroscopy; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031935577

The endothermic peak of sulindac due to the fusion of drug disappeared in DSC thermograms for the coprecipitate product, which confirmed the interaction between sulindac and β-CD in the solid state. After a 1-year storage drug crystals could not be observed by x-ray diffractometry, which indicated that the complex formed was stable. The complex showed the fastest dissolution rate which might be attributed to the high-energy noncrystalline state and the inclusion complex formation in solution. UV spectra were modified and the apparent solubility of the drug increased with the addition of β-CD, which confirmed the interaction between sulindac and the ligand in solution. The apparent stability constant, K(1:1), for the complex at pH 2 and 25, 30, and 37°C was 340, 220, and 160 M-1, respectively, which confirmed the influence of temperature on the complex stability.

Current algorithms for differentiation of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias are based on ventricular sensing solely and, therefore, lack sensitivity and specificity. This preliminary analysis from a multicenter trial comprises data from the first 26 patients who received a Res-Q™ Micron active-can ICD (Sulzer Intermedics) with a ventricular defibrillation lead and an additional bipolar lead for atrial sensing. Digitized atrial and ventricular waveform storage as well as interval charts from 102 induced and 30 spontaneous arrhythmia episodes were prospectively collected and analyzed with regard to appropriateness of ICD therapy. From all 132 arrhythmia episodes, high-quality stored dual-chamber intracardiac electrograms (IEGM) could be retrieved for further analysis: in 40 (30%) episodes, atrial fibrillation (AF with rapid ventricular response 22, AF with VT 9, AF with VF 9) was identified as the underlying intrinsic rhythm, and inappropriate ICD therapy was delivered in 4/22 (18%) episodes of AF with rapid ventricular response. In the remaining 92 (70%) episodes, sinus rhythm was the underlying atrial rhythm (SR with VT 13, SR with VF 79), and no inappropriate therapy was observed. Three of 22 (15%) high-energy shocks delivered for ventricular arrhythmias (VT9, VF 9, rapid AF 4) terminated AF at the same time. In total, there were 3 complications (2 atrial lead dislodgments, 1 revision for bleeding). Both atrial lead dislodgments occurred in the 2 patients with passive-fixation leads compared to none in the 24 patients with active-fixation leads (p = 0.003). In conclusion, dual-chamber sensing and waveform storage of the new Res-Q™ Micron offer very helpful diagnostic tools for the detection of inappropriate ICD-therapy. Placement of an additional atrial lead is safe and does not interfere with proper ICD function. However, for avoidance of atrial lead dislodgment, active fixation leads are recommended. With the tested active-can lead configuration, the efficacy of successful atrial cardioversion by high-energy shocks delivered for ventricular arrhythmias seems to be low.","Implantable cardioverter defibrillator; Sensing; Supraventricular arrhythmias; Ventricular arrhythmias","adult; aged; clinical article; clinical trial; conference paper; defibrillator; electrocardiography; female; heart atrium fibrillation; heart supraventricular arrhythmia; heart ventricle arrhythmia; human; male; multicenter study; sinus rhythm; Algorithms; Defibrillators, Implantable; Electrodes, Implanted; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Tachycardia, Supraventricular",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031929948

It was shown that wide variations in the ratio of carbohydrate to fat do not alter total 24-h energy need. Studies of the fatty acid composition of plasma low-density lipoproteins during low- fat feeding indicated that there can be considerable lipogenesis from carbohydrate in humans during isoenergetic feeding. The energy cost of this conversion must be small or be counterbalanced by other changes in energy metabolism because measured energy need was unaltered by fat-to-carbohydrate ratios. Energy need was, however, markedly varied by changes in body weight. Subjects at their usual body weights who had experimentally induced increases in body weight became inefficient and required a higher energy intake for weight maintenance. The reverse occurred with a reduction in body weight. The set point at which energy storage is defended is clearly different in obese persons.","Adipose tissue; Diet composition; Dietary carbohydrate; Energy balance; Humans; Lipogenesis; Obesity","low density lipoprotein; body weight; conference paper; energy balance; energy cost; energy metabolism; food intake; human; human cell; human tissue; protein blood level; weight gain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031929696

The equation includes net radiation, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, bottom heat flux, heat storage, and energy available for melting. The energy balance is determined with a time-dependent 10-layer thermodynamic model of the ice slab that determines the surface temperature and the ice temperature profile using 3-h forcing values. The observations used for the forcing values are the 2-m air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, the cloud fraction, the snow depth and density, and the albedo of the nonponded ice. The downwelling radiative fluxes are estimated with parameterizations based on the cloud cover, the air temperature and humidity, and the solar angle. The linear relationship between the air temperature and both the cloud fraction and the wind speed is also determined for each month of the year. The annual cycles of the mean values of the terms of the energy balance equation are all nearly equal to those calculated by others based on mean climatological forcing values. The short-term variability, from 3 h to 16 days, of both the forcings and the fluxes, is investigated on a seasonal basis with the discreet wavelet transform. Significant diurnal cycles are found in the net radiation, storage, and melt, but not in the sensible or latent heat fluxes. The total annual ice-melt averages 0.67 m, ranges between 0.29 and 1.09 m, and exhibits large variations from year to year. It is closely correlated with the albedo and, to a lesser extent, with the latitude and the length of the melt season.",,"energy balance; heat storage; ice; latent heat flux; sensible heat flux; Arctic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031927876

The model is based on the conservation equations of energy for the phase change material (PCM) and the heat transfer fluid (HTF). Electrical heat sources embedded inside the PCM are used for heat storage (melting) while the flow of an HTF is employed for heat recovery (solidification). Parametric studies are performed to assess the effect of various design parameters and operating conditions on the thermal behaviour of the unit. Results indicate that the average output heat load during the recovery period is strongly dependent on the minimum operating temperature, on the thermal diffusivity of the liquid phase, on the thickness of the PCM layer and on the HTF inlet mass flowrate and temperature. It is, on the other hand, nearly independent of the wall thermal diffusivity and thickness and of the maximum operating temperature. Correlations are proposed for the total energy stored and the output heat load as a function of the design parameters and the operating conditions. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Heat transfer fluid; Latent heat storage system; Phase change material","energy; heat; heat transfer; mathematical modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031925065

The type of polymer produced depends on the carbon sources available, the flexibility of the organism's intermediary metabolism, and the substrate specificity of the PHA biosynthetic enzymes. Ralstonia eutropha produces both the homopolymer poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and, when provided with the appropriate substrate, the copolymer poly(β- hydroxybutyrate-co-β-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV). A required step in production of the hydroxyvalerate moiety of PHBV is the condensation of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and propionyl-CoA to form β-ketovaleryl-CoA. This activity has generally been attributed to the β-ketothiolase encoded by R. eutropha phbA. However, we have determined that PhbA does not significantly contribute to catalyzing this condensation reaction. Here we report the cloning and genetic analysis of bktB, which encodes a β-ketothiolase from R. eutropha that is capable of forming β-ketovaleryl-CoA. Genetic analyses determined that BktB is the primary condensation enzyme leading to production of β- hydroxyvalerate derived from propionyl-CoA.

Numerous scientific studies have shown that increasing the exercise intensity leads to a progressive utilization of CHO. The latter will induce a state of glycogen depletion which is generally recognized as being a limiting factor for the continuation of strenuous exercise. Different dietary interventions have been proposed to overcome this limitation. A high-CHO diet during periods of intense training and competition, as well as CHO intake during exercise, are known to maintain a high rate of CHO oxidation and to delay fatigue. However, it has been recognized also that enhancing fatty acid (FA) oxidation during exercise induces a reduced rate of glycogen degradation, resulting in an improved endurance capacity. This is most strikingly observed as a result of frequent endurance exercise which improves a number of factors known to govern the FA flux and the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle. Such factors are: (1) blood flow and capillarization; (2) lipolysis of triacylglycerol (TAG) in adipose tissue and circulating TAG and transport of FA from blood plasma to the sarcoplasm; (3) availability and rate of hydrolysis of intramuscular TAG; (4) activation of the FA and transport across the mitochondrial membrane; (5) the activity of enzymes in the oxidative pathway; (6) hormonal adaptations, i.e. sensitivity to catecholamines and insulin. The observation that the plasma FA concentration is an important factor in determining the rate of FA oxidation, and that some dietary factors may influence the rate of FA supply to muscle as well as to the mitochondria, has led to a number of dietary interventions with the ultimate goal to enhance FA oxidation and endurance performance. It appears that experimental data are not equivocal that dietary interventions, such as a high-fat diet, medium-chain TAG-fat emulsions and caffeine intake during exercise, as well as L-carnitine supplementation, do significantly enhance FA oxidation during exercise. So far, only regular endurance exercise can be classified as successful in achieving adaptations which enhance FA mobilization and oxidation.","Caffeine; Exercise; Fat intake; L-carnitine; Medium-chain triacylglycerols","caffeine; carnitine; catecholamine derivative; fatty acid; glycogen; insulin; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; aerobic metabolism; blood flow; carbohydrate intake; carbohydrate metabolism; endurance; exercise; fat intake; fatigue; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; glycogen metabolism; human; hydrolysis; lipid metabolism; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipolysis; mitochondrion; review; sarcoplasm; skeletal muscle; training",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031917149

The geological weathering fronts of calcareous sedimentary rock were investigated by examining the bulk density, porosity, and distribution of Ca, Fe, and Mn. Core samples were taken of soil, saprolite, and bedrock material from both summit (HHMS-4B) and sideslope (HHMS-5A) positions on an interbedded Nolichucky shale and Maryville limestone landform in Solid Waste Storage Area 6 (SWSA-6). This is a low-level radioactive solids waste disposal site on the Dept. of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Reservation in Roane County Tennessee. This work was initiated because data about the properties of highly weathered sedimentary rock on this site were limited. The core samples were analyzed for pH, calcium carbonate equivalence (CCE), hydroxylamine-extractable (HA) Mn, and dithionite-citrate (CBD)-extractable Fe and Mn. Low pH values occurred from the soil surface down to the depth of the oxidized and leached saprolite in both cores. The CCE and HA-extractable Mn results were also influenced by the weathering that has occurred in these zones. Extractable Mn oxide was higher at a lower depth in the oxidized and leached saprolite compared with the Fe oxide, which was higher in the overlying soil solum. Amounts of Mn oxides were higher in the side-slope core (HHMS-5A) than in the summit core (HHMS-4B). Iron was more abundant in the deeper weathered summit core, but the highest value, 39.4 g kg-1, was found at 1.8 to 2.4 m in the sideslope core. The zone encompassing the oxidized and partially leached saprolite down to the unoxidized and unleached bedrock had higher densities and larger quantities of CaCO3 than the soil solum and oxidized and leached saprolite. The overlying soil and oxidized and leached saprolite had lower pH and CCE values and were higher in Fe and Mn oxides than the oxidized and unleached saprolite. The distribution of Fe and Mn is important when evaluating soil and saprolite for hazardous waste disposal site assessment.","Calcarious sedimentary rock; Iron oxides; Manganese oxides; Saprolite; Weathering","calcareous rock; iron; manganese; radioactive waste disposal; saprolite; sedimentary rock; soil; weathering; Oak Ridge Reservation; Tennessee; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031907678

Nash]. A field study was established in 1986 and from 1988 to 1991 treatments were applied with burning in March, April, or May with unburned controls. Forage was harvested from plots 1 (June), 2 (June and July), or 3 (June, July, and August) times with unharvested control plots included. Treatments were applied to the same plots annually and were arranged in a split-split plot, randomized complete block design. The main plot was species, the subplot was burning, and the sub-subplot was harvest frequency. Big bluestem produced 147 and 122% more etiolated biomass in spring than did switchgrass or indiangrass, respectively. Effects of harvest management on plant vigor occurred after 1 growing-season, but changed little during the remainder of the study. Etiolated biomass declined more as harvest frequency increased from 2 to 3 harvests than from 1 to 2 harvests (213, 205, and 162 g m-2 for 1, 2, and 3 harvests per summer, respectively). Big bluestem produced 95 and 33% more tillers than switchgrass and indiangrass, respectively, and burning stimulated tillering an average of 32% across all species and harvest treatments. Harvest frequency increased tiller density. However, plant vigor as measured by etiolated growth decreased as harvest frequency increased. This suggests that with these species tillering may occur at the expense of energy storage with frequent defoliation. Vigorous spring etiolated growth and high tillering potential may partially explain the dominance of big bluestem in the tallgrass prairie.","Andropogon gerardii; Basal cover; Energy reserves; Etiolated growth; Panicum virgatum; Sorghastrum nutans; Tiller density","burning; harvest frequency; indiangrass; switchgrass; tallgrass prairie; vigor; Andropogon gerardii; Panicum virgatum; Poaceae; Sorghastrum nutans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031907411

In our companion paper we examine relationships with soil moisture, biomass production, and nutrient assimilation. Randomization and replication were key components to our study of microclimate under tropical radiation conditions. The bare Oxisol control soil exhibited the most extreme microclimatic conditions with the lowest albedo (not significantly different from that of P300® North American Green, a dark green polypropylene system), and the highest mean and maximum hourly temperatures recorded at depths of 5 and 8 cm. This hostile climatic environment was not conducive to biomass production or moisture storage and it is likely that the observed soil surface crusts impeded plant emergence. Rolled erosion control systems, on the other hand, generally moderated soil temperatures by reflecting more shortwave radiation, implying less heat energy at the surface for conduction to the soil. The result was that RECS exhibited lower mean soil temperatures, higher minimum temperatures and lower maximum soil temperatures. An aspen excelsior system (Curlex I® Excelsior) had the highest albedo and the soil beneath this system exhibited the greatest temperature modulation. Open-weave systems composed of jute (Geojute® Price & Pictures) and coconut fibers (BioD-Mat 70® RoLanka) were the RECS most similar in temperature response to the bare control soil.

Etiolated growth measurements of nonstructural biomass (NSB) are a reliable method for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) taproots. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is another method that has been used to determine TNC of alfalfa. Rhizomes were sampled monthly from four locations within a field. The NSB was correlated (r = 0.74) with the TNC means from each sampling date. The NIRS calibration was highly correlated with the TNC of all samples (R2=0.96). Both NSB and TNC decreased in summer and increased in the fall as the plant stored carbohydrate for winter survival and regrowth. Any of the three methods could be used to study energy storage, although NIRS is the quickest, and NSB the least technologically sophisticated. Based on the positive results of NIRS, a more comprehensive calibration is warranted.","Etiolated growth; Fructans; Near infrared spectroscopy; Total nonstructural carbohydrate","Medicago sativa; Mentha piperita",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031903042

Changes in physiological condition may be an early indication of stress, because the increased energy demand associated with stress often results in a depletion of glycogen reserves, the principal storage form of carbohydrates in unionid mussels. Our goal was to nonlethally extract tissue from freshwater mussels and then to develop a rapid and dependable method for the analysis of glycogen in the tissue extracts. A biopsy technique was developed to remove between 5 and 10 mg of food tissue in Amblema plicata plicata. The survival rate did not differ between biopsied and non-biopsied mussels during a 581-d observation period, demonstrating that the biopsy technique will allow nonlethal evaluation of the physiological condition of individual mussels through measurement of changes in contaminant, genetic, and biochemical indicators in tissue. We also modified the standard alkaline digestion and phenol-sulfuric acid analysis of glycogen for use on the small samples of biopsied tissue and to reduce analysis time and cost. We present quality control data, including method detection limits and estimates of precision and bias. The modified analytical method is rapid and accurate and has a method detection limit of 0.014 mg glycogen. Glycogen content in the biopsied samples was well above the method detection limit; it ranged from 0.09 to 0.36 mg, indicating that the method should be applicable to native mussels.","Amblema; Foot biopsy; Freshwater mussels; Glycogen; Nonlethal sampling; Physiological condition; Unionidae","analytical technique; biopsy; glycogen; mussel; Amblema plicata plicata; Bivalvia; Unionidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031901734

Food intake and body weight were monitored daily. Rats were killed after 14 days of infusion. Carcass and fatpad weights were measured, and body compositions were determined. Food intake was not different during the first week of infusion; however, cumulative food intake was decreased in the 0.1 M 5-TG group during the second week as compared to the CSF control group. Body weight and carcass weight of this group also decreased as compared to the control. The group receiving the higher dose of 5-TG (0.1 M) had increased fatpad weights in all three depots examined (inguinal, retroperitoneal, and perimetrial depot); the group with lower dose of 5-TG infusion (0.01 M) increased the fatpad weights in the retroperitoneal and perimetrial depot, as compared to the CSF group. Data from the body composition analysis were consistent with the results of the fatpad weights. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that chronic fourth ventricular 5-TG infusion increased body fat without increasing food intake, suggesting that energy expenditure is decreased under this condition. The results of this study indicate that glucose metabolism in the hindbrain is important in the control of energy expenditure, body fat deposition, and thus energy balance regulation.",,"thioglucose; animal experiment; article; body fat; controlled study; energy balance; female; food intake; glucose homeostasis; intracerebroventricular drug administration; lipid storage; neuromodulation; nonhuman; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031893438

Excessive accumulation of triacylglycerol fatty acids (obesity) is associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Some of these abnormalities may be related to dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism. Body fat distribution exerts a major influence on endogenous nonesterified fatty acid metabolism, which may in turn mediate some of the metabolic abnormalities associated with upper-body obesity. The effects of diet on fatty acid metabolism can be dramatic and are not the same in upper-body and lower-body obesity. Different obesity phenotypes may respond differently to low-fat, high-complex-carbohydrate diets, and the response is further modified depending on whether the diet is isoenergetic or restricted in energy.","Adipose tissue; Body fat distribution; Diet composition; Humans; Insulin; Nonesterified fatty acids; Obesity; Triacylglycerol","adipose tissue; body fat; conference paper; esterification; fatty acid metabolism; human; human cell; human tissue; lipid composition; obesity; phenotype",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031883752

Because the influence of metabolism on eating behavior depends on where and in what way metabolic fuels are utilized, the partitioning of fuels among different tissues and between metabolic pathways has significant effects on food intake. There is substantial evidence that shifts in fat fuel partitioning between oxidation and storage influence food intake, and data indicate that this may also be the case for carbohydrates. Carbohydrate and fat fuel interactions appear to affect eating behavior, and may play a role in the overconsumption of high-fat diets. A mechanism for the control of eating behavior that is sensitive to a stimulus generated at the level of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production may underlie changes in food intake associated with shifts in fuel partitioning. A model based on such a mechanism provides a framework for understanding changes in food intake under a variety of conditions associated with alterations in energy storage and expenditure, including obesity and cachexia.","Anorexia; Cachexia; Eating behavior; Energy intake; Energy metabolism; Fuel partitioning; Hum ans; Hyperphagia; Hypophagia; Obesity; Overeating; Rats","adenosine triphosphate; behavior; conference paper; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; feeding behavior; food intake; food storage; human; human cell; human tissue; overnutrition; oxidative phosphorylation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031883288

If these attributes of dietary fat were counteracted by a high satiating power, or if the body made autoregulatory adjustments in fat utilization in response to high fat intakes, energy balance would not necessarily be displaced. However, recent experiments have shown that neither of these hold true: human and animal trials consistently show that covert manipulation of dietary fat can induce hyperphagia, which can readily lead to spontaneous fat storage of 50-100 g/d in humans. Experiments with isoenergy- dense diets show that this high-fat hyperphagia (with diets of similar palatability) is caused by the high energy density of fatty foods rather than by their other attributes. Hyperphagia has therefore been termed passive overconsumption because it occurs unintentionally and without the consumption of excess bulk. When palatability is allowed to vary normally, high-fat foods may additionally induce active overconsumption in response to the enhanced organoleptic qualities of fats. In terms of substrate flux, fat is at the bottom of an oxidative hierarchy that determines fuel selection. Whereas alcohol, carbohydrates, and protein elicit powerful autoregulatory adjustments in their oxidation in response to changes in intake, fat fails to elicit such a response and fat balance is therefore easily displaced. These physiologic observations provide mechanistic support for secular-trend, cross-cultural, and cross-sectional epidemiologic studies investigating the role of energy-dense diets in the etiology of obesity.","Dietary fat; Energy density; Food intake; High-fat hyperphagia; Obesity; Substrate flux","alcohol; carbohydrate; protein; autoregulation; conference paper; energy balance; fat intake; female; food intake; human; human cell; human tissue; hyperphagia; male; obesity; palatability; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031882498

The nature and severity of CNS dysfunction depend upon the aetiology and degree of hyperammonaemia, its acuteness of onset and the age of the patient. Neuropathological studies reveal Alzheimer type II astrocytosis in the adult hyperammonaemic patient, whereas hyperammonaemia in the infant resulting from congenital urea cycle disorders or Reye syndrome is accompanied by cerebral atrophy, neuronal loss and cerebral oedema. Several electro-physiological and biochemical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the deleterious effects of ammonia on CNS function. Such mechanisms include direct effects of the ammonium ion on excitatory and inhibitory neuro-transmission and a deficit in cerebral energy metabolism due to ammonia-induced inhibition of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. In addition, ammonia has been shown to interfere with normal processes of uptake, storage and release of various neurotransmitters. Ammonia disrupts monoamine storage, inhibits the high-affinity uptake of glutamate by both astrocytic and neuronal elements and activates 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine receptors leading to the potential synthesis of neuroactive steroids in brain. On the basis of these actions, it has been proposed that ammonia disrupts neuron-astrocyte trafficking of amino acids and monoamines in brain. The increased formation of brain glutamine in hyperammonaemic syndromes could be responsible for the phenomenon of brain oedema in these disorders. Therapies aimed at either decreasing ammonia production in the gastrointestinal tract or increasing ammonia removal by liver or skeletal muscle are the mainstay in the prevention and treatment of the CNS consequences of hyperammonaemia. New therapeutic approaches aimed at correction of the neurotransmitter and cerebral energy deficits in these syndromes could hold promise for the future. © SSIEM and Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"amino acid; ammonia; benzodiazepine receptor; glutamine; monoamine; neurotransmitter; oxoglutarate dehydrogenase; ammonia formation; astrocyte; astrocytosis; ataxia; brain atrophy; brain edema; brain function; brain level; central nervous system function; cognitive defect; coma; conference paper; convulsion; disease severity; energy metabolism; enzyme inhibition; human; hyperammonemia; mood; nerve cell necrosis; neurotransmission; onset age; personality disorder; reye syndrome; urea cycle; Ammonia; Astrocytes; Brain; Brain Diseases; Energy Metabolism; Glutamic Acid; Glutamine; Humans; Neurotransmitter Agents; Receptors, Glutamate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031879678

Allocation patterns were determined by comparing lipid content of eggs and hatchlings, to determine whether females of species with hatchlings that exhibit a delayed nest-emergence strategy: (1) allocate higher proportions of energy storage lipids to eggs, (2) produce hatchlings with higher levels of storage lipids, and (3) have higher levels of pre-ovulatory parental investment in comparison to species whose hatchlings exhibit immediate emergence. Whereas total non-polar lipid (NPL) proportions by dry mass of eggs varied significantly among species, NPL proportions of hatchlings were not significantly different. Pre-ovulatory parental investment in care (proportion of hatchling NPL to egg NPL) was 40, 50, and 55% for K. subrubrum, S. minor, and S. odoratus, respectively. Lipid class composition of eggs and hatchlings was studied to distinguish lipids allocated for energy storage from those allocated to other functions. For both eggs and hatchlings, individual lipid classes (triacylglycerol, triacylglycerol fatty acid, cholesterol, cholesterol ester, and phospholipid) as proportions of total lipid, were similar among species. The major lipid class component of eggs and hatchlings of all species was triacylglycerol (>83%), an energy storage lipid. Substantial changes in lipid classes during embryogenesis were similar among species and included: (1) depletion of triacylglycerol, (2) increase in cholesterol esters, and (3) changes in phospholipid composition. Incubation time varied significantly among species, and appeared to be responsible for differential energy utilization during embryogenesis. Our results are inconsistent with the previously observed pattern that hatchlings exhibiting a delayed nest-emergence strategy are allocated higher proportions of energy storage lipids than those that exhibit immediate emergence. However, because the species that overwinters in the nest (K. subrubrum) hatches approximately 40 days later than the species that typically does not (S. odoratus), hatchling K. subrubrum may contain higher non-polar lipid proportions than hatchling S. odoratus during similar winter time periods. Kinosternid hatchlings contain enough stored lipids to support basal maintenance costs for substantial time periods. We suggest that such reserves may be critical to hatchling survival during a period of negative energy balance, regardless of nest emergence strategy.

Prospect Road, Fort Collins, CO 80526, United States","Most forests in North America remain nitrogen limited, although recent studies have identified forested areas that exhibit symptoms of N excess, analogous to overfertilization of arable land. Nitrogen excess in watersheds is detrimental because of disruptions in plant/soil nutrient relations, increased soil acidification and aluminum mobility, increased emissions of nitrogenous greenhouse gases from soil, reduced methane consumption in soil, decreased water quality, toxic effects on freshwater biota, and eutrophication of coastal marine waters. Elevated nitrate (NO3/-) loss to groundwater or surface waters is the primary symptom of N excess. Additional symptoms include increasing N concentrations and higher N:nutrient ratios in foliage (i.e., N:Mg, N:P), foliar accumulation of amino acids or NO3/-, and low soil C:N ratios. Recent nitrogen-fertilization studies in New England and Europe provide preliminary evidence that some forests receiving chronic N inputs may decline in productivity and experience greater mortality. Long-term fertilization at Mount Ascutney, Vermont, suggests that declining and slow N-cycling coniferous stands may be replaced by fast-growing and fast N-cycling deciduous forests. Symptoms of N saturation are particularly severe in high-elevation, nonaggrading spruce-fir ecosystems in the Appalachian Mountains and in eastern hardwood watersheds at the Fernow Experimental Forest near Parsons, West Virginia. In the Los Angeles Air Basin, mixed conifer forests and chaparral watersheds with high smog exposure are N saturated and exhibit the highest streamwater NO3/- concentrations for wildlands in North America. High-elevation alpine watersheds in the Colorado Front Range and a deciduous forest in Ontario, Canada, are N saturated, although N deposition is moderate (~8 kg·ha-1·yr-1). In contrast, the Harvard Forest hardwood stand in Massachusetts has absorbed &gt;900 kg N/ha during 8 yr of N amendment studies without significant NO3/- leaching, illustrating that ecosystems vary widely in the capacity to retain N inputs. Overly mature forests with high N deposition, high soil N stores, and low soil C:N ratios are prone to N saturation and NO3/- leaching. Additional characteristics favoring low N retention capacity include a short growing season (reduced plant N demand) and reduced contact time between drainage water and soil (i.e., porous coarse-textured soils, exposed bedrock or talus). Temporal patterns of hydrologic fluxes interact with biotic uptake and internal cycling patterns in determining ecosystem N retention. Soils are the largest storage pool for N inputs, although vegetation uptake is also important. Recent studies indicate that nitrification may be widespread in undisturbed ecosystems, and that microbial assimilation of NO3/- may be a significant N retention mechanism, contrary to previous assumptions. Further studies are needed to elucidate the sites, forms, and mechanisms of N retention and incorporation into soil organic matter, and to test potential management options for mitigating N losses from forests. Implementation of intensive management practices in N-saturated ecosystems may only be feasible in high-priority areas and on a limited scale. Reduction of N emissions would be a preferable solution, although major reductions in the near future are unlikely in many areas due to economic, energy-use, policy, and demographic considerations.","Atmospheric nitrogen deposition; Eutrophication; Forest ecosystems; Nitrate leaching; Nitrogen cycling; Nitrogen saturation; Soil acidification","ecosystem function; forest; nitrogen; nutrient enrichment; watershed; North America; Abies; cellular organisms; Coniferophyta; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031873902

The two sites were AECL, a primarily deciduous forest with fine sandy soils, and PNFI, a mixed forest over a thin sandy-loam soil. The objective of the study was to investigate spatial heterogeneity in energy fluxes in a mixed forest landscape by examining interannual variations in radiation and energy balance components between the sites. The two sites showed small differences in albedo and net radiation. Total heat storage was not different between the two sites, yet there were some differences in the relative magnitudes of the storage components. The largest between-site differences were in energy partitioning between the convective fluxes of sensible heat, QH, and latent heat, QE. The QH was usually larger at PNFI and QE was usually larger at AECL. Thus, Bowen ratios were almost always smaller at AECL. The magnitude of these differences was controlled by soil moisture stress, with moisture stress frequently observed at PNFI but not at AECL. The implications of these results for regional-scale surface-vegetation-atmosphere climate modelling are discussed.",,"energy budget; forest; micrometeorology; radiation; summer; temporal variation; Canada, Ontario",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031872230

In order to identify optimal storage conditions, we investigated the effects of temperature (-5 to 45°C) and water content (&lt;0.17 g H2O g-1 dry weight) on longevity of Typha latifolia L. pollen. Longevity was highest at water contents corresponding to storage relative humidity (RH) of 11-15% which corresponded to the shoulder of water sorption isotherms. Also coinciding with this shoulder were abrupt changes in heat capacity of water present in the pollen. Consistent with changes in isotherms with temperature and the concept of critical RH for storage, optimum water contents increased with decreasing temperature. An attempt was made to explain the aging behavior according to the glass concept. The water content-temperature combinations of optimal storage were found to be below the glass transition curve, indicating that optimum storage conditions are achieved when intracellular glasses are present. We also found a change in activation energy of aging in Arrhenius plots around T(g), demonstrating a change in aging kinetics when the glassy state is lost. We conclude that T(g) curves cannot be used solely to predict precise conditions of optimum storage, but might be useful for predictions of storage longevity above optimum water contents. The data imply that too much drying reduces longevity and should be avoided, particularly when cryogenic storage is considered.","Aging; Glass; Longevity; Pollen; Relative humidity; Storage; Typha latifolia; Ultra-dry storage; Water activity","dry weight; drying; genetic resources; germplasm; humidity; longevity; pollen; storage; water; Typha latifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031868543

Thus, these Fe-rich particles are of common occurrence in seeds of this conifer family. These particles were most difficult to locate in Pseudolarix amabilis, which has green embryos. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis was used to determine the elements present in conifer Fe-rich particles and phytoferritin deposits in pea embryo axes. Fe-rich particles from all species studied contained mainly Fe and P but also contained considerable K and Mg. Abietoideae group I (genera Cedrus and Abies) had lower Fe: P ratios compared to all the other combined subfamilies within the Pinaceae. Pea phytoferritin deposits contained markedly lower amounts of P relative to Fe based on peak-to-background ratios and quantitative values calculated by using a ferric phosphate standard. We also found, for the first time, that pea phytoferritin contained considerable K. A strong similarity was found between the energy-dispersive X-ray analysis spectra from Fe-rich particles and portions of a laboratory-synthesized Fe, K, Mg phytate salt. Phytate is a common mineral-nutrient storage compound in seeds. The possibility of these Fe-rich particles being phytoferritin cannot be ruled out, but if they are phytoferritin, they have lower Fe: P ratios than almost all other ferritins reported to date.","Embryo; Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis; Iron-rich particles; Pinaceae; Seeds","embryo; ferric phosphate; iron; phytoferritin; X ray analysis; Abies; Cedrus; Pinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031863556

To quantify ontogenetic variations in the nutritional condition of the deposit-feeding polychaete Pseudopolydora kempi japonica, I modified existing spectrofluorometric assays of neutral and polar lipids. The hydrophobic fluorochrome Nile red fluoresces yellow-orange when bound to neutral lipids and red-orange when bound to polar lipids. The ratio of neutral lipids (energy storage) to polar lipids (cell membranes) provides an index of nutritional condition that is scaled to body size. For individual P. kempi japonica ranging in length from 2 to 12 mm, I quantified the florescence from each lipid class and analyzed size-dependent variations in the neutral/polar lipid ratio. P. kempi japonica showed a size-dependent increase in the neutral/polar lipid ratio up to a body length of ~6-8 mm; little size-dependent change in the ratio occurred beyond this size. Ontogenetic changes in both particle-size selection and the assimilated diet of P. kempi japonica display size-dependent patterns that are similar to the lipid data. Together, the three lines of evidence suggest that P. kempi japonica juveniles experience a food-related recruitment bottleneck until they grow to ~6-8 mm.

We predicted from equations derived from heated taxidermic mounts that the maintenance metabolism (Basal Metabolic Rate plus extra costs for thermoregulation) for Purple Sandpipers Calidris maritima wintering in these climatic conditions in Norway would be 1.3 times greater than for Purple Sandpipers of the same size in Scotland. Adaptations to the more extreme environment and greater energy requirements were investigated by measuring differences in the body size and composition of Purple Sandpipers from northern Norway and Scotland. As predicted, the Norwegian Purple Sandpipers had more fat stores, but these were still at relatively low levels (6.5% of fresh body mass) compared with other waders wintering in cold climates. The Norwegian birds were slightly larger so will probably have a relatively lower thermal conductance than Scottish birds. Also, there were large differences in the relative sizes of the intestine (1.5 times heavier in Norwegian birds) and liver (1.3 times heavier). This suggests that Purple Sandpipers wintering in Norway eat and process a greater amount of food than the birds in Scotland. In this way, the additional energy demands for thermoregulation in a colder environment are probably met.","Body composition; Calidris maritima; Energetics; Foraging; Metabolic rate; Storage strategies","arctic environment; overwintering; survival; thermoregulation; wader; Norway; Calidris maritima",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031854503

Variation in the duration of energy storage prior to reproduction is an important, but little-studied, axis of life history variation. We experimentally manipulated the availability of resources to females of a long-lived viviparous lizard (Eulamprus tympanum, Scincidae) in the first year of a two-year study to assess the relative importance of current food intake vs. stored reserves as sources of energy for breeding. Females given greater access to high temperatures (and hence, to resources) in the laboratory amassed larger caudal energy stores than did females with lesser opportunities. Energy intake during gestation slightly influenced offspring size, but the magnitude of energy stores prior to ovulation had a more dramatic effect: females with larger caudal energy stores produced much larger litters in the following year. Growth rates of females were unaffected by basking treatments or by reproduction in either year, but females that reproduced in the second year showed a large concomitant decrease in caudal energy stores compared to females that did not reproduce, indicating a large energetic cost of reproduction. Hence, reproductive output within this species can be influenced by resource availability over 12 months prior to reproduction, and simple comparisons of reproductive output with current resource availability may fail to detect the ways in which phenotypically plastic life history traits are influenced by environmental features. In addition to an appropriate temporal framework, models of resource allocation should also incorporate the possible roles of physiological and morphological constraints (e.g., maternal inability, in some species, to modify postovulation reproductive expenditure) and trade-offs with other life history currencies (e.g., decrements in maternal survival due to high relative clutch masses). The time lag between resource acquisition and expenditure may have significant consequences for a population's demographic response to shifts in resource availability or predation pressure (via tail autotomy). Finally, this study illustrates the way in which thermal aspects of the environment can influence life history phenotypes in ectothermic vertebrates with long-term energy stores.","Energy allocation; Eulamprus tympanum; Life history; Lizard; Reproduction; Scincidae; Storage; Time lags; Trade-offs","Animalia; Eulamprus tympanum; Eulamprus tympanum; Scincidae; Squamata; Vertebrata; Zootoca vivipara",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031853835

SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: Approximately 6-week-old female fa/fa Zucker rats were divided into four groups of 10 rats each: TE, fed the tepary bean type diet and exercised; TN, fed the tepary bean type diet and not exercised; CE, fed the purified type control diet and exercised; CN, fed the purified type control diet and not exercised. The exercise modality was treadmill running and the experiment lasted 13 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Body weight, cumulative food intake, body composition, weights of adipose tissues and liver, heart and gastrocnemius muscle. RESULTS: At the end of the 13 week experiment, TE rats weighed 511 ± 22 g and were significantly lighter than TN, 588 ± 15 g; CE, 606 ± 22 g; and CN, 660 ± 27 g. All are means ± s.e.m. The carcass of CN rats had 58, 20 and 13% more fat than TE, TN and CE rats, respectively; P < 0.01. Lean body mass was the same for all the groups of rats and ranged from means of 216-228 g. However, TE rats had significantly more fat free dry mass (FFDM) than CN rats; 68 ± 4 vs 58 ± 2 (means ± s.e.m.) and tended to have more FFDM than TN and CE rats. Inguinal fat depots weighed 20-30% less in T than in C rats (diet comparisons) and also 20-30% less in E than in N rats (exercise comparisons). Perirenal/retroperitoneal fat depots weighed 25% less in TN than in CN rats and 38% less in TE than in CE rats. Exercise did not reduce perirenal/retroperitoneal fat depot weights. Parametrial fat depot weights were not influenced by diet or exercise. CONCLUSIONS: In diets which provided 37% of the energy from fat, the incorporation of tepary beans attenuated weight gain, and subcutaneous and visceral fat gain compared to a purified type diet. Exercised rats gained less weight and subcutaneous, but not visceral fat, than non-exercised rats.","Body composition; Exercise; Fatty Zucker rats; High fat diet; Tepary bean diet","lipid; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; article; bean; body composition; body fat; body weight; controlled study; exercise; female; food intake; gastrocnemius muscle; heart; lean body weight; lipid diet; lipid storage; liver; liver weight; nonhuman; obesity; organ weight; priority journal; rat; treadmill exercise; Animalia; Ilex cookii; Phaseolus (angiosperm); Phaseolus acutifolius",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031853077

This phenomenon has been attributed to exceptional elastic energy storage and recovery via long compliant tendons in the legs. Alternatively, red kangaroos may have exceptionally efficient muscles. To estimate efficiency, we measured the metabolic cost of uphill hopping, where muscle fibers must perform mechanical work against gravity. We found that uphill hopping was much more expensive than level hopping. The maximal rate of oxygen consumption measured (3 ml O2 kg-1 s-1) exceeds all but a few vertebrate species. However, efficiency values were normal, ~30%. At faster level hopping speeds the effective mechanical advantage of the extensor muscles of the ankle joint remained the same. Thus, kangaroos generate the same muscular force at all speeds but do so more rapidly at faster hopping speeds. This contradicts a recent hypothesis for what sets the cost of locomotion. The cost of transport (J kg-1 m-1) decreases at faster hopping speeds, yet red kangaroos prefer to use relatively slow speeds that avoid high levels of tendon stress.

Ultrastructure of cellular and mitochondrial membranes is markedly altered by vesiculation [16], but this does not interfere with diagnostic evaluation of neurohistology by light microscopy. Serious difficulties are encountered, however, when immunocytochemical staining is attempted. Antigens that are immunoreactive in unfixed frozen sections and protein extracts appear to be concealed or destroyed in formalin-fixed tissues. In dilute aqueous solution, formaldehyde is in equilibrium with methylene glycol and its polymeric hydrates, the balance by far in favor of methylene glycol [16,41]. Carbonylic formaldehyde is a reactive electrophilic species well known for crosslinking functional groups in tissue proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides [16-20,22,27]. Some of its methylene crosslinks are readily hydrolyzed. Others are stable and irreversible. During immunostaining reactions, intra- and inter-molecular links between macromolecules limit antibody permeation of tissue sections [16], alter protein secondary structure [26,34], and reduce accessibility of antigenic determinants [10]. Accordingly, immunoreactivity is diminished for many antigens. Tissues are rapidly penetrated by methylene glycol, but formaldehyde binding to cellular constituents is relatively slow, increasing progressively until equilibrium is reached [16,24]. In addition, prolonged storage in formalin may result in acidification of human brain specimens [42]. Low pH favors dissociation of methylene glycol into formaldehyde [16], further reducing both classical staining and antigen detectability [14,42]. Various procedures have been devised to counter the antigen masking effects of formaldehyde. Examples include pretreatment of tissue sections with proteases [2,7,23], formic acid [3,28], or ultrasound [43]. Recently, heating of mounted sections in ionic salt solution by microwave energy was found to restore many antigens [6,37,44-48,54-56]. Theory and practice of microwave antigen retrieval are covered extensively in the handbook Microwave Cookbook for Microscopists [29]. A concise overview of microwave methods in the neurosciences has been published [33], and clinical applications have been reviewed [30]. In this context, it should be noted that fresh tissues may be stabilized for immunocytochemistry by reversible, non-chemical binding processes such as cryosectioning after microwave treatment [32] and freeze- drying [52]. Thus, it may be possible to enhance immunostaining for some antigens by microwave irradiation of unfixed as well as fixed specimens. Parameters to be optimized for microwave retrieval of specific antigens include temperature, irradiation time, tissue buffer composition, salt concentration, and pH [12,47,53]. Temperature, irradiation time, and pH are key variables [12,13]. With this in mind, an optimal method was developed for retrieval of a wide variety of antigens in human brain tissues [14]. Typical microwave protocols employ elevated temperatures that may reach 100°C, where denaturation causes irreversible uncoiling and disruption of protein secondary and tertiary structures [11]. Under these conditions, stable covalent bonds securing methylene crosslinks between polypeptides remain intact [20], but more reactive links formed by Schiff bases may be hydrolyzed [45]. Resultant conformational changes presumably expose buried loops of continuous amino acids and protruding regions [1], increasing accessibility of their epitopes [51]. Protein denaturation seems to be a reasonable explanation for the effects of microwaves on antigen retrieval. This idea is supported by the observation that denaturing solutions such as 6 M urea increase immunoreactivity of some antigens [8]. Still, the molecular basis of these effects remains unresolved, in part due to the complex chemistry of formaldehyde reactions with tissue constituents [41]. Indeed, some methylene bridges between similar groups such as NH2 and NH may be hydrolyzed by washing fixed tissues in distilled water at ambient temperature for several weeks [24,41]. Moreover, denaturation by conventional heating enhances antigenieity as well as classical neuroanatomical staining of formalin-fixed tissue [15,39,40,49]. When such externally heated specimens are immunostained and viewed by light microscopy, the results are almost indistinguishable from those obtained by microwave irradiation [58]. Nevertheless, the current widespread use of microwave methods in clinical and basic science laboratories likely results from the speed, convenience, and reproducibility of the results. Loss of immunoreactivity for many antigens likewise may occur when tissues are dehydrated in alcohol before they are embedded in paraffin. Exposure to alcohol causes antigenic denaturation, but clearing in xylene and heating in liquid paraffin do not [52]. While there are numerous reports of microwave procedures for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues [6,8,9,35,36,38,44,45,48,57,60], alternative methods that would further extend the range of retrievable epitopes have received less attention. One simple approach may be to irradiate free-floating sections with microwaves. A previous study found that heating vibratome sections in solution with microwaves resulted in severe wrinkling of the tissues. This problem was avoided by irradiation of tissue slices in buffer prior to sectioning [13]. Another strategy is presented here for neuropathological studies of human brain [50]. Vibratome sections in isotonic, mildly acidic citrate buffer [6,55] are heated to the boiling point with microwaves. After brief denaturation at 100°C, the sections are simmered for 5 min. To remove wrinkles, sections are incubated subsequently in Tris-buffered saline containing serum proteins and non-ionic detergent. The method also is suitable for single- and double-labeling studies of neural antigens in formalin-fixed tissues from experimental animals.","Immunocytochemistry; Microwave antigen retrieval; Neuropathology; Tau protein kinase I/glycogen synthase kinase-3β","formaldehyde; antigen retrieval; article; brain tissue; human; human tissue; immunocytochemistry; microwave irradiation; priority journal; Brain; Fluorescent Dyes; Formaldehyde; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Indicators and Reagents; Microtomy; Microwaves; Thiazoles; Tissue Fixation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031843413

The effect of day length on the release of hemp dogbane crown bud dormancy was studied in growth chambers. Total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) levels fluctuated with seasonal lows occurring during bud to mid-flowering and seasonal highs in fall predormancy periods. Starch was the primary storage carbohydrate, comprising up to 39.6% of crown root dry weight at the highest seasonal level. Ethanol soluble reducing sugar levels were negatively correlated with seasonal starch levels, and appeared to be maltose and glucose accumulated before conversion to sucrose for translocation. Most lipids were in ethanol soluble fractions and were inversely correlated with seasonal TNC patterns. The maximum level of total lipids in crown roots was 6%. Lipids appeared to be by-products of metabolism in nonarticulated lacticifers and not a significant carbon energy source. An 18-h day length resulted in a 10-fold increase in intact, 2-yr-old crown root dormancy release compared with 10- or 14-h day lengths in growth chamber studies. Seasonal carbohydrate fluctuations in hemp dogbane suggest the most effective control with mowing or tillage would occur when applied at mid- to full flower before root carbohydrates begin to recover. The most effective translocation of phloem mobile herbicides to crown roots would occur after mid- to late flower through leaf senescence when carbohydrates are being stored in the roots.","APCCA; Bud dormancy; Day length; Fructosan; Lateral roots; Laticifer; Light response; Lipids; Perennial weeds; Starch","Apocynum cannabinum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031840558

Sap flow was measured simultaneously at the top and at the base of each tree using constant energy input thermal probes inserted in the sapwood. The daily stem storage capacity was calculated by comparing the diurnal patterns of basal and crown sap flow. The amount of water withdrawn from storage and subsequently replaced daily ranged from 4 kg d-1 in a 0.20-m-diameter individual of Cecropia longipes to 54 kg d-1 in a 1-02-m-diameter individual of Anacardium excelsum, representing 9-15% of the total daily water loss, respectively. Ficus insipida, Luehea seemannii and Spondias mombin had intermediate diurnal water storage capacities. Trees with greater storage capacity maintained maximum rates of transpiration for a substantially longer fraction of the day than trees with smaller water storage capacity. All five trees conformed to a common linear relationship between diurnal storage capacity and basal sapwood area, suggesting that this relationship was species-independent and size-specific for trees at the study site. According to this relationship there was an increment of 10 kg of diurnal water storage capacity for every 0.1 m2 increase in basal sapwood area. The diurnal withdrawal of water from, and refill of, internal stores was a dynamic process, tightly coupled to fluctuations in environmental conditions. The variations in basal and crown sap flow were more synchronized after 1100 h when internal reserves were mostly depleted. Stem water storage may partially compensate for increases in axial hydraulic resistance with tree size and thus play an important role in regulating the water status of leaves exposed to the large diurnal variations in evaporative demand that occur in the upper canopy of seasonal lowland tropical forests.","Capacitance; Sap flow; Seasonal tropical forest; Transpiration, water storage; Water relations","diurnal variation; sap flow; tropical tree; water storage; water use; Panama; Anacardium excelsum; Anacardium excelsum; Anacardium occidentale; Cecropia; Cecropia longipes; Cecropia longipes; Ficus insipida; Ficus insipida; Luehea seemannii; Luehea seemannii; Spondias mombin; Spondias mombin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031833384

Maximum stresses of 40-50 MPa were calculated to act in several of the principal forelimb (superficial digital flexor (SDF), deep digital flexor (DDF), ulnaris lateralis (UL) and flexor carpi ulnaris/radialis (FCU/R)) and hindlimb tendons (plantaris, DDF) at the fastest galloping speeds recorded (up to 7.4 m s-1). Smaller stresses were found for the gastrocnemius (GAST) tendon (30 MPa) and suspensory ligaments (S-Ligs) (18-25 MPa). Average peak muscle stresses reached 200-240 kPa during galloping. Tendon and muscle stresses increased more steeply with changes of gait and during galloping, than during trotting. Calculations of elastic strain energy storage based on tendon stress showed similar patterns of increase with change of speed and gait, with the greatest contribution to elastic savings by the DDF tendons of the forelimb and hindlimb. In general, the hindlimb contributed two-thirds and the forelimb one-third to overall energy storage. Comparison of tendon elastic energy savings with mechanical work showed a maximum 40% recovery of mechanical work by elastic savings when the horses changed gait from a walk to a slow trot. Percentage of recovery then decreased with increased trotting speed, but increased again with a change of gait to a gallop, reaching 36% recovery at the fastest measured galloping speed (7.4 m s-1). The long length of horse tendons in relation to extremely short pennate muscle fibers suggests a highly specialized design for economical muscle force generation and enhanced elastic energy savings. However, elastic energy savings in terms of percentage of recovery of mechanical work and metabolic energy is less than that observed in wallabies and kangaroos during hopping, but similar to that in humans during running, and greater than that for dogs during trotting and galloping.

Based upon a 1536x1920 pixel, 127 μm pitch array of α- Si:H thin-film transistors and photodiodes, the FPI was developed as a prototype for examination of the potential of flat-panel technology in diagnostic x-ray imaging. The signal size per unit exposure (x-ray sensitivity) was measured for the FPI incorporating five commercially available Gd2O2S:Tb converting screens at energies 70-120 kVp. One- dimensional and two-dimensional NPS and DQE were measured for the FPI incorporating three such converters and as a function of the incident exposure. The measurements support the hypothesis that FPIs have significant potential for application in diagnostic radiology. A cascaded systems model that has shown good agreement with measured individual pixel signal and noise properties is employed to describe the performance of various FPI designs and configurations under a variety of diagnostic imaging conditions. Theoretical x-ray sensitivity, NPS, and DQE are compared to empirical results, and good agreement is observed in each case. The model is used to describe the potential performance of FPIs incorporating a recently developed, enhanced array that is commercially available and has been proposed for testing and application in diagnostic radiography and fluoroscopy. Under conditions corresponding to chest radiography, the analysis suggests that such systems can potentially meet or even exceed the DQE performance of existing technology, such as screen-film and storage phosphor systems; however, under conditions corresponding to general fluoroscopy, the typical exposure per frame is such that the DQE is limited by the total system gain and additive electronic noise. The cascaded systems analysis provides a valuable means of identifying the limiting stages of the imaging system, a tool for system optimization, and a guide for developing strategies of FPI design for various imaging applications.","Amorphous silicon; Cascaded systems analysis; Detective quantum efficiency; Digital x-ray imaging; Flat-panel imager; Noise power spectrum","Amorphous silicon; Biomedical signal processing; Diagnostic radiography; Efficiency; Fluorescent screens; Gadolinium compounds; Pixels; Power spectrum; Radiation; Radiology; Spectrum analysis; Systems analysis; Terbium compounds; Thin film transistors; X ray radiography; X ray screens; Cascaded systems analysis; Detective quantum efficiency; Digital x-ray imaging; Flat-panel imagers; Noise power spectrum; Quantum efficiency; silicon; article; diagnostic imaging; fluoroscopy; image processing; information processing; power spectrum; priority journal; quantum chemistry; X ray",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031805838

Most molecular-level body composition models are presently based on the overall hypothesis that nontriglyceride lipids constitute an insignificant proportion of total body lipid. A single lipid or 'fat' component consisting of triglycerides is thus assumed in most molecular-level body composition models. To test this hypothesis, the present study, carried out in adult rats, was designed to examine two questions: 1) What is the proportion of total lipids as triglycerides? and 2) Is this proportion constant or does it change with negative energy balance and weight loss produced by calorie restriction and increased exercise? Results indicated that with negative energy balance and weight loss there were progressive losses of total body triglyceride and lipid. The proportion of total lipids as triglyceride was 0.83 ± 0.08 (SD) in control animals, with reductions at 2 and 9 wk of energy restriction [0.82 ± 0.04 (P = NS vs. control) and 0.70 ± 0.15 (P = 0.05)] and at 9 wk for energy restriction plus exercise [0.67 ± 0.09 (P = 0.003)]. Nontriglyceride lipids comprised 2.8% of carcass weight at baseline and decreased to 2.2% by 9 wk of energy restriction and exercise (P = NS). Substantial differences were observed between body composition ratios expressed as percentages of the lipid-free body mass (LFM) and triglyceride- free body mass (TGFM); (e.g., total body water/LFM and TGFM in controls = 72.7 ± 0.7 and 70.4 ± 2.2, respectively; P = 0.02). These observations strongly support the existence and importance of nontriglyceride lipids as a body composition component that responds independently from storage triglycerides, with negative energy balance produced by food restriction and exercise.","Adipose tissue; Animal models; Total body fat","triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body composition; body fat; caloric restriction; controlled study; energy balance; exercise; food deprivation; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; weight reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031803390

Some organisms ('income breeders') fuel reproductive expenditure by simultaneous feeding, whereas others ('capital breeders') fuel reproduction from energy gained earlier, and stored prior to use. Most published discussions of this topic have focused primarily on endothermic animals (birds and mammals), and have interpreted the costs and benefits of these alternative breeding tactics in the context of endothermy. The far more diverse array of ectothermic animals has received less attention in this respect. Many features associated with ectothermy preadapt organisms to store energy for long periods prior to use (i.e. to rely on 'capital' rather than 'income'). For example, birds and mammals experience high costs (in terms of mobility and thermoregulatory efficiency) if they store large body reserves. By contrast, the energetic and demographic costs associated with storage, maintenance, and utilisation of body reserves are low in many ectotherms. Thus, capital breeding (which may also be more efficient energetically in many situations) is extremely common in these low energy systems. Ectotherms comprise the most extreme examples of capital breeders, with a strong tendency towards semelparity where the capital of reserves is massively invested into a single reproductive event. Overall, theoretical and empirical studies of the evolution of capital versus income breeding as alternative strategies of resource use should take account of the important role played by alternative thermoregulatory and metabolic systems. The acquisition of endothermy in avian and mammalian lineages has involved a massive shift towards reliance on 'income breeding', and the full spectrum of life-history variation in this respect cannot be appreciated without detailed examination of ectothermic organisms.",,"Animalia; Aves; Galliformes; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031797136

N6A 5B7, Canada","One of the most obvious features on the foredunes and strands of coasts and lakes is recurrent burial in sand. Burial levels vary in different coastal sand dune systems and influence the physical and biotic microenvironment of the plant and soil. Foredune plants along coasts possess numerous adaptations to withstand burial. Studies show that below a certain threshold level of burial, the growth of all foredune plant species is stimulated probably because of multiple factors, namely improved soil resources, increase in soil volume, reactive plant growth, and enhanced mycorrhizal activity. However, as the level of burial increases, the positive response starts to decline until it becomes a negative value. For example, burial may reduce seed germination, seedling emergence, survival, and growth of seedlings and adult plants. At the community level, burial acts as a filter and selectively eliminates susceptible species, reduces the relative abundance of less tolerant species, and increases the abundance of tolerant and sand-dependent species. However, if sand deposition continues unabated, even the sand-dependent species are eliminated and a bare area is created. The emergence of a plant from a burial deposit primarily depends on the energy reserves in its storage organs and the speed, depth, and frequency of burial. Upon burial the plants shift resources from the below-ground to the aboveground parts. Different plants show varied morphological responses to sand accretion. For example, the culms of grasses emerge by an increase in the number of nodes per culm and the elongation of internodes. Similarly, the emergent trunks and woody branches of tolerant trees and shrubs produce new buds and suckers at a higher level on the stem. In response to burial, the coastal sand dune species produce shootborne roots close to the new soil surface probably because of decreased oxygen levels.","Adaptations to burial; Burial of seeds; Impact on communities; Modes of emergence; Plant vigour; Sand accretion; Zonation of vegetation","adaptation; dune; energy metabolism; germination; mycorrhiza; physical tolerance; plant growth; plant morphology; soil; survival; dune; ecophysiology; plant burial",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031789396

Amylin potently inhibits postprandial glucagon secretion. The absence of this action could contribute to the hyperglycagonemia and subsequently, excessive endogenous glucose production, fasting hyperglycemia, and propensity to ketosis seen in insulinopenic diabetes. Restoration of normal glucagon secretion by amylin replacement therapy could therefore be therapeutically important in treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Amylin potently inhibits gastric emptying. This action is consistent with a physiologic role of amylin to regulate carbohydrate absorption. Of peptides known to be secreted in response to ingested carbohydrate, only amylin and glucagon-like peptide-1 are reported to inhibit gastric emptying at near- physiologic concentrations, and could therefore participate in nutrient- mediated feedback control of carbohydrate release from the stomach. Amylin reduces food intake in rodents. This action, which synergizes with a similar action of CCK, could reflect a role as short-term peripheral satiety agent. Amylin alone or in combination with CCK may be useful in moderating caloric intake in obesity and other metabolic disorders. Although insulin has been extensively studied as a therapy and as a controller of nutrient storage and metabolism, the role of its β-cell partner, amylin, has been largely unrecognized. In contrast to the nutrient disposal and storage role of insulin, amylin appears to more generally address the opposite side of the energy balance equation, the assimilation of nutrient.",,"amylin; carbohydrate intake; diabetes mellitus; diet restriction; energy balance; glucagon release; hormonal regulation; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; note; pathogenesis; priority journal; satiety; stomach emptying; substitution therapy; Rodentia",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031779868

The advanced FEL was developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. It operates in the 4-7 μm range, with a macropulse duration of 10 μs and repetition rate of 10 Hz. Each macropulse consists of a train of micropulses that are 15 ps in pulse duration separated by 10 ns. The output energy of macropulses can be adjusted from 5 to 120 mJ. Five transplant grade corneal-scleral buttons preserved in corneal storage medium were used. Wavelengths 5.3 and 6.0 μm were selected based on Fourier-transform infrared absorption spectra of a type I collagen film. Ocular tissue cuts made at 6.0 μm revealed a well-defined ablation boundary with a lateral tissue damage at 10 ± 2 μm. The ablation boundary of the corneal cuts made at 5.3 μm revealed tissue disruption with thermally denatured tissue constituents with loss of organised structure. The lateral dimension of this effect extended up to 220 μm. It was concluded first that Fourier-transform infrared absorption spectra may be useful in selecting laser ablation wavelengths, and second that lasers emitting near 6 μm achieve excellent spatial confinement of laser energy secondary to both protein and water energy partitioning. This wavelength may have potential for cutting ocular tissue such as cornea, sclera, vitreous or lens, because of energy partitioning.","Laser; Surgery; Trabecular meshwork; Wavelength","collagen type 1; protein; water; article; controlled study; cornea; energy; eye surgery; human; human tissue; infrared spectroscopy; laser surgery; lens; priority journal; sclera; vitreous body",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031769169

This increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the postmenopausal years has been partially attributed to adverse effects of estrogen deficiency on plasma lipid-lipoprotein levels and on the cardiovascular system, although other factors are contributing. Central body fatness and insulin resistance are components of a cluster of metabolic abnormalities which also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. This review summarizes studies that have examined the effects of the menopause transition and of estrogen-replacement therapy on central body fatness and insulin resistance. Review of cross-sectional studies suggests that the menopause transition is associated with an increase in abdominal and visceral adipose tissue accumulation, as measured either with dual X-ray absorptiometry or computed tomography. These results appear to be independent of the aging process and total body fatness. In general, cross-sectional studies using circumference measurements did not find any significant effect of the menopause. Longitudinal studies also support that accumulation of central body fatness accelerates with menopause. The effects of the menopause on insulin resistance appear to be moderate, if any, although available studies are clearly insufficient to draw firm conclusions. The majority of interventional studies support the notion that hormone-replacement therapy attenuates the accumulation of central fat in postmenopausal women, compared with control or placebo-treated women. Retrospective comparisons of hormone users and nonusers also support a protective effect of hormone replacement on fat distribution. Moderate effects of estrogen therapy were found on insulin resistance in postmenopausal women, although long-term, controlled trials using accurate measurements of insulin sensitivity are lacking. Treatment with progestins exerts moderate deleterious effects on insulin sensitivity, which may be attributable to the partial androgenicity of progestins used. It is concluded that part of the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women may be attributable to increased central body fatness. Therapies aiming at preventing these changes in fat distribution such as hormone-replacement therapy, diet or exercise are likely to provide long-term cardiovascular and metabolic benefits for women's health.","Body fat distribution; Central adiposity; Hormone-replacement therapy; Insulin resistance; Menopause","conjugated estrogen; dydrogesterone; estradiol; estrogen; gestagen; glucose; insulin; levonorgestrel; lipid; medroxyprogesterone acetate; norethisterone acetate; body fat; cardiovascular risk; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; diet restriction; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; estrogen deficiency; female; glucose clamp technique; hormone substitution; human; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin tolerance test; lipid storage; longitudinal study; menopause; oral drug administration; oral glucose tolerance test; physical activity; postmenopause; priority journal; review; transdermal drug administration",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031739555

After hypothermic storage, hearts were rewarmed to 37°C with KHB alone or KHB containing sodium nitroprusside or L-arginine. Cardiac function was then assessed in either Langendorff mode or working heart mode. 4. Compared with values from fresh unstored hearts, hypothermic stored hearts showed a significant decrease in coronary flow and left ventricular developed pressure when the stored hearts were perfused in Langendorff mode. These hearts also produced less aortic flow and cardiac output when perfused in the working mode. 5. Hearts hypothermically microperfused with buffer containing either L-arginine or sodium nitroprusside and then reperfused in the Langendorff mode with untreated KHB buffer had the highest left ventricular developed pressure and coronary flow values. Aortic flow and cardiac output were also higher in these hearts. 6. In all groups of stored hearts, the concentrations of both ATP and creatine phosphate were significantly low, when compared with values from freshly isolated hearts. Addition of dexamethasone to the buffer either during storage or during reperfusion had no beneficial effect on high-energy phosphate loss or cardiac performance of stored hearts. 7. This study showed that the addition of nitric oxide donors to storage buffer significantly improves cardiac function on normothermic reperfusion. The improved functional recovery is unrelated to the high-energy phosphate content of these hearts.","Hypothermic preservation; L-arginine; Rat heart; Sodium nitroprusside","adenosine triphosphate; arginine; arginine methyl ester; buffer; creatine phosphate; dexamethasone; nitric oxide; nitric oxide donor; nitroprusside sodium; phosphate; animal tissue; aorta flow; article; controlled study; coronary artery blood flow; cryopreservation; female; heart function; heart left ventricle pressure; heart output; heart performance; heart perfusion; isolated heart; nonhuman; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031739412

This study examined 1) the relationship between recent diet and total body and central abdominal fat in middle-aged female twins independent of genetic and important environmental factors and 2) evidence of interaction between diet and genetic predisposition. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Measurements in 436 healthy female twins (aged 58 ± 10 years) included dietary intake by food frequency questionnaire (validated against a 7-day food diary n = 162), BMI, total body and central abdominal fat by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and environmental covariates (smoking habit, hormone replacement, and physical activity) by standardized questionnaire. Dietary energy underreporters were excluded. RESULTS - Intake of dietary fat (total and subtype) and carbohydrates was not related to BMI or to total or central fat, confirmed in quintile analysis. With genetic and environmental factors controlled in 90 monozygotic pairs, differences in the intake of energy, fat, or protein were not related to intrapair differences in total and central body fat. However, a minor inverse relationship between carbohydrate intake and total adiposity was confirmed (r = -0.25, P = 0.02). In paired analyses, the twin with the higher intake of total sugars had significantly lower total body and central abdominal adiposity. There was no evidence of a gene-environment interaction between intake of fat or carbohydrates contributing to greater body fat mass in subjects genetically predisposed to obesity CONCLUSIONS - Using validated dietary measures and direct measures of body fat and excluding underreporters, no relationship between dietary fat and body fat was found in middle-aged women, particularly after controlling for genetic and some environmental factors. The role of dietary factors in determining total body and central abdominal fat appears to have been overestimated in past cross-sectional studies.",,"carbohydrate; fat; protein; sugar; abdomen; adult; article; body fat; body mass; correlation function; dietary intake; environmental factor; female; food composition; genetic predisposition; heredity; human; lipid storage; major clinical study; statistical analysis; twins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031738113

Besides leptin, however, the adipose tissue also secretes a large number other signals. Cytokine signals, TNFα and IL-6, and components of the alternative pathway of complement influence peripheral fuel storage, mobilization and combustion, as well as energy homeostasis. In addition to the acute regulation of fuel metabolism, adipose tissue also influences steroid conversion and sexual maturation. In this way, adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ, influencing many aspects of fuel metabolism through a network of local and systemic signals, which interact with the established neuroendocrine regulators of adipose tissue. Thus, insulin, catecholamines and anterior pituitary endocrine axes interact at multiple levels with both cytokines and leptin. It may be proposed that the existence of this network of adipose tissue signalling pathways, arranged in an hierarchical fashion, constitutes a metabolic repertoire which enables the organism to adapt to a range of different metabolic challenges, including starvation, reproduction, times of physical activity, stress and infection, as well as short periods of gross energy excess. However, the occurrence of more prolonged periods of energy surplus, leading to obesity, is an unusual state in evolutionary terms, and the adipose tissue signalling repertoire, although sophisticated, adapts poorly to these conditions. Rather, the responses of the adipose tissue endocrine network to obesity are maladaptive, and lay the foundations of metabolic disease.","Adipose tissue; Catecholamines; IL-6; Insulin; Leptin; TNFα","adenohypophysis hormone; catecholamine derivative; complement component C3; cytokine; fatty acid; glucocorticoid; insulin; interleukin 6; leptin; lipid; sex hormone; steroid hormone; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adenohypophysis; adipocyte; adipose tissue; complement system; cytokine production; endocrine gland; energy metabolism; homeostasis; human; hypothalamus hypophysis system; infection; lipid metabolism; neuroendocrine system; nonhuman; obesity; physical activity; priority journal; protein synthesis; reproduction; review; sexual maturation; starvation; steroidogenesis; stress; sympathetic tone",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031736064

The effect of drainage at the disturbed site is to lower the water table and to reduce the depth and duration of inundation. Evapotranspiration was measured as its energy equivalent, the latent heat flux, within the framework of the surface energy balance using the eddy correlation approach. Results show that when standing water is present at each site, there is very similar flux partitioning; the latent heat flux accounts for approximately 50% of the net radiation (approximately 3.5 mm d-1), storage heat flux 30%, and sensible heat flux 20%. When the disturbed site has no standing water, evapotranspiration rates are maintained at the same level (3.5-3.75 mm d-1), but the storage heat flux drops significantly, and the sensible heat flux is enhanced.

Incoming solar radiation, incoming atmospheric radiation, and long-wave radiation emitted from the water body are the largest energy fluxes to and from the wetland. Because of the small heat storage of the water body, evaporation rates closely track solar radiation on short time scales. The effect of advected energy related to precipitation is small because the water quickly heats up by solar radiation following precipitation. Advected energy related to ground water is minimal because ground-water fluxes are small and groundwater temperature is only about 7 °C. Energy flux related to sediment heating and thermal storage in the sediments, which might be expected to be large because the water is clear and shallow, affects evaporation rates by less than 5 percent.","Energy-budget; Evaporation; Prairie wetland","energy budget; evaporation; wetlands; USA, North Dakota, Cottonwood Lake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031735333

Box 8030, Haifa, 31080, Israel","Photosynthetic microorganisms are able to modify their chemical composition, cellular structure, and organization of their chloroplasts in response to the level of irradiance. The photosynthetic apparatus adjusts itself to any new light regime by changing the ultrastructural properties of the chloroplast to provide space and area needed to match other biochemical changes in order to optimize light harvesting and utilization. Acclimation to low light intensity is characterized by an increase in thylakoid number in cyanobacteria, and in the chloroplast volume in eukaryotic plants. In the Eukaryota, these changes allow the packaging of more thylakoids within this organelle to harbor the addition of photosynthetic complexes, i.e., light harvesting antennae, reaction centers, and electron transport components. These changes are essential for optimal operation of the photosynthetic apparatus at low light intensity, mainly to increase the absorption of light energy. Acclimation to high irradiance is characterized by a reduction of the surface density of thylakoid membranes and reduction in the specific volume of the chloroplast. The accumulation of storage bodies containing starch and lipids is yet another typical feature of high light acclimated cells in response to the high rate of photosynthetic activity. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031713140

Treatment with neuraminidase, incubation with Triton X-100 or storage of samples adjusted to pH 7.3 for 9 days at 37°C, did not alter the activation energy of the enzyme. However, the digestion of pathological samples with papain, which removes the hydrophobic domain from the enzyme, resulted in a significant reduction of this thermodynamic parameter up to values analogous to those found in healthy subjects.

Nevertheless, the statistical significance for the activation energy of AAP with that of the other plasma membrane enzymes assayed was not reached in any case.

To achieve this goal, a semiclosed-loop gas turbine cycle using an highly-enriched CO2 mixture as working fluid was adopted. As the oxidizer, syngas combustion utilizes oxygen produced by an air separation unit. Combustion gases mainly consist of CO2 and H2O: after expansion, heat recovery and water condensation, a part of the exhausts, highly concentrated in CO2, can be easily extracted, compressed and liquefied for storage or disposal. A detailed discussion about the configuration and the thermodynamic performance of these plants is the aim of the paper. Proper attention was paid to: (i) the modelization of the gasification section and of its integration with the power cycle, (ii) the optimization of the pressure ratio due the change of the cycle working fluid, (iii) the calculation of the power consumption of the `auxiliary' equipment, including the compression train of the separated CO2 and the air separation unit. The resulting overall efficiency is in the 38-39% range, with status-of-the-art gas turbine technology, but resorting to a substantially higher pressure ratio. The extent of modifications to the gas turbine engine, with respect to commercial units, was therefore discussed. Relevant modifications are needed, but not involving changes in the technology. A second plant scheme will be considered in the second part of the paper, using air for syngas combustion and a physical absorption process to separate CO2 from nitrogen-rich exhausts. A comparison between the two options will be addressed there.",,"Carbon dioxide; Combined cycle power plants; Combustion; Condensation; Energy utilization; Exhaust gases; Gas absorption; Gas emissions; Gasification; Greenhouse effect; Liquefaction of gases; Syngas combustions; Gas turbine power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031706748

The numerical results show that, (1) the optimum linear PCT distribution from the theoretical analysis seems to be the same as that of composite PCMs for practical latent heat TES systems; (2) the phase change time of composite PCMs with optimum linear PCT distributions in practical latent heat TES systems can be reduced by as many as 25% to approximately 40% in comparison with that of PCMs of single PCT.",,"Composite materials; Mathematical models; Numerical analysis; Optimization; Temperature distribution; Phase change materials (PCM); Phase change temperature (PCT) distributions; Thermal energy storage (TES) systems; Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031706705

These modules employ low voltage high current IGBT devices and can be viewed as power electronic building blocks (PEBBs). The proposed medium voltage inverters exhibit high quality PWM output with low dv/dt, modular construction with built-in redundancy, lower dc-link capacitive energy storage compared to other structures and are flexible for different medium voltage ASD applications.

Low loss performance of magnetic bearings in aerospace equipment such as jet engines and flywheel energy storage systems is especially critical. Two basic magnetic bearing designs are employed in industrial practice today: the homopolar design, where the flux paths are of a mixed radial/axial orientation, and the heteropolar design, where the flux paths are primarily radial in nature. The stator geometry and flux path of a specific bearing can have a significant effect on the rotor losses. This paper describes the detailed measurement of rotor losses for experimentally comparable homopolar and heteropolar designs. The two test bearing configurations are identical except for geometric features that determine the direction of the flux path. Both test bearing designs have the same air gap length, tip clearance ratio, surface area under the poles, and bias flux levels. An experimental test apparatus was used where run down tests were performed on a test rotor with both bearing designs to measure power losses. Numerous test runs where made for each bearing configuration by running multiple levels of flux density. The components of the overall measured power loss, due to hysteresis, eddy currents, and windage, were determined based on theoretical expressions for power loss. It was found that the homopolar bearing had significantly lower power losses than the heteropolar bearing.",,"Eddy currents; Magnetic bearings; Magnetic field effects; Magnetic hysteresis; Stators; Heteropolar flux path; Homopolar flux path; Magnetic flux density; Rotors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031703054

The idea behind this proposal is to overcome the major drawbacks of the previous solution (large oxygen consumption and re-design of the gas turbine unit), by means of a semiclosed cycle using air as the oxidizer. Consequently, combustion gases are largely diluted by nitrogen and cannot be simply compressed to produce liquefied CO2 for storage or disposal. However, CO2 concentration remains high enough to make separation possible by a physical absorption process. It requires a re-pressurization of the flow subtracted from the cycle, with relevant consequences on the plant energy balance. The configuration and the thermodynamic performance of this plant concept are extensively addressed in the paper. As in the first part, the influence of the pressure ratio is discussed, but values similar to the ones adopted in commercial heavy-duty machines provide here acceptable performance. Proper attention was paid to the impact of the absorption process on the energy consumption. The resulting net overall efficiency is again in the 38-39% range, with assumptions fully comparable to the ones of Part A. Finally, we demonstrated that the present scheme enables the use of unmodified machines, but large additional equipment is required for exhausts treatment and CO2 separation. A final comparison between the two semiclosed cycle concepts was therefore addressed.",,"Carbon dioxide; Combined cycle power plants; Energy utilization; Exhaust gases; Gas absorption; Gas emissions; Liquefaction of gases; Oxidation; Thermodynamics; Air-blown combustions; Pressure ratio; Gas turbine power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031701947

A survey of 52 studies conducted since 1970 indicated that rates of water use ranged from 10 kg day-1 for trees in a 32-year-old plantation of Quercus petraea L. ex Liebl. in eastern France to 1,180 kg day-1 for an overstory Euperua purpurea Bth. tree growing in the Amazonian rainforest. The studies included in this survey reported whole-tree estimates of water use for 67 species in over 35 genera. Almost 90% of the observations indicated maximum rates of daily water use between 10 and 200 kg day-1 for trees that averaged 21 m in height. The thermal techniques that made many of these estimates possible have gained widespread acceptance, and energy-balance, heat dissipation and heat-pulse systems are now routinely used with leaf-level measurements to investigate the relative importance of stomatal and boundary layer conductances in controlling canopy transpiration, whole-tree hydraulic conductance, coordinated control of whole-plant water transport, movement of water to and from sapwood storage, and whole-plant vulnerability of water transport to xylem cavitation. Techniques for estimating whole-tree water use complement existing approaches to calculating catchment water balance and provide the forest hydrologist with another tool for managing water resources. Energy-balance, heat dissipation and heat-pulse methods can be used to compare transpiration in different parts of a watershed or between adjacent trees, or to assess the contribution of transpiration from overstory and understory trees. Such studies often require that rates of water use be extrapolated from individual trees to that of stands and plantations. The ultimate success of this extrapolation depends in part on whether data covering short time sequences can be applied to longer periods of time. We conclude that techniques for estimating whole-tree water use have provided valuable tools for conducting basic and applied research. Future studies that emphasize the use of these techniques by both tree physiologists and forest hydrologists should be encouraged.","Cavitation; Decoupling coefficient; Forest hydrology; Hydraulic conductance; Sap flow; Scaling; Stomatal conductance; Transpiration; Water storage","tree; water use; Euperua; Euperua purpurea; Euperua purpurea; Quercus; Quercus petraea; Quercus petraea",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031695138

Apart from genetic factors, likely causes of overweight are reduced physical activity, excess energy intake, or both. Under conditions of energy need, the body metabolizes all available fuels and diet composition has no impact on the amount or rate of weight loss. In contrast, when energy is consumed in excess, it is disposed of according to an oxidative hierarchy. Whereas excess carbohydrate and protein promote their own oxidation, dietary fat does not. As a result, increased fat intake, typically associated with a consumption of a varied and energy-dense diet, can lead to increased fat storage. Physical activity can restore energy balance and so prevent weight gain. Though carbohydrate is an important fuel for exercise, its body stores are small in comparison to those of fat and protein. Carbohydrate consumption during intensive exercise, whether in liquid or solid form, optimizes exercise performance by virtue of sparing glycogen stores. In contrast, low intensity aerobic exercise increases the oxidation of fat and so contributes to weight control. Aerobic exercise can be maintained for long periods of time, in trained individuals, with fat oxidation proportionally increasing with time. As physical activity moves the energy equation in the direction of greater energy need, diet composition plays a lesser role. An exercise prescription together with a balanced diet is the key to shaping health habits, especially for adolescents.",,"carbohydrate; fat; glycogen; body weight; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; energy expenditure; exercise; fat intake; health status; human; lipid storage; metabolism; obesity; physical activity; review; sitting",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031688742

The concept pursued in this paper is the generation of syngas low in carbon, where most of the heating value of the coal fuel is carried by hydrogen. Catalytic shift reactors convert most of the CO in the syngas into CO2, which is subsequently removed by physical absorption and then compressed to make it suitable for transport and permanent storage. Energy balances, performance and cost of electricity are evaluated for two plants based on a Texaco gasifier and a large, heavy-duty gas turbine giving an overall IGCC power output between 350 and 400 MW. In one plant the raw syngas exiting the gasifier is cooled in a high-temperature, radiative cooler; in the other it is quenched by the injection of liquid water. With respect to `conventional' Texaco IGCCs, the reduction of specific CO2 emissions by 90% reduces LHV efficiency from 5 to 7 percentage points and increases the cost of electricity of about 45%.

Memory has been shown to be a crucial component of the total system energy dissipation. This paper presents for the first time a network flow approach to minimizing the energy dissipation of memory components during systems synthesis. In particular, this new approach determines the optimal number of external and internal memory accesses and the number of extra computations (or data regeneration) for each task such that the total estimated energy dissipation of a task is minimized. This is unlike previous research which has only discussed ad-hoc suggestions for this problem. The network flow approach can be solved by a globally optimal solution in polynomial time using very fast and efficient algorithms. A large complex real industrial application, audio compression, donated by Motorola, is used to study the energy savings using different single and multichip system implementations along with voltage scaling. Results of synthesizing this complex application show that for some tasks, estimated energy savings range from 2 to 10 times. This contributes to 2.7 times improvement in the overall estimated energy dissipation of the embedded audio compression system, with no significant increase in cost or decrease in performance. This research is important for industry since consideration of energy dissipation at the early stages of design is crucial for mapping high performance applications into cost-efficient and reliable systems.",,"Algorithms; Cost effectiveness; Data compression; Electric network synthesis; Energy dissipation; Storage allocation (computer); Embedded audio compression systems; Low energy embedded system synthesis; Network flow methods; VLSI circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031675229

All the films have the maximum polarization larger than 30 μC/cm2 and show zero remanent polarization. By choosing appropriate compositions, we can make the films have 'square' hysteresis loops with very sharp phase transition or 'slanted' hysteresis loops with very small hysteresis. The properties that are important for decoupling capacitor and microactuator applications are characterized. For decoupling capacitor applications, films having square hysteresis loops with energy storage density of up to 7 J/cm3 can be made, which release more than half of their stored charge in 10 ns with a maximum current density of more than 9400 A/cm2.

The current long-standing systems for on-orbit power storage are nickel hydrogen and nickel cadmium, with nickel hydrogen being the current technology leader in on orbit power storage. Lithium-ion technology is new technology which holds great promise for aerospace applications. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the efforts being undertaken at Eagle Picher to optimize the weight of thermal and support structures, and then to use those improvements to compare the competing technologies. In order to `bridge the gap' between the two systems, changes and technological improvements to current nickel-hydrogen systems must be undertaken. The main areas for improvements are the incorporation of thermally-conductive composites to replace heavier aluminum components. EPI in conjunction with Lockheed Martin Astronautics Division has designed and built K1100 graphite epoxy thermal sleeves for thermal performance testing at EPI. EPI is currently in the design phase of a composite thermal assembly for the 50 Ah and 60 Ah SPV batteries. This paper will outline the test programs that are underway at EPI in the test and analysis of composite nickel-hydrogen battery components and lithium-ion batteries. These test results will provide valuable data on watt hours per kilogram of advanced nickel-hydrogen storage systems and their direct comparison to lithium ion. Unfortunately, the lithium ion test batteries are in manufacturing along with the K1100 thermal sleeve. Therefore test descriptions for both systems will be described in detail.

Both groups use the conversion of glycogen to poly-hydroxuyalkanoate to produce ATP and NADH; however, the first group call also produce ATP from polyphosphate (poly-P). No representative pure cultures are available from either group. The question arises: is the observed activity of GAO due to PAO that are depleted in poly-P ? In this study, using a laboratory sequencing batch reactor containing an enriched culture, the ability of the enriched PAO to utilize organic substrate (acetate) anaerobically was investigated under conditions of poly-P limitation and surplus glycogen content of the biomass. This study showed clearly that, under these conditions, almost no acetate was taken up. Furthermore, this strongly suggests that PAO can not use glycogen conversion to poly-hydroxyalkanoate as the sole energy source under anaerobic conditions, which seems to be the restricted to a separate group of GAO. On the basis of the results and literature data, an improved scheme for the anaerobic acetate accumulation is presented.",,"anaerobic metabolism; article; biomass; citric acid cycle; energy resource; enzyme activity; phosphate transport; pollution control; sludge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031669131

Training increased endurance (206%), but diet composition did not affect endurance in either trained or sedentary rats. β-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity was increased in fat-fed but not carbohydrate-fed rats (P < 0.05).

We used individual data on BMR, body fat, and fat-free mass (FFM) assessed during the control (prestarvation) period, at weeks 12 and 24 of semistarvation (S12 and S24), and week 12 of restricted refeeding (R12) to calculate an index of the reduction in thermogenesis at S12, S24, and R12, defined as the change in BMR adjusted for changes in FFM and fat mass, and an index of the state of depletion of the fat mass and FFM compartments at these times, defined as the deviation in fat mass or FFM relative to control values. The results indicated a positive relation between the reduction in thermogenesis and the degree of fat mass depletion (but not FFM depletion) during weight loss as well as during weight recovery (r = 0.5, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the residual variance was predicted by the initial (prestarvation) percentage fat and the cormic index (sitting height/height). Taken together, these results in normal-weight men responding to severe food deprivation reveal anthropometric predictors for human interindividual variability in the capacity for energy conservation and suggest that the adaptive reduction in BMR is partly determined by an autoregulatory feedback control system linking the state of depletion of fat stores to compensatory mechanisms that suppress thermogenesis.","Basal metabolic rate; Energy balance; Malnutrition; Men; Obesity; Semistarvation; Thermogenesis","adult; article; autoregulation; basal metabolic rate; body composition; feedback system; food deprivation; food intake; human; lipid composition; lipid storage; male; malnutrition; normal human; obesity; starvation; thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031661846

The shelf-life of the enzyme on storage in 0.1 M Tris-acetate buffer, pH 6.5, at -10°C showed a single exponential decay with a t( 1/4 ) of approx. 30 days. In the presence of additives like 5mm dithiothreitol the t 1/4 increased to 223 days at the same temperature, in a single exponential decay. The Arrhenius plot of the kinetics of the pigeonpea urease catalysed urea hydrolysis over the temperature range 27 to 77°C, was linear. The Q10 value was found to be 1.46. The energy of activation calculated from the Arrhenius equation was found to be 5.1 kcal/mole active site. The thermal denaturation of pigeopea urease at 65 and 70°C was found to obey biphasic kinetics in which half of the activity is destroyed faster than the remaining half.

A 2-yr study was conducted to determine the effect of conserving ryegrass as balage on ensiling efficiency, storage losses, and feeding value. Ryegrass conservation treatments were balage (BLG), haylage (HLG, positive control), and hay (HAY, negative control. Ryegrass was cut at the boot stage and, following a 48-h wilt, was baled and wrapped with stretch film (BLG) or was chopped and stored in a bag silo (HLG). HAY (bloom stage) was harvested approximately 3 wk later when weather permitted and was stored indoors. At the conclusion of the 6-mo storage period, the nutritional value of stored forages was assessed with lactating Holstein cows (n = 21). Ryegrass pH values were lower, and lactate concentrations were slightly higher for HLG than BLG. Storage losses averaged 8.9% of dry matter (DM) for BLG compared with 3.7% for barn-stored HAY. Forage nutritive value was similar between ensiled forages; however, HAY was lower in protein and energy than other treatments. Cows fed HLG consumed 17.3% more forage DM and tended to produce more fat-corrected milk (FCM) than cows fed BLG. Feed efficiency (lb FCM/lb dry matter intake [DMI]) was higher for the BLG treatment than HAY. No treatment differences were observed for milk composition or cow weight/condition changes.

Also, the reduction in volume through compaction would facilitate relatively easier mechanical handling and reduce the space requirement for storage and transportation. The overall objective of this research was to determine whether mechanical compaction of flour would adversely effect its thermodynamic and functional properties. Two different grades of flour were used in this investigation: a low extraction (64%) patent flour and a high extraction (79%) straight grade flour. Loose flour was compacted mechanically, which corresponded to a reduction in flour volume of 55%, and exposed to sorption desorption tests. Dough prepared from treated (compacted and reconstituted) and loose flour was exposed to standard empirical and imitative rheological tests.

AVC is a mapping tool that indicates the dopant type of each point of the cross-sectioned surface by measuring the Auger electron energy shifts that mirror the workfunction differences caused by the built-in junction, i.e., caused by Fermi level differences between n- and p-doped silicon. AVC makes use of the dual capabilities of field emission Auger electron spectroscopy instrumentation for spectroscopy at each pixel and for high spatial resolution. A theoretical examination is made of the important practical aspects of this previously observed Auger energy line shift, in particular the effect of surface states on the Fermi level position and the effect of beam-induced electron-hole pair creation and transport. AVC results obtained from cross-sectioned metal-oxide-semiconductor structures are shown to have good agreement with both theory and with one-dimensional secondary ion mass spectroscopy and spreading resistance probe profiles from the same sample. A fast and efficient algorithm has been devised which fits the Auger Si LVV spectrum to that of a reference spectrum obtained from a region of known doping, so that it is possible to make a calculation of the energy shift at each pixel with resolution on the order of 50 meV and in a way that speeds analysis and minimizes storage size. © 1998 American Vacuum Society.",,"Algorithms; Calculations; Computer simulation; Crystal structure; Electron energy levels; Fermi level; Mathematical models; Semiconductor device structures; Semiconductor doping; Semiconductor junctions; Silicon wafers; Auger voltage contrast imaging; Fermi-Dirac statistics; Secondary ion mass spectroscopy; Auger electron spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031655129

The flywheel rotor consists of multiple rings, and the interferences and ply angles vary in the radial direction. For the structural analysis the rotor is assumed to be an axisymmetric thick laminated shell with a plane strain state. Considering the ring-by-ring variation of fiber orientations, a symmetric local stiffness matrix was derived for each ring. Using the stiffness matrix, the continuity conditions of radial stresses and displacements between the rings with a consideration of the interferences can be easily incorporated. A symmetric global stiffness matrix is then obtained assembling the local stiffness matrices. Displacements are obtained by solving the global stiffness matrix, and the stresses in each ring are then calculated. Three-dimensional intra-laminar quadratic Tsai-Wu criterion for the strength analysis is used yielding the strength ratio for each ring. The optimization has been also performed maximizing the kinetic energy stored in the rotor. For that purpose the sensitivities of the strength ratios and displacements with respect to the design variables have been derived. As a result, the optimal design has attained 2.4 times of total energy compared to the case of 0 degree ply angle and no interference. The effects of interferences are found to be much more considerable than those of fiber orientations.","Axisymmetric laminated shell; Composite flywheel rotor; Energy storage system; Optimum design; Sensitivity analysis","Energy storage; Flywheels; Optimization; Rings (components); Sensitivity analysis; Shells (structures); Stiffness matrix; Stress analysis; Structural analysis; Yield stress; Thick-walled composite rings; Three-dimensional intra-laminar quadratic Tsai-Wu criterion; Laminated composites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031652995

Nature of the defects created by UV light at low temperatures is discussed basing on the correspondence between the thermostimulated glow curve peaks and thermal evolution of the photostimulation spectra observed after irradiation in the D absorption band. Three bands at 1400, 950 and 580 nm have been observed in the stimulation spectrum at 80 K. The 1400 and 950 nm stimulation bands are presumably explained as the optical transitions in the Tl0 centre forming the spatially correlated defect pair with Vk centre while the 580 nm stimulation band is connected with the unperturbed Tl0 centres.

With increasing F 2 mixing ratio, the ArF* excimer formation first increases as F - increases, but in F 2-rich conditions the laser power decreases because of the laser photon absorption due to F - ions and quenching of ArF* with F 2 molecules.","ArF excimer laser; Density measurement; Excimer formation mechanism; F - ion; Mean electron energy; Photon absorption","Density measurement (optical); Dye lasers; Effects; Fluorine; Ions; Light absorption; Molecules; Numerical methods; Oscillations; Photons; Dye laser absorption method; Excimer formation mechanism; Laser photon absorption; Mean electron energy; Excimer lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031647676

The release of glycerol and free fatty acids is intensively regulated by hormones and agents. In man, the major hormones are insulin (inhibition of lipolysis) and catecholamines (stimulation of lipolysis). Physiological factors such as dieting, physical exercise and ageing also regulate lipolysis. The lipolytic process is modified in pathological conditions, e.g. obesity (both upper and lower obesity), diabetes (non- and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), and dyslipidaemia (in particular, familial combined hyperlipidaemia. The regulation of lipolysis is complex because of the heterogeneity of fat depots (visceral versus subcutaneous), which may contribute to the well-known gender differences in accumulation of fat. Since visceral fat depot is directly drained into the liver and has a high turnover of visceral triglycerides, 'portal' free fatty acids seem to be an important pathophysiological factor in common complications of obesity (in particular, metabolic syndrome). New advances in genetic studies indicate that polymorphisms in several genes encoding for proteins that regulate the lipolysis process are important for the development of obesity and its complications.","Adipose tissue; Adrenoceptor; Free fatty acids; Hormone-sensitive lipase; Triglycerides","adrenergic receptor; catecholamine; cholecystokinin; fatty acid; glucagon; growth hormone; hydrocortisone; parathyroid hormone; sex hormone; thyroid hormone; thyrotropin; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; tumor necrosis factor alpha; body fat; diabetes mellitus; gluconeogenesis; hormonal regulation; human; hyperlipidemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; lipid storage; lipolysis; lipoprotein synthesis; metabolic regulation; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pathophysiology; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031647224

There was a few months of low Btu gas injection, followed by ten years with high Btu gas injection. A gas sweeping was achieved in 1986 to convert the reservoir to a low Btu value gas storage. The cushion gas is therefore a mixture of low and high Btu value gases. The average Btu value during withdrawal periods since 1986 is occasionally very close to the maximum allowed value, potentially raising operational difficulties. For the next ten years, additional wells and surface facilities will be gradually added to increase the working gas and the peak flow rate capacities. This paper describes how a history matching of gas Btu content is performed for the first time using a full field in-house reservoir simulator. In fact, a model was matched the conventional way, then the detailed Btu value history was added. The results of the model in terms of energy and nitrogen content during withdrawal periods have accurately reproduced the actual behavior of the gas storage. This confirms as correct the previous history matching of the reservoir pressure and saturation. By calculating the evolution of Btu values within the storage, the model proves very efficient in assisting the engineer to define the best strategy for injection and withdrawal periods in order to meet the customers required gas Btu value. Therefore emissibility problems can be avoided by choosing the most suitable wells. It has been possible to optimize inert gas injection planning by evaluating, under various operational scenarios, the influence of gas mixing on the withdrawn gas Btu values. © Copyright 1998, Society of Petroleum Engineers, Inc.",,"Aquifers; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Petroleum reservoirs; Forecasting; Gas fuel storage; Inert gases; Mathematical models; Natural gas; Natural gas wells; Optimization; Petroleum reservoirs; Pressure; Saturation (materials composition); History matching; Nitrogen content; Operational scenario; Operational strategies; Rate capacity; Reservoir pressures; Reservoir simulator; Surface facilities; Inert gases; Natural gas well production; Gas BTU control; Inert gas injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031645724

As an alternative to simply increasing cache associativity or size to reduce lower-level memory energy consumption (which may have a detrimental effect on on-chip energy consumption), we show that, by using buffers, energy consumption of the memory subsystem may be reduced by as much as 13% for certain data cache configurations and by as much as 23% for certain instruction cache configurations without adversely effecting processor performance or on-chip energy consumption.",,"Computer simulation; Microprocessor chips; Architectural level simulators; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031642231

Before regulations and the market drive hydrogen to the fuel of chose, the safety issues must be systematically addressed and interdisciplinary techniques defined for application. The paper proposes a generic methodology for performing hazards assessments of integrated systems in the hydrogen fuel cycle. The cycle elements include production, stationary storage, transport, and transfer operations. A generic assessment is presented for one such process in the fuel cycle. The assessment approach utilizes the chemical industry standard HAZOP procedure. Standardization of review questions include materials of construction, process control, leak detection, confined space, and ignition sources. Recommended approaches for addressing unanalyzed events is also presented. The Nevada Test Site is developing the capability to safely integrate liquid hydrogen based energy systems using new generation technologies. These technologies must be qualified in a systems approach. The Nevada Test Site's HAZMAT Spill Center has the capability to support testing and verification of liquid hydrogen systems and components which will be needed for deployment of a safe infrastructure.",,"Accident prevention; Hazards; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Production; Storage (materials); Transportation; Hazard assessment; Hydrogen fuel cycle; Liquid hydrogen; Risk assessment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031638602

Higher CO2 accelerates photosynthesis. Forest productivity may increase substantially in some regions. For example, growth rates of well-managed southern pines may increase by 20 percent over the next fifty years if climate doesn't change and if CO2 concentrations continue to increase. Models of climate change and its potential effects on forests include many untested assumptions. Environmental advocacy groups often assert that restrictions on forest management help control atmospheric CO2. They cite studies showing that a no-harvest regime can maximize carbon storage on isolated tracts of unmanaged forest. A more thorough analysis indicates that active management is usually a better strategy than preservation. Prohibiting harvest on selected areas (e.g., on federal lands in the Northwest) may provide no overall increase in forest carbon stocks because harvest activity will shift to other regions. Broad restrictions on harvest would eliminate economic incentives for forest management and encourage conversion of forest lands to other uses. Active forest management can significantly increase the productivity and carbon storage capacity of land. It also provides raw material for essential products that store significant amounts of carbon. Moreover, forest products often require less fossil energy to manufacture than non-renewable alternatives.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Environmental protection; Harvesting; Laws and legislation; Photosynthesis; Renewable energy resources; Abstract only; Carbon storage capacity; Forest management; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031638188

The demonstration that the defect formation is detected from charging analysis characteristics is made. It is suggested that the charge spreading characteristics may reflect the insulator aptitude to develop water tree. It will be shown that the observations which are made during high voltage can be reproduced under electron irradiation. Also, the correlation is illustrated in the field of Mechanics.

The conductivity of indium-oxide thin films grown by dc-magnetron or laser sputtering can be modified upon illumination with ultraviolet radiation (photon energy &gt; 3.5 eV), resulting in a variable electrical state of the films from a resistive to a purely conductive one, while recently holographic recording has been demonstrated aiming to information storage and processing applications. We report simultaneous measurement of the non-steady-state photoelectromotive force and holographic recording in indium-oxide thin films at the He-Cd laser wavelength of 325 nm (Fig. 1). Two He-Cd laser beams formed a holographic grating in the thin film. One of the beams was phase modulated at frequency ω and a HeNe laser beam was monitoring the holographic recording. Two scattered beams of equal intensity were observed, corresponding to the ±1 diffraction orders of the recorded sinusoidal grating, and monitored. The non-steady-state photocurrent J$+ω/ was detected by applying lock-in techniques. The decay time constants of the diffraction efficiency and non-steady-state photocurrent were found to be in the range of 5-50 s, naturally depending on fringe spacing.

The `optimal' strategy minimizes the cost of operating the cooling plant over the simulation horizon. The particular case of a popular ice storage system (ice-on-coil with internal melt) was investigated in a simulation environment. Various predictor models were analyzed with respect to their performance in forecasting cooling load data and information on ambient conditions (dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures). The predictor model provides load and weather information to the optimal controller in discrete time steps. An optimal storage charging and discharging strategy was planned at every time step over a fixed look-ahead time window utilizing newly available information. The first action of the optimal sequence of actions was executed over the next time step and the planning process was repeated at every following time step. The effect of the length of the planning horizon was investigated. It was found that short horizons of one day were only marginally suboptimal relative to one that is optimal over the entire simulation horizon of one week. Various utility rate structures were analyzed to cover a range of potential real-time pricing scenarios. The predictive optimal controller was then compared to conventional control heuristics. In summary, it was found that in the presence of complex rate structures the proposed controller had a significant performance benefit over the conventional controls, while requiring only a simple predictor.",,"Control system analysis; Discrete time control systems; Energy efficiency; Heuristic methods; Ice; Mathematical models; Optimal control systems; Predictive control systems; Refrigerating machinery; Thermal load; Abstract only; Thermal energy storage systems; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031634301

Using Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES), we have studied the local atomic environments in immiscible mixtures processed by high-energy ball milling, a mechanical alloying technique involving heavy deformation. By examining the local coordination and bond distances, it is concluded that atomic-level alloying can indeed be induced between Cu and Fe through milling at room temperature, forming substitutional fcc and bcc solid solutions. In addition to single-phase regions, a two-phase region consisting of fcc/bcc solutions has been found after milling at both room temperature and liquid nitrogen temperature. In contrast to the Cu-Fe system, solid solution formation is not detectable in milled Ag-Fe and Cu-Ta mixtures. This work demonstrates the power of synchrotron EXAFS/XANES experiments in monitoring nonequilibrium alloying on the atomic level.

Then a partition can be placed in sleep mode during the time intervals all elements contained in that partition are idle. We formulate the partitioning problem to exploit sleep mode operation and show that the problem is NP-complete. We present polynomial time algorithms for practical classes of the problem.

The formation of these deposits, termed conductive anodic filaments (CAF) require high humidity (80%RH) and high voltage gradient (5 V/mil). The humidity exposure during the storage environment may cause the failure in the use environment. CAF formation is enhanced by the use of certain hot air solder leveling (HASL) fluids and/or water soluble flux constituents. In this work, two catastrophic field failures were analyzed. Both failures were related to boards produced in a manufacturing process, which included HASL. One CAF failure occurred between a component through-hole and power plane held at a potential difference of 40 V with a 0.005 inch nominal spacing. The other occurred on an inner layer of a multi-layer board (MLB) between a via and ground plane held at a potential difference of 320 V with 0.015 inch nominal spacing. The nature of the CAF was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS).

In addition, the effect of certain assumptions was investigated for sensitivity on the predicted performance of regenerative energy exchangers. The sensitivity results are calculated with an aluminum matrix wheel that is coated with a molecular sieve desiccant. Neglecting thermal and moisture storage in the air is shown to result in errors as large as 2.4% in the predicted effectiveness of a rotary energy exchanger at typical wheel speeds. Including the heat of sorption in the model affects the predicted effectiveness only slightly (<0.5%). However, the predicted effectiveness is greatly affected (up to 48%) by whether the heat of phase change is assumed to remain in the air or in the matrix. Controlling the energy rate of the energy exchanger by controlling wheel speed may be impractical because the sensitivity of each effectiveness to wheel speed differs with each operating condition.

The key challenge is to develop effective scheduling techniques that treat voltage as a variable to be determined, in addition to the conventional task scheduling and allocation. Our synthesis technique also addresses the selection of the processor core and the determination of the instruction and data cache size and configuration so as to fully exploit dynamically variable voltage hardware, which result In significantly lower power consumption for a set of target applications than existing techniques.

The cooling plant used for this evaluation consisted of one chiller for icemaking and chilled-water modes, an ice storage, an air-handling unit, a condenser, and all required fans and pumps. The plant model allows the selection of one of three ice storage systems as well as one of three compressor types. Components are modeled using polynomial fits to manufacturers' data. Using dimensionless parameters, components can be scaled to arrive at a proper cooling plant design. The performance of a selected cooling plant configuration can be assessed for three conventional control strategies (chiller-priority, constant-proportion, and storage-priority control) and compared to optimal control that achieves the theoretical maximum of operating cost savings. Optimal control is found using a dynamic programming based global search in the domain of on-peak and off-peak demands. Mixed integer programming is used for validation using a linear plant model.

We then use the information obtained from the simulator to calculate the energy consumption of the memory hierarchy of the system. As an alternative to simply increasing cache associativity or size to reduce lower-level memory energy consumption (which may have a detrimental effect on on-chip energy consumption), we show that, by using buffers, energy consumption of the memory subsystem may be reduced by as much as 13% for certain data cache configurations and by as much as 23% for certain instruction cache configurations without adversely effecting processor performance or on-chip energy consumption.",,"Design; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Microprocessor chips; Performance; Simulation; Cache associativity; Cache size; Memory hierarchy; On chip energy consumption; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031622062

Utilizing a suite of current, voltage, and radiation diagnostics to measure power flow out of the POS as it opens into an e-beam diode, these experiments aim to elucidate the switch-load coupling, a phenomenon which is not currently well understood. Localized, shielded B-dot pickup coils located in the cathode and anode are used as current monitors to measure generator and load currents, to determine magnitude and location of current losses, and to determine the partitioning between electron-flow and cathode currents. The radiation diagnostics include a time resolved bremsstrahlung spectrometer, a Compton-Hall voltmeter, a scintillator photodiode, two pinhole cameras, and thermoluminescent dosimeters. The spectrometer is used to measure the high-energy tail of the bremsstrahlung spectrum, from which the electron energy may be inferred. This is compared with a direct load-voltage measurement using a vacuum voltmeter. By comparing the measured currents, load voltage, and spectrometer data, the effect of electron-flow current on the bremsstrahlung spectrum may be investigated.

One key component of an IES system that is still under development is the plasma opening switch (POS). In its simplest form, cable gun or flashboard plasma sources (multi-species) are used to inject plasma between the anode and cathode of a coaxial transmission line. Recent experiments on the Hawk accelerator at the Naval Research Laboratory show the potential for improved switching behavior using a hydrogen plasma source (HPS) when compared to cable gun or flashboard sources. In contrast to cable gun and flashboard results, the HPS results suggest that the plasma density thins as it translates downstream before finally opening many 10's of cm from the original POS location. Interferometry measurements show that the plasma density is reduced below the sensitivity of the measurement technique (approximately 1014 cm-3) across the entire A-K gap. Furthermore, the electrical measurements indicate that the entire vacuum inductance between the POS and a short circuit load is uncovered indicating that there is very little plasma left in the POS-to-load region to exclude magnetic flux. In this talk results from MHD simulations of the hydrogen plasma source will be presented and compared to Hawk measurements. In addition, we will use the PIC method to examine the role of species separation in POS's that contain multiple ion species with widely varying masses. In recent POS experiments at the Weizmann Institute it was observed that the magnetic field is frozen-in on the lighter species leaving the heavier plasma components magnetized. This phenomena may also be important for the DECADE POS where current transfer between the POS and load may occur through this lighter species.",,"Anodes; Cathodes; Inductance measurement; Interferometry; Magnetohydrodynamics; Plasma density; Plasma sources; Inductive energy storage (IES) technology; Plasma opening switch (POS); Plasma simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031619618

This includes maximum power point tracking, series battery voltage regulation, sensorless short, circuit protection of the MPPT's converter and intelligent shutdown and wakeup at dusk and dawn. The MPPT can source 10 A to a 6 V-36 V lead-acid storage battery and can be connected in parallel or series with other MPPTs. The MPPT may be easily configured to perform output voltage regulation on passive and water pumping loads. It could also control the actuation of a diesel generator in a hybrid remote area power supply (RAPS). Energy transfer enhancements of up to 26%, compared to solar panels without MPPTs, have been measured.

The heat required for desiccant regeneration was provided by a solar collector/storage subsystem. Performance of the desiccant system was analyze as a function of system design parameters such as the desiccant storage volume, the regenerator size, the hot water storage volume, and the solar collector areal.

Naturally, the electromagnetic interactions with human body at these high frequencies would be of great interest for the design of personal communication terminal devices. Popular numerical techniques such as Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method [l]-[3] have severe limitations in evaluating EM interactions at those high frequencies due to excessive computer storage requirements and computation time. For example, the size of a typical adult head (18 cm) is -75 (dielectric wavelength) at 30 GHz. On the other hand, Eigenfunction Expansion Method (EEM) can be utilized to efficiently assess the EM interactions associated with thin biological layers (e.g. skin) at high frequencies. It has been found that the unaVcraged peak specific absorption rate (SAR) at the skin layer can be very high with non-directional (monopole or dipole) antennas. This is because most of the radiated energy of the antenna is absorbed in the skin layer. For example, the unavcraged peak SAR is -450 W/kg with 1W of the delivered power at 30 GHz, and the 1-g averaged peak SAR is ~ 10 W/kg. However, the peak SAR-and the absorbed power-can be greatly reduced by employing the directional antennas; e.g. the unaveraged peak SAR is -3 W/kg and the 1-g averaged peak SAR is -0.1 W/kg. It can be shown that the directional antennas are more efficient at Ka-band as compared with those at much lower frequencies (e.g. 900 MHz or 1.9 GHz). In this paper, we will discuss the power absorption properties and radiation patterns of directional and non-directional antennas at Ka-band. © 1998 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Directional patterns (antenna); Directive antennas; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Finite difference time domain method; Mobile antennas; Monopole antennas; Numerical methods; Satellite communication systems; Time domain analysis; Directional patterns (antenna); Electromagnetic wave absorption; Telephone sets; Communication terminal; Directional Antenna; Eigenfunction expansion methods; Electromagnetic interactions; Numerical techniques; Satellite communications; Specific absorption rate; Storage requirements; Microwave antennas; Antennas; Directional handset antennas; Specific absorption rate (SAR)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031618190

The method avoids the need for complicated characterizations of resin and fiber properties that affectresidual stress development during the manufacturing process. New results from a series of experiments with in-situ cured hoop-wound glass and carbon reinforced epoxy composites show that residual stresses due to non-thermal sources such as winding tension and resin shrinkage during cure are essentially constant for fixed manufacturing process parameters and resin system, regardless of ring geometry and fiber type. Also, the combined effect of winding tension and resin shrinkage becomes progressively less important in comparison to thermal effects as the ID/OD ratio of a ring decreases. The analysis method is demonstrated by using the data acquired with a single ring to predict the residual stress in another ring with different fiber, ID, and OD.

It is important to remember that flow cytometers are very complex instruments that are composed of four closely related systems. The fluidic system transports particles from a suspension through the cytometer for interrogation by an illumination system. The resulting light scattering and fluorescence is collected, filtered, and converted into electrical signals by the optical and electronics system. The data storage and computer control system saves acquired data and is also the user interface for controlling most instrument functions. These four systems provide a very unique and powerful analytical tool for researchers and clinicians. This is because they analyze the properties of individual particles, and thousands of particles can be analyzed in a matter of seconds. Thus, data for a flow cytometric sample are a collection of many measurements instead of a single bulk measurement. Basic knowledge of instrumentation is a tremendous aid to designing experiments that can be successfully analyzed using flow cytometry. For example, it is important to know the emission wavelength of the laser in the instrument that will be used for analysis. This wavelength is critical knowledge for selecting probes. It is also important to understand that a different range of wavelengths is detected for each fluorescent channel. This will aid selection of probes that are compatible with the flow cytometer. Understanding the complication that emission spectra overlap contributes to detection can be used to guide fluorochrome selections for multicolor analysis. All of these experiment design considerations that rely on knowledge of how flow cytometers work are a very practical and effective means of avoiding wasted time, energy, and costly reagents. Data analysis is a paramount issue in flow cytometry. Analysis includes interpreting as well as presenting data that has been stored in list-mode files. Data analysis is very graphically oriented. There are a number of types of graphic representation that are available to visually aid data analysis. Two standard types of displays are used. These data plots are one-parameter histograms and bivariate plots. A user must be familiar with these two fundamental types of display in order to effectively analyze data. Histograms are the most simple modes of data representation. Histograms allow visualization of a single acquired parameter. Mean fluorescence and distributional statistics can be obtained based on markers that the user can graphically set on the plot. Percentages of positively expressing particles relative to a control sample can also obtained in a similar manner. In addition, multiple histograms can be overlayed on one another to depict qualitative and quantitative differences in two or more samples. Two-parameter data plots are somewhat more complicated than histograms; however, they can yield more information. Two-parameter dot plots of FSC vs SSC allow visualization of both light-scattering parameters that are important for identifying populations of interest. Bivariate fluorescent plots allow discrimination of dual-labeled populations that might remain hidden if histograms were used to display fluorescent data. Two-parameter plots that combine one light-scattering parameter and a fluorescent parameter are useful for analyzing control samples to elucidate the origin of nonspecific binding. Data analysis is very graphically oriented. Experience and pattern recognition become important when using two-parameter data plots for qualitative as well as quantitative analysis. The technique of gating or drawing regions on dual parameter light-scatter plots allows one to exclude information and examine the population of interest by disallowing particles that might confound or interfere with analysis. This is one of the fundamental uses for gating.

Sci., University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States","Various vertebrate inner-ear end organs appear to have switched their sensory function between equilibrium sensing and acoustic sensing over the courses of various lines of evolution. It is possible that all that is required to make this transition is to provide an end organ with access to the appropriate stimulus mode and frequency range. If, as we believe, however, the adaptive advantage of an acoustic sensory system lies in its ability to sort the total accoustic input into components that correspond to individual acoustic sources, and the adaptive advantage of an equilibrium sensory system lies in its ability to compute the total orientation and motion of the head without regard to the individual sources contributing to that orientation and motion, then it is easy to argue that the differences between acoustic and equilibrium sensors should be more profound than simply access to the appropriate stimuli. Effective signal-sorting requires high resolution in both time and frequency; to achieve this resolution, a peripheral tuning structure must be one of high dynamic order (i.e., constructed from multiple independent energy storage elements). If the peripheral tuning structure simply converts head acceleration to head displacement, velocity, or jerk (i.e., provides one or two steps of integration or differentiation with respect to time, where one energy storage element per step is required), then high dynamic order is inappropriate. Because the bullfrog lagena possesses both acoustic and equilibrium sensitive regions, it is especially suited for comparing these two sensor types and addressing the question of dynamic order of tuning. In this paper we report observations of the linear tuning properties of bullfrog lagenar primary afferent nerve fibers obtained by stimulating the lagena with random, dorsoventral micromotion over the frequency range from 10 Hz to 1.0 kHz. Tuning curves obtained by reverse correlation analysis and discrete Fourier transformation were used to estimate the dynamic order of each fibers associated peripheral tuning structure. We found two classes of lagenar afferent axons - those with lowpass amplitude tuning characteristics (44 units) and those with bandpass amplitude tuning characteristics (73 units). Lowpass units were found to originate at the equilibrium region of the macula and they exhibited low dynamic order - summed low- and high-frequency slopes (absolute values) ranged from 10 dB/decade to 64 dB/decade, implying dynamic orders of less han one to three (the modal value was equal to one). Bandpass units were found to originate at the acoustic region of the macula, and they exhibited higher dynamic order than lowpass units - summed low- and high-frequency slopes (absolute values) ranged from 53 dB/decade to 185 dB/decade, implying dynamic orders of three to nine (the modal value was equal to five). It appears that while lagenar equilibrium and acoustic sensors both possess access to signals in the acoustic frequency range, lagenar acoustic sensors are tuned by means of peripheral structures with markedly greater dynamic order and consequently markedly greater physical complexity. These results suggest that steep-sloped (high-dynamic-order) tuning properties reflect special adaptations in acoustic sensors not found in equilibrium sensors and that any evolutionary transition between the two sensor types must have involved profound structural changes.","Bullfrog lagenar macula; Dynamic order; Inner ear evolution; Linear amplitude tuning curves; Peripheral acoustic sensors; Peripheral equilibrium sensors","Lagena; Rana catesbeiana; Vertebrata; animal; article; auditory nervous system; body equilibrium; classification; comparative study; evolution; frog; hearing; histology; inner ear; innervation; kinesthesia; nerve fiber; phylogeny; physiology; sound detection; ultrastructure; vestibular labyrinth; vestibulocochlear nerve; Acoustic Maculae; Animals; Auditory Pathways; Axons; Ear, Inner; Evolution; Kinesthesis; Musculoskeletal Equilibrium; Phylogeny; Pitch Discrimination; Rana catesbeiana; Sound Spectrography; Vestibulocochlear Nerve",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031616156

A two-rowed winter barley (Beka cultivar) was stored at room temperature for 0, 3, 6, 16, and 32 wk after harvesting. At these dates, diets were formulated using 50% barley with and without the addition of a commercial β-glucanase-based enzyme product. In Experiment 1, 320 Arbor Acres chickens (eight replicates of three 10-d-old birds and eight replicates of one 30-d-old bird, per treatment) were fed the experimental diets to determine the AMEn following a 2 × 2 × 5 (age by enzyme by barley storage time) factorial design. At the end of the metabolism trial, viscosity of the intestinal contents was determined in 30-d-old broilers. Total β-glucan, nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP), in vitro viscosity, and endogenous enzyme activity of barley grain decreased with increasing storage time. Dietary AMEn increased with barley storage time (from 2,755 to 2,939 kcal/kg DM, P &lt; 0.001, for 0 and 32 wk of storage, respectively), with enzyme addition (2,861 vs 2,919 kcal/ kg DM, P &lt; 0.003), and with the age of animals (2,826 and 2,958 kcal/kg DM for 10- and 30-d-old chickens, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Interactions of enzyme and age by barley storage time (P &lt; 0.02 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) were also detected. These data indicate that the minimum time of barley storage before its inclusion in broiler feed depends on the animals′ age (more than 6 wk for 10-d-old chickens and 3 wk for 30-d-old chickens), and that the use of enzymes allowed a reduction in the time of barley storage. Digesta viscosity decreased with barley storage time (P &lt; 0.001), and with enzyme addition (P &lt; 0.001), an interaction of storage time by enzyme addition was shown (P &lt; 0.007). Digesta viscosity was also negatively related to the dietary AMEn content (r = -0.68, P &lt; 0.01). In vitro barley viscosity explained 53 and 90% of the variation in gut viscosity produced by unsupplemented and enzyme supplemented diets, respectively. In Experiment 2, the same diets as Experiment 1 and the barley grain were intubated into 120 adult roosters (Hy-Line®) to determine TMEn. Dietary and barley TMEn values were not affected by barley storage time or enzyme addition (3,237 and 3,037 kcal TMEn/kg DM for diets and barley, respectively).","Barley storage; Enzymes; Gut viscosity; Nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy; Poultry age","Animalia; Aves; Gallus gallus; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; beta glucosidase; glycosidase; xylan 1,4 beta xylosidase; xylan endo 1,3 beta xylosidase; animal; animal food; article; Aspergillus; barley; chicken; diet supplementation; digestion; energy metabolism; food handling; male; methodology; physiology; stomach juice; time; Trichoderma; viscosity; Animal Feed; Animals; Aspergillus; beta-Glucosidase; Chickens; Dietary Supplements; Digestion; Energy Metabolism; Food Handling; Gastrointestinal Contents; Glycoside Hydrolases; Hordeum; Male; Time Factors; Trichoderma; Viscosity; Xylan Endo-1,3-beta-Xylosidase; Xylosidases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031613262

In addition to the preferred use of liquid hydrogen due to its range per tank filling and low amount of mass for storage in the vehicle, the cryogenic characteristics of hydrogen provide significant advantages. In addition to engine operation with external mixture formation, considerable success was achieved with internal mixture formation with injection of cryogenic high pressure hydrogen. Only pressurization of cryogenic hydrogen can be accomplished without investing a considerable amount of engine power. Hybrid mixture formation, a proper combination of external and internal mixture formation with suitably pressurized cryogenic hydrogen, is very attractive with respect to power and torque as well as other positive characteristics under steady and intermittent operating conditions. The state of the art technology of liquid hydrogen represents a suitable base for large scale demonstration projects now. Additional aims of more intense R&amp;D work relate to internal mixture formation and improved engine drivability, as well as utility vehicle application including trucks and buses.

In the present study, the modified composition of AB5-type corresponds to the spin as well as thermal melted versions of MmNi4.3Al0.3Mn0.4 and MmNi4.0Al0.3Mn0.4Si0.3. Structural characterization has revealed that, whereas for the spin melted MmNi4.3Al0.3Mn0.4 the dominant growth is perpendicular to the c-axis, it is parallel to the c-axis for MmNi4.0Al0.3Mn0.4Si0.3.

Attempts have been made to establish a correlation between the structure and hydrogenation behaviour.

The bulk version of the alloy with silicon has been found to undergo easy activation (2nd cycle) as compared to the bulk version of the alloy without silicon (6th cycle).

The transpiring water transfer was coupled to heat transfer at steady state. Sum of heat energies transferred through natural convection from ambient air and generated from respiration inside the produce was assumed to be supplied for evaporating moisture on the surface. Respiration heat was obtained from measured respiration rate of O2 consumption and CO2 production, and convective heat transfer was calculated from an empirical formula for natural convection, in which produce temperature was taken as wet bulb temperature. The moisture losses estimated by the developed model were in good agreement with experimental data of weight change for the apples and minimally processed vegetables stored under controlled atmospheric conditions and normal air.

The radiators were thin (0.18-9 μm) and the electrons were of sufficient energy (118-252 MeV) so that the electrons passed through the radiators many times. This effectively increased the efficiency of the radiators (photons/electron). The electron-beam lifetime in the storage ring was measured, and used to determine the number of passes through each radiator. Multiple passes between 5 and 385 were observed, thus giving a corresponding increase in radiator efficiency.

Single-foil transition radiation was observed whose total output power was comparable to that of multiple-foil radiators composed of the same material.

A state-of-the-art review shows that current solid state lasers exhibit a clear deficiency as compared to well developed gas lasers. This may be overcome by the new concept of a diode pumped thin disc laser combining the advantages of low optical degradation of the laser medium and good output power scalability. This solid state laser benefits further from the shorter wavelength and better coupling efficiency for a wide range of materials. Yb:YAG is chosen as the preferred laser material because it primarily has a high quantum efficiency, guarantees good energy storage for pulsed operation, and exhibits a broad absorption line at 941 nm for easy and effective pumping with InGaAs diodes. Performance data of the thin disc laser are shown for output powers up tp 350 W CW with optical and slope efficiencies of 49% and 56%, respectively. Scalability of the concept is demonstrated by using a multiple disc design with a zig-zag stable resonator. Beam quality parameter, M 2, has also been determined for al operation conditions. Best values of M2 equals 1.22 have been obtained for 100 W output power at 39% optical efficiency. In addition, passive mode locking and Q-switched operation are demonstrated.

Electric vehicles (EVs) generate little waste heat, and using battery energy for heating may consume a substantial fraction of the energy storage capacity, reducing the vehicle range, which is one of the most important parameters in determining EV acceptability. This paper analyzes the applicability of a desiccant dehumidifier for providing comfort heating in an EV with reduced energy consumption. A dehumidifier can reduce the heating load in a vehicle because it adsorbs the water vapor generated by the passengers, thereby avoiding water condensation on the windows without requiring a high external air ventilation rate or a high window temperature. The results indicate that the desiccant dehumidifier can reduce the steady-state heating load by 60 percent or more under typical conditions. The reduction in heating load is such that waste heat may he enough to provide the required heating under most ambient conditions.

The major species cultured are Penaeus monodon and Penaeus japonicus, but other penaeids, including Metapenaeus macleayi, Penaeus esculentus, and Penaeus plebejus, have been cultured in small quantities. Research with Australian penaeids has described the mechanisms of food location, feeding, and digestion (Dall, 1992). The composition of natural prey items of penaeids in the wild has been proposed as a guide to nutritional requirements, and indeed successful diets have some similarities with natural food. The major differences between natural prey for shrimp in the wild and commercial diets is that prey items are higher in ash, while commercial diets have more carbohydrate. Predation on natural food present within farming ponds has been shown to lower requirements for formulated diets during the early stages of pond culture when shrimp biomass is relatively low. More research dedicated to the improvement of the abundance and quality of natural biota as a source of food through fertilization and prevention of pond bottom deterioration is warranted. Studies on protein turnover have identified major differences in protein degradation in shrimp fed diets with different protein contents. Many studies aimed at determining protein requirements of penaeids have used different methods to calculate 'metabolizable' energy contents of the diets. However, as none have directly measured digestible or metabolizable energy of test diets, interactions between protein and energy may have confounded interpretation of results. This may explain some of the variation in the conclusions published. The digestive gland has been identified as the primary site for lipid synthesis, storage and assimilation. Regulation of 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3, and 22:6n-3 and chain elongation of 18:2n-6 to 20:4n-6 have been documented.

Its advantages include the ability to stay in two positions without power input and despite small external disturbances. Therefore, bistable micro-mechanisms could allow the creation of MEMS with improved energy efficiency and positioning accuracy. This paper presents the first bistable MEMS which function within the plane of fabrication. These bistable mechanisms, known as ""Young"" bistable mechanisms, obtain their energy storage characteristics from the deflection of two compliant members, have two pin joints connected to the substrate, and can be constructed of two layers of polysilicon. The pseudo-rigid-body model overcomes problems with nonlinearities in the analysis and design of these mechanisms. This approach allows greater freedom and flexibility in the design process.

Energy storage systems with extremely high specific energy (&gt;400 Wh/kg) have been designed that use lightweight pressure vessels to contain the gases generated by reversible (unitized) regenerative fuel cells (URFCs). Progress is reported on the development, integration, and operation of rechargeable energy storage systems with such high specific energy. A primary fuel cell test rig with a single cell (46 cm2 active area) has been modified and operated reversibly as a URFC (for up to 2010 cycles on a single cell). This URFC uses bifunctional electrodes (oxidation and reduction electrodes reverse roles when switching from charge to discharge, as with a rechargeable battery) and cathode feed electrolysis (water is fed from the hydrogen side of the cell). Lightweight pressure vessels with performance factors (burst pressure × internal volume/tank weight) &gt; 50 km (2.0 million in.) have been designed, and a vessel with performance factor of 40 km (1.6 million in.) was fabricated. These vessels use lightweight bladder liners that act as inflatable mandrels for composite overwrap and provide the permeation barrier for gas storage. Bladders are fabricated using materials that are compatible with humidified, electrolyzed gases and are designed to be compatible with elevated temperatures that occur during fast fills or epoxy curing cycles. RFC systems are considered that use hydrogen/oxygen, hydrogen/air, or hydrogen/halogen chemistries. Hydrogen/halogen URFCs are capable of higher round-trip efficiency than hydrogen/oxygen URFCs but are significantly heavier. Therefore, hydrogen/halogen URFCs are advantageous for stationary applications, whereas hydrogen/oxygen URFCs are advantageous for mobile applications. Safety aspects of halogens may prohibit their use in densely populated areas and some commercial applications, so these niches can also benefit from hydrogen/oxygen URFCs.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002659839

New feed evaluation systems are needed that are especially suitable for roughages, including feed intake as an integral part of the system. A system has been suggested and some evidence provided for the development of an expression of feed potential that gives an estimate of the intake of digestible energy, and the performance that can be achieved, if the feeds are offered ad libitum. The feed potential of roughages depends on the size of the soluble fraction and of the insoluble but fermentable fraction, on the rate at which the latter is fermented, and on the rate at which the unfermented residues are eliminated from the rumen. It is suggested that it may be possible to select ruminants with greater gut volume and greater capacity to digest and utilise roughages. It also seems possible to select cereals for the feed potential of their straw without sacrificing yield and quality of their grain. Ruminants have adapted to seasonally fluctuating pasture forage quality and (or) availability by conserving energy from the good season in the form of fat stores. Fat stores can be manipulated to fuel growth, lactation and maintenance. It is argued that storage of energy must be contrasted to other methods of feed preservation. Fat storage generated by high intakes of high quality grass may sometimes be energetically more efficient than conservation of the forage. Fat can be reduced to match consumer demand without loss, or even with gain of carcass weight by feeding ruminally undergraded proteins sources. Finally, evidence is provided to suggest that during periods of low level nutrition, one should try to meet about one-third of the energy required for maintenance in order to avoid the excessive lean loss that otherwise occurs, to alleviate glucose deficiency. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Feed evaluation; Nutrient supply; Roughages",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002584380

The analysis is based on a simplified model that allows the system performance to be evaluated in terms of a small set of parameters, while still retaining the main thermodynamic aspects associated with their operation. This analysis therefore permits the broad-based application potential of these systems to be viewed. The paper also discusses the applicability of the model to practical systems. This paper analyzes LTES with multiple energy storage cells and multiple phase-change materials (PCMs). The most general case of infinite energy storage cells and PCMs is solved, for the charge process only, as well as for the overall charge-discharge process. The results yield the optimum phase change temperature, expressed as a continuous function of position along the LTES. The method is equally applicable to the case of a finite number of storage cells. An example of the application of the method to this case is also included. The results show the optimum phase change temperatures for each of the problems being considered, along with the corresponding optimum exergetic efficiencies. The solutions to the optimization problems are surprisingly simple to express, considering the difficulty of the problems, and indicate the potential advantages of using LTES with multiple PCMs. © 1998 by ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002226745

The surface memorization for p-n-heptyl-,-octyl- and-nonyl-oxybenzoic acids (HOBA, OOBA, NOBA) consisting of dimer molecules is relatively strong and is observed only on conducting coatings (ITO, SiO/ITO) while dielectric surfaces depress the effect. p-n-Decyloxybenzoic acid (DOBA) exhibits a SME neither for conducting nor for dielectric coatings. The basic role of adsorption in the surface memorization is discussed in combination with the influence of surface polarization and of certain mechanical properties of the liquid crystal molecules. It is demonstrated that the erasure activation energy V hyperbolically decreases with increasing cell thickness d and reaches saturation values at d 250mum. Probably this dependence indicates the role of the dielectric state of the coatings in the surface memorization process.

During the storm main phase, a high-density plasma sheet was observed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory geosynchronous satellites to move into and flow around the inner magnetosphere over a period of ∼12 hours [Borovsky et al., 1997; this issue] during the storm main phase. Densities at the leading edge of this structure reached 3 cm-3 as compared with more typical values &lt;1 cm-3. The factor of 3 change in the plasma sheet density from quiet to active times produced a factor of 3 enhancement in the strength of the simulated ring current. In addition, a short-timescale recovery in the Dst index at 1600 UT on November 4 was driven by changes in the outer boundary condition and appeared even in the absence of collisional losses. An overshoot in the minimum Dst occurred in the simulated ring current compared with observed values at ∼0200 UT on November 4 and is taken as evidence of a loss process not included in the ring current-atmosphere interaction model (RAM). The storm onset was associated with a compression of the entire dayside magnetopause to within geostationary orbit starting at 2307 UT and continuing for a half hour. It is suggested that a possible additional loss may have resulted as ions drifted to the compressed dayside magnetopause. In fact such losses were found in another simulation of the inner magnetosphere for the same storm by Freeman et al. [1996]. The energy supplied to the inner magnetosphere, relative to the total energy input during this magnetic storm, was examined by comparing two widely used energy input functions, the ε parameter [Akasofu, 1981] and the F parameter [Burton et al., 1975] against energy input to the ring current model based on geosynchronous plasma observations at the outer boundary. It is found that the ε parameter [Akasofu, 1981] overestimates the ring current energy input compared to the drift-loss model by almost an order of magnitude during the main phase. However, the integrated energy input from ε, over the 4 day interval of the storm, is in very good agreement with the total energy input inferred from observations. On the other hand, F more closely approximates the magnitude of the ring current energy input alone as calculated in the drift-loss model. An energy budget is constructed for the storm that shows energy inputs from the solar wind and energy dissipation due to ring current buildup and decay, auroral electron precipitation, Joule heating, ion precipitation, and energy storage in the magnetotail in reasonable balance. The ring current energy input accounts for only 15% of the total dissipated energy in this storm interval. A more complete energy budget that extends to November 11, 1993, was compiled by Knipp et al. [this issue].

Four different starches were used: unmodified waxy maize, containing 100% amylopectin; industrial corn, containing approximately 70% amylopectin and 30% amylose; common corn, possessing approximately 50% amylopectin and 50% amylose and an unmodified high amylose starch, consisting of approximately 30% amylopectin and 70% amylose. The concentration of starch in the blends was kept at 70% by weight. The influence of starch type on processing parameters (pressure, torque and energy), tensile strength, percent elongation, flexural strength and water absorption was investigated. Torque and energy data showed that the blends with starch containing high amylopectin content had the maximum value while the blend containing the highest amylose content required the lowest torque. Degradation or debranching of the branched macromolecular components of the starch during the thermomechanical processing treatment was observed from a gel-permeation chromatograph. Tensile strength and water absorption were correlated with the torque generated during blending. The effect of amylose to amylopectin in starch on tensile properties, flexural properties and storage time are discussed. The tensile and flexural strength increased at the amylose content of 70% and it is higher in waxy maize starch (highly branched) blends, presumably due to more crosslinking. Samples with weldline had a lower tensile strength, flexural modulus and percent elongation. Influence of starch type on water absorption is also discussed. Blends containing waxy maize starch absorb more water than those containing high amylose content of 70%. In most of the samples, the equilibrium water uptake was between 20 to 24% over the period of 80 days. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001450684

As a consequence, understanding the thermal response of the materials used in the construction of the drive becomes imperative. In this report, we focus on the thermal behavior of a common perfluoropolyether lubricant (ZDOL) used on the carbon-overcoated, hard disk. In particular, we show that evaporative loss of this disk lubricant, as well as bonding of the lubricant to the carbon-overcoated disk, can occur at the temperatures encountered in the hard-disk drive. Surface energy measurements show that the interaction of the hydroxyl-terminated perfluoropolyether ZDOL occurs principally through the end-groups. On unannealed disks, the interaction between this ""mobile"" lubricant and the carbon overcoat is characterized by hydrogen bonding with the strength of these interactions being only slightly stronger than the intermolecular hydrogen bonding characteristic of bulk ZDOL. Upon annealing at temperatures in the range of 60-150°C, the ZDOL lubricant becomes ""bonded"" to the disk. The surface energy of the bonded lubricant is substantially lower than the mobile lubricant reflecting the increased interaction strength that occurs as a result of bonding. Since the bonded state is the lower energy state, transitions from the mobile state to the bonded state are thermodynamically favored. The kinetics of this bonding transition, as well as the kinetics of lubricant evaporation were studied as a function of temperature. Using a model of two competing reaction channels, the activation energies for both lubricant bonding and lubricant evaporation were determined to be 3.6 kcal/mole and 5.4 kcal/mole respectively. Ab initio quantum chemical modelling was used to investigate possible interaction sites on the carbon surface. Both experiment and theory indicate that interaction of the hydroxyl-terminated ZDOL to the carbon overcoat occurs via hydrogen bonding to oxygenated species on the carbon overcoat, with a binding energy of 5-8 kcal/mole. An esterification reaction between the hydroxyl end-groups of ZDOL with carboxyl groups on the carbon surface as a result of annealing is shown to be consistent with the both the surface energy data and the kinetic data. © J.C.

Plant propagation can be performed by means of tissue-culture-propagated plants or by rhizomes. In the latter case, the farmer can produce them on his farm from 2-3 yr old plants, which will reduce costs compared to micropropagation. Methods were developed for harvesting and planting of rhizomes. Harvest of the crop is influenced by the destination of the raw material and the drying and storage methods. Harvesting can be done by existing mowing, baling and chopping machines for some building material applications and energy and paper pulp use. For utilization of Miscanthus as special building materials and geotextiles whole stems are required, and machines for mowing and bundling of whole stems are a necessity. Different storage possibilities have been investigated. Selection of the most appropriate method can be performed only by comparing complete production chains from field harvest to delivery at the processing plant. Costs of different chains are compared from soil preparation to transport to the processing plant. Self-propelled baling is one of the lowest cost options but chopping and compaction after storage is also an attractive option, since drying is possible and transport costs are lower. © 1998 Silsoe Research Institute.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001370984

In addition to raising the level of cleaning, they have also provided environmental benefits by reducing energy consumption through shorter washing times, lower washing temperatures, and reduced water consumption. Today proteases are joined by lipases and amylases in improving detergent efficacy especially for household laundering at lower temperatures and, in industrial cleaning operations, at lower pH levels.

Following 7 days of food deprivation at 15°C, the levels of muscle glycogen decreased by approximately 50% in small fish relative to control values (i.e., day 1). In comparison, small fish acclimated to cold temperatures did not exhibit a significant reduction of muscle glycogen over the seven day fasting regime. In contrast to small fish, the levels of white muscle glycogen in large fish remained unchanged after food deprivation, regardless of acclimation temperature. A seven day deprivation of food also resulted in a 50% depletion of white muscle glucose concentrations in small and large fish acclimated to warm temperatures, but there were no significant changes in this variable in fish acclimated to cold temperatures. In contrast to the negative effects of food deprivation on white muscle glycogen and glucose levels, the concentrations of white muscle PCr and ATP were not greatly affected by food deprivation under any of the experimental conditions. Taken together, these results clearly show that food deprivation can have an important influence on the storage of energy metabolites for anaerobic energy production, particularly in small fish at warm temperatures. In the future, it may be very important to consider the physiological effects of short-term food deprivation when interpreting results from studies in which fish have been fasted prior to treatments such as exercise.","ATP; Body size; Fasting; Glucose; Glycogen; Metabolites; Nutritional status; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Phosphocreatine; Scaling; Temperature","Mykiss; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmonidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001117731

While the small scales at Mercury should make the substorm timescale there much shorter than it is at the Earth, these early interpretations may have too readily assumed that the substorm requirement of an energy storage and release phase occurs. Instead, its size should make Mercury's magnetosphere especially prone to disturbances that are purely ""driven"" by the changing external boundary conditions on the magnetosphere imposed by the solar wind. These result simply from the magnetosphere's relatively unhindered reconfiguration in response to the varying interplanetary parameters, including the IMF southward component. In this paper we demonstrate that the ""disturbed"" structure observed outbound from closest approach during the first Mariner 10 flyby can alternately be explained as a consequence of a typical period of rotating IMF. We use an appropriately modified IMF-dependent terrestrial magnetosphere model scaled for Mercury, together with an assumed, reasonable IMF time series, to reproduce the magnetic field signature during the disturbed outbound pass segment. This result suggests that rapid restructuring of the small magnetosphere in response to changing local interplanetary conditions may dominate the magnetospheric dynamics at Mercury. Future Mercury magnetosphere missions should be instrumented to distinguish between this driven magnetospheric dynamism and any internal Earth-like substorm processes. These results also remind us that driven reconfigurations must always be considered in studies of transients in the terrestrial magnetosphere.

The plant components are described adding to their steady-state characteristics the dynamic equations of mass, momentum, and energy balances. The state variables are mass flow rates, static pressures, static temperatures of the fluid, wall temperatures, and shaft rotational speed. The analysis has been applied to a 65 MW heavy-duty gas turbine plant with two off-board, silo-type combustion chambers. To model the compressor, equipped with variable inlet guide vanes, a subdivision into five partial compressors is adopted, in serial arrangement, separated by dynamic blocks. The turbine is described using a one-dimensional, row-by-row mathematical model, that takes into account both the air bleed cooling effect and the mass storage among the stages. The simulation model considers also the air bleed transformations from the compressor down to the turbine. Both combustion chambers have been modeled utilizing a sequence of several sub-volumes, to simulate primary and secondary zones in presence of three hybrid burners.

Three techniques - lambda iteration, matrix and accelerated lambda iteration - which are used to solve these problem are discussed and compared. In the case of the CO2 non-LTE problem in the Earth's atmosphere, it is demonstrated that accelerated lambda iteration is far superior to the other algorithms in minimizing computer time and storage and in converging much more rapidly; moreover the convergence rate is insensitive to the initial population estimates and to wide range of variation in the model input parameters.

Triclinic pendimethalin I (P1̄) is the orange-coloured thermodynamically stable form, whereas monoclinic pendimethalin II (P21/c) is a bright-yellow metastable form. The latter is normally produced first upon cooling the molten chemical, whereas the orange form is formed by a polymorphic phase transition which occurs slowly upon long term storage of the yellow form at temperatures below its melting point. Such phase transitions are rapidly revealed by calorimetry. The crystal structures of the polymorphs have been determined using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Solid state NMR spectroscopy, vibrational spectroscopy and UV-VIS spectroscopy were applied to further study the nature of the polymorphism in terms of intra- and inter-molecular properties. Solid state CP-MAS 13C NMR spectroscopy was shown to be the method of choice for quantitative analysis of polymorphic mixtures. The differences in spectral properties and crystal habits were investigated by computational methods which included molecular exciton, molecular orbital and molecular mechanics calculations. The dramatic colour change from yellow to orange-red during the polymorphic transition is discussed in terms of competing inter- and intra-molecular electronic effects. The driving force for the yellow (II) to orange (I) polymorphic transition is attributed to the change in the electronic delocalization achieved from shortening, strengthening, and partially straightening the 'bent' hydrogen bond between the secondary amino hydrogen and an oxygen of the 6′-nitro group. This results in increased overlap between the amino nitrogen's lone pair and the π-electron orbitals of the aromatic ring. The calculated lattice stabilization energy due to this process is 4 to 5 kcal mol-1, and the relative lattice energies are consistent with the observed stabilities of the polymorphs. The slow kinetics of the polymorphic transition are largely governed by the steric interaction of the 1-ethylpropyl side chain and the two nitro groups. During crystallization, the more compact side chain conformation required to form the energetically more stable orange (I) polymorph appears to be more difficult to achieve than that required for the yellow (II) polymorph.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000844380

Blubber was thinner over the head than in the thoracic-abdominal region, where thickness varied little around the girth of the animal. Thickness of blubber anterior to the anus ranged from 15 to 25 mm. Posterior to the anus, blubber formed thick dorsal and ventral ridges but was extremely thin laterally. In the thoracic-abdominal region, blubber of calves (X̄ = 22.9 mm ± 3.6 SD; n = 11) was significantly thicker than that of all other animals, but lactating females had the thinnest blubber (14.5 ± 3.1 mm; n = 7). Immature porpoises of both sexes, mature males, and non-lactating mature females had thicknesses of blubber intermediate between those of calves and lactating females. Thickness of blubber anterior to the anus was correlated negatively with body size, an unusual relationship for a marine mammal. Blubber posterior to the anus was similar among reproductive classes. Blubber of the harbor porpoise appears to be divided into two functional components. The thoracic-abdominal blubber functions primarily as an energy store and insulation, and posterior blubber acts to maintain hydrodynamic shape on the peduncle. Calves and adult porpoises may have different thermoregulatory and energetic strategies, resulting in different adaptations of blubber structure.","Blubber; Harbor porpoise; Lipid storage; Phocoena phocoena",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000631818

Explicit assignments for equivalent circuit parameters (resistances, inductances, and capacitances), are derived in terms of the properties of the resonant piezoid and damping fluid medium. The calculation shows that the effect of fluid elasticity is a reduction in both the equivalent resistance and inductance relative to a corresponding viscous bulk. The lower inductance is due to a reduced decay envelope for shear wave propagation into the liquid; in effect, a smaller mass of liquid is ""dragged"" by the crystal. The lower equivalent resistance is due to the combined effect of lower energy dissipation and enhanced recoverable energy storage within the mechanically active fluid layer near the crystal surface. Comparison of model predictions with published results on a variety of undamped, viscously damped, and viscoelastically damped crystals shows very good agreement. © 7998 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000630591

In the view of the majority of nutrition scientists and physicians, this practice heightens the risk of malnutrition and infection for the infant. Where these nonbreastmilk foods are used to replace breastmilk, this view certainly is justified. In high-risk populations who use foods such as butterfat as complements to unrestricted breastfeeding, however, the relationship between early supplementation and infant growth and morbidity may be complex. Moreover, it may be mediated by the nutritional status of mothers and the nutritional adequacy of their breastmilk. In this work, the ecological context of butterfat feeding in Turkana, Kenya, is examined. It is argued that butterfat promotes positive infant energy balance prior to the critical period of the transition to active immunity, which occurs during the stressful dry season. Breastmilk alone may be inadequate to sustain growth and fat storage of young infants, since the diet and nutritional status of Turkana mothers suggest that fat content of their milk may be at the low end of the human range. In an environment where selection pressure is assumed to be high, a strategy of complementing the fat in human milk with butterfat may prolong positive energy balance of infants and enhance their resistance to infection and their survival during the critical period. Hence, it is an important component of human adaptation in Turkana. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000473960

These disks typically have an amorphous carbon overcoat upon which a thin lubricant layer is deposited using dip-coating technique. Glancing-angle FTIR (Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectrometry) is used for measuring molecular orientation of planer functional end groups. A molecular orientation index (MOI) was defined as 1 for randomly oriented functional end groups. The MOI is mathematically derived as 3 (maximum) for lubricant molecules oriented with their functional end groups perpendicular to the surface, and as 0 (minimum) if lubricant molecules oriented with their functional end groups parallel to the surface. The MOI is shown to depend on processing conditions and lubricant film thickness. The tribological performance of the lubricant films was evaluated using drag-mode contact start-stop testing. It was found that wear durability of the lubricant films (˜2 nm) with MOI ˜ 1.5 is a few times better than those with MOI ˜ 0.5 to 1.0. No significant difference in the amount of bonded lubricant film was detected over the range of MOI studied. Nor was there a detectable relationship with hydrophobicity. It was inferred from decreased MOI values due to thermal effects and storage time that a smaller MOI value corresponds to a lower free energy state of the lubricant film. Interestingly, MOI values for bonded lubricant films for Process A are found to be close to 3.0, suggesting that almost all functional end groups in the bonded films are oriented perpendicular to the carbon surface, close to 2.0 for process B, and close to 0 for process C, meaning that almost all functional end groups in the bonded films from process C are oriented parallel to the carbon surface. Relationship between physical/chemical bonding configurations and MOI values are graphically presented in detail. Based on this relation, a simple model on lubricant film structures for the three processes studied is presented. The model MOI values agree very well with measured MOI values as a function of lubricant thickness for all three processes, and the model also appears to account for the observed tribology performance for the MOI values studied (0.5 ˜ 1.5). © 1998 by ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000462691

It is proposed that below 500 K the reduction of NO occurs at the expenses of a concomitant oxidation of Ce3+ sites. In this model, the supported metal activates the reducing agent favouring the efficiency of Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple. The influence of a high temperature reduction (H2, 1073 K) is also investigated.

TEM observations revealed the Thiobacillus ferrooxidans cells used an excreted organic film in which sulfide-sulfur was collected from iron disulfide (FeS2) in the form of tiny particles acting as temporary energy storage sites. The energy cycle responsible for microbial corrosion of steel and the symbiosis (collective corrosion) between SRB and aerobic iron sulfide-oxidizing bacteria were discussed based upon the investigated systems.","Biocorrosion; Films and film formation; Iron sulfide; Marcasite; Microbiologically influenced corrosion; Pyrite layers; Steel; Sulfate-reducing bacteria; Sulfide oxidation; Thiobacillus ferrooxidans",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000218010

METHODS: The swine segmental small bowel graft was autotransplanted after it was preserved with lactated Ringer's (LR), Euro-Collins (EC), hyperosmolarity citrate adenine (HC-A) and WMO-1 solutions for 10, 18 and 24 hours, respectively. The recipient survival rate, morphological structure, graft mucosal energy substances and Na+-K+ ATPase activity were studied, and graft absorption was estimated with D-xylose absorption test. RESULTS: The morphological study of the grafts preserved with LR or HC-A solution for 10 hours or with EC and WMO-1 solution for 18 hours was normal 6 days after operation. Mucosal ATP, total adenine nucleotides (TAN) contents and Na+-K+ AT-Pase activity of the graft preserved with EC or WMO solution were higher than that of the graft preserved with LR or HC-A solution. Serum level of D-xylose was higher in EC and WMO-1 groups than in LR and HC-A groups when the graft was preserved for 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: EC and WMO-1 solutions can preserve the swine small bowel up to 18 hours, which are superior to LR and HC-A solutions.","Adenine nucleotides; Adenosine triphosphate; Intestine, small/transplantation; Intestine, small/transplatation; Na (+)-K(+)-exchanging ATPase; Organ preservation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000174075

The mechanism proposes that storage of a portion of the kinetic energy of the hyperthermal particles as interstitial atoms and subsequent release of this energy is a general phenomenon that is responsible for ion beam enhanced epitaxy and growth of metastable materials. A generalized epitaxial phase diagram which illustrates the energy-temperature synergism is constructed. This provides an understanding of the limited and unlimited silicon homoepitaxial growth from thermal (molecular beam epitaxy) and hyperthermal Si atoms, respectively. Four regions of energy-temperature space have been identified in reference to epitaxial growth: I. Unlimited epitaxy due to high thermal energy; II. Interstitial registry-limited epitaxial growth; III. Hyperthermal particle enhanced epitaxy; IV.

By deceleration from the initial energy of 358 MeV/u down to various energies as low as 49 MeV/u, i.e., far below the production energy of bare ionic species, the electron pickup cross sections were obtained for collisions with [Formula Presented], Ar, [Formula Presented] and Kr gaseous targets. The measured cross sections and beam lifetimes are compared with the theoretical results for radiative and nonradiative electron capture. The present data, along with the theoretical approximations discussed, provide a solid basis for the estimation of beam lifetimes for decelerated bare high-[Formula Presented] ions. Moreover, a normalization procedure is proposed, in which absolute total charge-exchange cross sections are derived by normalizing the simultaneously measured yield of radiative electron capture photons to rigorously calculated relativistic cross sections. This method, along with the unprecedented beam conditions at the ESR storage ring, allows a significant improvement of the accuracy of cross-section data. © 1998 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000057398

The LESR uses an intense laser pulse stored in a high-finesse resonator to interact repetitively with a circulating electron beam in the energy range from a few MeV to a few hundred MeV. The rapid damping caused by laser-electron interaction counterbalances the intrabeam scattering effect, thus allowing electron beams with relatively low energy to be cooled or stabilized in the storage ring to very low transverse emittances. Intense x rays are produced simultaneously from Compton backscattering and can be used for x-ray lithography and other applications. © 1998 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000031121
