The economical and efficient technique that can be used to produce building products for insulation and store energy is also the subject of research for a long time. Cement-based products manufactured by extrusion technique offer advantages in terms of the flexibility of section profiles, material performance enhancement and mass production mode. Different fillers can be used to achieve desired effects on thermal, mechanical and physical characteristics during extrusion process. These fillers include sand and expanded perlite which are good at thermal insulation and phase change composites which can provide high energy storage capacities.

The high penetration of wind generation causes fluctuations of tie-line power flow and significantly affects power system operations. This can lead to severe problems, such as system frequency oscillations, and/or violations of lines capability. With proper control, the DSTATCOM-SMES is capable of supplying the power system with both active and reactive powers simultaneously and very fast, and thus is able to enhance the dynamic security dramatically. A full detailed model of the DSTATCOM-SMES controller is proposed and a new control scheme is designed, comprising an enhanced frequency control scheme. The dynamic performance of the proposed control schemes is fully validated through digital simulation carried out by using MATLAB/Simulink. © 2009 IEEE.","Detailed modeling; Distributed energy storage system; Distributed generation; Distribution static synchronous compensator (DSTATCOM); Dynamic control; Microgrids; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Wind generation","Detailed modeling; Distributed energy storage systems; Distributed Generation; Distribution static synchronous compensators; Dynamic controls; Micro grid; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Wind generation; Controllers; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Flywheels; Magnetic storage; Simulators; Superconducting cables; Superconducting magnets; Superconductivity; Wind power; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72449200263

However, requirements such as high power factor, long lifetime, accurate current control and high efficiency pose challenges to the design of LED ballast circuits. This paper proposes an LED ballast with a first-stage isolated current-fed power factor correction (PFC) pre-regulator that puts the storage capacitor to the secondary, thus allowing the use of lower-voltage storage capacitor in order to extend the overall system lifetime. Furthermore, the high voltage stress on the main switch, which is typical in current-fed converters, is reduced substantially by appropriately exploiting the transformer leakage inductance. The design uses two secondary transformer windings and an LED current driver to form a non-cascading structure to improve efficiency. Multiple non-cascading structures can be used for LED lamps for instant independent brightness control. Analysis, design example and prototype verification are given for the LED ballast. © 2009 IEEE.","Isolated PFC regulator; LED ballast; LED lighting; Non-cascading construction","Ballast circuit; Brightness control; Current control; Current drivers; Current-fed converter; High efficiency; High power factor; High-voltage stress; Independent control; Industrial environments; Isolated PFC regulator; Leakage inductance; LEd lamps; LED lighting; Long lifetime; Power factor corrections; Pre-regulator; Prototype verification; Real time; Storage capacitor; AC generator motors; Capacitance; Capacitors; DC generators; Electric power factor; Energy conversion; Light; Lighting; Transformer windings; Light emitting diodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72449182109

The Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) battery is commonly used for photovoltaic storage because of its low cost, low maintenance, and wide availability. A Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) integrates the VRLA battery and ultracapacitor, drawing on their respective advantages at appropriate times. By combining an ultracapacitor with a VRLA battery, the power density of the overall system is increased. The ultracapacitor operates under high power conditions reducing the strain of large current draw from the VRLA battery.

This initial form of chemical energy is stabilized by the biosynthesis of carbohydrates. To produce these energy-rich products, a substrate is needed that feeds in reductive equivalents. When photosynthetic microorganisms learned to use water as a substrate some 2 billion years ago, a fundamental barrier against unlimited use of solar energy was overcome. The possibility of solar energy use has inspired researchers to construct artificial photosynthetic systems that show analogy to parts of the intricate molecular machinery of photosynthesis. Recent years have seen a reorientation of efforts toward creating integrated light-to-fuel systems that can use solar energy for direct synthesis of energy-rich compounds, so-called solar fuels. Sustainable production of solar fuels is a long awaited development that promises extensive solar energy use combined with long-term storage. The stoichiometry of water splitting into molecular oxygen, protons, and electrons is deceptively simple; achieving it by chemical catalysis has proven remarkably difficult. The reaction center Photosystem II couples light-induced charge separation to an efficient molecular water-splitting catalyst, a Mn4Ca complex, and is thus an important template for biomimetic chemistry. In our aims to design biomimetic manganese complexes for light-driven water oxidation, we link photosensitizers and charge-separation motifs to potential catalysts in supramolecular assemblies. In photosynthesis, production of carbohydrates demands the delivery of multiple reducing equivalents to CO2. In contrast, the two-electron reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen is much less demanding. Virtually all microorganisms have enzymes called hydrogenases that convert protons to hydrogen, many of them with good catalytic efficiency. The catalytic sites of hydrogenases are now the center of attention of biomimetic efforts, providing prospects for catalytic hydrogen production with inexpensive metals. Thus, we might complete the water-to-fuel conversion. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"hydrogen; hydrogenase; iron; manganese; nanoparticle; ruthenium; titanium; titanium dioxide; water; article; biomimetics; chemistry; cyanobacterium; electron transport; green alga; metabolism; methodology; oxidation reduction reaction; photosynthesis; photosystem II; solar energy; Algae, Green; Biomimetics; Cyanobacteria; Electron Transport; Hydrogen; Hydrogenase; Iron; Manganese; Nanoparticles; Oxidation-Reduction; Photosynthesis; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Ruthenium; Solar Energy; Titanium; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72949084589

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global primary energy demand will increase by 50% between now and 2030, and over 70% of this increase will come from developing countries, especially China and India. The increased use of energy has led to considerable emissions of greenhouse gas emissions, and many countries have proposed a target to limit the rise of the global average temperature to two degrees Celsius compared with the temperature of the preindustrial era. According to the IPCC, this means reducing global emissions by at least 50% by the middle of the century. On the other hand, the availability of and demand for energy probably means that fossil fuels will continue to play a key role in the energy mixture of the future. Naturally, the challenge is to reduce dramatically the greenhouse gas emissions of power generation based on fossil fuels, but there are several options available and CCS technologies are under development and demonstration. CCS processes need additional process phases compared with traditional power plants, which brings a penalty in power generation efficiency of 11-40% compared with power plants without CO2 capture. Additional costs will also come from transportation and storage of CO2. The final costs are, however, dependent on individual projects, scale, location and technology in use. The deployment of CCS technologies is progressing very quickly at the moment. Several demonstration projects are running and there are plans for many new ones. Achieving CCS on a full commercial scale will require the construction of a huge infrastructure encompassing a CO2 transport network and large-scale storage solutions. Full-scale deployment will therefore take a long time to accomplish. On the other hand, CCS will enable the utilisation of enormous fossil fuel resources with low CO2 emissions and will guarantee clean power production to meet the needs of increasing energy demand.",,"Additional costs; Average temperature; Clean power; Demonstration project; Economic output; Energy demands; Final costs; Fossil fuel resources; Global emissions; International Energy Agency; Power generation efficiency; Pre-industrial; Primary energy demand; Storage solutions; Technology in use; Transport networks; Developing countries; Energy management; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71949093597

The goal is maximizing the profit of company through participating in the day-ahead energy and ancillary service markets. In order to reach this goal, it is essential to have an appropriate approach to self-schedule of company. The spinning reserve and regulation markets are considered as ancillary services in which the company can participate.

The discrete representation of the derivative operator reproduces the exact derivative of a trigonometric polynomial. The set of ordinary differential equations that represents the dynamic behavior of the electric system is transformed into a nonlinear algebraic formulation and solved using a Newton algorithm. The unknowns of the algebraic equations are the samples of the state variables at the periodic steady-state. Furthermore, a direct method for solving sparse systems of equations is incorporated in the Newton method, where the Jacobianmatrix is highly sparse for large-scale power systems. The incorporation of sparse techniques to this discrete-time domain method improves its efficiency in terms of storage and computational effort. Two test cases based on a electric arc furnace and a transmission power network are presented to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of this method to solve electric power systems.

For this purpose, the usual plasmon dispersion relation is employed to derive an approximate paraxial equation. The latter is analyzed with a Gaussian beam solution. For a finite angular momentum associated with the plasmon, Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) solutions are employed for solving the electrostatic potential problem which gives approximate solution and is valid for plasmon beams in the paraxial approximation. The LG potential determines the electric field components and energy flux of plasmons with finite angular momentum.

The structural parameters such as crystallite size have been evaluated. The transmission spectra, recorded in the UV visible range reveal a relatively high transmission coefficient (70%) in the obtained films. The transmittance data analysis indicates that the optical band gap is closely related to the deposition conditions, a direct band gap ranging from 2.0 eV to 2.34 eV was deduced.

While previous studies of Lake Kinneret, Israel, have looked at evaporation rate using a single timescale or single measurement method, this is the first comprehensive study to reconcile and explain the differences between a variety of measurement and calculation methods (pan evaporation, water and heat balance, aerodynamic methods and Penman simplified methods) across a multitude of temporal scales (10 min, 1 h, daily, monthly). The cross validation of the methods suggests that the hourly calculation with the aerodynamic methods may result in a better estimation of the monthly Bowen Ratio for the energy balance methods, and therefore may increase its reliability. We also show that comprehensive measurements and calculations of monthly heat storage change in the lake can be used to verify the hourly results of the hydrodynamic method, and the daily calculations of the Penman's equation method. Moreover, using the Penman's equation it is suggested that daily Pan A evaporation measurements are nearly similar to the evaporation from the deep water lake when the heat storage change is not taken into account. It is suggested that subject to data availability, the cross validation of multiple methods increases the reliability and confidence of the measured and calculated surface fluxes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For climate change it is necessary to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Fossil energy carriers are becoming scarcer and increasingly costly. There is the import dependence on crude oil, gas, and coal. The EU and member countries like Germany seek to make 22% of the electricity that is needed to come from regenerative sources and for 18% of it to be generated in power-heat coupling. The federal government aims for the source of electrical power to be up to 40% renewable energy. With this massive development the preparation of large energy storage capacities is urgently needed for a stable grid operation according to a new Verein des Elektrotechnik Elektronik Informationstechnik eV (VDE) study ""Energy storage in power supply systems with a large share of renewable energy carriers"". The discussion covers introduction; attractive possibilities, and tuning or decoupling power generation and power needs. Increasingly energy storage gains significance. Such storages must have outputs in gigawatts and capacities up to 100 Gw-hr. Hydrogen has a great potential to store energy because stored under pressure in underground salt caverns it can be the source for 60 times more electrical energy than compressed air. The hydrogen can be used in hybrid vehicles, gas engines, gas turbines, and gas-and-steam power plants. Electrolysis has an efficiency of 65%, compression 97%, and gas and steam process 60%. The automotive use of renewable energies is another option. Wind and other regenerative energies decrease carbon dioxide emissions. Initial hybrid vehicles are the plug-in type that also use the conventional combustion engine. Lithium-ion batteries are presently favored. To further reduce the use of fossil energy carriers, the fuel cell hybrid vehicle will use a combination of battery and hydrogen power. The use of batteries as opposed to hydrogen has the advantage that with battery power from renewable energies the power obtained is better used by a factor of 2 to 3. In city traffic the battery can be charged at whatever plug outlet and travel most of the day. The combination of hydrogen and fuel cells for the long stretches overcomes the handicap of the low range of pure battery cars and opens an attractive potential for decoupling or tuning power generation and need. The real competition is not between batteries and fuel cells but between fuel cells and combustion engines. The race is won by fuel cells when motor fuel costs increase and/or when the carbon dioxide problem becomes greater. A conversion to hydrogen and the fuel cell drive requires a concerted action of energy and motor fuel suppliers and the vehicle industry.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70649114575

The focal point was the increase of the energy efficiency of fossil fired power plants and technologies for carbon dioxide separation from the flue gas of coal power plants. The discussion covers introduction; increase of the energy efficiency of fossil fired power plants; and carbon dioxide separation for fossil fired power plants. In the foreseeable future, worldwide and in Germany all primary energy carriers will be used to assure the supply of electrical energy. This includes a continuously increasing share of renewable energy carriers such as water, wind, and sun, and of fossil energy carriers ideally using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. Also there is the indisputable contribution of nuclear energy to a carbon dioxide-lean electrical power generation. Besides optimization of the energy mix the efficiency is to be increased at every step in the energy chain. The third contribution is optimization of the transmission and distribution of electrical power. To contribute to this, there is the bundling of small generation facilities to virtual power plants for example or feeding excessively produced electricity from renewable energies into storages such as heat pumps or into the grid of electric vehicles. A permanent monitor using intelligent counters will change the behavior of persons in households. The efficiency of combined gas and steam power plants since the first such facility of the 1990's has constantly increased from 50% at that time to over 58% today. The SGT5-8000H gas turbine developed by Siemens is illustrated. It is the largest and most powerful gas turbine in the world. The SGT5-8000H gas turbine is being installed at the Irsching 4 combined gas and steam power plant with over 60% efficiency in a fossil fuel fired power plant. By the higher efficiency of 2 percentage points about 40,000 tonnes/yr of carbon dioxide emissions can be saved corresponding to the emissions of about 10,000 middle-market cars going over 20,000 km/yr. Since the start of the 1980's to today the efficiency of coal power plants has increased from 37.5% to 46%. The next step is to develop the ""50 plus"" coal power plant to achieve over 50% efficiency that would save 33% in carbon dioxide emissions versus a coal power plant of 1980. Power-heat coupling facilities that supply steam for district heating can achieve an overall efficiency of about 90%.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70649093924

To this end, this chapter studies neural structures with weights that follow the model of the quantum harmonic oscillator. The proposed neural networks have stochastic weights which are calculated from the solution of Schrödinger's equation under the assumption of a parabolic (harmonic) potential. These weights correspond to diffusing particles, which interact with each other as the theory of Brownian motion (Wiener process) predicts. The learning of the stochastic weights (convergence of the diffusing particles to an equilibrium) is analyzed. In the case of associative memories the proposed neural model results in an exponential increase of patterns storage capacity (number of attractors). It is also shown that conventional neural networks and learning algorithms based on error gradient can be conceived as a subset of the proposed quantum neural structures. Thus, the complementarity between classical and quantum physics is also validated in the field of neural computation. © 2009, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900068444

Since several years the community has been discussing the directions for maximizing the physics reach of the LHC by upgrading the experiments, in particular ATLAS and CMS, the LHC machine and the CERN proton injectors, in a phased approach. The first phase comprises construction of a new proton linac, LINAC4 and an LHC interaction-region (IR) upgrade, with the goal of increasing the LHC luminosity to 2 - 3 × 1034 cm-2s-1, while maximizing the use of mature magnet technologies and of the existing infrastructure. These two projects were approved by the CERN Council in December 2007 and are scheduled for completion in 2014. The second phase foresees further substantial improvements in the injector chain, with a proposed replacement of the aging PS and its booster, by a superconducting proton linac (SPL) and a new higher-energy storage ring, PS2, complemented by modifications in the existing SPS, together with major upgrades of the ATLAS and CMS detectors, and, possibly, including another upgrade of the interaction regions based on a different magnet technology, as well as complementary measures such as crab cavities, or a new beam structure. Completion of this second phase around 2018-2020 should allow further increasing the luminosity of the LHC towards 1035 cm -2s-1. On an even longer time scale, the magnet technology developed for the second phase could provide the route towards an ultimate energy upgrade of the LHC. In this report, I first recall a few key challenges inherent in the LHC baseline design, and then describe phased upgrade scenarios for the LHC and its injectors which overcome the design limitations and may ultimately lead to a 10-fold luminosity increase. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial- ShareAlike Licence.",,"Baseline design; Beam structures; Design limitations; Injector chains; Interaction region; Large Hadron collider LHC; Magnet technology; Super conducting proton linacs; Luminance; Magnets; Nuclear instrumentation; Superconducting magnets; High energy physics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891939849

In many cases, the problems can be attributed to the performance of drilling fluids which then presents challenges to drilling fluid industry. Such problems include poor hole cleaning, high pressure losses, loss circulation zones, fluid gelation, reservoir fluid invasions. Thus, drilling fluid industry must work hard to overcome these challenges figuring out solutions which include fluid formulations capable of good continuous performance under all adverse conditions. In this paper we address these issues, we present the adverse conditions in the deep drilling environment of pressures and temperatures, and the implications they have on flow pressures, formation damage and well control. We analyze the approaches taken by different operators in terms of drilling fluid design and implementation in such wells from a series of reported case studies. These include rheological measurements at high temperature and pressures and attempts to model-fit the data to predictive rheological models which could then be used in appropriate hydraulic models to estimate pressure drop profiles along the wellbore. High temperatures present additional stability challenges to drilling fluids which could be overcome with the addition of appropriate additives. The search for such additives is continuous and in this paper we discuss various alternatives, the operational procedures and address also potential problems. Finally, we present possible optimum solutions to overcome such problems and increase the success rate of drilling fluid performance in these difficult conditions. © 2009 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM.","Challenges; Deep drilling; Drilling fluids; Mpd; Rheology","Challenges; Deep drilling; High temperature and pressure; Mpd; Operational procedures; Potential problems; Rheological measurements; Rheological models; Deepwater drilling; Digital storage; Energy resources; Exhibitions; Gelation; Hydraulic models; Oil wells; Rheology; Drilling fluids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890317667

Due to their relatively low cost power, high reliability and the lack of moving parts they powered the space program from the very beginning (Landis and Appelbaum 1991). As a result the array manufacturing technology is now well developed, and the technology is well characterized for vibration, thermal-cycling, and other environmental loads of the space environment. A number of studies concerning the usage of PV cells on the Mars surface have been performed during the years and we quote here some of them. A rover powered by a PV array was designed in Hibbs (1989). To add robustness, a fixed array rather than one which tracks the sun was envisaged, because of the modest power requirements (275 Watt average power and peak power capability of up to 2000 W during climbing over large boulders). The array surface was as large as 7 m2. Another study refers to a long-endurance, remotely piloted aircraft capable of flight within the Martian environment (Colozza 1990). There is a variety of mission scenarios which would be possible with this aircraft ranging from magnetic and gravity field mapping to surveillance / reconnaissance missions. The flight duration would be on the order of one year. The power and propulsion systems consist of solar PV array panels, a regenerative fuel cell and an electric motor. Depending on the solar cell type the required PV array surface could be quite large (from 336 to 405 m2 in case of silicon-based solar cells or from 118 to 166 m 2 when gallium arsenide PV arrays are used). A solar power system for a 40 day manned Mars surface scientific expedition was studied in McKissock et al. (1990). The electrical power requirements were assumed to be 40 kW for life support and experiment power during the Martian day and 20 kW for life support during the Martian night. The solar energy system consisted of roll out amorphous silicon arrays and a hydrogen - oxygen regenerative fuel cell energy storage system. The total array covers 2822 m2 when deployed and has a blanket mass of 177.6 kg. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890003476

A standard solar dynamic power system uses a mirror to concentrate solar radiation onto an absorber structure. By conduction through a solid material or circulation of a working fluid, the absorber heat is transferred to a thermal engine (i.e. a turbogenerator, Stirling engine, termocouple or thermionic-emitter). Alternators coupled to these thermal engines may generate electrical energy. Previous practice proved that three different cycles can be used for thermodynamic conversion of solar radiation: Brayton, Rankine and Stirling (Menetrey 1963; Prisnjakov 1991; Prisnjakov et al. 1991). For continuos operation during dark periods the use of melted materials to store thermal energy is being considered. Among the advantages of dynamic power systems one could quote their ability to provide electrical energy and heat simultaneously, the fact that the power plant may be unified by using either solar or nuclear energy or their relative invulnerability to corpuscular particles and to electromagnetic radiation and the possibility of power control according to a given power consumption schedule (Prisnjakov 1991). © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889969478

To act as an efficient energy carrier, hydrogen should be absorbed and desorbed in materials easily and in high quantities. Owing to the complexity in structural arrangements and difficulties involved in establishing hydrogen positions by x-ray diffraction methods, the structural information of hydrides are very limited compared to other classes of materials (like oxides, intermetallics, etc.). This can be overcome by conducting computational simulations combined with selected experimental study which can save environment, money, and man power. The predicting capability of first-principles density functional theory (DFT) is already well recognized and in many cases structural and thermodynamic properties of single/multi component system are predicted. This review will focus on possible new classes of materials those have high hydrogen content, demonstrate the ability of DFT to predict crystal structure, and search for potential meta-stable phases. Stabilization of such meta-stable phases is also discussed. © 2009 by the authors.","Complex hydrides; Hydrogen storage materials; Structural study; Theoretical modeling","Complex hydrides; Computational simulation; First-principles density functional theory; Hydrogen storage materials; Structural arrangement; Structural studies; Theoretical modeling; X-ray diffraction method; Forecasting; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Intermetallics; X ray diffraction; Materials properties",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888419329

The electromagnetic fields used for beam observations are discussed. Nearly all instruments are based on the so-called 'near field' which is attached to the particles and is basically just the Lorentz-transformed Coulomb field. The 'far field', or radiation field, is used for diagnostics mostly as synchrotron radiation. Since this application was covered in the CAS in 2003, only a short summary is given here. For transverse beam dynamics a particle is followed around the ring, this is described by a transport matrix; its position and angle are measured at each revolution. This approach is close to that of some beam experiments. It serves as a base to develop most relations which are important for understanding the transverse beam behaviour and for designing and interpreting measurements. The beam experiments are covered in order of increasing sophistication, starting with static beam conditions, going to oscillations and phase-space observations. The longitudinal dynamics is based on the relation between deviations in energy and revolution time and the longitudinal focusing provided by the RF system. Dispersion, energy loss, and bunch pattern are the static conditions to be observed. The excitation of synchrotron oscillations opens the way for measurements of chromatic effects and energy calibration. Many measurements done in storage rings are related to intensity limitations.

Based on several wind measurements in Finland, the amount of wind power variation was calculated for a scenario with 2000 MW wind power in Finland. Additionally, an estimate of the reserves needed for wind power and an analysis of the regulating power market (balancing market) in Finland was made. Hydro power and gas turbines can be regulated by at least 40 % of the maximum capacity in one minute. Condensing power plants fuelled by coal (or peat) can be regulated by 5 % (or 3 %) of their capacity in one minute. The power regulation characteristics in Combined Heat and Power plants (CHP) vary from one plant to another. Therefore no general figures can be given. However, CHP can have possibility for high regulation capacity if heat storage are provided. The one minute power regulation for pressurized water nuclear reactors can be from 1 to 3 % of the capacity. Based on these figures and on the installed Finnish electricity production capacity, there is 2100-2200 MW (hydro power and gas turbines) of power reserve capacity in Finland. The maximum power variation in wind power production from hour to hour has been 16 % and the corresponding standard deviation is 2.7 % of the installed capacity, from three years of measured power production data in Finland. Based on these measurements a scenario with 2000 MW wind power in Finland was made. In this scenario the maximum hourly production variation would be 20 % and the standard deviation 3.4 %. This study also examines the changes in Finland's regulating power market in aggregated regulation bids, volume of regulating power and regulating power price. Both regulation bids and volume of regulating power vary in time. In recent years there have been an increased number of peaks in the regulating power price. If the wind power capacity (2000 MW) would be geographically distributed, it would unlikely have an impact on the amount of the disturbance reserves. The influence on the needs of the frequency controlled normal operation reserve can not be specified with the current (hourly) wind power measurements in Finland. Also sufficient slow reserve capacity and working order must be ensured when the wind power production increases. Adding wind power to the power system will clearly be seen in the regulating power market. The current capacity available to the Finnish regulating power market can be insufficient at times when changes in the power production increase. © CIGRE2009.","Power regulation; Power variation; Reserve; Wind power","Combined heat and power plants; Condensing power plant; Electricity production; Power regulation; Power variations; Production and consumption; Reserve; Wind power variations; Cogeneration plants; Commerce; Electric power transmission; Energy policy; Gas turbines; Heat storage; Hydroelectric power; Nuclear reactors; Power plants; Statistics; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877343126

To conduct meaningful analyses so that decisions may be taken in the procedures of planning, design, economics and technology, appropriate models must be derived for both loads and energy sources. The most difficult and the most important aspect in this type of modeling is the inclusion of uncertainty. In a practical hybrid solar/wind power system (HSWPS) uncertainty not only exists in the energy sources and loads but also in the manner in which the system is managed, operated and accepted by the customers. Issues relating to the second group of uncertainties have been addressed in [1]. This paper, however, focuses on the problem of including uncertainty in analyzing the adequacy of an autonomous solar/wind installation to meet the expected load demand of a typical South African, rural community. Several authors have contributed to understanding and modeling the uncertainty associated with wind and solar power sources. Karaki [2] describes the uncertainty in the availability of solar irradiance with the use of the beta probability distribution function (pdf) and that of the wind resource using the Weibull pdf. A discretized approach is then used to evaluate the renewable energy source in time segments. Tina et al [3] uses a closed form solution to improve the approach. In South Africa extensive load measurements and research have produced load models for various classes of customer. The Beta pdf is most appropriate for electrification design for small groups of customers. In this paper we explore an approach to answering the question: 'How many customers of a given statistical type can be adequately supplied from an autonomous HSWPS in South Africa?' For this purpose a general model of a power system with renewable energy is proposed. Simulations are performed to match the variable outputs of the combined wind and solar renewable energy sources with the uncertainty in the expected loads, as derived from South African load research data, and with various sizes of storage battery. The results are affected by the choice of the load model and the confidence level of the simulation. © CIGRE2009.","Load modeling; Probabilistic methods; Renewable sources; Rural electrification; System sizing","Load modeling; Probabilistic methods; Renewable sources; Rural electrification; System sizings; Computer simulation; Distribution functions; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Natural resources; Probability distributions; Rural areas; Sales; Solar energy; Wind power; Uncertainty analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877326216

The load flow in meshed transmission grids is caused by the distribution of load and generation and depends on the grid structure. Extensive wind generation in combination with operation of pump storage power plants and extensive electrical energy trading introduce additional challenges to network planning. Thus conventional load cases - e.g. peak load - are not always adequate to cover all critical power line loading situations in grids. With the herein presented method it is possible to determine a set of load flow cases (SLFC) considering the occurrence probability of critical situations. The number of required load flow cases within the SLFC depends on • the grid size, • the grid topology • the observation period, • the defined accuracy defining the critical loading and • the duration of critical loading situations. We investigated the impact of these criteria on the number of load flow cases and on the SLFC's information content and we defined the boundary conditions for the proposed planning tool. The basic input data for this method are the measured active and reactive line loading data from SCADA in meshed transmission networks and the maximum transfer capacities of the elements (e.g. overhead lines, cables and transformers). Besides the theoretical background the paper provides results from the application of this method in real world transmission networks. Those resulting sets of load flow cases are furthermore analysed with respect to the significance and the relevance to actual line loadings. The proposed approach to determining a set of load flow cases can be used for power system planning with regard to 1) increasing demand, 2) new power plants, 3) new substations which affects the grid structure and 4) repowering of existing lines. This derived set of load flow cases gives a comprehensive and representative overview of the expected situation and provides the basis for power system planning tools using multiple scenarios to handle uncertainties.","Critical loading situation; Power system planning; Set of load flow cases; Transmission grid","Critical loading; Information contents; Load flow; Occurrence probability; Power system planning; Pump storage power plants; Transmission grids; Transmission system planning; Digital storage; Electric lines; Electric power transmission; Power plants; Loading",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877288819

This will require adapted use of electricity, to the availability and price of electricity in the grid. In the Nordic countries a common electricity stock exchange NORDPOOL exist that creates hourly electricity prices 24 hours ahead for all days of the year. By using this information and also weather forecasts, heat load and solar heat production predictions the price variations and a solar heating system based on a smart controller and a smart storage tank can be used to minimize the energy cost and utilize renewable energy sources in a better way in the future. The electricity can be used both in the form of direct electric heating of the tank or via a heat pump. A TRNSYS model has been further developed to simulate a single family house with a solar combi-system that uses an electric backup system controlled according to the weather and electricity prices. So far the control strategy and tank design is just at a first level. One first result is that even a normal solar heating system without smart control seems to benefit significantly from variable electricity prices compared to a fixed average price. This is mainly caused by the normal load pattern for heating that is largest during off peak hours.

For regions with a high frequency of direct sun, small concentrating solar systems can offer a good solution without deforestation and pollution. We assume an efficient, concentrating collector supplying heated air at some 350 °C to a rock storage. Systems with recirculation during charging may have very high thermal efficiency with one-stage storage. Once through air current systems require a second heat exchanger system serving e.g. to produce steam, hot water and pasteurized water, thus broadening the utilised temperature range as well as increasing the overall efficiency. However, these applications are outside the scope of this study and therefore warrant no further discussion here. The high temperature section powers a hotplate incorporated at the top of the storage. To extract heat, air circulation is conventionally used, but requires electric power. The hotplate is in this case studded with copper pins (on the underside) extending into a channel through which the hot air-current from the storage passes. To avoid the electric power requirement, an alternative is to use vertical aluminium plates, also attached (ensuring good metallic contact) on the underside of the hotplate, but then extend to reach the bottom of the storage. Optimization of both systems is discussed in some detail. A prototype of the conductor system, which has the prime advantage of not needing fan power for use in periods with no direct sun, is being tested.

Varying significantly in type and geometry, the functions used to account for heat transfer are possibly outdated and in light of the still relatively high investment costs of solar thermal systems, not cost optimizing. An overview of the current thermal storage market implementing typical immersed heat exchanger types and variations has been collated such that geometrical dependencies and specific advantages or disadvantages can be elucidated. By analysing the correlation between parameters, the relationship between trends in design and current rules of thumb is discussed. From the market research a reference solar DHW was defined and simulated in the TRNSYS simulation environment. A method for interpreting the results in dependency of the energy transferred through an immersed coil heat exchanger at any given annual condition is presented and a selection of representative immersed coil heat exchangers is discussed for future experimentation based on the knowledge gained from the simulation results. Based on commensuration of the experiments with computational modeling (computational fluid dynamics as well as TRNSYS models), future work will entail the development of an immersed coil heat exchangers optimization methodology.

This geometry is suitable for reflectors with wide rim angle (>55°) giving high concentration ratios. A glass cover allows recirculation of air to and from the storage. For safety reasons, the reflector is covered by trapezoidal tiles to give a concentration factor of about 100. The absorbing fibrous material is in the model discretised into small volumes. By a Monte Carlo method, temporal and spatial responses for a given incident direct radiation level are calculated. An adaptive and rigorous computer code was developed to simulate all the pertinent heat transfer mechanisms from radiation to air.

Over time, the use of these systems was extended to provide water to commercial and residential properties, but their primary function continues to be distribution of water to fight fires. Providing high-quality drinking water to city residents was an added benefit provided by these systems. To accommodate the needs of fire protection, pipes and storage tanks tended to be larger. This results in extended residence times that can cause a degradation in drinking water quality. The good news is that these aging conventional systems offer modern cities a unique opportunity to create the foundation for a dual water system that can: - shorten detention times, - produce higher-quality water, - reduce trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), - minimize ""red water"" calls and odor problems, - save energy, - save money and - conserve potable water. This foundation can be developed during a routine pipe rehabilitation process. Instead of installing the temporary piping required to bypass distribution lines while they are being cleaned, relined or replaced, utilities can install permanent, stainless steel, small-diameter pipe that provide for the potable water needs of their customers. Once the existing pipes are rehabbed, the new lines can function as the drinking water distribution system and the existing large-diameter fire lines can be converted to provide high-quality reclaimed water to meet all non-potable water needs. Even if not converted immediately to reclaimed, the addition of a smaller diameter system will yield immediate improvements in water quality by reducing detention time in the potable system while continuing to provide fire protection through the larger diameter pipes. This approach may be of particular interest to utilities whose systems rely on raw water supplies that may contain endocrine disrupters (EDs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Small volumes of potable water can be more economically treated with reverse osmosis (RO) or other methods to reduce these and other potential compounds of concern. Even without RO treatment, smaller diameter drinking water distribution systems can create shorter detention times and help reduce THMs and HAAs. In addition, smaller-sized elevated storage tanks, or more reliable redundant pumping for the new, smaller system, may reduce installation costs. And by using stainless steel, the ""C"" factor can be improved and the pumping costs lowered while producing higher water quality and reducing ""red water"" calls and odor problems. Additional savings may be gained by eliminating the ammonia feed to meet regulations on both the new potable system or the existing system rehabbed for reclaimed water use. Locational running averages (LRA) for THMs and HAAs should be lower, thereby making regulatory compliance much easier. Even if the reclaimed conversion never occurs, the benefits of drinking water quality gained from a dual system when installed as a part of a rehabilitation program may make it a feasible approach to providing high-quality drinking water distribution. © 2009 American Water Works Association.",,"City residents; Conventional systems; Detention time; Distribution lines; Distribution of water; Drinking water distribution; Dual system; Existing systems; Fire line; Haloacetic acids; High quality; Installation costs; Odor problems; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; Pipe rehabilitation; Potable systems; Primary functions; Pumping cost; Raw water supply; Re-claimed water; Rehabilitation programs; Residence time; Save energy; Small diameter pipe; Storage tank; Trihalomethanes; Water needs; Water system; Cost reduction; Exhibitions; Fire extinguishers; Fire protection; Reclamation; Regulatory compliance; Tanks (containers); Water distribution systems; Water quality; Water supply; Waterworks; Potable water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871376246

On the other hand, these islands are favored with considerable wind potential that encourages the realization of wind energy projects. However, due to the stochastic behavior of wind, the respective electricity generation cannot always provide firm capacity to an autonomous electrical power system. To encounter the existing situation, system operators are obliged to limit wind power penetration, this resulting in significant wind energy curtailments. In an attempt to face these problems, the idea of an integrated water pumping energy storage strategy is examined. To investigate the optimum size of a Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) system, an integrated computational algorithm is developed, based on a well-established sizing procedure methodology that also considers boundary conditions. The numerical code is prepared in ""Visual-Basic"" environment and a user-friendly computational tool is created, presenting among others the hourly operational status as well as the annual energy yield of the plant. Finally, an application of the proposed numerical code is presented, based on real data like the long-term renewable energy curtailments of existing wind parks (operating in a representative North Aegean island) and the operational characteristics of the PHS system components. By applying the proposed numerical code, the operational parameters of a PHS system may be investigated in detail, while based on the application results obtained, the ability of the wind energy to remarkably contribute in the remote islands' energy balance is illustrated.","Hybrid Systems; Island Electrical Grids; Pumped Hydro Storage; Wind Energy Curtailments","Computational algorithm; Computational tools; Electrical grids; Electrical power system; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Energy yields; Hydro storage systems; North aegean; Numerical code; Operational characteristics; Operational parameters; Remote islands; Renewable energies; Stochastic behavior; System components; System operator; Water pumping; Wind energy projects; Wind park; Wind potential; Wind power penetration; Computational methods; Electric generators; Energy policy; Exhibitions; Hybrid systems; Integration; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870044766

The proposed power systems are introduced in the examined islands with the following goals: • the maximisation of the available renewable energy sources exploitation • the minimisation of the electricity production cost • the improvement of the security of the electrical systems. The achievement of the abovementioned targets is investigated through the case studies implementation in characteristic isolated insular power systems of small (Kasos - Karpathos, Astypalaia), medium (Rhodes, Lesvos) and large size (Crete). In the examined cases, the fundamental power source is the wind power. The pumped storage systems aim at the wind power stochastic production adaptation to the power demand. The possible available potential of any other renewable energy sources (biomass, geothermy) in the examined insular system, may contribute to further limitation of the conventional thermal generators power production. The proposed systems are dimensioned and the corresponding investments are evaluated. Finally, the dynamic security of the existing and the proposed electrical systems is evaluated with the simulation of the corresponding systems operation. The conclusions of the present paper are: • The R.E.S. penetration percentage in the Greek insular systems may exceed 80% of the annual energy demand. • The electricity production cost is minimized, even in the isolated systems of small size. • The corresponding investments exhibit very good economical indexes, regardless the possible availability of initial capitals subsidy. In case of initial capitals subsidy availability, the investments exhibit quite attractive economical indexes. • The dynamic security of the proposed systems is improved considerably, due to the existence of hydro turbines in the power production systems. The necessity for spinning reserve from the thermal generators is restricted.",,"Dynamic security; Electrical systems; Electricity production; Energy demands; Hydroturbines; Isolated power system; Isolated systems; Power demands; Power production; Power sources; Pumped Storage; Renewable energy source; Spinning reserves; Stochastic production; Systems operation; Thermal generators; Energy management; Exhibitions; Investments; Natural resources; Wind power; Economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870030736

Renewable energy is regarded as a solution to this problem, mainly in its transformation to electricity. This, however, excludes the impact of the transportation sector that represents a significant component of the imported fuels consumption. Other main limitations associated to renewable electricity consists on the need to increase the storage capacity that might attenuate the effect of intermittence of renewable energy sources and the disparity between supply and demand. In both problems - that are associated with renewable energy management - Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV) could be a part of the solution in that the use of vehicle to grid (V2G) technology can provide storage of electric energy during low demand times and use it to match the demand in peak hours and/or to avoid fossil fuel consumption. Therefore, some of the main questions are: could the large scale PEV penetration lead to increases in the fraction of electricity produced from renewable? Is the usage of PEV batteries as a storage system truly the best solution? This work analyses a case study in the Island of São Miguel in Azores, where energy systems modelling is used to assess to different roll out scenarios for large scale PEV penetration and discuss the possibility to increase the potential for the use of renewable electricity.","Bev (battery electric vehicle); Energy source; Energy storage; V2G (vehicle to grid)","Battery electric vehicles; Electric energies; Energy source; Energy systems; Isolated areas; Isolated systems; Low demand; Plug-ins; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Security of supply; Storage capacity; Storage systems; Supply and demand; Transportation sector; Vehicle to grids; Work analysis; Economics; Electricity; Energy management; Energy storage; Exhibitions; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Renewable energy resources; Electric vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868595361

The environmental impact of hydrogen - used in a fuel cell (FCEV) or internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) - depends strongly on the production pathway for hydrogen and should therefore be evaluated on a well-to-wheel basis. In this paper, the Ecoscore methodology is used to assess the environmental impact of H 2-ICE and fuel cell vehicles on a well-to-wheel basis. The Ecoscore is an environmental indicator for vehicles taking into account the impact on global warming, air quality depletion (divided into impact on human health and ecosystems) and noise. The Ecoscores of two FCEV and one H 2-ICEV are calculated for different hydrogen production pathways (electrolysis and Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)), as well as for different methods of hydrogen storage (compression and liquefaction) and distribution (pipeline and truck). The highest Ecoscores - and thus best results - are obtained for vehicles using hydrogen from electrolysis produced with 100 % renewable energy, followed by SMR and then electrolysis using the Belgian electricity mix. Compression appears to be better than liquefaction to store hydrogen due to the high energy use for the liquefaction process, and this compressed hydrogen should be transported through pipelines in stead of by trucks to obtain the best environmental performance.","Energy; Environment; Fuel cell; Hydrogen; ICE (internal combustion engine)","Drive train; Ecoscore; Energy; Environment; Environmental analysis; Environmental indicators; Environmental issues; Environmental performance; Fuel cell vehicles; High energy; Human health; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Liquefaction process; Production pathways; Rain impact; Renewable energies; Research efforts; Well-to-wheel; Acid rain; Air quality; Alternative fuels; Ecosystems; Electric vehicles; Electrolysis; Environmental management; Exhibitions; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Internal combustion engines; Liquefaction; Ozone; Trucks; Vehicle wheels; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868593533

GET 7.0, a global energy system model with five end-use sectors, is used for the analysis. We find that an energy system dominated by either solar thermal energy or nuclear power tends to make biofuels in plug-in hybrids cost-effective. If coal with carbon capture and storage dominates the energy system, hydrogen cars, rather than plug-in hybrids tends to become cost-effective. From a Monte Carlo analysis we conclude that the stationary energy system does not alone determine how the transportation sector develops, but that its impact on the absolute and the relative cost of energy carriers has a significant impact on the cost-effectiveness of different propulsion technologies. Thus, analyses of future energy carriers and propulsion technologies need to consider developments in the stationary energy sector.","Climate change mitigation; Energy system model; Hydrogen; Plug-in hybrids","A-carbon; Carbon capture and storage; Climate change mitigation; End-use sectors; Energy carriers; Energy sector; Energy system model; Energy systems; Future energies; Global energy system models; Hydrogen car; Monte carlo analysis; Plug-in hybrids; Propulsion technology; Significant impacts; Solar thermal energy; System interactions; Transportation sector; Carbon; Carbon capture; Cost effectiveness; Electric vehicles; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Motor transportation; Propulsion; Solar energy; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868587428

Research on the development and enhancement of these models is performed on two tracks: on one hand by defining the model topology, where a trade-off is sought between the reduction of components in the model equivalent scheme and the ability of the model to describe all potential system behaviour and, on the other hand by improving the method of calculating the magnitudes of the different components in the model. The storage devices examined in this paper are divided in two groups, electrochemical devices and electrical double layer capacitors. The first group consists of lead-acid, lithium, Ni-Cd and Ni-MH batteries. The second group comprises of Electric Double-Layer Capacitors (EDLC). For every model used to describe a battery or EDLC, different techniques are implemented to calculate the magnitude of the components. The work presented in this paper will elaborate to the calculating method used in NREL's FreedomCAR test-manual adapted to fit different battery- and EDLC models. This method consists of an iterative approach to the equations of the model using data gathered from performing tests on the battery or supercapacitor. Validation of the models obtained through this calculating method will be done by performance tests on the storage devices. As the models of batteries and supercapacitors are a key aspect in the simulation software for hybrid-vehicles more accurate models result in more accurate simulations. These simulation programs depend upon the underlying component models, the data generated by which determines the accuracy of the program's data-output. The availability of reliable storage RESS models will thus be a key element in to allow overall vehicle modelling.","Battery model; EDLC; Simulation","Battery models; Calculating methods; EDLC; Electric double layer capacitor; Electrical double layer capacitor; Electrical parameter; Electrochemical devices; Energy storage systems; Equivalent scheme; Iterative approach; Key elements; Ni-MH batteries; Performance tests; Potential systems; Second group; Simulation; Simulation program; Simulation software; Super capacitor; Underlying components; Vehicle modelling; Capacitors; Computer software; Electric properties; Electric vehicles; Electromagnetic wave emission; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Iterative methods; Lithium; Topology; Virtual storage; Computer simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868582814

One way to reach this target is to develop green energy solutions based on on-board energy storage, but also on on-board energy production. In this paper, economic aspects of power generation using a photovoltaic system integrated on a camping car is described and discussed. For other hand, micro-generation systems using renewable energies can contribute significantly not only to reduce the pollutant emissions but also to improve the energy balances of the modern societies.

To identify the present and future potentials of each technology a detailed assessment of all propulsion systems was performed. Within this assessment the energy efficiency of each system was determined including detailed data on fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of the vehicles (TTW-data). Furthermore the entire chains of energy conversion were investigated to receive overall energy- and greenhouse gas balances. For the analysis of their economic competitiveness an economic assessment of the aforementioned powertrain systems was performed considering investment costs for vehicles, fuel costs and taxes. The whole assessment was performed for the present state and dynamically for the next decades (2010-2050).

In comparison to conventional vehicle systems, safety standards which are not internationally harmonised yet have to be considered and strict EMC regulations need to be met. The required vehicle performance and the resulting powertrain configuration determines the traction voltage levels, the definition of the corresponding power range of traction components (electric machines, power electronics, energy storage) and finally the topology of the power net architecture. This paper focuses on vehicle integration aspects of HV power nets with modular approaches for different architectures considering partitioning, clustering and selection of HV components.

The battery ageing mechanisms and the resulting cycle life of HEV-optimised batteries are highly non-linear and difficult to test. In addition, the selection of load cycle profile is of great significance when battery cycle life is to be verified experimentally. This paper presents a statistic method for evaluation and simplification of dynamic load profiles based on measured load profiles from heavy-duty HEV applications. The presented method has been used to extract simplified synthetic load cycles with configurable energy throughput as well as different strategies for state-of-charge control. These cycles were also compared with reference cycles and evaluated regarding power distribution, energy distribution, energy window and energy throughput. The presented method was found to be a usable tool for creating new battery load cycles for cyclelife tests. In addition, it may be a useful to evaluate and compare statistical properties of measured cycles before initiating laboratory battery tests.","Battery model; Battery SoH (state of health); Cycle life; Energy storage; Lithium battery","Battery ageing; Battery cycle life; Battery loads; Battery models; Battery tests; Cycle life test; Cycle lives; Energy distributions; Energy windows; HEV applications; Li-ion batteries; Load cycle; Load profiles; Power distributions; State of charge; State of health; Statistic method; Statistical properties; Dynamic loads; Electric batteries; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Lithium batteries; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868575007

The coordination of the charging gives an improvement of the grid exploitation in terms of reduced power losses and voltage deviations with respect to uncoordinated charging. The vehicles must be dispatchable to achieve the most efficient solution. As the exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, stochastic programming is introduced. Two main techniques are analyzed: quadratic and dynamic programming. Both techniques are compared in results and storage requirements. The charging can be coordinated directly or indirectly by the grid utility or an aggregator who will sell the aggregated demand of PHEVs at the utility. PHEVs can also discharge and so inject energy in the grid to restrict voltage drops. The amount of energy that is injected in the grid depends on the price tariffs, the charging and discharging efficiencies and the battery energy content. A day and night tariff are applied. The charging and discharging of vehicles can respond on real-time pricing or on a price-schedule as well. Voltage control is the first step in the utilization of distributed resources like PHEVs for ancillary services.","Charging; Energy; Optimization; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","Ancillary service; Battery energy; Distributed resources; Distribution grid; Energy; Household loads; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Power-losses; Real time pricing; Storage requirements; Voltage deviations; Voltage drop; Charging (furnace); Costs; Dynamic programming; Economics; Electric vehicles; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Investments; Optimization; Stochastic programming; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868571525

Different energy storage systems (ESS) configurations were designed for the metro trains to be placed at the substation level. The investigation consists in defining the required specifications of the supercapacitor modules in terms of energy capacity and power. In view of the identified systems, potential energy savings will be estimated and, based on a well-to-wheel approach, the reduction in emissions will be measured and monetarily valuated. To conclude, a cost-benefit analysis will be carried out to determine whether the benefits exceed the estimated costs on a life cycle basis. This approach is innovative in the sense that few studies analyse in-depth the economic and environmental benefits of energy storage applications for mass transport networks.","Energy savings; Energy storage; LCA; Public transport; Supercapacitor","Belgium; Brussels; Cycle basis; Economic and environmental benefits; Energy capacity; Energy storage applications; Energy storage systems; Estimated costs; LCA; Metro networks; Metro train; Public transport; Public transport operators; Storage solutions; Super capacitor; Transport networks; Well-to-wheel; Capacitors; Electric vehicles; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Metropolitan area networks; Subways; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868541913

Large power demands in particular have a detrimental effect to a battery pack's lifespan. This paper investigates the effect of the use of a EDLC (Electrical Double Layer Capacitors) as a power buffer to smooth rapid power fluctuations in and out of the batteries of a hybrid electric heavy truck. The study considers a simple configuration where the supercapacitors are directly connected in parallel with the batteries. A simple parallel connection is the easiest to arrange for trial purposes but depending on the specific application, it might not always be the most efficient. Such design of hybrid energy storage system is expected to result in substantial benefits to the well being of the battery system. The work has been carried out on computer simulations. Finally the simulations results are validated on a test bench.","Battery model; EDLC; Simulations","Battery models; Battery pack; Battery systems; EDLC; Effectiveness evaluation; Electrical double layer capacitor; Heavy lifts; Heavy truck; Hybrid configurations; Hybrid energy storage; Large power; Life span; Parallel combination; Parallel connections; Power buffers; Power fluctuations; Simulations; Super capacitor; Test benches; Well being; Capacitors; Electric connectors; Electric properties; Electric vehicles; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Computer simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868533541

The impacts provoked by EVs deployment on the network voltage profiles, branches' congestion levels, grid losses and imbalances between phases were evaluated using a three phase power flow. The first part of this work focused on the determination of the maximum share of electric vehicles, defined as the percentage of conventional vehicles replaced by EVs, which can be integrated into the selected grid, without violating the system's technical restrictions and complying with drivers' requests concerning the foreseen use of vehicles. The maximization of the EVs connected to the grid was performed using two distinct charging strategies: dumb charging and smart charging. The second task was to analyse the impacts of both charging approaches (dumb charging and smart charging) on the prevention of wasting renewable energy surplus. For the purpose of this analysis, a 2011 wet and windy day was considered, where large hydro and wind generation exists. For that specific case, in some periods of the day (mainly valley hours), the hydro and wind generation, added to the must run thermal generation units, will surpass the consumption and renewable energy can be wasted. The results obtained for the LV grid were extended to a National level and the changes in the Portuguese load/generation profiles were computed.","Charging; Electric vehicle; Emissions; Energy storage; Load management","Charging strategies; Congestion level; Grid loss; Grid performance; Low-voltage; National level; Renewable energies; Smart charging; Thermal generation unit; Three-phase power flow; Voltage profile; Wind generation; Charging (furnace); Electric load management; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Particulate emissions; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868530290

The aim was to quantify the potential impact of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology and low CO 2 intensity electricity from renewable sources, such as concentrating solar power (CSP), on cost-effective passenger vehicle fuel and technology options necessary to achieve stabilization of atmospheric CO 2 at 450 ppm. In addition, the model was used to assess the sensitivity of future vehicle cost assumptions. For all cases investigated, there is no single technology and fuel that dominates throughout the century; instead a variety of fuels and vehicle technologies are important. The availability of CCS and CSP have a substantial impact on cost-effective fuel and technology choices, in general: (i) the introduction of CCS increases the use of coal in the energy system and conventional vehicle technology, (ii) the introduction of CSP reduces the relative cost of electricity in relation to hydrogen and tends to increase the use of electricity for transport, and (iii) the introduction of both CCS and CSP reduces the economic incentives to shift to more advanced vehicle technologies. Varying cost estimates for future vehicle technologies results in large differences in the cost-effective fuel and vehicle technology solutions. For instance, for low battery costs ($150/kWh), electrified powertrains dominate and for higher battery costs ($450/kWh), hydrogen-fueled vehicles dominate, regardless of CCS and CSP availability. The results highlight the importance of a multi-sector approach and the importance of pursuing research and development of multiple fuel and vehicle technologies.","Alternative fuel; Cost; Emissions; Modeling; Passenger car","Advanced vehicle; Atmospheric CO; Battery cost; Carbon capture and storage; Concentrating solar power; Cost estimate; Cost of electricity; Economic incentive; Energy systems; Global energy; Hydrogen-fueled vehicles; Multiple fuels; Passenger transport; Passenger vehicles; Potential impacts; Renewable sources; Research and development; Technology choices; Technology options; Vehicle technology; Alternative fuels; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric vehicles; Electricity; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Models; Particulate emissions; Passenger cars; Solar energy; Technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868517341

It establishes an overall binding target of a 20% share of renewable energy sources in the final energy consumption in the EU by 2020. In addition, a 10% binding minimum target for renewable energy sources in transport is set for each Member State. The RED also introduces environmental sustainability criteria for biofuels and other bioliquids. It states that the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission saving from the use of biofuels and other bioliquids taken into account for the national targets shall be at least 35% for current biofuels, at least 50% after 1 January 2017, and at least60 % after 1 January 2018 for biofuels produced in installations in which production started on or after 1 January 2017. The RED introduces a methodology to calculate the GHG emission savings of biofuels and other bioliquids compared to fossil fuels. In this report the methodology was tested with a case study based on commercial and industrial waste-derived bioethanol production integrated with a CHP plant in Finland. The aim of the report was to study whether the waste ethanol concept gains the 60% GHG emission savings according to the RED methodology or not. Four different interpretations of the RED methodology were considered possible for the studied concept. All these options were calculated with three different process values depending on the need of sterilisation of the waste material and the amount of urea used in the process. Within these four options differences in the system boundary setting and thus allocation of emissions took place resulting in differences in emission saving results. The key question was, whether the CHP plant and the biofuel process were supposed to be treated as one combined process or as two separated ones. The GHG emission savings over 60% were gained when the biofuel process and the CHP plant were assumed to be separate processes and the amount of heat and urea needed in the process were minor. The GHG emission saving of the waste ethanol was highly dependent on the emission factor given for the waste material combusted at the CHP plant. The emission factor was the higher the higher were the plastic and moisture contents of the waste. To gain results with over 60% emission savings, attention should be paid to minimization of the plastic content of waste material combusted. Over 60% emission savings could also be gained if carbon capture and replacement or storage were applied for the biogenic carbon dioxide released from the ethanol processing (fermentation).

More than 30 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions arise from the land use sector. Thus, no strategy for mitigating global climate change can be complete or successful without reducing emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land uses. Moreover, only land-based or ""terrestrial"" carbon sequestration offers the possibility today of large-scale removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, through plant photosynthesis. Five major strategies for reducing and sequestering terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions are: • Enriching soil carbon. Soil is the third largest carbon pool on Earth's surface. Agricultural soils can be managed to reduce emissions by minimizing tillage, reducing use of nitrogen fertilizers, and preventing erosion. Soils can store the carbon captured by plants from the atmosphere by building up soil organic matter, which also has benefits for crop production. Adding biochar (biomass burned in a low-oxygen environment) can further enhance carbon storage in soil. • Farming with perennials. Perennial crops, grasses, palms, and trees constantly maintain and develop their root and woody biomass and associated carbon, while providing vegetative cover for soils. There is large potential to substitute annual tilled crops with perennials, particularly for animal feed and vegetable oils, as well as to incorporate woody perennials into annual cropping systems in agroforestry systems. • Climate-friendly livestock production. Rapid growth in demand for livestock products has triggered a huge rise in the number of animals, the concentration of wastes in feedlots and dairies, and the clearing of natural grasslands and forests for grazing. Livestock- related emissions of carbon and methane now account for 14.5 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions-more than the transport sector. A reduction in livestock numbers may be needed but production innovations can help, including rotational grazing systems, manure management, methane capture for biogas production, and improved feeds and feed additives. • Protecting natural habitat. The planet's 4 billion hectares of forests and 5 billion hectares of natural grasslands are a massive reservoir of carbon-both in vegetation above ground and in root systems below ground. As forests and grasslands grow, they remove carbon from the atmosphere. Deforestation, land clearing, and forest and grassland fires are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Incentives are needed to encourage farmers and land users to maintain natural vegetation through product certification, payments for climate services, securing tenure rights, and community fire control. The conservation of natural habitat will benefit biodiversity in the face of climate change. • Restoring degraded watersheds and rangelands. Extensive areas of the world have been denuded of vegetation through land clearing for crops or grazing and from overuse and poor management. Degradation has not only generated a huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions, but local people have lost a valuable livelihood asset as well as essential watershed functions. Restoring vegetative cover on degraded lands can be a win-win-win strategy for addressing climate change, rural poverty, and water scarcity. Agricultural communities can play a central role in fighting climate change. Even at a relatively low price for mitigating carbon emissions, improved land management could offset a quarter of global emissions from fossil fuel use in a year. In contrast, solutions for reducing emissions by carbon capture in the energy sector are unlikely to be widely utilized for decades and do not remove the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere. To tackle the climate challenge, we need to pursue land use solutions in addition to efforts to improve energy efficiency and speed the transition to renewable energy. Yet so far, the international science and policy communities have been slow to embrace terrestrial climate action. Some fear that investments in land use will not produce ""real"" climate benefits, or that land use action would distract attention from investment in energy alternatives. There is also a concern that land management changes cannot be implemented quickly enough and at a scale that would make a difference to the climate. But most of these concerns are misplaced or can be addressed effectively now. While many land-use activities are not strictly ""permanent,"" there are numerous ways to ensure that commitments to reduce or offset emissions are strictly met, such as by using large-area programs and investing in reserve areas for insurance. Carbon sequestration through interventions such as agroforestry do not present any ""leakage"" problems, and the risks of leakage from avoided deforestation can be addressed through large-scale monitoring and project screening. Investments to overcome major barriers to farmer adoption of climate-friendly land use systems (such as lack of technical assistance, credit, or planting materials) are clearly ""additional,"" even when the interventions are themselves profitable to land users, and land uses with long-term profitability are far more permanent. Great strides have been made in devising methods for monitoring land-use carbon at field scales for many diverse practices and components of the landscape (soils, grasses, trees, animal wastes, etc.), and methods for integrated landscape-wide carbon assessment will soon be available. While there are institutional challenges to rapidly scaling up climate-friendly practices in diverse rural areas of the world, expertise can be tapped to overcome them-in rural development agencies, farmers' organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and private agricultural businesses. Institutional platforms exist in many countries to promote sustainable land management on a large scale. Community land use planning and action models are widely implemented and can be strngthened and adapted to address climate change mitigation as well as adaptation. The food industry is beginning to mobilize investments for climate action in its agricultural supply chains, in response to anticipated consumer demand and regulation. National policies can re-shape public investments and subsidies to support climate-friendly agriculture and land use. Indeed, the benefits for food security, rural livelihoods, and watershed and biodiversity protection that accompany wise, locally appropriate investments in land use will expand political support and new coalitions for climate action generally. They will be an attraction, not a distraction. To tap the full potential of land use mitigation, six principles for action are recommended: 1. Include the full range of terrestrial emission reduction, storage, and sequestration options in climate policy and investment; 2. Incorporate farming and land use investments in cap-and-trade systems; 3. Link terrestrial climate mitigation with adaptation, rural development, and conservation strategies; 4. Encourage large, area-based programs; 5. Encourage voluntary markets for greenhouse gas emission offsets from agriculture and land use; 6.Mobilize a worldwide, networked movement for climate-friendly food, forest, and other land-based production. © Worldwatch Institute, 2010.",,"action plan; climate change; emission control; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; food; greenhouse gas; land management; land use planning; mitigation; national planning; profitability; soil emission; sustainable development; Animalia; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051766148

B 5363, Ado Ekiti, Nigeria","Thermal treatment in soy oil medium is one of the techniques used as a substitute for chemical treatment in wood preservation. However, the effects of this technique vary from one species to another and hence the need to investigate the response of individual species to it. Thermal treatment of air-dried Nigerian-grown Albizzia zygia and Funtumia elastica wood was carried out in a vessel containing soy oil at a temperature of 220°C for 2hours. This was followed by the determination of hygroscopy and swelling by water soaking method; surface energy by the sessile drop contact angle method; pH and buffer capacity by the cold extraction method. The process of soy oil thermal treatment resulted in significant reductions in hygroscopy, swelling properties and pH in both species with accompanying increase in buffer acid and alkaline buffer capacity. The surface energy which is an indication of wettability was reduced in Albizzia zygia but increased in Funtumia elastica. The reductions in hygroscopy and pH are indications of cellulose degradation during the heat treatment process leading to build up of acid formation. The reduction in hygroscopic behaviour indicates potential for stability in woodwater relationship especially when the material will be used in a continuously- changing ambient environment. The reduction in surface energy in Albizzia zygia implies that soy-oil-thermally modified wood from this species will have reduced interfacial attractions with most chemical adhesives. On the other hand, the increase in surface energy in Funtumia elastica shows possibility of improvement in the level of interfacial attractions between wood (substrates) and adhesives. The reduction in pH in both species is expected to have a two-way effect; a benefit through reduction in adhesive curing time and an adverse effect through expected reduction in strength properties. © The Wood Technology Society of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining 2009.","Buffer capacity; Hygroscopy; Ph; Soy-oil; Surface energy; Swelling; Thermal-treatment; Wood","Buffer capacity; Hygroscopy; Soy-oil; Surface energy; Thermal-treatment; Adhesives; Alkalinity; Buffer storage; Contact angle; Driers (materials); Drying oils; Heat treatment; Interfacial energy; pH effects; Surface chemistry; Surface properties; Swelling; Wood preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953906900

The coordination of the charging gives an improvement of the grid exploitation in terms of reduced power losses and voltage deviations with respect to uncoordinated charging. The vehicles must be dispatchable to achieve the most efficient solution. As the exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, stochastic programming is introduced. Two main techniques are analyzed in this paper: quadratic and dynamic programming. Both techniques are compared in results and storage requirements. The charging can be coordinated directly or indirectly by the grid utility or an aggregator who will sell the aggregated demand of PHEVs at the utility. PHEVs can also discharge and so inject energy in the grid to restrict voltage drops. The amount of energy that is injected in the grid depends on the price tariffs, the charging and discharging efficiencies and the battery energy content. The impact of a voltage controller embedded in a PHEV charger is regarded in this paper. A day and night tariff are applied. The charging and discharging of vehicles can respond to real-time pricing or on a price-schedule as well.

Renewable energy is regarded as a solution to this problem, mainly in its transformation to electricity. This, however, excludes the impact of the transportation sector that represents a significant component of the imported fuels consumption. Other main limitation associated to renewable electricity consists on the need to increase the storage capacity that might attenuate the effect of intermittence of renewable energy sources and the disparity between supply and demand. In both problems - that are associated with renewable energy management - Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV) could be a part of the solution in th hicle to grid (V2G) technology can provide storage of electric energy during low demand times and use it to match the demand in peak hours and/or to avoid fossil fuel consumption. Therefore, some of the main questions are: could the large scale PEV penetration lead to increases in the fraction of electricity produced from renewable? Is the usage of PEV batteries as a storage system truly the best solution? São Miguel Island is the main electricity consumer in the whole Azores's archipelago. There is no power connection to any major grid or even with other Islands.

The environmental impact of hydrogen - used in a fuel cell (FCEV) or internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) - depends strongly on the production pathway for hydrogen and should therefore be evaluated on a well-to-wheel basis. In this paper, the Ecoscore methodology is used to assess the environmental impact of H2-ICE and fuel cell vehicles on a well-to-wheel basis. The Ecoscore is an environmental indicator for vehicles taking into account the impact on global warming, air quality depletion (divided into impact on human health and ecosystems) and noise. The Ecoscores of two FCEV and one H2-ICEV are calculated for different hydrogen production pathways (electrolysis and Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)), as well as for different methods of hydrogen storage (compression and liquefaction) and distribution (pipeline and truck). The highest Ecoscores - and thus best results - are obtained for vehicles using hydrogen from electrolysis produced with 100 % renewable energy, followed by SMR and then electrolysis using the Belgian electricity mix. Compression appears to be better than liquefaction to store hydrogen due to the high energy use for the liquefaction process, and this compressed hydrogen should be transported through pipelines in stead of by trucks to obtain the best environmental performance. © 2009 AVERE.","Energy; Environment; Fuel cell; Hydrogen; ICE (internal combustion engine)","Drive train; Ecoscore; Energy; Environment; Environmental analysis; Environmental indicators; Environmental issues; Environmental performance; Fuel cell vehicles; High energy; Human health; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Liquefaction process; Production pathways; Rain impact; Renewable energies; Research efforts; Steam methane reforming; Well-to-wheel; Acid rain; Air quality; Alternative fuels; Automobiles; Combustion; Combustion equipment; Ecosystems; Electrochemistry; Electrolysis; Engines; Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Ice; Internal combustion engines; Liquefaction; Locomotives; Methane; Ozone; Railroad cars; Renewable energy resources; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Steam reforming; Trucks; Vehicles; Wheels; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953051230

Research on the development and enhancement of these models is performed on two tracks: on one hand by defining the model topology, where a trade-off is sought between the reduction of components in the model equivalent scheme and the ability of the model to describe all potential system behaviour and, on the other hand by improving the method of calculating the magnitudes of the different components in the model. The storage devices examined in this paper are divided in two groups, electrochemical devices and electrical double layer capacitors. The first group consists of lead-acid, lithium, Ni-Cd and Ni-MH batteries. The second group comprises of Electric Double-Layer Capacitors (EDLC). For every model used to describe a battery or EDLC, different techniques are implemented to calculate the magnitude of the components. The work presented in this paper will elaborate to the calculating method used in NREL's FreedomCAR test-manual adapted to fit different battery- and EDLC models. This method consists of an iterative approach to the equations of the model using data gathered from performing tests on the battery or supercapacitor. Validation of the models obtained through this calculating method will be done by performance tests on the storage devices. As the models of batteries and supercapacitors are a key aspect in the simulation software for hybrid-vehicles more accurate models result in more accurate simulations. These simulation programs depend upon the underlying component models, the data generated by which determines the accuracy of the program's data-output.

However, relatively little experimental data is available on the structure of multiply charged ions and their interactions with photons. Combining a merged ion-photon beam (IPB) endstation, an electroncyclotron- resonance (ECR) ion source and a third-generation synchrotron radiation source makes possible quantitative studies of photoionization (PI) of multiply charged ions. This apparatus is permanently installed on undulator beamline 10.0.1.2 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), which provides intense photon beams at high energy resolution range 17 - 340 eV. In the soft X-ray region we can study the atomic structure of the inner shells for most of the elements, which has not explored yet for the best of my knowledge. Photoionization of molecular and cluster ions remain essentially unexplored, and will provide new insights into their structure and dynamics. Interpreting such experiments will be a major challenge. So SESAME as a third generation light source similar to the ALS will be the best for such studies, and with similar IPB endstation at the ALS will attract many researchers from the region and all over the world. PI experiments performed at ALS in collaboration with the Giessen group included multiply charged metallic ions, such as K-like Sc2+, for which complementary measurements of time-reversed process electron-Sc3+ recombination have been performed at a heavy-ion storage ring in Europe. PI measurements for the lower charge states of the Fe isonuclear sequence, which are important for astrophysical applications, and present a formidable theoretical challenge.

Simulations are done using a mathematical model of energy storage. Results show the relation between storage power and energy, and the obtained increase in minimum available power from the combination of wind and storage. The introduction of storage enables smoothening of wind power on a timescale proportional to the storage energy. Storage does not provide availability of wind power at all times, but allows for a certain fraction of average power in a given timeframe to be available with high probability. The amount of storage capacity necessary for significant wind power quality improvement in a given period is found to be 20 to 40% of the energy produced in that period. The necessary power is found to be 80 to 100% of the average power of the period.","Energy storage; Power generation availability; Power quality; Simulation; Wind energy","Average power; High probability; Power quality improvement; Simulation; Storage capacity; Storage energy; Storage power; Time-scales; Wind energy; Computer simulation; Energy storage; Flywheels; Mathematical models; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956449654

A recently developed coordination algorithm for a high number of small thermostat-controlled appliances requires the connection of individual appliances to a central control entity through a two-way communication channel. The control method, which does not cause significant comfort losses for users, enables the group of appliances to act like a virtual distributed energy storage. While the coordination algorithm has been presented in detail before, the contribution of this paper lies in the analysis of the aggregated behavior of coordinated appliance groups. Apart from that, a methodology for estimating the coordinated load control potential in larger areas (e.g. countries) is presented. This is illustrated by exemplary considerations on the Swiss power system, which can also be adapted to other countries. Furthermore, different applications for the gained demand-side flexibility in a liberalized electricity market are discussed.","Home appliances; Load management; Power system control","Central control; Control methods; Coordination algorithms; Demand-side; Distributed energies; Home appliances; Household appliances; Liberalized electricity market; Load control; Load management; Power system controls; Power systems; Two way communications; Electric load management; Domestic appliances",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956438027

Storage and interconnection are frequently proposed to manage this variability and total flexibility of the interconnector is assumed. This paper examines how market and meteorological effects could constrain interconnector operation. Currently an interconnector between the Republic of Ireland and Wales officially referred to as the East West Interconnector is in planning. The split between energy transfer and reserve provision through the interconnector will be dictated by energy prices and relative value of reserve services. The levels of wind power generation in each connected region may limit the mutual support expected from interconnection. In this regard wind forecasting and wind correlations in the connected regions are extremely relevant and are discussed in this paper.","Interconnected power systems; Meteorology and wind power generation","Connected region; Economic success; Electricity grids; Electricity system; Energy prices; Interconnected power systems; Interconnectors; Ireland; Meteorological effects; Northern Ireland; Overall stabilities; Relative value; Wind correlation; Wind energy generation; Wind energy integration; Electric generators; Electric load forecasting; Electric power generation; Electric power system interconnection; Energy transfer; Mesh generation; Meteorology; Weather forecasting; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956431279

Therefore, reservoir engineering has to be involved in determining these pressures to finally verify the gas resources on the basis of dynamic pressure values. The methodics of determining mean pressures on the basis of measured dynamic pressures in a well is described in the paper. This methodics is based on boundary gas flux to the well in a semisteady state. Basing on measurements of dynamic pressures in production wells there were determined mean pressure values in reservoir, followed by evaluation of energy conditions of the analyzed gas field with the ""p/z"" method. Afterwards, initial gas resources in the wells' impact zones could be established. The obtained results were verified making alternative balance calculations on the basis of bottomhole pressures in static conditions. The comparison of the results reveals that the presented method is fully applicable.","Dynamic pressure; Mass balance method; Pseudopressure function; Pseudotime function; Static pressure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954911175

A fundamental goal of researches in WSNs is to reduce the communication operations and prolong the total lifetime of sensor networks. Therefore, researchers are focusing on optimal routing techniques which are one of the main factors to reduce consumable energy of sensor and wireless sensor networks. Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) over WSNs is a new routing paradigm promises several advantages over conventional routing protocols. This paper presents an overview of using DHTs in WSNs, especially routing techniques using DHTs over WSNs such as GHT, CSN, CHR, T-DHT, VRR and ScatterPastry. After that we compare with methods which used DHTs in WSNs with three main parameters such as Scalability, Energy-efficient, and Data storage/lookup efficiency. © ICITA 2009.","DHTs over WSNs; Distributed hash tables; Routing; Wireless sensor networks","Communication operation; Conventional routing; DHTs over WSNs; Distributed Hash Table; Distributed hash tables; Energy efficient; Main parameters; Optimal routing; Research and application; Routing paradigm; Routing techniques; Information technology; Research; Sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953964541

This paper presents further developments regarding molten salt mixtures consisting of common alkali nitrates and either alkaline earth nitrates or alkali nitrite salts that have advantageous properties for applications as heat transfer fluids in parabolic trough systems. We report results for formulations of inorganic molten salt mixtures that display freeze-onset temperatures below 100°C. In addition to phase-change behavior, several properties of these molten salts that significantly affect their suitability as thermal energy storage fluids were evaluated, including chemical stability and viscosity. The nitrate-based molten salts have demonstrated chemical stability in the presence of air up to 500°C. The capability to operate at temperatures up to 500°C may allow an increase in maximum temperature operating capability vs. organic fluids in existing trough systems and will enable increased power cycle efficiency. Experimental measurements of viscosity were performed from near the freeze-onset temperature to about 200°C. Viscosities can exceed 100 cP near the freezing temperature but are 4 to 5 cP in the anticipated operating temperature range. Experimental measurements of density, thermal conductivity and heat capacity are in progress and will be reported at the meeting. Corrosion tests were conducted for several thousand hours at 500°C with stainless steels and at 350°C for carbon and chromium-molybdenum steels. Examination of the specimens demonstrated good compatibility of these materials with the molten nitrate salt mixtures. Laboratory studies were conducted to identify mixtures of nitrate and nitrite (NO2.) salts as additional candidates for a low-melting heat transfer fluid. Mixtures in which the cations were potassium, sodium and lithium, in various proportions, demonstrated freezing points as low as 70°C for a particular nitrate/nitrite anion composition. Development has emphasized mixtures that minimize lithium content in order to reduce the cost as the lithium salt is the most expensive constituent. Work is in progress to explore the phase diagram of the 1:1 mol ratio of nitrate/nitrite and to evaluate physical properties such as viscosity, density and thermal conductivity. Results to date indicate that the viscosity of these mixtures is considerably less than nitrate-only melts, which necessarily contain calcium cations to suppress freezing to similarly low temperatures.

This paper presents a comparative study of a gas turbine cycle with post-combustion CO2 separation using an amine-based absorption process with Monoethanolamine (MEA). The study has been made for a triple pressure reheated 400 MWe natural gas-fuelled combined cycle (NGCC) with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to improve capture efficiency. Two different options for the energy supply to the solvent regeneration have been evaluated and compared concerning plant performance. In the first alternative heat is provided by steam extracted internally from the bottoming steam cycle while in the second option an external biomass-fuelled boiler was utilized to generate the required heat. With this novel configuration the amount of CO2 captured can be even more than 100 % if the exhaust gas from the bio-fuelled boiler is mixed and cleaned together with the main exhaust gas flow from the combined cycle. In order to make an unprejudiced comparison between the two alternatives, the reduced steam turbine efficiency has been taken into consideration and estimated, for the alternative with internal steam extraction. The cycles have been modelled in the commercial heat and mass balance programme IPSEpro™ using detailed component models. Utilizing EGR can double the CO2 content of the exhaust gases and reduce the energy need for the separation process by approximately 2%-points. Using an external biomass-fuelled boiler as heat source for amine regeneration, turns out to be an interesting option due to high CO2 capture effectiveness. However the electrical efficiency of the power plant is reduced compared to the option with internal steam extraction. Another drawback with the external boiler is the higher investment costs but nevertheless, it is flexibility due to the independency from the rest of the power generation system represents a major operational advantage.

The reliability of both systems is calculated in case of occurrence of Large Loss of Coolant Accident (Large LOCA). The new Russian design is based on the original KWU Convoy design and the applied modifications have improved its reliability. To perform the reliability analysis the event tree/fault tree method is used and the calculations are done by IAEA computer code PSAPACK. The results show that the applied modifications such as, increase of redundancy from 4 x 50% to 4 x 100%, change of cool down route, fuel storage pool cooling in all four trains have reduced the ECCS unavailability from 5.9 E-4 to 1.7 E-4.

Such microspheres are formed from mineral additives during coal burning in furnaces of boiler units of electric power stations. Despite some reduction in exchange capacity per a mass unit of sorbents the latter have high kinetic characteristics that makes it possible to carry out the sorption process both in static and dynamic modes. Taking into account large industrial resources of microspheres as by-products of electric power stations, a comparative simplicity of the modification process, as well as good kinetic and capacitor characteristics, this class of sorbents can be considered promising enough for solving the problems of cleaning liquid radioactive wastes of various pollution levels.

To more effectively utilize natural, renewable cooling sources, such as evaporative cooling and sky-radiative cooling, diurnal storage media operated on daily basis at the temperate range between 10 and 20 °C are the most desirable.

The system, which was installed on the rooftop of one the Ngee Ann Polytechnic's building, is intended to replace the normal city water supply from PUB. In this project rainwater was collected from the roof gutter, subsequently filtered and disinfected and then sent to nearby cooling tower to replace and eliminate the need from city water. A solenoid valve triggered supply of city water in the absence of rain or dry season. A comprehensive monitoring system was implemented whereby rainwater samples in the storage tanks and the cooling tower basin were taken regularly to determine their chemical, biological and physical properties. This is to determine that the rainwater quality would not cause operational problems for the cooling tower system such as corrosion, scaling and breakout of the Legionella bacteria. In general, results showed that values of conductivity, alkalinity, Chloride, silica, standard plate count, Legionella bacteria, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, phosphate and Aluminum were well within the control limits practiced in Singapore, USA and Hong Kong. However, values of pH, hardness and Iron concentrations didn't comply with the recommended control limits, occasionally. During 3 months of operation and actual installation, results indicated an effective saving of 40% of the water used, in terms of volume, the volume of which did not have to come from city water. As a result of savings in terms of water, energy costs, and deferred capital, the cost of collected roof water was calculated to be S$0.20 per cubic meter.

Theoretical principles of DPCMC method are established based on an UPFC model, together with a new direct power control approach based on sliding mode control techniques. As a result, active and reactive power can be directly controlled by selection of an appropriate switching state of matrix converter. This new direct power control approach associated to matrix converters technology guarantees decoupled active and reactive power control, zero error tracking, fast response times and timely control actions. Simulation results show good performance of the proposed system. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Control actions; Direct power control; Fast response; Intermediate energies; Matrix converter; Phase matrix; Power conversion; Simulation result; Sliding modes; Unified power flow controllers; Zero-error tracking; Cost reduction; Electric control equipment; Flow control; Industrial electronics; Power control; Power converters; Reactive power; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951615713

The influence of chlorine doping on the optical parameters of CdS:Cl films was studied using spectrophotometric measurements of the film transmittance in the wavelength range 200-1100 nm. All the chlorine doped films have sharp fall at the band edge, which is an indication of good crystallinity of the films, and exhibit high optical transmittance (70-90 %) in the range of wavelengths above the absorption edge. It was found that as the CdCh concentration increased the optical energy gap also increased while the refractive index decreased up to 0.10 concentration then stabilized for 0.15 and 0.20 concentrations. It is observed that as the CdCl2 concentration is increased, the resistivity of the films decreased. The carrier concentration increases with the increase in CdCl2 concentration which indicates that the chlorine impurity atoms serve as strong donor impurities. A rapid incremental behavior of mobility can be seen with increasing CdCb concentration. This behavior begins to slow down as the doping concentration increases. AFM studies reveal the growth of nano crystalline film structure for pure CdS film as well as the film doped with 0.05 wt% CdCl2 concentration. These significant results certainly encourage tailoring the CdS films with chlorine doping suitable as window materials required for heterojunction solar cells. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Absorption edges; AFM; Band edge; CdS; CdS films; CdS thin films; Crystallinities; Donor impurities; Doped films; Doping concentration; Electrical property; Glass substrates; Heterojunction solar cells; High-vacuum evaporation; Impurity atoms; Nanocrystallines; Optical energy gap; Optical parameter; Optical transmittance; Spectrophotometric measurements; Wavelength ranges; Weight percentages; Window materials; Cadmium compounds; Cadmium sulfide; Carrier concentration; Chlorine; Data storage equipment; Doping (additives); Electric properties; Film growth; Heterojunctions; Impurities; Organic polymers; Refractive index; Substrates; Thin films; Vacuum evaporation; Concentration (process)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951600711

More detailed investigations indicated that the difference is mainly caused by different sublibraries for thermal neutron scattering based on parameterizations of the S(α,β scattering matrix. Hence an analysis of trends was done with respect to the low energy neutron flux in order to assess the S(α,β) data sets. First, when performing the trend analysis based on the full set of 149 benchmarks that were employed for the validation, significant trends could not be found. But by analyzing a selected subset of benchmarks clear trends with respect to the low energy neutron flux could be detected. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the sensitivity of specific configurations to the parameterizations of the S(α,β) scattering matrix and thus may help to improve CSE of wet storage pools. Finally, in addition to the low energy neutron flux, we also refined the trend analyses with respect to other key (spectrum-related) parameters by performing them with various selected subsets of the full suite of 149 benchmarks.

Such salinity systems would provide a medium of energy storage: concentrated brine. They might be of particular interest for service continuity in small markets where standard renewable energy sources are not sufficiently reliable. The concept provides significant engineering challenges. Evaporation ponds would need to be large, but might be marine installations with no land footprint, or might be existing salt evaporation pans. High salinity differences are optimal in this application. With osmotic systems the operating pressures are correspondingly large - adequate membrane technology is yet to be developed. However, novel methods of generating power from salinity gradients are now appearing and familiar methods are now attracting increased attention that is likely to address many of these problems.

Such a system may be used in many conventional applications (e.g. traction, pumping, mills, kilns) and has substantial benefits for sustainable system applications such as building HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) where ventilation using a variable speed drive can greatly reduce net energy input. The VSMC is a bidirectional converter, with no dc-link energy storage element, consisting of 12 IGBTs (or other power devices), capable of drawing sinusoidal current from the supply. Hysteresis current control (HCC) may be employed so that a near-sinusoidal AC output current can be obtained while satisfying the torque load or speed load requirements. In conventional ASDs hard-switching can produce undesirable harmonics and losses. However, in this paper a new HCC-based space vector modulation (SVM) technique employing soft-switching is applied to the inverter stage of a VSMC with careful selection of a zero voltage vector (ZVV). As discussed in this paper, vector selection depends on the location of the current error vector instead of motor back emf prediction with no need for current derivatives. A simulation of a 3-phase VSMC drive and 40 KW PMSM is presented to verify the validity of the proposed new switching technique using the MATLAB SIMULINK package. ©2009 IEEE.","Adjustable Speed Drive (ASD); Field Oriented Control (FOC); Heating; Hysteresis current control based Space Vector modulation (HCC-SVM); Indirect Matrix Converter (IMC); Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM); Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC); Very Sparse Matrix Converter (VSMC)","Adjustable speed drives; Field Oriented Control (FOC); Field-oriented control; Hysteresis current control; Indirect matrix converter; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor; Space Vector Modulation; Sparse matrix converters; Very Sparse Matrix Converter (VSMC); AC motors; Air conditioning; Blood vessel prostheses; Brickmaking; Electric current control; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Heating; Hysteresis; Magnetic devices; MATLAB; Modulation; Permanent magnets; Power converters; Semiconducting intermetallics; Soft switching; Speed; Support vector machines; Variable speed drives; Vector spaces; Vectors; Ventilation; Zero voltage switching; Synchronous motors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951458941

This dual power system is too complex especially from points of nonlinearity, uncertainty, and switching structure and needs to be controlled by an intelligent controller accurately to meet vehicle's needs, guaranteeing stability, smooth operation and also today's standards. According to the discrete behavior of HEV, a model of this system has been developed in MATLAB/Simulink. In this work an on-line strategy based on fuzzy logic control is developed for energy flow management between internal combustion engine (ICE), as a major source of energy and batteries as energy storage system (ESS). It will optimize the power output, fuel economy and also meets vehicle's operational requirements. In addition, Battery State of Charge (SOC) is kept within a suitable range to guarantee the life expectancy of the battery. Using this controller, the model shows major improvement in fuel consumption and emissions levels. The overall design of the controller meant a smooth power flow to the wheels and consequently to the vehicle.

Currently, the polycarbonate method employs the high absorption ability of some polycarbonates to noble gases for sampling them from the environment and then to measure the absorbed activity. This work explores the applicability of LSC for measurement of 85Kr beta particles emitted from the exposed polycarbonates. Experiments with exposure of polycarbonates to Kr-85 in water and subsequent LSC counting are presented. The results from these experiments demonstrate good linear correlation between the measured net LS counting rate and the activity concentration of 85Kr at the exposure. The usage of the proposed technique leads to approximately 10 times better sensitivity for 85Kr compared to gross beta counting or gamma-spectrometry of the exposed polycarbonates. A particularly advantageous feature that has been identified in the present work is that the polycarbonate material is largely transparent for the LS cocktail light, thus adding polycarbonate in the LS cocktail do not result in a strong adverse effect on the light output. The results from the conducted experiments imply that quantitative measurements of 85Kr activity concentrations in air or water by LS counting of polycarbonates are feasible. The technique is applicable for monitoring of 85Kr concentrations in air or water in nuclear power plants (including at-reactor pools), spent fuel storage facilities and reprocessing plants. It allows simultaneous monitoring of 85Kr concentrations in a large number of points in these facilities. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Activity concentration; Adverse effect; Beta particles; Counting rates; Gamma spectrometry; Gross beta; Light output; Linear correlation; Liquid-scintillation counting; Noble gas; Quantitative measurement; Reprocessing plant; Sensitive techniques; Carbonates; Concentration (process); Dosimetry; Experiments; Flowcharting; Fuel storage; Gas absorption; Inert gases; Krypton; Light emission; Liquids; Monitoring; Nuclear energy; Nuclear industry; Nuclear physics; Nuclear power plants; Polycarbonates; Scintillation; Scintillation counters; Nuclear fuel reprocessing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951170449

This massive increase has primarily come from the addition of support for micro or mini Secure Digital (SD) flash cards on the nodes. This extra storage capacity has led to new use cases for sensor motes which result in fewer data transmissions as a result of more in network aggregation and processing of the sensor data. The primary motivation for using this approach is that writing data to, and then reading data from the SD card, aggregating and processing this data before transmitting smaller packets, should be much more power efficient than transmitting the raw data using the onboard radio.

The optimal generation scheduling is one of the important functions for the Microgrid operation. This paper describes a three-step efficient method for the optimal generation scheduling of a Microgrid in island operation. The first step of the method is to set up an initial feasible solution for thermal unit commitment and the next step is to solve the thermal unit commitment problem. The final step is to optimize the renewable-thermal dispatch based on thermal unit commitment results. Solving the thermal unit commitment problem has more opportunity to minimize the operating cost. Therefore, few algorithms such as Lagrangian relaxation, genetic algorithm and a hybrid algorithm of Lagrangian relaxation and genetic algorithm have been used to find the least operating cost. Microgrid which is considered in the case study, consists of a PV system, a wind plant, 10 thermal units and a battery bank. ©2009 IEEE.","Distributed energy resource; Genetic algorithm; Lagrangian relaxation; Microgrid; Optimal generation scheduling","Distributed energy resource; Distributed Energy Resources; LaGrangian relaxation; Micro grid; Optimal generation; Distributed parameter networks; Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Energy resources; Genetic algorithms; Lagrange multipliers; Operating costs; Optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951100158

In these vehicles usually different and/or varying voltage levels for the drive and the energy storage elements are employed in order to fully utilise the components and increase the system efficiency. The DClinks with different voltage levels are interconnected by bidirectional DC-DC converters. Due to the high power levels the converters are often realised by interleaved smaller units for increasing part load efficiency and power density. In this paper an procedure for optimising the nominal power levels, operating points and distribution of silicon area of interleaved/parallel connected DC-DC converters is presented. There, the aim is to optimise the overall system efficiency for a given mission profile of the electric vehicle (e.g. NEDC/FTP-75) and to determine the optimal distribution of a fixed amount of silicon area between the parallel units for minimal losses. For demonstrating the performance of the method a 48kW test system is optimised, where an improvement of more than 21% compared to equal parallel connected units is shown. There, the calculations are based on measurements on a 12kW bidirectional prototype DC-DC converter designed for electric vehicles. ©2009 IEEE.","DC-DC converter; Hybrid car; Mission profile; Optimisation","Bidirectional DC-DC converters; DC links; Electrical drives; Environmental reasons; High power level; Hybrid cars; Hybrid vehicles; Mission profile; Modularizations; Nominal power levels; Operating points; Optimal distributions; Optimisation; Optimisations; Parallel-connected; Part load; Power densities; Silicon area; System efficiency; Test systems; Voltage levels; Automobile electronic equipment; Automobile parts and equipment; Electric losses; Electric vehicles; HVDC power transmission; Locomotives; Modular construction; Motion control; Motion planning; Optimization; Power electronics; Railroad cars; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951098274

Modulation (SVPWM) for three phases Voltage Source Converter (VSC) and it is the standard PWM techniques to utilize the DC-AC power conversion. A control technique based on SVPWM is also proposed for dynamic voltage restorer. The DVR was a power electronics device that was able to compensate voltage sags on critical loads dynamically. By injecting an appropriate voltage, the DVR restores a voltage waveform and ensures constant load voltage. The compensating signals are determined dynamically based on the difference between desired and measured values. The DVR consists of VSC, injection transformers, passive filters and energy storage (lead acid battery The efficiency of the DVR depends on the efficiency of the control technique involved in switching the inverter. In this paper a novel structure for voltage sags mitigation and for power quality improvement are proposed. There was an increasing trend of using space vector PWM (SVPWM) because of their easier digital realization and better dc bus utilization. The proposed control algorithm is investigated through computer simulation by using PSCAD/EMTDC software. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed low voltage dynamic voltage restorer and prove the validity of the proposed topology. From simulation and experimental results of a DVR using PSCAD/EMTC software based on SVPWM technique showed that the effectiveness of the DVR in mitigating voltage sags. The DVR operates without any difficulties to inject the appropriate voltage component to correct rapidly any disturbances in the supply voltage. It was concluded that the proposed low voltage dynamic voltage restorer works well both in balance and unbalance conditions of voltages.","Dynamic voltage restore; Space vector pulse width modulation; Voltage sag; Voltage source converter","Compensating signal; Constant load voltage; Control algorithms; Control techniques; Critical load; DC-AC power conversion; Dynamic voltage; Dynamic voltage restorers; Injection transformers; Low voltages; Novel structures; Power electronics devices; Power quality improvement; PSCAD/EMTDC; Pulse width; PWM techniques; Simulation result; Software-based; Space Vector; Space vector pulse width modulation; Space vector PWM; Supply voltages; Three phasis; Voltage sag mitigation; Voltage sags; Voltage source converters; Voltage waveforms; Algorithms; Computer crime; Computer simulation; Computer software; Counting circuits; Electronic equipment; Passive filters; Power converters; Power electronics; Power quality; Pulse modulation; Restoration; Vector spaces; Vectors; Videodisks; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Pulse width modulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951004798

Hence, the reliability of the WBAN is greatly dependent on the life span of the gateway. In this paper, a selective gateway method based on the residual energy of the sensor nodes has been proposed. By changing the gateway, the lifetime of the WBAN can be extended. To further increase the lifetime of the WBAN, a thermal energy harvesting system has been proposed to harvest heat energy from human warmth.

The inverter operates during the day time as an active power compensator as well as load voltage regulator under grid voltage sag, swell or even under normal condition. The compensating voltage provided by the inverter is always added vectorially in series with the grid voltage in such a way that it maintains the load voltage magnitude constant. This eliminates the need for battery or any other energy storage device at the DC link. This reduces the investment cost of the system. Moreover, the proposed control strategy works in such a way that even in the presence of lagging power factor load, it is possible to supply reactive power back to grid that can be utilized in some other lagging power factor load connected directly to grid. An adaptive proportional resonant controller is used to track the required load voltage magnitude as well as phase angle. This control strategy is simple to implement and provides improved performance as compared to a conventional PI controller. Detailed simulation studies and experiments have been carried out and results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.","Day time control; Proportional resonant controller application; Series PV inverter; System without active energy storage device","Active energy; Proportional resonant controller application; PV inverter; Resonant controller; Time control; Electric potential; Electric power factor; Energy storage; Flywheels; Investments; Photovoltaic effects; Power electronics; Voltage regulators; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950898769

Frequency control is directly related to the active power balance in the system. When RES are involved the generated active power is difficult to predict, and may have fluctuations mainly in the case of wind power plants. Therefore, the autonomous MGs have to be able to manage fast the active power flow, even when the generated power is less than the loads demand. This paper investigates a new control solution for maintaining the frequency stability in the MG, by using a combination of an energy storage system and a dump load.

The reactor electrode system is configured as a checker mesh of potential and grounded threaded electrodes, and the pulse generator is based on a modern magnetic compression topology. Both the corona reactor and the nanosecond pulse power supply designs were described in detail earlier [1], [2]. This presentation considers the effect of the geometrical parameters of the reactor (the total length of the high-voltage electrode surrounded by its grounded counterparts and the gap between high-voltage and the grounded electrodes) on the operation of the atmospheric pressure streamer plasma system. The model analyzes the discharge processes in the reactor by distinguishing between four phases, each being represented by an equivalent circuit: before streamer generation, during primary streamer propagation, after primary streamers have crossed the interelectrode gaps, and after the plasma conductivity quenching. Such an approach has been validated in previous work [3]. The new reactor model is realized on the PSpice platform, and simulations are done using an improved pulse modulator model [4]. The simulation results are compared with experimental data, showing the model validity. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Capacitive storage; Discharge process; Electrode systems; Energy pulse; Experimental data; Geometrical parameters; Grounded electrodes; High voltage electrodes; High-voltages; Interelectrode gaps; Magnetic compression; Model validity; Nanosecond pulse; Plasma conductivity; Pulse modulators; Reactor models; Semiempirical models; Simulation result; Streamer plasmas; Streamer propagation; Total length; Atmospheric pressure; Electric conductivity; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Plasma applications; Pressure effects; Pulse modulation; Signal generators; SPICE; Pulse generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950016951

In power modulators based on capacitor discharge this voltage droop is mainly defined by the input capacitance. In order to overcome this problem, in power modulators systems, compensation circuits are added, whereby in spite of a smaller storage capacitor a flat pulse top is achieved. Depending on the pulse duration, different approaches for voltage droop compensation exist. For short pulse durations, in the range of several μs, only passive solutions or bouncer circuits are applicable. In this paper the design and optimization of a two-winding inductor bouncer circuit is presented in order to achieve an output voltage droop of less than 1%. Due to the realized galvanic isolation a new degree of freedom is obtained, which allows an adaption of the bouncer circuit's voltage and current rating to standard semiconductor switches. With an optimal design of the two-winding inductor bouncer circuit for the existing system, the volume of the input capacitor is reduced by a factor of 10.5 and the stored energy is decreased by a factor of 24 compared to system without bouncer circuit. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Capacitor discharge; Compensation circuits; Current rating; Degree of freedom; Design and optimization; Existing systems; Galvanic isolation; Input capacitance; Optimal design; Output pulse; Output voltages; Passive solutions; Power modulators; Pulse durations; Pulsed power applications; Short pulse duration; Storage capacitor; Stored energy; System operation; Voltage droop; Capacitors; Design; Electric switchgear; Optimal systems; Optimization; Winding; Capacitance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949996138

This is based on a novel surface-normal communication scheme. It exploits massively parallel quantum tunneling through an array of field emission devices lining the surface of an electromagnetic vacuum chamber and multi-trajectory electron optics through the cavity volume. This results in significantly reduced energy loss per bit communicated, due loss-less nature of quantum tunneling and collision-free movement of electrons through vacuum. Modulation of field-emitted electron beams and the new electron optical system are both enabled by recent insights into optimization problems with multiple global minima. Just as many natural systems governed by potential energy functions with multiple global minima are well understood theoretically (e.g. systems with translational symmetry in crystallography and solid state physics), we are able to analyze behavior of electrons in systems with artificially created symmetries based on finite projective geometry.

This incorporation can generate a number of problems on the dynamics of power systems. In addition, over the last few years, new power electronic devices coupled with energy storage have emerged. These new devices allow the operation of electric systems to be controlled. In this work, the use of a Distribution Static Synchronous Compensator (DSTATCOM) coupled with a Flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS) is proposed to mitigate problems, mainly in power quality, introduced by wind generation in the electric system. A dynamic model of the DSTATCOM/FESS device is presented and a multi-level control technique is proposed. The control technique has one control mode for active power and two control modes for reactive power, power factor correction, and voltage control. Tests of the behaviour of the device are analyzed when it is combined with wind generation in the electric system. The results demonstrate a satisfactory performance of the control technique proposed as well as a high effectiveness of the device, to mitigate problems introduced by wind generation. © 2009 IEEE.","DSTATCOM; Flywheel energy storage; Wind power","Active power; Control modes; Control techniques; Distribution static synchronous compensators; DSTATCOM; Electric systems; Flywheel energy storage; Flywheel energy storage system; Multi-level; New devices; Power electronic devices; Power factor corrections; Power systems; Wind energy; Wind generation; Electric generators; Electric potential; Electric power factor; Electron devices; Energy storage; Flywheel propulsion; Flywheels; Power electronics; Power quality; Voltage regulators; Wheels; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949938001

The Malaysian Energy Center (PTM)'s Suria1000 project highlights the problems associated with rooftop PV systems. TNB's off-grid PV projects also provide valuable lessons on standalone PV systems. PTM's Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) project shows grid-connected rooftop PV systems are viable. The annual energy output of these installations has been found to be in the top 50 % of similar installations Worldwide. The major obstacles to these systems are the high capital cost of the system and the absence of a feed-in tariff. TNB's experience with offgrid PV projects point to their viability as an attractive alternative to costly extension of the grid for small isolated loads. The major problem is the high maintenance cost of these installations. Simulation studies indicate that standalone PV systems with storage capacity and backup generator are cheaper than grid extension for small loads beyond a certain distance from the grid. Rooftop PV generation in the commercial areas of the city can also be an attractive alternative to upgrading the existing grid capacity. The study concludes that various PV system options need to be introduced into the country on an urgent basis to bring down capital and maintenance costs as well as provide learning opportunities to upgrade the technical competencies of its human resource. ©2009 IEEE.","Cost; Grid; Obstacles; Photovoltaics; Rooftop","Back-up generators; Building integrated photovoltaic; Capital costs; Energy output; Feed-in tariff; Grid; Grid extension; Grid-connected; Human resources; Isolated loads; Learning opportunity; Maintenance cost; Malaysia; Malaysians; Off-grids; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; PV generation; PV system; Simulation studies; Small load; Stand-alone PV systems; Storage capacity; Technical competencies; Costs; Maintenance; Mesh generation; Sustainable development; Photovoltaic effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949593438

At high levels of installed wind, it is shown that storage reduces curtailment and increases the use the base loaded plant on the system. This reduces system costs. However, when the additional capital costs of storage are taken into account, it is shown that storage is not viable from a system perspective until extremely large levels of wind power are seen on the system. At these levels of installed wind, while the system can operate without storage, it is less costly to do so with storage. The capacity credit of the storage unit is also examined, using a simplified approach, and shown to decrease as larger amounts of intermittent wind power are added to the system. ©2009 IEEE.","Large scale energy storage; Power system modelling; Wind energy","Capacity credit; Capital costs; Power system modelling; Power systems; Pumped Storage; Storage units; System costs; Total energy; Unit commitments; Wind energy; Wind penetration; Energy storage; Flywheels; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649321572

The environmental risks of industry operations are many but are commonly associated with; drilling fluids containing toxic materials (including oil/grease, heavy metals, & naturally occurring radioactive materials); produced waters posing threat of accidental release; potential emissions of hydrogen sulfide in natural gas deposits with its deadly effects on human health; and blowout of exploratory wells (statistically, in 0.5-1% cases) under pressurized contents of a geologic formation resulting in harmful emissions; and other accidents severely impacting environment and the project economics. To focus on general environmental risks, statistics of environmental incidences and preventions related to well drilling, pipelines incidents and spills/leaks are described. Guidelines and some economically feasible options based on technological advances to minimize risks to environment & human health are also listed. However, the paper essentially emphasizes the importance of technological advances to reduce industry's operational and environmental compliance costs during all phases (exploration, drilling, production, transportation, and storage) of oil and gas exploration and production (E&P). An an example, using modern technology, a substantial cost reduction from $8M in 1980 to about $0.1M today is realized for a 50 sq-mile exploration survey. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that by 2020, the lower cost compliance technology programs could decrease cumulative industry environmental compliance costs by over $36 billion. The cost reduction coupled with better survey and monitoring data allows less intrusive methods with least impact on environment. Compliance cost reduction further provides opportunities for investing in continued research & development (R&D) towards achieving environmental protection goals. Therefore, special emphasis is to be given to applications of ""smart technological solutions"" in achieving essential goals of environmental protection, economic benefits and environmental sustainability. New exploration and production technologies for the petroleum industry are developed primarily to increase oil recovery and reduce the cost of recovery. Reducing costs often goes with reducing the environmental impact of exploration, drilling and completion procedures. The industry search for advanced technology to produce oil and to meet environmental regulations has developed new, improved techniques and strategies which accomplish both goals. Conducting operations that are ""Smarter, Farther, Deeper, Cleaner and Smaller"" makes good business sense and helps to protect the environment. Many oil companies have learned that going that one step farther to protect sensitive environments and avoid pollution, pays them back directly in increased economic benefits. In the US, petroleum production generates on average, 7 to 8 barrels (approximately 15 billion barrels annually) of wastewater or produced water per barrel of oil. Today, operators are using advanced reservoir management techniques as discussed above to enhance well placement and reduce water production. Downhole oil/water and gas/water separation could dramatically further reduce the amount of water produced up the wellbore, cutting operating costs, improving environment by decreasing the possibility of groundwater contamination from produced water spillage. Besides reducing environmental compliance costs, sensible use of modern technology results in lesser volume of waste produced in conjunction with re-use of resources (such as re-injection of treated wastewater) as well as provides speed and reliability of processing information. As an example, the cost of analyzing a 50-square mile survey for Oil & Gas operations has fallen from approximately $8 million in 1980, to just about $0.1 million today. Satellite imagery and aeromagnetic surveys are useful tools to pinpointing resources and reduce wastes. These methods allow engineers to better ""see"" underground to locate potential sources of oil and gas, dramatically improving exploration success rates, reducing drilling costs, and minimizing environmental impacts. Fiber optics sensor systems are increasingly being applied throughout a reservoir's life to optimize production. This helps to develop ""smart wells"" technology, which collects data on well performance and reservoir properties downhole that can be monitored from anywhere in the world via the Internet. Slim-hole drilling technology (drilling holes of a diameter of 6 inches or less) is changing exploration and production, especially in the early stages of exploration and in re-entering existing small-diameter wells to reach new reserves in mature fields. Even greater reductions in costs and environmental impacts can be achieved with more advanced technologies. Using above mentioned smart technologies during all phases of Oil & Gas industry is directly reducing overall operational costs and should achieve DOE's targeted goal of reducing the cumulative industry environmental compliance costs by over several billion dollars by next decade. The reduction in cost of environmental compliance and liability is directly benefiting additional research in finding new low cost technologies for the industry. The newer technologies in turn continue to further help reduce the overall environmental compliance costs while adequately protecting the environment.

Both fresh and pit manures had been converted to bio-crude with refined oil yields of 32-42% (dry mass) of the total feedstock (∼ 60-70% raw oil yield). The refined oil is the toluene soluble portion of the raw oil. The testing conditions were 305°C, with an initial solid content of 20% wt, a retention time of 30 min, an initial N2 gas pressure of 0.65 MPa, and without catalysts or additives. Length of manure storage time in pit did not significantly affect the bio-oil formation compared to that of fresh manure, if the volatile solids contents were relatively similar. Manures from nursery, grower-finisher and sow pigs were tested, and statistical analysis showed that there were no significant differences of bio-oil yield for these different types of manures. A strong linear relationship was found between the refined oil yield and the sum of crude protein and crude fat contents in the feedstock. This indicates that the crude protein and crude fat are critical elements, although probably not the only two, causing bio-crude oil formation in the hydrothermal process.","Bio-oil; Hydrothermal process; Renewable energy; Swine manure","Bio oil; Bio-oil yield; Conversion rates; Critical elements; Crude fat; Crude proteins; Dry mass; Gas pressures; Hydrothermal process; Linear relationships; Manure storages; Oil yield; Renewable energies; Retention time; Solid contents; Statistical analysis; Storage time; Swine manure; Testing conditions; Volatile solid; Crude oil; Feedstocks; Fertilizers; Manures; Proteins; Refining; Renewable energy resources; Toluene; Petroleum refining",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649138126

It is designed to consist of two modified gold electrodes and a thickness-controlled PDMS as the micro fluidic channel for transporting the glucose solution.

The entire chemical reaction process is designed to take place between the cathode and anode without a proton exchange membrane. In addition to this project, some conducting materials, such as electronic-grade carbon nanotubes (EG-CNTs), palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been analyzed to determine the effects on the power output. These materials were annexed to the gold electrodes and enzymes . The results show that using CNTs can provide steady and higher power output, the largest generated power density is 3.52μWm-3.

The first two designs use FPGA HW with different number of storage registers 2n and 2n2 and the third design uses a computer system piloted by NIOS II\e processor with On-Chip memory.

Acoustic emission (AE) testing was performed on type I steel cylinder. These studies suggested that the elastic stress waves or acoustic emissions generated during the microscopic dislocation can propagate across the storage cylinder surface to be detectable by the sensors attached at the ends of the cylinder. This paper presents a preliminary study on the signal transmission and propagation of acoustic emission (AE) signatures across the cylinder. During the test, a gradual increase in hydrostatic pressure up to 300 bars was pplied to the cylinder. The AE signals were recorded as a function of time and the increased pressure. It is therefore obvious that AE can be used to capture the microscopic failure due to its grain dislocation or flaws initiation in the cylinder.","Acoustic emission; CNG cylinder; Propagation","AE signals; CNG cylinder; CNG cylinders; Compressed natural gas; Cylinder surface; Elastic stress waves; Function of time; Signal transmission; Steel cylinders; Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic emissions; Acoustics; Energy resources; Hydrostatic pressure; Steel testing; Cylinders (shapes)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76349103550

The energy of plasmonic resonances in Au particles is close to the energy of excitonic transitions in layers of the solid alloy In0.25Ga0.75.

To release this limitation, we present a Cooperative Power Management (referred to as CPM) scheme to save energy with performance guarantee for object-based storage cluster. CPM reclaims idle memories of neighboring Object-based Storage Devices (OSDs) over high speed network as remote cache to store evicted objects. Then requests missed in local cache could be hit by remote cache, and local disk does not necessarily spin back up to service these requests. Hence, CPM can artificially create long idle periods to provide more opportunities for underlying disk power management. CPM minimizes the risk of performance and energy penalty by spinning down disks only when predicted idle period is long enough to justify state-transition energy. Our rigorous experiment results conclusively demonstrate that CPM can dynamically adapt to workload changes and outperform existing solutions in terms of energy saving and performance for large-scale OSD cluster.","Cooperaticve cache; Power management; Storage cluster","Back up; Energy saving; Local cache; Object-based storage; Object-based storage devices; Performance guarantees; Power managements; Save energy; Transition energy; Computer simulation; Disks (structural components); Electric power measurement; Management; Phase modulation; Telecommunication systems; Energy management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76349085406

Effects of scleroglucan concentration on the gelation process and swelling behavior of synthesized hydrogels in different media were investigated using dynamic rheometery and swelling tests, respectively. Oscillatory shear rheology showed that the limiting storage modulus of the semi-IPN gels increased with increase in scleroglucan concentration. It was also found that the viscous energy dissipating properties of the semi-IPN gels decreased with increase in the crosslinker concentration of the gelation system. In addition, the loss factor slightly decreased by increasing the scleroglucan content, indicating that the viscous properties of this gelling system decreased more than its elastic properties. The swelling tests showed that the equilibrium swelling ratio (ESR) of the semi-IPN networks decreased with increase in scleroglucan content, due to the decrease of ionic groups of polyelectrolyte hydrogel. However, the semi-IPN gels showed lower salt sensitivity in synthetic oil reservoir water as compared with HPAM gels.

In the context of rapidly expanding of distributed energy sources, the wind energy converters are in the center of interest. In this case, the direct dependence of the power generation capability for a given wind speed represents a major problem of wind energy conversion with regard to large-scale network integration. This paper proposes an overall solution which consists of a wind plant with a smart Storage Modular System (SSMS) where the wind source -as stochastic one- is coupled over a dc bus with two storage modules and a smart grid interface. The investigated system consists of three modules: a) the stochastic module (variable wind turbine with PMSG and ac/dc + bust converters), b) the short term storage module (flywheel with power electronic converter) and c) the medium/long term module (Vanadium Redox Flow Battery with power electronic converter). All of three modules are interfaced with the network and insulated loads by a grid interface module (power electronic converter, filter and transformer). To the related SSMS, are accomplished computer simulations. In order to validate them, laboratory tests are also presented. © 2009 IEEE.","Computer simulation; Digital control; Direct torque control; Distributed generation; Energy storage; Flow batteries; Flywheels; Induction motor; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; Power electronics; Power system simulation; Renewable energy; Wind energy","Digital control; Direct Torque Control; Distributed Generation; Flow batteries; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; Power system simulations; Renewable energies; Wind energy; Computational methods; Computer control systems; Computer simulation; Digital control systems; Electric generators; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Flywheels; Induction motors; Lithium batteries; Magnetic devices; Motors; Permanent magnets; Power electronics; Rotors; Stochastic systems; Synchronous generators; Synchronous motors; Torque control; Vanadium; Wheels; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74949129835

Hence, locations of pixels are the key factor to determine the size of each block and we use wavelet transform to decompose each block into subband components, which are represented by 3D vectors. The 3D vectors are then classified into 8 groups corresponding to quadrants of spatial coordinates. In addition, we apply Fuzzy C-Means algorithm to classify the member in the magnitudes value of 3D vectors into code vector. Due to the lossy coding process, we propose a method of system error compensation on Vector Quantization (VQ) by using principle component analysis and discrete wavelet transform to performed on the system error and keeping the high-energy coefficient for further inverse wavelet transform to yield system error compensation. The reconstructed image and system error compensate will be combined in order to construct an output image (Xo). By applying the proposed method, performance of the method is evaluated as 26.19% of bit rate and 1.50% of PSNR improved. ©2009 IEEE.",,"3D vectors; Bit rates; Code vectors; Data storage; Fuzzy C mean; Fuzzy C-means algorithms; High energy; High-speed data transmission; Inverse wavelet transforms; Key factors; Lossy coding; Low frequency range; Method of images; Peak signal to noise ratio; Principle component analysis; Reconstructed image; Spatial coordinates; Spatial domains; Sub-bands; System errors; Copying; Data communication systems; Discrete wavelet transforms; Error compensation; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy systems; Information technology; Pixels; Signal to noise ratio; Three dimensional; Vector quantization; Vectors; Visual communication; Image coding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74549141439

Based on the analysis of the available technologies for solar water heating equipment, the most suitable solution of a DHW solar system for the Syrian and Armenian markets has been identified as a solar hot water heater, composed of flat plate solar collectors and a storage tank located horizontally slightly above the collectors, connected together by pipes where a thermosyphon circulation of water is established, in a closed loop between the solar collector absorber and an appropriate heat exchanger. This choice is based on the observation that this technology is much more reliable than pumped systems, due to the absence of pump and control that contribute heavily to the maintenance problems of DHW systems. It is clearly demonstrated that SHWS are feasible in both countries and should be widely distributed all over their territories. It was found that the cost of the useful energy yielded by a solar system with a relatively low efficiency (20% for example), installed in all over these countries and sold at 800 $/m2, is 17.44 cent/kWh for a net discount rate of 0% and 23.2 cent/kWh for a net discount rate of 5%; such system is therefore already economically competitive against electric heaters and oil fired boilers with international prices of electricity and diesel oil, especially if incentives are granted by the public authorities.","Domestic hot water; Economic feasibility; Solar systems","Armenia; Closed loops; Diesel oil; Discount rates; Domestic hot water; Economic feasibilities; Economic feasibility; Electric heater; Flat-plate solar collectors; Maintenance Problem; Public authorities; Pumped systems; Solar domestic hot water systems; Solar hot water; Solar water heating; Storage tank; Suitable solutions; Thermosyphons; Astronomy; Diesel fuels; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Oil fired boilers; Solar absorbers; Solar collectors; Solar heating; Solar radiation; Solar system; Solar water heaters; Water; Water analysis; Waterworks; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74549126599

The intercepted electromagnetic signal can be used to reveal the contents of program and/or data memory of the microprocessor, exploited in a variety of attacks [1] [2] [3] [4]. Common for these approaches is the need to map an unknown intercepted signal (trace) to a known set of activities on the microprocessor, often based on thousand of available variables. It is unlikely that all variables contain relevant information and a large number of variables requires a lot of computational resources (storage and execution time). It is therefore of interest to reduce the number of variables by selecting lower dimensional subsets or mapping. This article gives an introduction to feature selection methods as well as suggestions as to how to handle a multi-class case. We use the wireless covert channel attack [4] to perform an application specific comparison between a selection of these methods. The different methods are compared by classification error and computational cost. Our results suggest use of the Greedy Forward Selection method, if preprocessing time is of no concern. Otherwise, ranking based methods give fair results. Experimental results also show that, in a wireless covert channel application, it is possible to classify microprocessor activity (i.e instruction executed), with a very low probability of error, given the energy emitted on only a few selected carrier frequencies. Implementation of a M-ary, multi carrier covert channel with a reasonable error rate is therefore feasible.","Covert channel; Electromagnetic side channel; Feature selection; Microprocessors","Application specific; Carrier frequency; Classification errors; Computational costs; Computational resources; Covert channels; Data memory; Electromagnetic signals; Error rate; Execution time; Feature selection; Feature selection methods; Greedy forward; Low probability; Multi carrier; Multi-class; Power Consumption; Preprocessing time; Side-channel; Transistor transition; Electromagnetism; Pattern recognition; Signal processing; Microprocessor chips",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74549116870

The objectives were (1) to examine the seasonal patterns of rhizome growth and nutrient dynamics of the energy crop reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) in ley I and II, and (2) to evaluate the roles of soil type (mineral vs. organic), fertilisation level (0, 50, and 100 kg N ha-1), and season/harvest time (Oct-96, May-97, and Aug-97) on the rhizome growth and nutrient dynamics by means of a factorially designed experiment. The general pattern of rhizome growth was that biomass was low in June during initiation of shoot growth, but increased steadily during the growing season, reached a peak in late autumn, and remained high until next spring. The N and P accumulation in rhizomes followed a similar pattern. During ley years I and II, reed canary grass rhizome growth was less dependent on soil type, and more dependent on fertilisation and season, with fertilisation being the most important predictor of growth. The season/harvest time, followed by soil type, was the most important factor for both concentrations and therefore total uptake of N, P, and K in rhizomes. Soil type affected N content in rhizomes significantly, and also interacted with season and enhanced the effect on N, P, and K content in rhizomes. The seasonal dynamics of the nutrient content in rhizomes indicate a remobilisation of the nutrients from rhizomes to the regrowth of shoots and roots in spring and relocation/storage from aboveground shoots to rhizomes during late summer and autumn. The results of this study suggest that delaying the harvest to later than October would result in considerably more energy and nutrient resources being translocated from aboveground shoots to rhizomes for growth in the next season. © 2009 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Delayed harvest; Energy crop; Fertilisation; Nutrient dynamics; Rhizomes; Seasonal growth; Soil type",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74449084441

The capture and subsequent geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide has been central to plans for managing carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. Michael suggests that the volume of liquid or supercritical CO2 to be disposed cannot exceed more than about 1% of pore space, and will require from 5 to 20 times more underground reservoir volume than envisioned. It renders geologic sequestration of CO2 a profoundly nonfeasible option for the management of CO2 emissions.",,"Carbon capture and storage; Carbon storage; Climate scenarios; Geologic sequestrations; Oil companies; Pore space; Supercritical CO; Fossil fuels; Underground reservoirs; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74349107993

Only the energy-balance transport model allows for transient simulations of realistic voltage wave forms. To attain qualified predictions, impact ionization rates were calibrated by full-band Monte Carlo simulations. Inclusion of band-to-band tunneling is crucial, although junction profiles were optimized for minimal gate-induced drain leakage. The memory effect is explored in detail for partially-depleted FETs, stressing the difference between two operation modi: the steady-state avalanche mode which makes use of the soft breakdown of the body-drain junction, and the bipolar mode where the collector current of the parasitic bipolar decays in time due to the loss of stored holes in the base. It is shown that in fully-depleted ultra-thin body FETs the common kink effect is absent, instead a similar floating body effect is found in the sub-threshold range which is however suppressed by unavoidable and predominating band-to-band tunneling. Although a large amount of excess holes can be created during WRITE1 and hold relatively steady in the body, this charge is always lost when switching to READ1. At sub-threshold gate voltages, the READ1 current becomes self-determined by band-to-band tunneling, which also fixes the READ0 current to the same value. Above threshold, stored holes are either swept out to the source or their electrostatic impact is negligible compared to the injected charge from the source. No wave form could be found that results in a READ1/READ0 programming window. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Avalanche mode; Band to band tunneling; Bi-polar mode; Collector currents; Drain junctions; Floating bodies; Floating body effect; Full-band Monte Carlo; Fully depleted; Gate-induced drain leakage; Junction profiles; Kink effect; Memory cell; Memory effects; Partially depleted; Programming window; Short-channel devices; Soft breakdown; Subthreshold; Transient simulation; Transport models; Ultrathin body; Voltage waves; Wave forms; Bodies of revolution; Computer simulation; Drain current; MESFET devices; Monte Carlo methods; MOS devices; Particle detectors; Scalability; Semiconductor junctions; Semiconductor storage; Threshold logic; Tunneling (excavation); Wind tunnels; Impact ionization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74349105944

This is due to the complex reorganisation of key sub-system processes involving nonlinear, cross-scale and cross-sector interactions in real time. Hence, predictive models of complex social-ecological systems are often subject to large uncertainties. We propose an approach for evaluating land-use adaptations for biofuel production, using Bayesian networks and integrating research on the food, water and energy sectors. The approach is intended to facilitate interdisciplinary consideration of cross-scale and intersector dependencies. We applied this approach to 2 examples of land-use strategies and show how the resilience of a strategy that meets the new South African national biofuel production target can be assessed in relation to climate change. Cross-disciplinary consideration of variables may be enhanced through the sensitivity analysis enabled by Bayesian networks, which is used to conceptualise the conditional causal dependencies between subsystem variables. We formulate and run a national scale South African model which links the impacts of projected climate change effects in southern Africa to irrigated agriculture, water storage planning and biofuel production. We demonstrate how the approach can be used to evaluate land-use changes in different projected climate change scenarios and land-use combinations, and how conflicting demands between water, food and biofuel energy sources may be preliminarily identified and assessed in an integrated probabilistic framework. Evaluating this problem in the context of climate change and water-related limits to growth enables research to support integrated analysis and planning for biofuel production and development. © Inter-Research 2009.","Bayesian networks; Biofuels; Climate change; Cross-sector analysis; Land-use change; Resilience","Bayesian modelling; Biofuel production; Climate change scenarios; Cross-disciplinary; Cross-sector analysis; Ecological systems; Energy sector; Energy source; Integrated analysis; Integrating research; Irrigated agriculture; Land-use change; Land-use strategies; Predictive models; Probabilistic framework; Real time; Reorganisation; Social-ecological systems; Sub-systems; Water storage; Bayesian networks; Biofuels; Climate models; Complexation; Distributed parameter networks; Forestry; Inference engines; Intelligent networks; Land use; Sensitivity analysis; Water analysis; Climate change; Bayesian analysis; biofuel; climate change; ecological impact; land use change; land use planning; socioeconomic conditions; water storage; Southern Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74349090714

They have brought significant breakthroughs in different fields such as materials, electronic devices, energy storage, separation, sensors, etc. If the CNTs are ever to fulfill their promise as an engineering material, commercial production will be required. Catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) technique coupled with a suitable reactor is considered as a scalable and relatively low-cost process enabling to produce high yield CNTs. Recent advances on CCVD of CNTs have shown that fluidized-bed reactors have a great potential for commercial production of this valuable material. However, the dominating process parameters which impact upon the CNT nucleation and growth need to be understood to control product morphology, optimize process productivity and scale up the process. This paper discusses a general overview of the key parameters in the CVD formation of CNT.

The two machines were compared on aspects such as safety, loading potential, energy efficiency and costs. The objectives of the comparison were to determine whether or not the replacement of the rocker shovel with the Warthog will be operationally and financially justifiable. The results from this study were obtained from underground observations and time studies on the machines, as well as consultations and data collection at the shaft and suppliers. This paper compares only the Warthog loader to the Trident 215 rocker shovel used at Anglo Platinum's Brakspruit shaft and does not compare the other models of rocker shovels, which are fundamentally the same but will have different loading potentials and specifications. Cleaning times for the rocker shovel are based on underground observations at Brakspruit shaft. These times can be influenced by factors such as blasting practices, compressed air pressure and operator experience and skill. For this reason the times will most likely vary at different shafts. The Warthog cleaning times are based on manufacturer specifications and results from trial stages and therefore further work is required to confirm cleaning times achieved. The findings from this study indicate that the replacement of the rocker shovel with the Warthog will improve the safety, production, cost and energy efficiency of development end cleaning operations. The Warthog also complements the system of rapid face advance achieved by the Mantis drill rigs, by achieving faster cleaning rates to handle the longer advances and larger volume of rock. In this way the Warthog benefits the overall efficiency of flat end development. © The Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2009.",,"Anglo platinums; Cleaning operations; Cleaning rate; Data collection; Drill rigs; Manufacturer specifications; Overall efficiency; Rocker arm; Two machines; Atmospheric pressure; Caissons; Cold storage; Compressed air; Loaders; Loading; Mining; Platinum; Pneumatics; Pressure vessels; Shovels; Specifications; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73849100733

Ronald Oxburgh, former chairman of Shell and a prominent consultant on energy and CCS, is heading a team, which is currently investigating any remaining obstacles to large-scale installation of CCS at power plants, such as providing the infrastructure for transporting sequestered CO2 to depleted gas fields and other suitable storage sites. Other technologies a Conservative government would nurture include marine and tidal power, energy from waste, microgeneration, and nuclear power. Wind power would receive a boost with the installation of new high-voltage DC power lines, which would sit on the sea bed along the east and west coast of the UK. All these renewable and low-carbon technologies will not come cheap, and Hendry urged greater transparency on the cost of decarbonizing future energy supplies. All sources of low-carbon power are very expensive and prices per unit of energy will rise.

Proposed data forwarding mechanisms represent different trade offs between data transfer speed and network resource consumption, most of them assuming perfect cooperation among network nodes. Nevertheless, nodes may exhibit selfish behavior, in particular when they are constrained with respect to energy, computational power, and/or storage space. In this paper, we analytically assess the performance of two popular data relaying alternatives, the unrestricted and two-hop relay schemes, when nodes behave selfishly while forwarding data. Our results suggest that the performance advantage of unrestricted relaying over two-hop relaying decreases both with the number of selfish nodes and the intensity of their selfishness, irrespective of whether nodes defer from relaying deterministically or probabilistically. We use our model to quantify the vulnerability of the two relaying schemes to node selfishness but also drive remediation actions against it. © 2006 IEEE.","DTN; Performance evaluation; Selfish nodes","Computational power; Data transfer speed; Data-forwarding; Delay Tolerant Networks; Network node; Network resource; Performance evaluation; Relay schemes; Relaying schemes; Selfish node; Storage spaces; Trade off; Two-hop relaying; Data transfer; Relay control systems; Ad hoc networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449145700

Based on simulation results obtained with a detailed model of the two drive systems, it is shown that the distortions of the input/output currents caused by a single-fault in a matrix converter are approximately identical to the ones that appear in a back-to-back converter with two faults, one in the rectifier stage and the other one in the inverter stage. On the other hand, the back-to-back converter is perfectly capable of operating with an open-circuit fault provided that it is located in the rectifier stage, being the operation of the motor practically unaffected in that case. In general terms it can be said that due to the absence of an energy storage element, the matrix converter is particular sensitive to the appearance of faults. The back-to-back converter, on the other hand, is capable of maintaining a better quality of operation of the motor under faulty conditions, provided that the faults are not located in the inverter stage.","AC/AC converter; Adjustable speed drive; Matrix converter; Reliability","AC/AC converter; Adjustable speed drives; Back-to-back converter; Comparison study; Detailed models; Drive systems; Energy regeneration; Faulty condition; Induction motor drive; Input power; Input/output; Inverter stage; Matrix converter; Matrix converter drives; Motor torque; Number of switches; Open-circuit fault; Power switches; Rectifier stage; Simulation result; Waveform distortions; Electric drives; Electric rectifiers; Induction motors; Motors; Photolithography; Power converters; Power electronics; Simulators; Variable speed drives; Torque converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72949100828

Typically the measurement range (DC) can vary from 10 mA up to 1000 A. Today's available current transducers are not well adapted to work with good accuracy in this very large domain. In this paper a new measurement principle based on a technology of type ""fluxgate"" [1] is presented, which allows reaching a wide measurement range while guaranteeing an excellent accuracy. The key idea is to use the magnetic field created by the primary (battery) current acting on a saturable inductor. By measuring the intervals to reach inductor saturation and the load current and making use of a suitable microcontroller it is possible to accurately evaluate the value of the primary current for both high and low current levels.","Battery management systems (BMS); Component for measurements; Energy storage; Transducer","Battery management system; Battery management systems (BMS); Battery monitoring; Component for measurements; Current measurements; Current sensors; Current transducer; Fluxgates; Large domain; Load currents; Low currents; Measurement principle; Measurement range; Primary currents; Saturable inductors; Wide measurement; Electric current measurement; Energy storage; Flywheels; Magnetic fields; Management; Photolithography; Piezoelectric transducers; Power electronics; Monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72949097880

An accelerated storage test showed that dark color increased at a higher rate than oxidized flavor. Additionally, a survey among mothers who were giving HMRFs to their babies showed that mothers rarely tasted the product. Thus, the salient sensory attribute they would pay attention to when preparing their babies' bottles was color. If a portion was rejected by the babies, mothers attributed the rejection to stomach trouble and not to an inappropriate flavor. Thus, as a result of the color having increased at a higher rate than flavor changes and being the salient attribute that mothers would pay attention to, it was chosen as the critical shelf life descriptor. The sensory cutoff point was determined from the correlation between mothers' acceptability scores for samples with increasing color and the dark color of the same samples measured by a trained panel. A high correlation was obtained between dark color measurements from a trained panel and CIE-LAB values (L*, a* and b*). The cutoff point was used to determine shelf life based on sensory attributes of a commercial HMRF stored at 25, 37 and 45C, resulting in 150, 43 and 21 days, respectively.

The sustainability of such system is based exclusively on the solar energy input, as the renewable and pure energy resource and the use of hydro energy, due to the possibility of its continuous production of energy and its well-known flexibility in covering the consumers' needs. For the purpose of connecting all relevant values into one integral SHE system, a mathematical model was developed for selecting the optimal size of the PV power plant as the key element for estimating the technological feasibility of the overall solution. The model was tested on electric energy supply from the island of Vis in Croatia. The obtained power of the PV power plant was 41MWp, which corresponds to collector field of approximately 25 ha, while the estimated related storage was 20 hm3. The results show that the subject model describes the SHE very well and that the proposed concept of joint operation of PV and HE power plants is real and possible. The application of such sustainable SHE systems could significantly increase PV industry worldwide, i.e. the share of solar energy in energy balances of numerous countries.

It can be realized within the thermal column situated close to the reactor core. With its large diameter of 1 m, this channel allows to install a 15-cm-thick bismuth shielding, a graphite premoderator (300 dm3 at 20 K), and a superfluid helium converter (35 dm3). At a temperature of 1.2 K it is possible to remove the heat release power of about 20 W. Using 4π flux of cold neutrons within the reactor column can bring more than a factor 100 of cold neutron flux incident on the superfluid helium with respect to the present cold neutron beam conditions at the ILL reactor. The storage lifetime for UCN in superfluid He at 1.2 K is about 30 s, which is sufficient when feeding experiments requiring a similar filling time.

An absorption chiller and a thermal storage system are included as part of the cogeneration system configuration. The optimization uses a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization technique to size the system. The search for the minimum operational cost uses a NewtonRaphson and conjugate method with tangent estimates and forward derivatives. In certain cases, the approach uses dynamic programming principle to decide on the best feasible practical solution. The electrical and thermal outputs from the turbogenerator are modeled by taking into account partial loading. The annual facility load is represented by a week of hourly load. The optimization variables used are the one week of hourly electrical energy output from the turbogenerator and the optimum solution is determined by minimizing the total operational cost. The paper evaluates three case studies of different types of load characteristic (hospital, university campus, and paper mill) to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model.

The scheme utilizes two battery energy storage systems (BESSs) in which the generated wind power is used to charge one BESS, while the second BESS is used to discharge constant power into grid. The role of the two BESS interchanges when the discharging BESS reaches specified operating limit. With this scheme in mind and based on given wind speed statistics, charging characteristics of the BESS are studied, and a method to determine the expected charging time of the BESS to reach stipulated battery state of charge is developed. The expected BESS charging time, in turn, dictates the constant power level that can be dispatched to the grid through the discharging BESS. The corresponding discharge time is also determined using the developed method, the accuracy of which is validated experimentally. The proposed design procedure is then used to determine the minimum BESS capacity based on the expected wind power. Statistical likelihood of dispatchable power delivery achievable from the scheme is also obtained. © 2009 IEEE.","Battery energy storage systems (BESSs); Renewable energy; Statistical method; Wind power generation","Battery energy storage systems; Battery state of charge; Charging characteristics; Charging time; Constant power; Design procedure; Discharge time; Dispatchable wind power; Operating limit; Power delivery; Renewable energies; Renewable energy; Statistical approach; Wind power generating; Wind speed; Charging (batteries); Electric charge; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission; Energy storage; Flywheels; Hybrid integrated circuits; Lead acid batteries; Statistics; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70749145317

One of the renewable energy technologies aimed in this paper is the generation of electric-energy based on fuel-cell technology, where the input hydrogen (H 2) gas is supplied by electrolysis system powered by renewable energy system based on solar cell. In this paper, the authors explain the development of electrolysis system which is powered by solar cell array to supply hydrogen for fuel-cell system. The authors explain in detail how to design an efficient electrolysis system to obtain high ratio conversion of electric energy to hydrogen gas volume. It includes the explanation of the usage of multiple anodes with a single cathode for many solar cell inputs in a single electrolysis system. Hereinafter this is referred as multiple anode electrolysis system. This multiple anode electrolysis system makes the management of hydrogen gas becomes more efficient and effective by using only a single hydrogen gas storage system. This paper also explain the careful design of the resistance value of the electrolysis system to protect or avoid the solar cell panel to deliver excessive current to the electrolysis system which can cause damage on the solar cell panel. Moreover, the electrolyte volume detector is applied on the system as a tool to measure the electrolyte concentration to assure the system resistance is still in the allowed range. Further, the hydrogen gas produced by electrolysis system is stored into the gas storage which consists of silica-gel purifier, first stage low pressure gas bottle, vacuum pump, and second stage high pressure gas bottle. In the first step, the pump will vacuum the first bottle. The first bottle will collect the hydrogen from the electrolysis system through the silica gel to get rid of water vapor. When the first bottle pressure is close to atmospheric pressure, then the vacuum pump will evacuate the hydrogen gas from the first bottle to store into the second high pressure bottle. When the first bottle become vacuum then the procedure is repeated again. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.","Electrolysis; Electrolyte; Fuel-cell; Hydrogen storage; Renewable; Solar-cell",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70549091242

Exterior magnetic fields higher than the saturation field lead to an irremediable loss of the stored information because the antiferromagnetic state of the synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) structure becomes a ferromagnetic state and data stored in the magnetic memory cell are altered. At the saturation point, the two ferromagnetic-layer magnetizations became parallel oriented, in a direction close to that of the applied field. In this paper, we present a method to find an analytical formula for the magnetic saturation field that depends on the angle between the applied magnetic field related to the easy anisotropy axis, on the amplitude of the antiferromagnetic coupling field between the ferromagnetic layers, on the geometrical characteristics of the SAF structure, and on the second term of the series expansion of the anisotropy energy of the system. This method allows us to obtain an analytical formula for saturation field that depends only on the controllable parameters of the SAF structure. This analytically obtained critical saturation curve perfectly matches with the critical saturation curve reported in previous papers. © 2009 IEEE.","MRAM; SAF; Saturation curve; Saturation field; Toggle mode","Analytical formulas; Anisotropy axis; Anisotropy energies; Antiferromagnetic coupling; Antiferromagnetic state; Applied field; Applied magnetic fields; Controllable parameters; Critical saturation; Ferromagnetic layers; Ferromagnetic state; Geometrical characteristics; Magnetic memory cells; Magnetic random access memories; Magnetic saturation; Saturation curve; Saturation fields; Saturation point; Series expansion; Synthetic antiferromagnetic; Work region; Anisotropy; Antiferromagnetic materials; Antiferromagnetism; Bioinformatics; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Lanthanum compounds; Magnetic fields; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Random access storage; Saturation magnetization; Magnetic properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450273204

Combined analytical and simulation approach was applied to analyze energy conversion efficiency of different HEV topologies. Analytical approach is based on the energy balance equations and considers all energy paths in the HEVs from the energy sources to the wheels and to other energy sinks. Simulation approach is based on a fast forward-facing simulation model for simulating parallel and series HEVs as well as for conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, and considers all components relevant for modeling energy conversion phenomena. Combined approach enables evaluation of energy losses on different energy paths and provides their impact on the fuel economy. It therefore enables identification of most suitable HEV topology and of most suitable power ratios of the components for targeted vehicle application, since it reveals and quantifies the mechanisms that could lead to improved energy conversion efficiency of particular HEV. The paper exposes characteristics of the test cycles that lead to improved energy conversion efficiency of HEVs. Mechanisms leading to improved fuel economy of parallel HEVs through drive-away and vehicle propulsion at low powertrain loads by electric motor are also analyzed.

The focusing and box-type solar cookers are for outdoor applications. The advanced solar cookers have the advantage of being usable indoors and thus solve one of the problems, which impede the social acceptance of solar cookers. The advanced type solar cookers are employing additional solar units that increase the cost. Therefore, the solar cooker must contain a heat storage medium to store thermal energy for use during off-sunshine hours. The main aim of this study is to investigate the influence of the melting/solidification fast cycling of the commercial grade acetanilide C8H9NO (Tm = 116 °C) and magnesium chloride hexahydrate MgCl2·6H2O (Tm = 116.7 °C) on their thermo-physical properties; such as melting point and latent heat of fusion, to be used as storage media inside solar cookers. Five hundred cycles have been performed. The thermo-physical properties are measured using the differential scanning calorimetric technique. The compatibility of the selected phase change materials (PCMs) with the containing material is also studied via the surface investigation, using the SIM technique, of aluminum and stainless steel samples embedded in the PCM during cycling. It is inferred that acetanilide is a promising PCM for cooking indoors and during law intensity solar radiation periods with good compatibility with aluminum as a containing material. However, MgCl2·6H2O is not stable during its thermal cycling (even with the extra water principle) due to the phase segregation problem; therefore, it is not recommended as a storage material inside solar cookers for cooking indoors. It is also indicated that MgCl2·6H2O is not compatible with either aluminum or stainless steel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A good knowledge on dynamic characteristics and energy performance of buildings using PCMs is essential for building researchers and practitioners to better understand building temperature response characteristics and economic feasibility of using PCMs and take further proper actions to fully utilize PCMs to enhance indoor environmental quality and overall energy efficiency of buildings. This paper presents an overview of the previous research work on dynamic characteristics and energy performance of buildings due to the integration of PCMs. The research work on dynamic characteristics and energy performance of active and passive building applications is reviewed, respectively. Since the particular interest in using PCMs for free cooling and peak load shifting, the specific research efforts on both subjects are reviewed separately. A few useful conclusive remarks and recommendations for future work are presented. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, the changes produced by the compatibility between the filler and the matrix were analyzed by using more hydrophobic clays or incorporating PP grafted with maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA). Different models were used to predict the relative degree of crystallinity and several parameters were analyzed. A clear nucleating effect of clay nanoparticles was found on the experimental behavior (induction time, half-crystallization time, and overall crystallization time) and also deducted from the models parameters (Avrami exponent, rate constant, nucleation activity, activation energy). The effect was also related with the matrix/clay compatibility. In addition, the polarized light optical microscopy showed that the number of spherulites increased and their size decreased when clay was incorporated, which is also an indication of the heterogeneous nucleating behavior of such particles.

In this study, a high-pressure homogeniser and a standard radial diffuser homogeniser (Gaulin-type) were evaluated and compared in terms of their efficiency in model cream liqueur homogenisation and stabilization. Cream liqueurs with finely-dispersed droplets were produced on single-pass homogenisation using the high-pressure homogeniser. However, an increase in the homogenisation intensity above optimal conditions increased the mean fat droplet diameter. The standard radial diffuser homogeniser required multiple homogenisation passes to produce a stable cream liqueur. High-pressure homogenisation markedly increased cream liqueur temperature, due to pressure build-up and shear effects associated with conversion of kinetic energy into heat. Cream liqueurs with small mean fat droplet diameters, homogenised using the high-pressure homogeniser, displayed a slower rate of increase in droplet diameter and in viscosity during storage at 45 °C than those produced using a low pressure homogenisation process. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a novel Energy-Based System Well-being Analysis framework (EBSWBA) is presented to assess the reliability of systems containing renewable energy sources (RES), fossil-fueled sources and electricity storage. The framework combines the advantages of the well-known System Well-being Analysis (SWBA) and Expected Energy Not-Served (EENS) approaches, thus overcoming the weaknesses of the SWBA by considering all key factors that influence the system adequacy. Furthermore, two techniques are proposed for calculation of the EBSWBA indices: the Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) adopted for the EBSWBA framework, and the Contingency Enumeration for Small Isolated Power Systems (CESIPS) technique, which is derived from the Contingency Enumeration (CE) methodology. These techniques enable formation of probability distributions of the indices. The comparison of the results of classical SWBA and EBSWBA when applied to different SIPS architectures, operating schemes and load profiles demonstrates the superiority of EBSWBA over SWBA in terms of rendered information about the system state as well as in terms of computational efficiency, especially when the CESIPS technique is used for calculation of the EBSWBA indices. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An optimal ""sustainable island"" scheme should ensure 100% use of renewable energy resources for power generation, while hydrogen production is ideal for covering storage and transportation needs. Due to its morphology and scale, Karpathos applies perfectly for wind and solar energy systems, due to increased solar resource (about 1790 kWh/m2.year of global irradiation) and high wind potential (average of 9 m/s in specific locations).

After that, for several months, the DIS dosemeters were worn in parallel with the legal dosemeters (thermoluminescent badge) in a nuclear research centre and in several departments of a university hospital. The conclusions are that the DIS has good characteristics to be used as legal personal dosemeter, and that the comparison with the TLD badge is good. Only in interventional radiology and cardiology fields the DIS gives significant lower values than the TLD badge. © The Author 2009.

Chronic liver diseases may induce insulin resistance. The hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Insulin promotes the storage of energy in the fed state by stimulation of glycogen synthesis, lipogenesis, suppression of gluconeogenesis and VLDL formation. Epidemiological studies have shown that chronic hepatitis C induces insulin resistance. Insulin resistance in chronic hepatitis C is associated with progression of liver fibrosis, resistance to antiviral therapy and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we review the major findings from epidemiological studies from 1994 to the present which have resulted in our current knowledge of insulin resistance in chronic hepatitis C. We further summarise the preliminary pathogenetic models that explain the development of hepatitis C virus-induced insulin resistance.

Laser weapon is effective at long or short distances, owing to beam's unique characteristics such as narrow bandwidth, high brightness, coherent both in time and space, and it travels at the speed of light. Unlike kinetic weapon, laser weapon converts the energy stored in an electromagnetic laser beam into a large amount of heat aimed on a small area spot at the skin of the missile, usually close to the liquid fuel storage tank, warhead case or engine area, following by a temperature increase and finally-catastrophic failure by material ablation or melt.

This study was accomplished to compare the yearly trends of ET among three main vegetations in Thailand, a rain-fed paddy rice field, cassava plantation and teak plantation. Bowen Ratio Energy Balance (BREB) technique was applied in this study to measure the ET and heat flux between ground surface and atmosphere. Penman-Monteith (PM) equation, recommended by FAO, was used to calculate reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0). Measurements were carried out during 1999-2003 in the both paddy rice field and teak plantation and during 2002-2003 in the cassava plantation. The results indicated that the amount of daytime ET during the rainy season in the paddy rice field and cassava plantation varied between 1 and 7 mm and in the teak plantation between 2 and 6 mm. The averages amounts of daytime ET in the rainy season were about 4 mm in all sites, although, the variations of ET were different. In the dry season, day time ET of the cassava plantation was around 2.7 mm, slightly lower than those of other sites. During the growing season, ET/ET0 varied in the paddy rice field between 0.4 and 1.2 and in the cassava between 0.3 and 1.2. In the rainy season, LE/Rn ratios of the cassava plantation and paddy rice field were around 70%, while LE/Rn ratio in the teak plantation was found to be around 73%. Long-terms trends of ET and ET/ET0 were observed in the main vegetations of Thailand characterized by tropical monsoon climate.

Such solar cells have shown promise as they can be deposited on thin flexible foils that enable flexibility of integration within products while keeping the weight light. Several R&D efforts are underway in creating improved organic solar cells in terms of their efficiency and other performance metrics. One such is the FACESS project (""Flexible Autonomous Cost Efficient Energy Source and Storage""), funded under the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission. The main goal is to develop economically viable solar cells on large scale for mass production to achieve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 2.5% thus producing 250 mW under AM1.5 illumination. This requires selection, modification and up-scaling of suitable solar cell materials, effective patterning technologies, development of the printing processes and improved encapsulation technologies. This development will be done keeping all the time the application, the potential and the required performance in mind. The development and experimental results of roll-to-roll techniques such as wet chemical etching of an anode electrode, gravure printing of PEDOT:PSS and the P3HT:PCBM photoactive layer and gas barrier lamination of the printed modules will be presented in detail. The performance status for lab-scale printed solar cells is currently 2.4% of PCE under AM1.5 illumination.

A popular multiphase level set approach, the Chan-Vese model, was developed for this model by representing the phases by several overlapping level set functions. Recently, exactly the same model was also formulated by using binary level set functions. In both approaches, the gradient descent equations had to be solved numerically, a procedure which is slow and has the potential of getting stuck in a local minima. In this work, we develop an efficient and global minimization method for the binary level set representation of the multiphase Chan-Vese model based on graph cuts. If the average intensity values of the different phases are sufficiently evenly distributed, the discretized energy function becomes submodular. Otherwise, a novel method for minimizing nonsubmodular functions is proposed with particular emphasis on this energy function. © 2009 Springer.",,"Chan-Vese model; Energy functions; Global minimization; Gradient descent; Graph cut; Image segmentation model; Intensity values; Level set approach; Level set functions; Level set representation; Local minimums; Mumford Shah model; Novel methods; Submodular; Computer vision; Digital image storage; Level measurement; Optimization; Set theory; Image segmentation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449707280

The hybrid wind-hydro power plant uses the storage capacity of hydro power plant to store the wind energy in the form of hydro-energy of water when the wind exists but lacks the electric load. The Didactic Platform is to be placed in a building belonging to the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. A wind turbine will be placed on the top of the building, which place being favourable regarding the average wind speed. The wind energy will be converted in electric energy, which will be stored in an electric accumulator battery. This energy is similar with the energy stored in a superior water basin of a hydro-power plant. The hydropower plant will be further simulated by a hydro-turbine, operating in closed circuit with an electric pump and a lower water basin. From the accumulators the stored wind energy will be converted in water pressure by means of an inverter and an electric pump and further again in electric energy by means of hydro-generator. Such an arrangement is combined with measuring devices: anemometer, electric energy measurements devices, flow-rate and pressure water measuring devices, which allows evaluating the performances of the simulated hybrid wind-hydro power plant.

The R &amp; D trend in the lithium-ion battery development is toward the high power and energy density, cheaper in price and high safety standard. In our laboratory, the research and development of lithium-ion battery technology was mainly focus to develop high power density performance of cathode material, which is focusing to the Li-metal-oxide system, LiM02, where M = Co, Ni, Mn and its combination. The nano particle size material, which has irregular particle shape and high specific surface area was successfully synthesized by self propagating combustion technique. As a result the energy density and power density of the synthesized materials are significantly improved. In addition, we also developed variety of sizes of lithium-ion battery prototype, including (i) small size for electronic gadgets such as mobile phone and PDA applications, (ii) medium size for remote control toys and power tools applications and (iii) battery module for high power application such as electric bicycle and electric scooter applications.

It is important to use some error correction schemes in order to control the errors introduced and to reduce the number of automatic requests for retransmission. The sensor nodes are typically wireless nodes with limited storage and computational power. Thus the error control schemes should be energy efficient at sensor nodes level. Most of the reported works assume that both encoding and decoding are performed at every node. The idea of this paper is to perform encoding only at the first node and decoding will be done at the base station. We assume that the base station has enough power to run complex decoding algorithms. This paper provides a model for energy consumed and the probability of receiving a correct word for multi-hop WSN at base station when considering a number of coding schemes and hops. The emphasis is on using powerful codes with low complexity encoding. Several powerful codes like Reed-Solomon (RS), list decoded RS codes, multivariate interpolation decoded RS codes (MIDRS) and Hermitian codes are investigated for this scheme. All these codes have very simple encoding based on RS type encoders and we will show that this scheme consumes less power than reported schemes while maintaining a low probability of error. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Coding scheme; Computational power; Decoding algorithm; Encoding and decoding; Energy efficient; Error control; Error correcting scheme; Error-correction schemes; Hermitian codes; Limited storage; Low complexity encoding; Low probability; Multihop; Multivariate interpolation; Noisy channel; Reed-Solomon; Retransmissions; RS codes; Wireless nodes; Base stations; Computational efficiency; Decoding; Encoding (symbols); Energy efficiency; Error correction; Microelectronics; Rapid solidification; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449512212

One of the main problems in actual implementation is their inherently limited life-span, due to the (usually) not field-replaceable energy source. The energy consumption is due to the data and management communication, messages, sensing, processing (and storage) activities of the motes. The sensing may be local, e.g. temperature, radiation, humidity or similar physical measurement. There are a lot of applications, civilian or military alike, which implement some remote discovery, localization or tracking activities. In this case, the active sensing is performed mainly by emitting light, electromagnetic or sound waves. Obviously this imposes a heavy burden on the limited energy resources available to the mote, shortening his life and consequently the life of the WSN itself. Previously published sensing models use a circular coverage area around the motes, with fixed (unit-disk) or variable radius. Our work proposes a more energy-efficient sensing model, based on circular sectors with variable angles and radii, negotiated between the motes, as a function of their current energy capabilities. The performance of this model was checked vs. previously published schemes, using a proprietary simulation program, developed specifically for this purpose. The paper presents the results of simulations, showing significant energy savings. The obtained data confirm the viability and the advantages of this new sensing model. The possible implementation of such a WSN will significantly improve the energy-related performance of the WSN, allowing the development of new applications and improving the performance of existing ones. © 2009 IEEE.","Circular sector model; Energy efficiency; Sensing coverage; Wireless sensor networks","Active Sensing; Circular sector model; Coverage area; Current energy; Energy consumption; Energy efficient; Energy saving; Energy source; Life span; Limited energy resource; New applications; Physical measurement; Sensing coverage; Sensing model; Simulation program; Sound waves; Variable radius; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Military applications; Sensor networks; Simulators; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449468828

For that reason three types of intelligent systems for household applications are modeled: electric devices with a storage capacity like boilers, shiftable loads like washing machines and batteries. A district of 300 houses is simulated. Agents, representing devices can trade power on virtual markets, like the PowerMatcher. First, the relation between load flows and smart power is examined. We found, as a rule of thumb, that the variations in load flow decreases proportionally to the fraction smart controlled power. This might have important consequences for investment policies in power networks. Next, the stability of a cluster is examined. Here it is estimated how long a cluster can remain stable if a constant power flux is imposed. This flexibility can be traded, directly on an imbalance market or through a balance responsible party (BRP). In the next two business cases, the implications for retailers and end-users are examined for three billing types: a fixed tariff, a two tariff structure and an hourly 'real-time' tariff structure. Compared to the fixed tariff structure, the incentive to use smart devices is small in the double tariff structure. In a real-time tariff structure the income increases and the risk decreases for the retailer, while end-users have the potential to decrease costs.","Agent based control; Business cases; Distributed energy resources; Power grid simulations","Agent based control; Business case; Business cases; Constant power; Demand-side; Distributed energy resources; Electric devices; End-users; Household applications; Investment policies; Load flow; Power grid simulations; Power networks; Rule of thumb; Smart devices; Smart power; Storage capacity; Tariff structures; Virtual markets; Commerce; Electric loads; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Intelligent systems; Power generation; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Washers; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449413725

The proposals for the physical layer range from parallel transmission using a number of optical fibers or a number of wavelength channels within a single fiber to serial transmission over a single wavelength channel by exploiting advanced modulation formats and high-speed data processing. Since power consumption is becoming the main limiting factor in scaling current switches, routers and data centers to very high capacities, it would be of interest to see if the proposed 40 Gbit/s and 100 Gbit/s Ethernet physical-layer transport options could contribute to reduce the total power consumption of highperformance networking and storage systems. This communication addresses power efficiency of different realization options for optical 40 Gbit/s and 100 Gbit/s Ethernet by considering five different realizations of line cards, three of them comprising 100GbE ports and two other comprising 40GbE ports. The 100GbE options include parallel transmission over either 10 wavelength channels (10×10G) or 4 channels (4×25G) as it is expected to be defined in the 100GBASE- ER10 and 100GBASE-ER4 specifications of the future IEEE 802.3ba standard [1], respectively. For the implementation of serial transmission at 100 Gbit/s (1×100G) we consider single-polarization differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) format [2]. Similarly, 40GbE systems include both serial option (1×40G) that comprises electronic 1:4 muxes and demuxes and parallel transmission over 4 channels (4×10G), analogous to the drafts of the 40GBASE-LR4 and 40GBASE-LR specifications, respectively. We estimated total power consumption of those systems by using a model that includes all functional blocks needed to implement Ethernet line cards and switches as well as realistic data of power consumption obtained from components' specs, research papers, and documents of the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Task Force. Fig. 1 shows the energy efficiency of large switches when using the five options for the implementation of the physical layer. It is evident that switches equipped with 40GbE or 100GbE line cards are more energy efficient than those having only 10GbE ports. Here, a reduction in energy consumption of more than 2 nJ per bit and relative power savings of more than 20% can be achieved. The relative power savings decrease exponentially when increasing the aggregated switch capacity (C) and by using a fixed number of either 40GbE (P) or 100GbE (M) ports together with a large number of 10GbE ports (N). For large switch capacities of more than 20 Tbit/s, the power savings shrink to values below 3%.",,"100 GbE; 100 Gigabit Ethernet; 40-Gbit/s; Advanced modulation formats; Current switches; Data centers; Differential quadrature phase-shift keying; Energy efficient; Fixed numbers; Functional block; High capacity; High-performance networking; High-speed data; IEEE 802.3; Limiting factors; Line card; Optical ethernet; Parallel transmission; Physical layers; Power Consumption; Power efficiency; Power savings; Realistic data; Reduction in energy consumption; Research papers; Serial transmission; Single fiber; Single wavelength; Storage systems; Switch capacity; Task force; Total power consumption; Wavelength channels; Broadband networks; Data processing; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Ethernet; Fiber optic networks; Light transmission; Optical communication; Optical fibers; Optical materials; Quadrature phase shift keying; Research; Specifications; Spinning (fibers); Switches; Transparent optical networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449387232

To conduct meaningful analyses so that decisions may be taken in the procedures of planning, design, economics and technology, appropriate models must be derived for both loads and energy sources. The most difficult and the most important aspect in this type of modeling is the inclusion of uncertainty. In a practical hybrid solar/wind power system (HSWPS) uncertainty not only exists in the energy sources and loads but also in the manner in which the system is managed, operated and accepted by the customers. Issues relating to the second group of uncertainties have been addressed in [1]. This paper, however, focuses on the problem of including uncertainty in analyzing the adequacy of an autonomous solar/wind installation to meet the expected load demand of a typical South African, rural community. Several authors have contributed to understanding and modeling the uncertainty associated with wind and solar power sources. Karaki [2] describes the uncertainty in the availability of solar irradiance with the use of the beta probability distribution function (pdf) and that of the wind resource using the Weibull pdf. A discretized approach is then used to evaluate the renewable energy source in time segments. Tina et al [3] uses a closed form solution to improve the approach. In South Africa extensive load measurements and research have produced load models for various classes of customer. The Beta pdf is most appropriate for electrification design for small groups of customers. In this paper we explore an approach to answering the question: 'How many customers of a given statistical type can be adequately supplied from an autonomous HSWPS in South Africa?' For this purpose a general model of a power system with renewable energy is proposed. Simulations are performed to match the variable outputs of the combined wind and solar renewable energy sources with the uncertainty in the expected loads, as derived from South African load research data, and with various sizes of storage battery. The results are affected by the choice of the load model and the confidence level of the simulation. © CIGRE2009.","Load modeling; Probabilistic methods; Renewable sources; Rural electrification; System sizing","Load modeling; Probabilistic methods; Renewable sources; Rural electrification; System sizing; Customer satisfaction; Distribution functions; Electric batteries; Electric load management; Electric loads; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Natural resources; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Probability density function; Rural areas; Sales; Simulators; Uncertainty analysis; Weibull distribution; Wind power; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449375289

Based on several wind measurements in Finland, the amount of wind power variation was calculated for a scenario with 2000 MW wind power in Finland. Additionally, an estimate of the reserves needed for wind power and an analysis of the regulating power market (balancing market) in Finland was made. Hydro power and gas turbines can be regulated by at least 40 % of the maximum capacity in one minute. Condensing power plants fuelled by coal (or peat) can be regulated by 5 % (or 3 %) of their capacity in one minute. The power regulation characteristics in Combined Heat and Power plants (CHP) vary from one plant to another. Therefore no general figures can be given. However, CHP can have possibility for high regulation capacity if heat storage are provided. The one minute power regulation for pressurized water nuclear reactors can be from 1 to 3 % of the capacity. Based on these figures and on the installed Finnish electricity production capacity, there is 2100-2200 MW (hydro power and gas turbines) of power reserve capacity in Finland. The maximum power variation in wind power production from hour to hour has been 16 % and the corresponding standard deviation is 2.7 % of the installed capacity, from three years of measured power production data in Finland. Based on these measurements a scenario with 2000 MW wind power in Finland was made. In this scenario the maximum hourly production variation would be 20 % and the standard deviation 3.4 %. This study also examines the changes in Finland's regulating power market in aggregated regulation bids, volume of regulating power and regulating power price. Both regulation bids and volume of regulating power vary in time. In recent years there have been an increased number of peaks in the regulating power price. If the wind power capacity (2000 MW) would be geographically distributed, it would unlikely have an impact on the amount of the disturbance reserves. The influence on the needs of the frequency controlled normal operation reserve can not be specified with the current (hourly) wind power measurements in Finland. Also sufficient slow reserve capacity and working order must be ensured when the wind power production increases. Adding wind power to the power system will clearly be seen in the regulating power market. The current capacity available to the Finnish regulating power market can be insufficient at times when changes in the power production increase. © CIGRE2009.","Power regulation; Power variation; Reserve; Wind power","Balancing market; Combined heat and power plants; Condensing power plant; Current capacity; Electricity production; Finland; Finnish; Hydro power; Installed capacity; Maximum power; Normal operations; Power production; Power regulation; Power reserves; Power systems; Power variation; Pressurized water; Production variations; Regulating power; Regulation capacity; Reserve; Reserve capacity; Short term; Standard deviation; Wind measurement; Wind power capacity; Wind power production; Commerce; Electric power transmission; Energy policy; Gas turbines; Heat storage; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Nuclear propulsion; Nuclear reactors; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Power plants; Statistics; Turbomachinery; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449368530

Storage facilities are typically very large underground salt caverns or depleted gas reservoirs that have undergone an expensive conversion process. Storage is extremely important because of the strong seasonality in natural gas prices due to demand patterns. We study the effects of competition when firms share space and injection/withdrawal resources and behave in a rational, self-interested manner to optimize utilization (typically using software systems to assist in decision support). Strategic interaction occurs between firms because injectability and deliverability depend on the total inventory stored. We analyze the interaction that occurs in a pre-commitment game where firms commit to inject until a certain time and subsequently withdraw the commodity until it is exhausted. We compute equilibrium and welfare maximizing outcomes and calculate losses in efficiency. We also study the effects of incorporating a ""use-it-or-lose-it"" policy on overall welfare. Our results indicate that significant inefficiencies can occur in both settings and, therefore, have significant implications for the regulatory systems for storage facilities, price stability in the gas markets and the operational policies for storage companies. © 2009 IEEE.","Decision optimization; Energy system modelling; Equilibrium analysis; Game theory; Software trading agents","Conversion process; Critical component; Decision optimization; Decision supports; Deliverability; Demand pattern; Depleted gas reservoir; Energy networks; Energy system modelling; Equilibrium analysis; Gas market; Gas storage; Industrialized nations; Injectability; Natural gas price; Natural gas storage; Operational policy; Price stability; Regulatory systems; Seasonality; Software systems; Software trading agents; Storage facilities; Strategic interactions; Underground salt caverns; Commerce; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Game theory; Gas industry; Natural gas; Optimization; Software agents; Underground gas storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71049176621

The results of leaching studies at 30 °C with cement solids simulating the composition of real radioactive wastes, containing NaNO3, small amounts of inactive CsNO3 and traces of 137Cs+ are also reported. Concentration profiles of Cs+ in inactive specimens showed that part of the Cs+ (20-30%) tends to be immobilized in the matrix, while elution of the readily leachable portion follows Fick's law reasonably well. No immobilized Cs+ was detected in the samples containing considerable amounts of NaNO3. Long-term leaching experiments (up to 8 years) revealed acceleration of the elution process (not detectable in short-term tests), attributable to increase in porosity caused by erosion of the cement matrix. Sorption experiments of Cs+ ions by cement granules indicated that adsorption on cement pore surfaces is not significant. On the other hand, the leaching tests at two different temperatures or with intermediate changes in temperature between 30 °C and 70 °C, yielded activation energies that indicated a more complicated kinetic behavior. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This pioneering work is to elaborate the importance of polymer rheology on hollow fiber formation and reveal the integrated science bridging polymer fundamentals such as polymer cluster size, shear and elongational viscosities, molecular orientation, stress relaxation to membrane microstructure and separation performance for gas separation. Torlon® poly(amide imide) was employed in this study with various solvent/nonsolvent additives. The effects of additives on polymeric cluster size, hydrogen bonding and dope rheology during the phase inversion have been examined. It is found that hydrogen bonding and strain-hardening characteristics play very important roles in dope rheology and membrane separation performance. Torlon® possesses strong hydrogen bonds with NMP/water mixtures, the addition of a small amount of water enlarges polymer cluster size, strengthen molecular network (i.e., strain hardening) and facilitate macrovoid-free morphology. However, strong hydrogen bonding may retard chain unfolding during spinning, induce faster relaxation for highly oriented dense-selective skin, and thus reduce gas-pair selectivity. By adjusting dope chemistry and spinning conditions with balanced solubility parameters and dope rheology, we have developed defect-free Torlon® hollow fiber membranes with an O2/N2 selectivity of 8.55 and an ultra-thin layer of 488 Å simply using water as the additive. Fibers spun from dopes containing other additives have the optimal O2/N2 selectivity varying from 7.69 to 9.97 at 25 ± 2 °C, and the dense layer thickness varying from 500 Å to 2000 Å. Their corresponding mixed-gas O2/N2 selectivity for compressed air varies from 7.12 to 9.00. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Multiple relaxation processes were observed. Besides the primary α-relaxation, two secondary relaxations β and γ (labelled in order of decreasing time scale) have been reported. Well-separated β-process observed above and below glass transition temperature Tg, has activation energy Eβ = 81.8 kJ/mol and was identified as intermolecular Johari-Goldstein (JG) process. The γ-relaxation visible in dielectric loss spectra at very low temperatures is most likely non-JG relaxation. The temperature dependence of the relaxation times of α-process, measured over 11 orders of magnitude, cannot be described by a single Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman-Hesse (VFTH) equation. At temperature TB = 475.8 K the change in relaxation dynamics occurred, consequently a new set of VFTH parameters was required. From low temperature VFTH fits the glass transition temperature Tg was estimated as Tg = 400.3 K and fragility index m = 87 was calculated. Of particular interest was the time scale of molecular motion below the glass transition temperature.

With this model, the weight quantities of some metal oxide nanopowders were calculated, and their hydrogen absorption and desorption catalytic activities were compared. The commercial MgH2 powder was mixed with the nanoparticles of different metal oxides (Cr2O3, TiO2, Fe3O4, Fe2O3, In2O3, ZnO) and subsequently ball milled for 20 h in an inert atmosphere. The hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics were evaluated using a volumetric Sievert's apparatus and characterized at 325 °C or 300 °C under 1 bar and 10 bar of hydrogen pressure during desorption and absorption, respectively. In both the absorption and desorption reactions, the superior catalytic effect of Cr2O3 and TiO2 was observed.

The main motivation for using ZnO as a dielectric is due to its optical transparency and mechanical flexibility. We have established the relationship between the electrical resistivity (ρ) and the activation energy (Ea) of the electron transport in the conduction band of the ZnO film. The ρ of 2 × 104-5 × 107 Ω-cm corresponds to Ea of 0.36-0.76 eV, respectively. The k-value and optical band-gap for films sputtered with Ar:O2 ratio of 4:1 are 53 ± 3.6 and 3.23 eV, respectively. In this paper, the basic charge storage element for a non-volatile memory is a triple layer dielectric structure in which a 50 nm thick ZnO film is sandwiched between two layers of methyl silsesquioxane sol-gel dielectric of varying thickness. A pronounced clockwise capacitance-voltage (C-V) hysteresis was observed with a memory window of 6 V. The integration with a solution-processable pentacene, 13,6-N-Sulfinylacetamodipentacene resulted in an optically transparent organic field effect transistor non-volatile memory (OFET-NVM). We have demonstrated that this OFET-NVM can be electrically programmed and erased at low voltage (± 10 V) with a threshold voltage shift of 4.0 V. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents the results and conclusions from the design, and experimental performance evaluation of high capacity thermal energy storage using so-called phase change materials (PCMs) as the storage media. A 140 l 15 kW h storage prototype was designed, built, and experimentally evaluated. The storage tank was directly filled with the PCM having its phase change temperature at 58°C.A tube heat exchanger for charging and discharging with water was submerged in the PCM. Results from the experimental evaluation showed that hot water can be provided with a temperature of 40°C for more than 2 h at an average power of 3 kW. The experimental results also show that it is possible to charge the 140 l storage with close to the theoretically calculated value of 15 kW h. Hence, this is a PCM storage solution with a storage capacity of over 100 kW h/m3, and an average power capacity during discharging of over 20 kW/m3. However, it is desirable to increase the heat transfer rate within the prototype. A predesign of using a finned-tube coil instead of an unfinned coil show that by using finned tube, the power capacity for discharging can be at least doubled, if not tripled.

Syngas can be used either for power generation or processed to obtain various chemicals (hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, etc.). This article evaluates the possibilities of solid fuel decarbonisation by capturing carbon dioxide resulted form thermo-chemical conversion of solid fuel using gasification. Evaluation is focused on power generation technology using syngas produced by solid fuel gasification (so-called integrated gasification combined cycle - IGCC). Case studies analysed in the article are using a mixture of coal and biomass (sawdust) to produce around 400 MW electricity simultaneously with capturing about 90% of the feedstock carbon. Various carbon dioxide capture options (post-and pre-combustion) are compared with situation of no carbon capture in terms of plant configurations, energy penalty, CO2 emissions, etc. Plant options are modelled using ChemCAD, and simulation results are used to assess the plant performances.

At birth the transplacental transfer of substrates is terminated. Before the start of breastfeeding the newborn infant must produce its own glucose particularly for the need of the central nervous system. Neonatal hypoglycaemia commonly occurs in risk groups such as immature and low birth weight infants, infants of mothers with diabetes and infants born large for gestational age. Our data show that extremely immature infants can also produce their own glucose during the first day of postnatal life. Although their stores of depot fat are limited, they also have a capacity for lipolysis. Infants of diabetic mothers have unimpaired lipolysis in spite of hyperinsulinaemia. This may represent a mechanism to compensate for the reduced rate of glucose production in these infants. The number of infants born large for gestational age is increasing in several countries partly consequent to increases in maternal weight. We have shown that foetal weight depends on maternal glucose production, which in turn is related to parameters associated with maternal fat mass. Like infants born small for gestational age, those born large for gestational age are at risk for metabolic disease later in life. Owing to a high fat mass these infants have a high rate of lipolysis, which can be one reason underlying the reduced insulin sensitivity seen already during the first day of life.","Gluconeogenesis; Glucose; Glycerol; Lipolysis; Newborn infant; Preterm; Stable isotope","glucose; theophylline; aerobic metabolism; apnea; body fat; body weight; breast feeding; cardiovascular disease; central nervous system; drug effect; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; fetus weight; gluconeogenesis; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; human; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; hypoglycemia; immaturity; infant nutrition; insulin sensitivity; intrauterine growth retardation; large for gestational age; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipolysis; low birth weight; maternal diabetes mellitus; maternal nutrition; metabolic disorder; metabolic rate; newborn; nutritional health; obesity; perinatal period; placental transfer; prematurity; review; small for date infant; symptom; Energy Metabolism; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Gluconeogenesis; Glucose; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Lipolysis; Models, Biological; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Diabetics; Theophylline",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72449128150

Known results are re-obtained in much a more direct manner and new ones are derived. The approach consists of representing the charge disturbances by a displacement field in the positions of the moving particles (electrons). The dielectric response and the electron energy loss are computed. The surface contribution to the energy loss exhibits an oscillatory behaviour in the transient regime near the surfaces. The propagation of an electromagnetic wave in these plasmas is treated by using the retarded electromagnetic potentials. The resulting integral equations are solved and the reflected and refracted waves are computed, as well as the reflection coefficient. For the slab we compute also the transmitted wave and the transmission coefficient. Generalized Fresnel's relations are thereby obtained for any incidence angle and polarization. Bulk and surface plasmon-polariton modes are identified. As it is well known, the field inside the plasma is either damped (evanescent) or propagating (transparency regime), and the reflection coefficient for a semi-infinite plasma exhibits an abrupt enhancement on passing from the propagating regime to the damped one (total reflection). Similarly, apart from characteristic oscillations, the reflection and transmission coefficients for a plasma slab exhibit an appreciable enhancement in the damped regime. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

With increasing integration of distributed photovoltaics (PV) in low-voltage distribution grids of residential areas, limits to the penetration level are set by voltage rise due to unmatched production and load. In this paper a methodology for determining the impacts of three options for increased load matching is presented and applied to high-latitude data. The studied options are PV array orientation, demand side management (DSM) and electricity storage. Detailed models for domestic electricity demand and PV output are used. An optimisation approach is applied to find an optimal distribution of PV systems on different array orientations and a best-case evaluation of DSM and a storage model are implemented. At high penetration levels, storage is the most efficient option for maximising the solar fraction, but at lower overproduction levels, the impact of DSM is equal or slightly better. An east-west orientation of PV arrays is suggested for high penetration levels, but the effect of the optimised orientation is small. Without an optimised storage operation, the overproduced power is more efficiently reduced by DSM than storage, although this is highly dependent on the applied DSM algorithm. Further research should be focused on the DSM potential and optimal operation of storage. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The highest value of average reflectance y (%) was found for barley bread (immediately after preparation), so that can be said that this sample was ""conditionally"" the lightest. The lowest values of y (%) were found for diet bread, so that it can be considered as the ""conditionally"" the darkest product. Colors of all investigated bread samples were lighter after three days of keeping compared to day 0. Changes of average reflectance of bread samples packed in polyethylene packaging with keeping time can be described by linear equation (correlation coefficient 0.99).

Optimization is first conducted in obtaining proper cable profiles when the rotary actuator swings across the disk using classical elastica theory with consideration of compliant boundary at its J-block conjunction point with rotary actuator and fixed boundary conditions at bracket. In addition to modal kinetic coupling factor, the cable's vibration modes are projected onto actuator voice coil's excitations to form as a weighted response factor to serve as the cost function in optimization process. It was found through the proposed process that the seek-settling flexible cable vibration can be minimized and even reduced to zero. An additional servo adaptive control format will be also discussed in this paper to totally eliminate the flexible ribbon vibrations in a disk drive's seek-settling operations. © 2009 IEEE.","Flexible cable; High TPI hard disk drives (HDD); Mechatronics; Settling position error signals (PES)","Adaptive Control; Compliant boundaries; Computer disk drives; Design Methodology; Disk drive; Elastica theory; Fixed boundaries; Flexible cable; Hard Disk Drive; High capacity; High TPI hard disk drives (HDD); Induced vibrations; Mechatronic integration; Modal kinetics; Optimization process; Response factor; Ribbon cable; Rotary actuator; Settling position error signals (PES); Vibration modes; Voice coil; Actuators; Cables; Disks (structural components); Drives; Electrostatic actuators; Mechatronics; Optimization; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Hard disk storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449378387

The aim of this design is minimization of annualized cost of the hybrid system over its 20 years of operation. Optimization problem is subject to reliable supply of the demand. Three major components of the system, i.e. wind turbine generators, photovoltaic arrays, and DC/AC converter, may be subject to failure. Also, solar radiation, wind speed, and load data are assumed entirely deterministic. System costs involve investments, replacement, and operation and maintenance as well as loss of load costs. Prices are all empirical and components are commercially available. An advanced variation of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. Results reveal the impact of component outages on the reliability and cost of the system, so they are directly dependent on components' reliabilities, i.e. outages result in need for a larger generating system for supplying the load with the acceptable reliability. Additionally, it is observed that the inverter's reliability is an upper limit for the system's reliability.

However, the level of microbial load in the raw vegetable can cause food poisoning and shorten its shelf-life of asparagus. The objectives of this work were to determine the effect of chlorinated and ozonated water in the washing process to reduce the microbial load on fresh green asparagus and the effect of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on asparagus quality. Washing at 10 °C for 15 min with chlorinated water (100 mg/L free Cl2) reduced aerobic plate count which had higher efficiency on microbial reduction than the use of ozonated water (0.1 mg/L O3). No significant differences on the amount of Escherichia coli contamination among washing methods were found. Asparagus in modified atmosphere packaging retarded the deterioration process. Changes in hue angle followed a first-order kinetic reaction. Temperature dependence of the kinetic rate constant during storage time of asparagus obeyed the Arrhenius relationship with an activation energy (Ea) 29.33 ± 4.60 kJ/mol. The shelf-life prediction equation was related well with real practice.

A primary spillover model was used, consisting of a Pt4 cluster, a graphite substrate model, and O and OH functional groups adsorbed on graphite. The spillover mechanism was found to proceed via the migration of dissociated hydrogen atoms from the Pt cluster to epoxide groups adjacent to the cluster (to form OH), followed by H migration by hopping on the adsorbed O atoms. The low energy barriers required for the relevant elementary steps indicate that the spillover process is facile when the carbon substrate is decorated with oxygen functionalities, leading to enhanced hydrogen uptake and faster charge/discharge kinetics. However, a reaction path was also identified, in which surface OH groups can react to form water, which can have adverse consequences for hydrogen storage on oxygenated carbons via spillover. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon substrates; Charge/discharge; DFT modeling; DFT study; Elementary steps; Epoxide groups; Graphite oxide; Graphite substrate; H migration; Hydrogen atoms; Hydrogen uptake; Low energies; Modified carbon; Oxygen surface groups; Pt clusters; Reaction paths; Spillover mechanisms; Surface OH group; Atoms; Functional groups; Graphite; Hydrogen; Oxygen; Platinum; Platinum compounds; Probability density function; Hydrogen storage; carbon; epoxide; graphite; hydrogen; hydroxyl group; oxygen; water; article; chemical analysis; chemical bond; chemical structure; density functional theory; diffusion; kinetics; synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350329261

These measuring activities are such tasks whose execution is too complex, too time-consuming or too dangerous for humans. In civil life the intelligent sensor network technology is used for controlling the heating and electrical networks of buildings, and the management of production processes or production phases at a plant, while in the military sector they are used for military intelligence tasks in operation areas or within buildings. The various usages of such systems set up distinctive requirements against the structure and building blocks of such networks as well as against the connections realizing the network. The devices must sense and measure the different environmental and other features, the short-time storage of the measured data and their forwarding to the data-analyzing system. One of the fundamental application questions is which features can be sensed and measured by a device; furthermore, how accurately and fast these sensor networks can execute the tasks. Due to security and encryption reasons, primarily in military use, further significant questions are the communication protocols, like the energy support. In case of military intelligence tasks, the method of placement and location, as well as the related location of the devices are of special importance.

Operation of the refineries as a fully integrated complex will lower total crude capacity to about 125,000 bpd, according to Holly Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Matt Clifton. Holly will pay $54.5 million in cash and $74 million in common stock for the refinery and about 2.3 million bbl of storage. It also will purchase the refinery's inventory of about 500,000 bbl at market value at the time of closing. Holly will agree at closing to provide as much as 50,000 bpd of gasoline and diesel fuel to Sinclair's Midwest marketing network. Holly Energy Partners, a midstream master limited partnership of which Holly Corp owns 41%, will buy an additional 1.4 million of storage at Sinclair's Tulsa refinery as well as various loading racks and related facilities. Holly expects to enter into a long-term agreement with the partnership for storage, loading, and delivery services. Holly also expects to invest $16 million to finish emission-reduction projects in progress. Integration will allow Holly to charge gas oil from its existing Tulsa refinery to the FCC unit at the refinery it is buying from Sinclair to produce gasoline and diesel. The company will use a desulfurizer at the Sinclair refinery for diesel from its existing refinery. Holly expects about 50% the diesel from the combined facility to meet ultra-low-sulfur standards.

In other words, monthly network demand (peak hours multiplied in install capacity) will be fully produced if the water level of reservoir in that month is between Minimum Operating Level (MOL) and Normal Water Level (NWL). If it is located under MOL or above NWL, the water level will be fixed on MOL or NWL and energy production will be lowered or increased, respectively. In order to take into account different monthly values of energy, implementing of an operating policy and rule curve is indispensable. The main goal of this study is to derive a set of monthly target storage elevation as a rule curve to operate the powerplant of Seymareh reservoir in West-South of Iran. The main simulation model of Seymareh reservoir and powerplant is developed in Vensim Environment using System Dynamics (SD) approach. In this process, all the technical and practical details of this reservoir are taken into account. Relations between discharge and turbine efficiency and tail water, volume-area-elevation relations, reservoir evaporation, overload coefficient and maximum and minimum allowable head and turbine discharge are some of these details. Energy production will be occurred if the water elevation of a particular month of reservoir is located above the defined target elevation of that month.

An array of ultracapacitor cells in series coupled to a load in parallel with storage battery creates a hybrid power source with higher power and energy density than either device in a standalone configuration. While ultracapacitors store a large amount of charge, they are still well below the energy density of storage batteries. Ultracapacitors have a maximum cell voltage of 2.7 voltages, so they must be connected in series to reach the required working voltage. The use of an ultracapacitor in combination with a battery is an excellent way to increase the overall power density of the power source and decrease the strain on the battery.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450003698

The model is a state-machine based behavioral language with support for hierarchical modeling, resource annotations, continuous time, and notions of explicit entry and exit points that make it suitable for component-based modeling of embedded systems. The analysis of REMES-based systems is centered around a weighted sum in which the variables represent the amounts of consumed resources. We describe a number of important resource related analysis problems, including feasibility, trade-off, and optimal resource-utilization analysis. To formalize these problems and provide a basis for rigorous analysis, we show how to analyze REMES models using the framework of priced timed automata and weighted CTL. To illustrate the approach, we describe a case study in which it has been applied to model and analyze resourceusage of a temperature control system. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Analysis problems; Behavioral languages; Component-based modeling; Continuous time; Entry and exit; Formal modeling; Hierarchical modeling; Resource model; Rigorous analysis; State-machine; Timed Automata; Weighted Sum; Continuous time systems; Embedded systems; Hierarchical systems; Mathematical models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350061958

The national and the overall waste management objective is to ensure that all PFP wastes are managed appropriately by capitalising on processes that minimise, reduce, recover and recycle without exposing employees, the public and the environment to unmitigated impacts. Both International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) principles act as a guide in the development of the strategy in order to ensure international best practice, legal compliance and ensuring that the impact of waste on employees, environment and the public is as low as reasonably achievable.

Decay heat removal by passive means must be guaranteed, taking into account the fact that dry storage vessels are under ground and inside the building footprint. Cooling takes place when ambient air (drawn downwards from ground level) passes on the outside of the 6 tanks' vessel containment (and gamma shielding), which is in a separate room inside the building, but outside PBMR building confinement and open to atmosphere. Access for loading/unloading of SF pebbles is only from the top of a tank, which is inside PBMR building confinement. No radioactive substances can therefore leak into atmosphere, as vessel design will take into account corrosion allowance. In this paper, it is shown (using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) modelling and analytical analyses) that natural convection and draught induced flow combine to remove decay heat in a self-sustaining process. Decay heat is the energy source, which powers the draught inducing capability of the dry storage modular cell system: the more decay heat, the bigger the drive to expel heated air through a higher outlet and entrain cool ambient air from ground level to the bottom of the modular cell. © 2008 by ASME.",,"Ambient air; Analytical analysis; Building footprint; CFD (computational fluid dynamics); Decay heat; Decay heat removal; Dry storage; Energy source; Gamma shielding; Ground level; Heat removal; Heated air; Modular cells; Radioactive substances; Vessel design; Wet storage; Cell membranes; Computational fluid dynamics; Decay (organic); High temperature reactors; Radiation protection; Reactor shielding; Spent fuels; Tanks (containers); Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349911512

However, the functional charging rates and the cycling stabilities have so far been found to be Insufficient for practical applications. These shortcomings can, at least partially, be explained by the fact that thick layers of the conducting polymers have been used to obtain sufficient capacities of the batteries. In the present letter, we introduce a novel nanostructured high-surface area electrode material for energy storage applications composed of cellulose fibers of algal origin Individually coated with a 50 nm thin layer of polypyrrole. Our results show the hitherto highest reported charge capacities and charging rates for an all polymer paper-based battery. The composite conductive paper material is shown to have a specific surface area of 80 m2 g 1 and batteries based on this material can be charged with currents as high as 600 mA cm 2 with only 6% loss in capacity over 100 subsequent charge and discharge cycles.

Numerical data of an average single family house has been taken as case study. The predictive optimal controller uses mixed-integer and linear programming where energy conversion and energy services models are defined as a set of linear constraints. Integer variables model the start-up and shut-down operations as well as the load dependent efficiency of the cogeneration unit. The proposed control system has been validated using more complex building and technology models to asses model inaccuracies. Typical demand profiles for stochastic factors have been used.

The analysis utilizes the outputs of some general circulation models runs under different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions (A2 and B2). The IPCC has produced diverse scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions, reported in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SPES) (IPCC, 2001). Statistical downscaling models (SDSM) are used that allow the observation of climate change at local level; the Water Evaluation and Planning System (WEAP), an integrated approach to simulate water systems and orient management policies, is applied as well as certain mathematical analyses and statistical methods. Thus, the study visualizes and analyzes the incidence of potential climate change on the hydroelectric sector, inding the degree of vulnerability for this or any other sector that relies on water as a source, and offers tools, strategies and criteria for the planning and orientation of projections in the different productive sectors. The results predict increases in maximum, mean and minimum temperatures, for example, the maximum temperature before the end of the century could rise from 1.3° to 2.5°C in scenario A2 and from 0.9° to 1.7°C in B2; an increase in precipitation is estimated up to approximately 30.4% in A2 and 27.9% in B2. The number of extreme events forecast is found over previously determined thresholds; an estimation is made of the water balance and the relation of the above variables to the Sinú River inlow to the Urrá 1 dam and the generation of hydroelectric energy. Changes in the generation of hydroelectric energy vary from 0.6 to -35.2% for the period 2010 to 2039, reduction in the Sinú River inlow to the dam in a range of -2.3 to -34.9% and a drop in the stored volume in the dam of -0.9 to -29.4 percent in relation to the maximum storage capacity (MSC), according to the analyzed scenario.","Downscaling models; General circulation models; Hydroelectric sector; Hydrological resources; Watershed","climate change; downscaling; general circulation model; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric power; power generation; vulnerability; water resource; watershed; Colombia; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349743849

To evaluate the set-associative cache, SIMPLESCALAR tool and CACTI analytical model are used. The experimental results show that as the feature size decreases and the associativity increases, the energy saving of the proposed cache increases. The experimental results express that for an 8-way setassociative cache in 32nm, about 7% area and 2%-17% energy consumption are saved.

Recently, new approaches have been proposed that rely on the reversible formation of either Li2O or Li2O2 at the electrodes. The details of their formation and dissolution are, however, still unclear. As a first step towards the understanding of these processes, bulk lithium oxides, their surfaces and their nanoparticles have been here investigated by density functional theory and abinitio thermodynamics. At a pressure of 1 atmosphere of oxygen, Li2O2 is the stable bulk phase below 5K, where a transition to Li2O takes place. Wulff's construction predicts an octahedral shape for Li2O nanoparticles and the form of a hexagonal prism for Li2O2. By taking into account the effect of the surfaces, a size-dependent phase diagram is calculated. At an oxygen pressure of 1atmosphere and a temperature of 300K, Li2O is the stable phase for particles with a diameter larger than ∼2.5nm. This size-dependent oxidation behavior of lithium should be taken into account in the design of nanostructured oxygen cathodes. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ab initio; Bulk phase; Bulk phasis; Hexagonal prism; Lithium oxides; Lithium-ion battery; Nano-structured; New approaches; New material; Oxidation behaviors; Oxygen cathodes; Oxygen pressure; Research efforts; Reversible formation; Size-dependent phase diagram; Stable phase; Density functional theory; Dissolution; Electrodes; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Nanoparticles; Oxygen; Phase diagrams; Thermodynamics; Lithium; chemical compound; lithium; lithium ion; lithium oxide; lithium peroxide; nanomaterial; nanoparticle; oxygen; unclassified drug; ab initio calculation; article; atmosphere; atmospheric pressure; density functional theory; dissolution; electric battery; electrode; oxidation; oxygen electrode; particle size; phonon; priority journal; prism; stoichiometry; surface property; technique; temperature; thermodynamics; Wulff construction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349669220

Low average milk fat, SNF and lactose content were determined in both breeds with no significant differences between breeds regarding the milk yield and milk composition. The significantly higher somatic cell count (SCC) was detected in Saanen goats. The SOD activity and TBARS concentration were significantly higher 14 h after the collection and cold storage in both breeds of dairy goats with no difference between the breeds. In the Alpine goats the TBARS concentration was negatively correlated with urea concentration, and in the milk of the Saanen goats the TBARS was positively correlated with proteins and SCC. The higher SCC in the Saanen goats may have caused higher production of secondary oxidative products catalysed by the enzyme superoxide dismutase from polymorphonuclear granulocytes present in the udder, or by some other enzymes that participate in oxidation of the milk constituents.

The biogenesis and function of mitochondria, the energy-generating organelles in eukaryotic cells, are primary longevity determinants. Genetic or pharmacological manipulations of mitochondrial activity profoundly affect the lifespan of diverse organisms. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism during ageing are poorly understood. Prohibitins are ubiquitous, evolutionarily conserved proteins, which form a ring-like, high-molecular-mass complex at the inner membrane of mitochondria. Here, we show that the mitochondrial prohibitin complex promotes longevity by modulating mitochondrial function and fat metabolism in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that prohibitin deficiency shortens the lifespan of otherwise wild-type animals. Notably, knockdown of prohibitin promotes longevity in diapause mutants or under conditions of dietary restriction. In addition, prohibitin deficiency extends the lifespan of animals with compromised mitochondrial function or fat metabolism. Depletion of prohibitin influences ATP levels, animal fat content and mitochondrial proliferation in a genetic-background-and age-specific manner. Together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and function, with opposing effects on energy metabolism, fat utilization and ageing in C. elegans. Prohibitin may have a similar key role in modulating energy metabolism during ageing in mammals. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The underground storage concept is attracting increasing interest from other countries in Europe. Because of the nature of Swedish political culture, the development of the actual method for final disposal is commonly perceived as resting on consensus and democratic cooperation. However, this paper argues that the aforementioned disposal method instead represents the outcome of intense conflict between the nuclear energy industry and the anti-nuclear movement. Accordingly, any investigation of the technical and political solutions to controversial environmental problems should involve the study of lay people and social movements. The present study does so, employing theoretical notions from science and technology studies that allow the analysis to conceptualize actions and strategies (enactments) of the nuclear energy industry (confined research) and the anti-nuclear movement (research in the wild).

In the present work, the surfaces of activated carbon electrodes were treated in low pressure oxygen and argon plasma for selected times of 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 300 s. The plasma source was a DC glow discharge in argon and oxygen gases generated by magnetron sputter deposition technique with Ni cathode. The working gas pressure was 1.3 Pa - 1.8 Pa and the distance between anode of magnetron and substrate - 30 mm. The dissipated power in plasma was equal to 250 W. The negative - 100 V bias voltage was supplied to the carbon electrode. The conducted studies of carbon surface topography showed that plasma treatment initiated microscopic roughening of the surface of activated carbon which was pronounced for short time (less than 30 s) plasma interaction. This was attributed to an increased of carbon surface area caused by argon-oxygen plasma etching. For discharge times greater than 10 min, combined effects of plasma chemical etching of carbon by oxygen atoms, physical sputtering by argon ions and deposition of nickel oxide deposit appeared to have a smoothing effect and led to a reduction of the measured surface area. Capacitance of electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) with activated carbon electrodes after 1 min plasma surface treatment was increased by 70% compared to EDLCs cells with the original activated carbon electrodes without plasma treatment and nickel oxide deposition. The results have shown that the modification by plasma treatment of activated carbon electrodes is a suitable technique for EDLCs used in high current applications.","Carbon electrodes; Plasma treatment; Supercapacitors; Surface modification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349540891

The exchange, or flux, of carbon among the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface is called the global carbon cycle. Comparatively, human activities contribute a relatively small amount of carbon, primarily as carbon dioxide (CO2), to the global carbon cycle. Despite the addition of a relatively small amount of carbon to the atmosphere, compared to natural fluxes from the oceans and land surface, the human perturbation to the carbon cycle is increasingly recognized as a main factor driving climate change over the past 50 years. If humans add only a small amount of CO2 to the atmosphere each year, why is that contribution important to global climate change? The answer is that the oceans, vegetation, and soils do not take up carbon released from human activities quickly enough to prevent CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere from increasing. Humans tap the huge pool of fossil carbon for energy, and affect the global carbon cycle by transferring fossil carbon - which took millions of years to accumulate underground - into the atmosphere over a relatively short time span. As a result, the atmosphere contains approximately 35% more CO2 today than prior to the beginning of the industrial revolution (380 ppm vs 280 ppm). As the CO2 concentration grows it increases the degree to which the atmosphere traps incoming radiation from the sun (radiative forcing), warming the planet. The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is mitigated to some extent by two huge reservoirs for carbon - the global oceans and the land surface - which currently take up more carbon than they release. They are net sinks for carbon. If the oceans, vegetation, and soils did not act as sinks, then the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would increase even more rapidly. A key issue to consider is whether these two sinks will continue to store carbon at the same rate over the next few decades, or whether their behavior will change. Currently, most of the total global carbon sink is referred to as the unmanaged, or background, carbon cycle. Very little carbon is removed from the atmosphere and stored, or sequestered, by deliberate action. Congress is considering legislative strategies to reduce U.S. emissions of CO2 and/or increase the uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. Congress may also opt to consider how land management practices, such as afforestation, conservation tillage, and other techniques, might increase the net flux of carbon from the atmosphere to the land surface. How the ocean sink could be managed to store more carbon is unclear. Iron fertilization and deep ocean injection of CO2 are in an experimental stage, and their promise for long-term enhancement of carbon uptake by the oceans is not well understood. Congress may consider incorporating what is known about the carbon cycle into its legislative strategies, and may also evaluate whether the global carbon cycle is sufficiently well understood so that the consequences of longterm policies aimed at mitigating global climate change are fully appreciated. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In this kind of reaction, two nuclei of light elements (typically deuterium and tritium, isotopes of hydrogen) fuse to form the nucleus of a heavier element (typically helium). Fusion possesses characteristics that make it extremely attractive as a primary source for energy generation, such as: (a) practically unlimited fuel which is plentiful and cheap, (b) minimum emissions of CO2 and other atmospheric pollutants, (c) intrinsic safety in all phases of operation, (d) radioactive waste recycling within a time scale compatible with one human generation, with no need for permanent geological waste storage. Over the past 40 years progress in plasma physics and technology for heating and confinement at the densities and temperatures of interest for a fusion electricity power plant has been considerable. In the case of magnetically confined plasmas, which is the dominant line of research in Europe, the possibility of arriving at the construction of a prototype fusion plant (DEMO) still requires answers to the following fundamental questions however: (i) maintaining a large volume (∼ 1,000 m3) deuterium-tritium plasma at high temperature (over 100 million °C), in almost stationary conditions for a sufficiently long time and with a high ratio between the power produced by the fusion and the power to sustain the plasma which is supplied from outside; (ii) demonstrating the reliability of numerous highly complex components; (iii) verification of the resistance of the materials to be used for the internal components of the power plant over the time span required for the plant to function economically. The answer to the first two points should come from the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) machine. Work on this began at an international level in 2007 and it should become operational in about ten years. The third point should be answered definitively by the material test machine called IFMIF (International Fusion Materials Facility). This project and the testing of the main components are already under way within the framework of an international collaboration (Broader Approach). These projects, accompanied by a complementary research and development programme at a European and international level, should allow researchers to acquire the elements necessary for the construction of a prototype fusion power plant within the next 30 years.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954655550

In 2006, in the context of low temperature solar power, used mainly for the production of sanitary water and underfloor heating, Italy came fifth in Europe in terms of volume sales and in 2007 there was a 55% growth in installations, up to 200 MWh for a surface area of 286,000 m2, thus passing the million mark for m2 installed overall, corresponding to about 700 GWh/year of thermal energy produced. The technology is long established but there are interesting margins for improvement, especially in cost reductions: there is work to be done on collector performance, plumbing and, above all, on the reduction of installation costs. Cooling buildings using solar energy is a promising area that requires research and development to become competitive and mature. Developments in the thermal solar market in Italy, influenced by European regulations, lead us to forecast two possible scenarios, with a total installed by 2020 of 12 GWh (17 million m2, the same level per head that Austria has today) or of 40 GWh (57 million m2 = 40 TWh/year; 1 m2 installed per capita), respectively. The technologies for concentrating solar power (CSP) use the direct radiation from the Sun and as such are destined to be installed above all in the sunniest regions. After a lull, CSP is now developing fast in several countries, particularly in Spain, the USA and China. The current cost per kWh is about double that from fossil fuels, but the Global Environment Facility forecasts a reduction in cost to about 0.04 €/kWh by 2025, reaching parity with fossil fuels. Many other sources forecast lower costs, down to 0.025 €/kWh. In solar thermoelectric plants the most innovative aspects are linked to the systems for harvesting and raising the temperature of solar heat and the storage system for times when there is no sunshine. Moreover the use of molten salt, as in Italy's Archimede project, still requires some research and development for the components that are attacked by that salt. Currently the power of the CSP plants already planned in the world in the short term amounts to about 1,700 MW. Of these 300 MW are considered very probably achievable. In the medium term the development programmes recently launched in the USA and China, which amount to several thousand MW, should be kept in mind. For Italy one could aim at reaching a maximum of 300 MW (0.5 TWh/year) installed by 2020.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954643002

The structure itself is made up from many hexagonal ducts, each housing a wind turbine and water pump within the duct. A single wind dam turbine is approximately 4m in diameter. The number and size of turbines relates to the amount of energy extracted from the wind. Energy storing wind dams have the huge advantage of being able to store energy.

Box 51000, East Jerusalem, Palestine","We report on the properties of water/mixed nonionic surfactants/R (+)-limonene/isopropylmyristate microemulsions. The surfactants were sucrose monolaurate and ethoxylated mono-di-glyceride. The total area of the one phase microemulsion region in the pseudoternary phase diagrams is dependent on the mixing ratios (w/w) of the oils and that of the mixed surfactants. The largest microemulsion area formed with a surfactants mixing ratio (w/w) equals unity. The one phase microemulsion area increases with the increase in the R (+)-limonene/ isopropylmyristate-mixing ratio (w/w). Electrical conductivity was measured at different temperatures and the activation energy of conduction flow was evaluated. At the percolation threshold, the activation energy of conduction flow reaches a minimum value. Beyond the percolation threshold, a small increase is observed in the activation energy of conduction flow, then it decreases with the increase in the water volume fraction indicating structural transitions. Dynamic viscosity was measured as function of temperature at different water volume fractions. The measured viscosities for the samples in all of the systems decrease as the temperature increases. The thermodynamic parameters of viscous flow that include enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy were estimated. In all of the systems studied, the enthalpy of viscous flow remains constant as function of temperature and varies as the water content in the microemulsions vary. The entropy and the Gibbs free energy vary with both the temperature and the composition of the microemulsions. Linear relationships were observed between the enthalpy and entropy of viscous flow. The enthalpy-entropy compensation temperature was determined and found to be 247K. Small angle X-ray scattering results indicate that the periodicity increases linearly with the increase in the water volume fraction. The correlation length increases with the increase in the water volume fraction to a certain value, then stabilizes.","Activation energy of conductive flow; Compensation temperature of viscous flow; Correlation length; Enthalpy of viscous flow; Entropy of viscous flow; Gibbs free energy of viscous flow; Percolation threshold; Periodicity; Scattering intensity","Compensation temperature of viscous flow; Enthalpy of viscous flow; Flow compensation; Gibbs free energy of viscous flow; Percolation thresholds; Periodicity; Scattering intensity; Electric conductivity; Enthalpy; Entropy; Fluid dynamics; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Microemulsions; Nonionic surfactants; Percolation (computer storage); Percolation (fluids); Percolation (solid state); Phase diagrams; Scattering; Soil structure interactions; Solvents; Sugar (sucrose); Temperature; Titration; Viscosity; Viscous flow; Volume fraction; Water content; Activation energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449126219

Spyr1 was identified as Mycobacterium sp. based on 16S rDNA analysis and it was capable of degrading pyrene, fluoranthene, fluorene, anthracene, and acenaphthene. The effect of entrapment in glass beads and alginate/starch mixtures on the survival and pyrene degradation ability of Spyr1 cells in liquid suspensions and soil microcosms was tested and compared with that of freely suspended cells. In general, free cells showed higher degradation of pyrene and other PAH than immobilized cells. However, immobilized cells could better tolerate PAH and they maintained their viability and PAH degradation capability for at least 1 year after storage at 4 °C. Entrapped cells in glass beads exhibited better pyrene biodegradation performance than alginate/starch entrapped cells in liquid suspensions and could be used effectively for at least ten repeated cycles. Alginate/starch entrapped cells exhibited better yields than glass beads entrapped cells for removing pyrene as well as mixtures of PAH in soil microcosms. © 2008 Humana Press.","Biodegradation; Entrapment; Mycobacterium sp.; PAH; Soil bacteria","16S rDNA analysis; Acenaphthene; Bacterial strains; Energy source; Entrapment; Fluoranthene; Fluorenes; Free cells; Glass bead; Immobilized cells; Liquid suspension; Mycobacterium sp.; PAH; Polluted soils; Repeated cycle; Soil bacteria; Soil microcosms; Sole carbon; Taxonomic identifications; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Bacteriology; Biochemistry; Biodegradation; Cell culture; Cell immobilization; Cell membranes; Glass; Granular materials; Liquids; Organic compounds; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Soil pollution; Soils; Degradation; alginic acid; anthracene; creosote; DNA 16S; fluoranthene; fluorene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene; starch; article; bioremediation; carbon source; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; energy resource; microbial degradation; molecular weight; Mycobacterium; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; soil pollution; taxonomic identification; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cells, Immobilized; Mycobacterium; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Soil Microbiology; Species Specificity; Bacteria (microorganisms); Mycobacterium sp.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350568177

Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats at 3 weeks of age were fed with a mixed normal diet of 10% fat and high-fat diet of 60% fat (50:50) for 2 weeks and then turned to 100% high-fat diet until 43 weeks of age. Body weight gain was recorded, and food intake, eating behavior, and metabolic variables were measured by a comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system. Body composition was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Ghrelin/obestatin-producing A-like cells in the stomach were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Results: Rats on high-fat diet were overweight at 9 weeks of age and later became obese characterized by increased body weight and excess fat deposition. There were no obesity-prone, obesity middle tertile, and obesity-resistant subgroups in rats on high-fat diet. The young rats on high-fat diet, even before becoming overweight (i.e., 8 weeks), consumed larger portion of meal (kilocalorie per meal) and ate faster but less frequent than the rats on normal diet. Obese rats had reduced food intake (expressed as gram per 100-g body weight per 24 h), unchanged calorie intake (kilocalorie per 100-g body weight per 24 h), and energy expenditure (kilocalorie per hour per 100-g body weight), and increased number of A-like cells in the stomach. Conclusion: Large size of meal, but not overnutrition, appears to be responsible for high-fat diet-induced obesity in rats. We propose a consideration that prevention strategies for obesity epidemic should strongly focus on meal size at early childhood and adolescence. © 2009 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Body weight; Calorie and food intake; Eating behavior; High-fat diet; Rats","ghrelin; obestatin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body composition; caloric intake; cell count; controlled study; disease association; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; energy expenditure; feeding behavior; food intake; hormone blood level; immunohistochemistry; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; metabolic parameters; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; rat; stomach mucosa; weight gain; Animals; Dietary Fats; Disease Models, Animal; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Eating; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Hyperphagia; Male; Obesity; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350096243

Our objective was to characterize the determinants of enhanced glucose utilization in adipose tissue during catch-up fat. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - White adipose tissue morphometry, lipogenic capacity, fatty acid composition, insulin signaling, in vivo glucose homeostasis, and insulinemic response to glucose were assessed in a rat model of semistarvation-refeeding. This model is characterized by glucose redistribution from skeletal muscle to adipose tissue during catch-up fat that results solely from suppressed thermogenesis (i.e., without hyperphagia). RESULTS - Adipose tissue recovery during the dynamic phase of catch-up fat is accompanied by increased adipocyte number with smaller diameter, increased expression of genes for adipogenesis and de novo lipogenesis, increased fatty acid synthase activity, increased proportion of saturated fatty acids in triglyceride (storage) fraction but not in phospholipid (membrane) fraction, and no impairment in insulin signaling. Furthermore, it is shown that hyperinsulinemia and enhanced adipose tissue de novo lipogenesis occur concomitantly and are very early events in catch-up fat. CONCLUSIONS - These findings suggest that increased adipose tissue insulin stimulation and consequential increase in intracellular glucose flux play an important role in initiating catch-up fat. Once activated, the machinery for lipogenesis and adipogenesis contribute to sustain an increased insulin-stimulated glucose flux toward fat storage. Such adipose tissue plasticity could play an active role in the thrifty metabolism that underlies glucose redistribution from skeletal muscle to adipose tissue. © 2009 by the American Diabetes Association.",,"Fas antigen; fatty acid synthase; glucose; glucose transporter 4; insulin; mitogen activated protein kinase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phospholipid; saturated fatty acid; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; catch up growth; cell count; cell size; enzyme activity; enzyme phosphorylation; gene expression; glucose homeostasis; glucose tolerance test; glucose utilization; hyperinsulinemia; lipid composition; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; male; nonhuman; plasticity; priority journal; rat; skeletal muscle; thermogenesis; white adipose tissue; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Composition; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Glucose Tolerance Test; Growth Disorders; Humans; Hyperinsulinism; Lipids; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349634594

The topology modifies the switches configuration of the Z-Source converter to allow the application of the shoot-through state by a unique concentrated pulse. This fact improves its hardware implementation because this pulse could be quite narrow for some operation states of the converter. The developed control strategy makes use of the standard duty cycle (D1) and the shoot-through duty cycle (Dst) as independent manipulated inputs of the plant to perform a reference tracking problem. The proposed non-linear controller utilized is a combination of a multi-loop law with partial decoupling plus feed-forward cancellations. Simulation results show the potential of the controller for the tracking of typical waveforms with marked frequency separation components.

Therefore, we investigated how chronic training responses are affected by glucose ingestion. Methods: In previously untrained males performance and various muscular adaptations were evaluated before and after 8 weeks of supervised endurance training conducted either with (n = 8; CHO group) or without (n = 7; placebo) glucose supplementation. Results: The two groups achieved similar improvements in maximal oxygen uptake and peak power output during incremental cycling (both parameters elevated by 17% on average) and both groups lost ∼3 kg of fat mass during the 8 weeks of training. An equal reduction in respiratory exchange ratio (0.02 units) during submaximal exercise was observed in both groups. Beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase activity was increased in both groups, however, to a larger extent in the placebo group (45 ± 11%) than CHO (23 ± 9%, P < 0.05). GLUT-4 protein expression increased by 74 ± 14% in the placebo group and 45 ± 14% in CHO (both P < 0.05), while resting muscle glycogen increased (P < 0.05) to a larger extent in the placebo group (96 ± 4%) than CHO (33 ± 2%).

In this system, the salt water is heated in a solar collector before flashing inside an insulated chamber to be evaporated and condensed naturally later on where the rest of saline water is re-circulated into the system. Three systems are manufactured and tested in Cairo, 30°N. The salt water is circulated in a separate loop for the first and second systems. In the first system, an auxiliary heater is used to switch the temperature of the salt water where it is naturally switched in the second system depending on the weather conditions. The third system is an open system in which the salt water is used as a collector fluid. In all three systems, a thermosyphon solar water heater is used as a heat source consisting of a collector and a storage tank. A numerical simulation was developed for the considered systems to predict their annual performance and desalinated water production. An agreement between the measured and simulated data was obtained. It is found that the third system is the most efficient one and it has the lowest cost. Moreover, the first one has the greatest distilled water with higher temperatures and flow rates. © 2009.","Humidification-dehumidification; Multi-effect; Numerical simulation; Solar desalination","Auxiliary heater; Desalinated water; Distilled water; Heat sources; Higher temperatures; Humidification-dehumidification; Humidification-dehumidification process; Multi-effect; Numerical investigations; Numerical simulation; Salt water; Simulated data; Solar desalination; Storage tank; Thermosyphons; Three systems; Water desalination; Weather conditions; Computer simulation; Computer simulation languages; Desalination; Design; Humidity control; Mathematical models; Open systems; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar water heaters; Water filtration; Water heaters; Saline water; desalination; experimental study; numerical method; salt water; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69349095384

Titania coatings were prepared on silicon wafers Si(100) using sol-gel dip-coating method. Amorphous, anatase, and rutile titania were obtained in the post-preparation annealing process conducted at 100, 500, and 1000 °C, respectively. Deposition of ZDDP having butyl- (C4) or dodecyl- (C12) alkyl chain was performed by means of dip-coating (DC), self-assembly (SA), and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) methods. The effectiveness of the modification was monitored by the wetting contact angle measurement. An increase of the surface hydrophobicity was observed upon modification. The surface topography, imaged with the use of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), revealed the presence of island-like agglomerates having different size of ZDDP films deposited using DC and SA method. Smooth and compact C12ZDDP films were observed when LB deposition was applied. The tribological performance of the ZDDP films on titania coatings was tested with the use of microtribometer operating in the normal loads range of 30-100 mN in the technical dry friction conditions.

The obtained electrode presented a disc shape, with 11 mm diameter and approximately 1 mm thickness. The crystalline structure of the hydrogen storage alloy was examined using X-ray diffractometry. The measured hcp lattice volume was 1.78% larger than the precursor LaNi5 intermetallic alloy, increasing the available space for hydrogen movement. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) measurements were used before and after hydriding in order to verify the alloy sample homogeneity. The negative electrode was electrochemically tested by using a laboratory cell. It activates almost totally in its first cycle, which is an excellent characteristic from the commercial point of view.

Burnup credit studies aim at accounting for fuel irradiation in criticality studies of the nuclear fuel cycle (transport, storage, etc...). The principal objective of this study is to evaluate the potential capabilities of a newly developed burnup code called ""BUCAL1"". BUCAL1 differs in comparison with other burnup codes as it does not use the calculated neutron flux as input to other computer codes to generate the nuclide inventory for the next time step. Instead, BUCAL1 directly uses the neutron reaction tally information generated by MCNP for each nuclide of interest to determine the new nuclides inventory. This allows the full capabilities of MCNP to be incorporated into the calculation and a more accurate and robust analysis to be performed. Validation of BUCAL1 was processed by code-to-code comparisons using predictions of several codes from the NEA/OCED.

The phase changing parameters (phase change temperature, latent heat, and energy storage capacity) of GPCC have been determined using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and temperature-history methods. Further analysis of measurement results has been conducted to describe the evolution of latent heat with temperature during phase change in terms of liquid fraction-temperature relationships. Charging and discharging packed bed column experiments have been also carried out for different operating conditions to analyze the potential of GPCC for packed bed thermal energy storage. The present column results clearly demonstrate the dependence of temperature variation along the packed bed and the overall performance of the storage unit on the phase change characteristics of GPCC. Small and non-uniform particles diameters of GPCC and heterogeneity of the bed material complicate the phenomena of heat transfer and evolution of latent heat in the packed bed. Mathematical modeling of the packed bed that considers the GPCC and air as two separate phases with inter-phase heat transfer is presented.

This causes the problem of energy flux determination in a real inhomogeneous deformed body. The energy flux is the key parameter of geomechanics, the continuum of which is essentially non-uniform. We consider the intrinsic metric of the deformed continuum as a Finslerian E3 × E3 with the metric tensor gi j (x, over(x, ̇)) = gi j (x, ξ). Taking into account the main properties of the Finsler space, we can find the metric as a Hamiltonian function. We can build the continuous field of the rays propagation directions because the energy of a deformed body is arbitrary. The continuity is very important from the physical point of view because the real energy flux starts only on the source and stops on the sink. The energy flux can be evaluated through the Umov-Pointing vector. The direction of this vector can be received as a normal to the equienergetic surface. For the arbitrary metric, this surface is the indicatrix. Taking into account non-symmetry of orthogonality in the Finsler space, we can determine the excess of storage energy. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The DVR is a power electronics device that is able to compensate voltage sags on critical loads dynamically. By injecting an appropriate voltage, the DVR restores a voltage waveform and ensures constant load voltage. The compensating signals are determined dynamically based on the difference between desired and measured values. The DVR consists of Voltage Source Converter (VSC), injection transformers, passive filters and energy storage (lead acid battery). The efficiency of the DVR depends on the efficiency of the control technique involved in switching the inverter. In this paper a novel structure for voltage sags mitigation and for power quality improvement are proposed. There is an increasing trend of using space vector PWM (SVPWM) because of their easier digital realization and better dc bus utilization. This paper also discussed a new control algorithm based on Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) technique to generate the pulses. The proposed control algorithm is investigated through computer simulation by using PSCAD/EMTDC software.

Renewable energy is regarded as a solution to this problem, particularly considering its transformation in electricity but this does not include the impact of the transportation sector, which represents a significant component of the imported fuels consumption. The other main limitations associated to renewable electricity consists on the need to increase the storage capacity that might attenuate the effect of renewable energy sources intermittence and disparity between supply and demand. In both these main problems associated with renewable energy management, the Plug-in Electric Vehicles (EV) could be a part of the solution in that the use of the vehicle to grid (V2G) technology can provide storage of electric energy during low demand times and use it to match the demand in peak hours and/or to avoid fossil fuel consumption. However, could the large scale EV penetration lead to increasing the fraction of electricity from renewable? Is the usage of EV batteries like as a storage system truly the best solution? Is the EV a better solution for the vehicle's owner than the internal combustion vehicle from an economical point of view? This paper analyses a case study in the Island of Sâo Miguel in Azores, where energy systems modeling is used to assess how far large scale EV penetration may lead to increasing the potential for the use of renewable electricity, and discusses the possible revenues for EV owners from providing vehicle to grid power.",,"Electric energies; Electric grids; Energy systems; EV battery; Internal combustion; Isolated systems; Low demand; Plug-ins; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Security of supply; Storage capacity; Storage systems; Supply and demand; Transportation sector; Vehicle-to-grid power; Competition; Economics; Electric automobiles; Electric network analysis; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Vehicles; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349304404

In this paper we introduce a medium access data communication protocol which dynamically adjusts its back-off algorithm to best suit the actual active RFID application at hand. Based on a simulation study of the effect on tag energy cost, readout delay, and message throughput incurred by some typical back-off algorithms in a CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Avoidance) A-RFID protocol, we conclude that by dynamic tuning of the initial contention window size and back-off interval coefficient, tag energy consumption and read-out delay can be significantly lowered.

The significant issues in the overall design of fossil fuels decarbonisation process using gasification process are: proper choice of gasification reactor and feedstock (e.g. fluxing or fuel blending), downstream syngas treatment options (shift conversion of carbon monoxide, syngas desulphurization and later carbon dioxide capture) and finally the usage of combustible decarbonised gas for various energy vectors poly-generation (e.g. power, H2 etc.).

While the three bare ions all absorb strongly at 222 nm, absorption at higher wavelengths was barely visible from sampling the neutrals formed in delayed dissociation. A band at 270 nm was introduced, however, as a consequence of CE attachment to the bare ions. To understand the difference between bare ions and complexes, electronically excited states are considered: The initially reached ππ*state on phenol couples with the dissociative πσ* state on ammonium, which leads to direct hydrogen loss. Cold radical cations are formed that at high wavelengths do not have enough energy for further dissociation. Excitation within the 222-nm band on the other hand leads to delayed dissociation of stored radical cations that is monitored in the present setup. The πσ* state moves out of the spectral region upon CE attachment, and instead statistical dissociation is sampled on the microsecond to millisecond time scale at all wavelengths. Our data demonstrate the strength of using supramolecular complexes for action spectroscopy experiments to prevent erroneous spectra as a result of undesired dissociation (H loss) from electronically excited states. The gas-phase absorption spectra firmly establish the perturbations of the phenol electronic structure by a water solvent: The 270-nm band red shifts by ∼5 nm, whereas the 222-nm band changes by ∼3 nm. Both transitions occur in the phenol group. These results may be useful for protein dynamics experiments that rely on electronic excitations. Product ion mass spectra of [Tyr + H]+, [Ala-Tyr + H]+, [Tyr-Ala + H]+, [Ala-Tyr + H]+(CE), and [TyrAla + H]+(CE) significantly depend on the excitation wavelength from 210 to 310 nm and on whether the ionizing proton is mobile or not. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"18-crown-6; Action spectroscopy; Dissociation lifetime; Electronic excitation; Excitation wavelength; Gasphase; Hydrogen loss; Ion mass; Ion storage; Phenol groups; Protein dynamics; Proton mobility; Protonated; Radical cations; Red shift; Spectral region; Statistical dissociation; Supramolecular complexes; Time-scales; Tunable lasers; Water solvents; Amino acids; Ammonium compounds; Crown ethers; Dissociation; Electric excitation; Electronic structure; Ethers; Excited states; Experiments; Free radical reactions; Gas absorption; Hydrogen; Lasers; Light absorption; Mass spectrometry; Organic compounds; Phenols; Photoexcitation; Photolysis; Positive ions; Protons; Water absorption; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; alanyltyrosine; amino acid; crown ether; dipeptide; hydrogen; proton; absorption; amino acid sequence; article; chemistry; gas; photolysis; spectroscopy; time; Absorption; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acids; Crown Ethers; Dipeptides; Gases; Hydrogen; Photolysis; Protons; Spectrum Analysis; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349208983

In order to reach this goal, the amount of overall profits of fuel-constrained power plant, NaS battery plant and their coupling are first calculated in a specific time interval. Then, the coupling efficiency is determined using incremental profit rate. Having an appropriate strategy to calculate this parameter is essential.

We have applied the techniques of magnetic resonance imaging as a tool to visualize the conversion of CH4 hydrate within Bentheim sandstone matrix into the CO2 hydrate. Corresponding model systems have been simulated using the phase field theory approach. Our theoretical studies indicate that the kinetic behaviour of the systems closely resembles that of CO2 transport through an aqueous solution.

The influence of the solution temperature is investigated in this study. We suggest that activation energy of the deposition rate measurement can be a tool for determining the nature of the deposition mechanism. We found that at low solution temperature, the growth mechanism proceeds via the ion by ion process, and found the corresponding activation energy equal to 0.06 eV. However, at higher solution temperature, the film deposition became via the cluster by cluster process, the growth rate activation energy is equal to 0.48 eV. The films' structural and optical properties were studied by x-ray diffraction analysis and UV-visible spectrophotometry. Structural analysis revealed that the deposited films have a cubic structure, and the crystallite size decreases with increasing deposition temperature. The transmission spectra of the film, in the visible range, show a high transmission coefficient (70%). The transmittance data analysis indicates that the optical band gap is closely related to the solution temperature. From this analysis, a direct band gap ranging from 2.21 to 2.34 eV was deduced. From the electrical characterization we inferred that CdS films are n-type and their dark conductivities reduced with increasing bath solution temperature. From the photoconductivity measurements we concluded that films deposited at low temperatures (less than 60 °C) or high temperatures (higher than 70 °C) have good optoelectronic properties suitable for utilization as a buffer layer in thin film solar cells. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cadmium sulfide; CdS films; CdS thin films; Chemical-bath deposition; Cluster process; Cubic structure; Dark conductivity; Data analysis; Deposited films; Deposition mechanism; Deposition temperatures; Direct band gap; Electrical characterization; Film deposition; Growth mechanisms; High temperature; High transmission; Low temperatures; Optoelectronic properties; Solution temperature; Structural and optical properties; Thin film solar cells; Transmission spectrums; UV-visible spectrophotometry; Visible range; Activation energy; Atomic layer deposition; Cadmium; Cadmium compounds; Chemical analysis; Crystallite size; Data storage equipment; Deposition; Energy gap; Film growth; Film preparation; Measurements; Optical properties; Photovoltaic cells; Semiconducting cadmium compounds; Structural analysis; Thin films; X ray diffraction analysis; Optical films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349148686

Thus, there is a relatively quick water level variation observed in water- storage reservoirs, which contributes to the problems, especially in case of high-pressure waterworks facilities. Swift reservoir draw-down enhances seepage volumetric forces acting from the rock mass, which may lead to rock mass cracking and eventually to the development of landslide processes. A rapid impoundment of the water-storage reservoir is no less damaging. In this case, seepage in the rock mass is progressing in non-steady conditions, there occurring, in the inception stage: - high magnitude seepage hydrodynamic forces at the rock mass surface, creating additional loads on the rock mass, causing deflection of its surface, which may promote dam-foundation contact opening; - with increased pore pressures and seepage gradients, there may occur suffusion and other undesirable processes in the rock mass; In the work is given a numerical analysis of some parameters of seepage mode given based on right-bank investigation admitting presence of break in the dam filling-up mode. Options of time-intervals for the two basic versions - in case of sudden rising of water level in the upstream and in case of slow filling-up and setting up steady-state seepage mode in the massive - are being discussed. Determination of seepage flow parameters (including gradients) requires nonstationary field task to be solved. Finite-elements approximation for time analysis of the task is solved by finite-difference scheme. Seepage calculations are carried out by cyclic-iteration scheme - where volumetric water content, hydraulic conductivity and elasticity module determined numerically by functional relations.

We find that 16V has the limit size where defect reconstruction is unlikely, preserving the unsaturated border. After hydrogenation, the border is passivated leaving an inert pore of about 6 Å in diameter. We verify that the incorporation and release of H2 molecules through this nanopore occurs barrierless and its stability in contact with a H2 gas for both exohedral and endohedral adsorptions is preserved at high temperatures. We also find endohedral binding energies of 0.14-0.21 eV/ H2 at room temperature, which are close to those estimated optimal for a reversible adsorption-desorption process, suggesting that nanoporous CNTs as produced by electron irradiation in a hydrogen atmosphere could be an effective H2 storage medium, allowing the access to the CNT inner space. © 2009 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349102524

Due to severe resource constraints on the sensor nodes, efficient key distribution schemes and secure communication protocols with low overhead are desired. In this paper we present an asynchronous group key distribution scheme with no time synchronization requirements. The scheme decreases the number of key updates by providing them on an as needed basis according to the amount of network traffic.

This concept shines a light on the possibility of achieving adaptive energy absorption. To investigate the effect of the internal pressure on the response of the structures under impact loadings, the present paper reports our study on the axial crushing behavior of pressurized thin-walled circular tubes. Three groups of thin-walled circular tubes with the radius/thickness ratio between 120 and 200 were employed in the experiments and two working modes were studied: mode-I (with constant internal pressure) and mode-II (closed tubes with finite leakage). In the tests of mode-I, the influences of internal pressure on the deformation mode and energy absorption of the tubes were investigated. The results show that with the increase of internal pressure, the deformation mode switches from diamond mode with sharp corners to that with round corners, and eventually to ring mode. In diamond mode, the mean force of the tubes increases linearly with the internal pressure. The enhancement comes from two mechanisms: direct effect of the pressure and indirect effect due to the interaction between the pressure and the tube wall. After the deformation switches to ring mode, the enhancement resulted from the second mechanism becomes weaker. Based on the results of mode-I, the mode-II was experimentally investigated both quasi-statically and dynamically. The results are compared with the predictions obtained from a semi-empirical formula, showing good agreements.

The hydrogen diffusion coefficient was found to decrease linearly with the increase of CH at all temperatures. However, the slope of this linear dependence was found to reduce with the increasing temperature. The partial interaction Gibbs energy of dissolved hydrogen (Δ over(G, ̄)int) revealed a strong influence of temperature on the stability of α-solid solution phase in the alloy electrode. Namely, the Δ over(G, ̄)int gradually increased -25.6 to -2.5 kJ mol-1 with increasing temperature, showing a linear dependence. It is found that the Einstein diffusion coefficient of hydrogen increased also with increasing temperature, and that the apparent energy of activation of hydrogen diffusion is 27.9 kJ mol-1.

The size of agglomerates/nanoparticles and the thickness of the CoPt thin films depend strongly on the filling gas pressure and the number of plasma focus deposition shots; hence it provides a possibility to control the CoPt agglomerates/ nanoparticles size and the deposition rate by simply changing the operating parameters of the DPF system.

Most obvious functions are storage of chemical energy, provision of structural support of biological membranes and signaling. All these cellular processes are of critical relevance to cells which undergo transformation, cancer progression and metastasis. Thus, it is likely that certain classes of lipids are reflective for the cellular physiology in cancer cells and tissue. Here we discuss key roles of lipids involved in cancer as well as challenges for development of novel lipid-based biomarkers. Special emphasis will be given to mass spectrometry based analysis of lipids. Such technology has been successfully used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of lipids with very different chemistries. Comparative analysis, often in case-control regimes, and either in non-targeted (e.g. by liquid chromatography-single stage mass spectrometry) or targeted (i.e. by tandem mass spectrometry) fashion yields vast arrays of information. Uni-variate (such as Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test) and multivariate statistics (principal components analysis, machine learning and regression analysis) are next used to identify variations in individual lipid species and/or to lower dimensions for visualization and grouping of cases and controls. As a result surrogate (single or multi-parameter) markers are identified which form the basis for functional validation as well as potential translation to alternative analytical readouts. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In present study, the thermal stability of micron and nano-sized nitrocellulose samples was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and simultaneous thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) techniques. The results of TG analysis revealed that the main thermal degradation of nitrocellulose occurs in the temperature range of 190-210 °C. On the other hand, the TG-DTA analysis of samples indicated that particle size of nitrocellulose could affect on its thermal stability and its decomposition temperature decreases by decreasing its particle size. The influence of the heating rate (5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min) on the DSC behaviour of the nitrocellulose with two particle sizes was verified. The results showed that, as the heating rate was increased, decomposition temperature of the micron and nano-sized compound was increased.

Binding interactions were proved by NMR, mass spectra, capillary zone electrophoresis, UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The 2D-NMR experiments on native CDs indicate that the interaction of TMPyP with the external CD surface is the dominant binding mode. The high binding affinity of TMPyP towards sulfonated CDs is due to electrostatic interactions. Binding is accompanied by an increase of the TMPyP basicity. Whereas βCD does not affect the lifetime of the TMPyP triplet states, binding with sulfonated CDs causes the protonation of the TMPyP triplet states even in neutral solution. The diprotonated anionic sensitizer 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPSH22+) forms host-guest complexes with native βCD and γCD, similarly as in its non-protonated state.

While reduced models alleviate these difficulties to some extent, most of the available reduced models do not preserve geometrical resolution. In this paper, we present a reduced model for a PEMFC that both reduces computational requirements and preserves geometrical resolution. The model is for a PEMFC equipped with porous flow fields and takes into account conservation of mass, momentum, species, energy, and charge. The results of the reduced model are then verified against those of the full model and validated against global polarization curves and local current-density distributions for three different experimental fuel cells; good agreement is obtained. In computational terms, the solution of the reduced model is found to require between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude less random access memory and execution time than that of the full model; furthermore, it scales well when run on up to four processors. Finally, we discuss the suitability of our reduced model for extension to a PEMFC stack model comprising tens or hundreds of single cells. © 2009 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Computational requirements; Computing time; Conservation of mass; Current density distribution; Execution time; Full model; Geometrical resolution; Memory requirements; Numerical computations; Orders of magnitude; PEMFC stack; Polarization curves; Porous flow; Random access memories; Reduced model; Single cells; Cell membranes; Membranes; Protons; Random access storage; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549120145

However, the output power provided via the photovoltaic conversion process depends on solar irradiation and temperature. Therefore, to maximize the efficiency of the photovoltaic energy system, it is necessary to track the maximum power point of the PV array. The present paper proposes a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) method, based on fuzzy logic controller (FLC), applied to a stand-alone photovoltaic system. It uses a sampling measure of the PV array power and voltage then determines an optimal increment required to have the optimal operating voltage which permits maximum power tracking. This method carries high accuracy around the optimum point when compared to the conventional one. The stand-alone photovoltaic system used in this paper includes two bi-directional DC/DC converters and a lead-acid battery bank to overcome the scare periods. One converter works as an MPP tracker, while the other regulates the batteries state of charge and compensates the power deficit to provide a continuous delivery of energy to the load. The Obtained simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy logic controller. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Throughout the time of a day, the steam plant is made to work at full power, where the excess power generated over the electric power demand is used to drive the compressors of the refrigeration cycles. The stored cooling is used for dissipating the heat absorbed by the cooling refrigerant in the steam condenser during the period of peak-loads, while the two refrigeration machines are stopped. In this way, the energy used for driving the refrigeration machine is saved so that the whole power generated by the steam plant is exported to the grid. Energy analyses of the proposed combined system has led to inferring that the net power of the steam plant during the period of exclusive direct cooling of the steam condenser (only the first refrigeration machine is running) is about 70-86% of the whole power generated by the steam plant when the coefficient of performance of the first refrigeration cycle lies in the range of 4-10. Also, it has been found that relatively small coefficients of performance of the first and second cycles, less than 6 and 1.5, respectively, result in low net power of the steam plant over the period of charging the cooling storage container (both refrigeration machines run in unison). In this case, the net plant power amounts to less than 26% of the total generated plant power when the time of storing the cooling is lower than double the time of the peak-loads. This necessitates increasing the storing time to assure reasonable available power to be exported to the grid. Economical analyses of the proposed system have showed that both the capital cost and energy charges are less for the proposed system than that of the steam plant without cooling storage for practically possible operating conditions. © 2009 by ASME.","Combined system; Cooling thermal storage; Refrigerant cooled condenser; Refrigeration cycle; Steam cycle; Steam power plant","Capital costs; Coefficient of Performance; Coefficients of performance; Combined system; Direct cooling; Economical analysis; Electric power demands; Energy analysis; Improving performance; Operating condition; Refrigeration cycle; Refrigeration cycles; Steam cycle; Steam plant; Steam power; Storage container; Storing time; Thermal storage; Cooling; Cooling systems; Heat storage; Refrigerants; Refrigeration; Steam; Steam condensers; Steam engineering; Steam power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149443087

Mitochondria and glycolytic complexes serve as the main energy production locations, while the highest energy demands are associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum, myofibrillar compartments and plasma membrane. Creatine kinase (CK) is a dimeric protein, which is deeply involved in the production of high energy storage compounds. This enzyme reversibly phosphorylates creatine (Cr) to phosphocreatine (PCr), and it is also highly adapted to specialized muscle function. To date, four major isoenzymes of CK have been identified, two of which occur in the cytosol and two in mitochondria. Disruption of the phosphotransfer system induced by an absence of either the sarcomeric mitochondrial CK or cytosolic CK or both isoenzymes of CK (CK-/-) in muscle cells leads to morphological and functional adaptations towards preservation of muscle contractile abilities. Remodeling of the cell ultrastructure observed in CK-/- cardiomyocytes and glycolytic fibers was associated with direct transfer of energy from places of energy production to locations of energy utilization. This direct interaction among the organelles can maintain a high ATP/ADP ratio near the cellular ATPases when CK is not functionally active.

In the seminal plasma of O. mykiss, the main FAAs were arginine, glutamic acid, isoleucine, leucine, methionine and proline, in spermatozoa cysteine, arginine and methionine. In the seminal plasma of C. carpio, the main FAAs were alanine, arginine, cysteine, glutamic acid, histidine, leucine, lysine, methionine and proline, in spermatozoa arginine, glutamic acid, histidine, leucine and lysine. When spermatozoa were incubated for 48 h together with the seminal plasma, the quantitative amino acid pattern changed in both species indicating their metabolism. In spermatozoa and seminal plasma of O. mykiss and C. carpio, the following enzymes were found to be related to amino acid metabolism: transaminases (specific for alanine, aspartate, isoleucine and leucine), decarboxylases (specific for valine and lysine), glutamate dehydrogenase and α-keto acid dehydrogenases (substrates: 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid and 4-methyl-2-oxovalerate). These data demonstrate that amino acid catabolism by transamination, decarboxylation and oxidative deamination can occur in semen of the two species. Also activity of methionine sulphoxide reductase was detected, an enzyme which reduces methionine sulphoxide to methionine. This reaction plays an important role in antioxidant defence. To determine the effect of FAAs on the sperm viability, C. carpio and O. mykiss spermatozoa were incubated in sperm motility inhibiting saline solution containing different amino acids. Methionine had a positive effect on the sperm viability in both species. Taken together this result with the in vivo occurrence of methionine and of methionine reductase in semen, it can be assumed that this amino acid plays an important role in antioxidant defence. Also isoleucine in O. mykiss and leucine in C. carpio had a positive effect on sperm viability. As seminal plasma and spermatozoa of the two species exhibit enzyme activities to catabolize leucine and isoleucine, they might serve as additional energy resources especially during prolonged incubation and storage periods. © 2009 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Fishes; Motility; Seminal fluid; Spermatozoa; Viability","amino acid; methionine; methionine sulfoxide reductase; animal; article; carp; chemistry; male; metabolism; rainbow trout; sperm; spermatozoon; spermatozoon motility; Amino Acids; Animals; Carps; Male; Methionine; Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Semen; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa; Cyprinidae; Cyprinus carpio; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349316770

Costs of abatement were about $150/metric ton of CO2 (tCO2), with a range of $120 to $180/tCO2 avoided. But as the technology matures, significant cost reductions are expected because of increased scale, lessons learned, and technological innovations for plant integration.

Smart metering could help for improving energy efficiency by offering information about the way in which the energy is used. Smart metering will be based on large volumes of sensor data, since energy monitoring will bring together sensor data from various critical areas. The main purpose of this paper was to present the selection mechanism for a scalable storage solution, based on the requirements of the DEHEMS (Digital Environment Home Energy Management System) project. With regular sensor readings coming at every 6 seconds, there is an impressive amount of data collected even for the minimal target of about 250 households, 10 -sensors per user. With these huge data streams that are non-stationary time-series data, collected at discrete intervals, the DEHEMS project has to offer a solution for storing and retrieving sensor data in a -responsive way. We have tested both collection speed and aggregation speed for reasonable data streams of sensor data. The tests were performed on various database models, with their associated -representations, -including relational databases, key-value stores, column stores, self-tuning databases, as well as time-series enabled database systems. These experiments confirmed that column stores and key-value stores perform better than relational databases, while time-series databases outperform all the others. © 2009 by the IETE.","Benchmarking; Energy monitoring; Sensor data; Smart metering; Time-series data.","Column-store; Critical area; Data stream; Database models; Digital environment; Discrete intervals; Energy monitoring; Home energy management systems; Nonstationary; Relational Database; Scalable storage; Selection mechanism; Selftuning; Sensor data; Sensor readings; Smart metering; Time-series data.; Benchmarking; Data communication systems; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Evolutionary algorithms; Sensors; Relational database systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70249143619

Slicing triggered differentiation processes that lead to changes in metabolism, activation of defence and cell-wall reinforcement. Proteins related to storage, cell growth and division, cell structure, signal transduction, energy production, disease/defence mechanisms and secondary metabolism were detected. Image analysis of the 2-DE gels revealed a timedependent change in the complexity of the polypeptide patterns. By microscopic observation the polyalyphatic domain of suberin was clearly visible by D4, indicating that a closing layer (primary suberisation) was formed by then. A PCA of the six sampling dates revealed two time phases, D0-D2 and D4-D8, with a border position between D2 and D4. Moreover, a PCA of differentially expressed proteins indicated the existence of a succession of proteomic events leading to wound-periderm reconstruction. Some late-expressed proteins (D6-D8), including a suberisation-associated anionic peroxidase, have also been identified in the native periderm. Despite this, protein patterns of D8 slices and native periderm were still different, suggesting that the processes of wound-periderm formation are extended in time and not fully equivalent. The information presented in this study gives clues for further work on wound healing-periderm formation processes. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These 2 harvest methods, termed ""rested"" - involving sedation with the aquatic anesthetic AQUI-S™ and ""exercised"" - a simulated conventional harvest not involving sedation, contrasted levels of activity of the animal prior to and upon slaughter. Rested and exercised harvesting protocols produced tissue in significantly different postmortem physiological states prior to freezing. Rested, postharvest tissue maintained high metabolic energy stores of ATP and glycogen within the tissue, with low concentrations of tissue and plasma lactate. Exercised tissue exhibited near depleted concentrations of ATP and glycogen and a marked lactate accumulation. In both treatments, no significant change in metabolite levels was seen over a 6-mo storage period at -19 °C when tissue was frozen immediately postharvest. Transfer of tissue from frozen temperatures (-80 and -19 °C), to refrigerated (-1 and +4 °C, respectively) resulted in rapid glycolysis, depleting tissue ATP and glycogen stores and increasing tissue lactate concentrations. Metabolic activity was more significant in rested tissue owing to the larger concentrations of metabolic energy stores and occurred at temperatures between -3 and -1.5 °C. During frozen storage (-19 °C), there was an increase in the secondary lipid oxidation product TBARS, but harvest treatment had no effect. However, following transfer from frozen to refrigerated (+4 and -1 °C) storage, rested tissue showed a significant ability to retard the development of TBARS products. © 2009 Institute of Food Technologists®.","Chinook salmon; Harvest; Lipid oxidation; Storage; Thaw","adenosine triphosphate; anesthetic agent; antioxidant; drug derivative; eugenol; glycogen; isoeugenol; lactic acid; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; veterinary drug; animal; animal disease; aquaculture; article; blood; comparative study; drug effect; female; food freezing; food handling; freezing; immobilization; lipid peroxidation; methodology; motor activity; physiology; quality control; salmon; sea food; Adenosine Triphosphate; Anesthetics, General; Animals; Antioxidants; Aquaculture; Eugenol; Female; Food Handling; Frozen Foods; Glycogen; Immobilization; Lactic Acid; Lipid Peroxidation; Motor Activity; Quality Control; Refrigeration; Salmon; Seafood; Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances; Veterinary Drugs; Animalia; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69749125553

In this paper the development of a computer application for the prediction of an ice bank system operation is presented. Static, indirect, cool thermal storage systems with external ice on coil building/melting were considered. The mathematical model was developed by means of energy and mass balance relations for each component of the system and is basically divided into two parts, the model of an ice storage system and the model of a refrigeration unit. Heat transfer processes in an ice silo were modelled by use of empirical correlations while the performance of refrigeration unit components were based on manufacturers data. Programming and application design were made in Fortran 95 language standard. Input of data is enabled through drop down menus and dialog boxes, while the results are presented via figures, diagrams and data (ASCII) files.

We also found that laypeople fear that a deployment of CCS could create incentives that would hinder a sustainable development of the energy economy. A misunderstanding of the concepts of hydro- and geostatic pressure, as well as a lack of knowledge about the physical-chemical properties of carbon dioxide seemed to trigger fundamental rejection of CCS among some laypeople.

The hydrogen economy concept, as set out in recent commissioned research investment policy advice documents, includes a range of hydrogen energy supply and consumption chains for transport and residential energy services. The benefits of research and development investments in these advice documents were not fully analyzed by cost or improvements in energy efficiency or green house gas emissions reduction. This paper sets out a straightforward method to quantify the system-level efficiency of these energy chains. The method was applied to transportation and stationary heat and power, with hydrogen generated from wind energy, natural gas and coal. The system-level efficiencies for the hydrogen chains were compared to direct use of conventionally generated electricity, and with internal combustion engines operating on gas- or coal-derived fuel. The hydrogen energy chains were shown to provide little or no system-level efficiency improvement over conventional technology. The current research investment policy is aimed at enabling a hydrogen economy without considering the dramatic loss of efficiency that would result from using this energy carrier. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However considerable energy is required for the capture, compression, transport and storage steps involved. In this paper, energy penalty information in the literature is reviewed, and thermodynamically ideal and ""real world"" energy penalty values are calculated. For a sub-critical pulverized coal (PC) plant, the energy penalty values for 100% capture are 48.6% and 43.5% for liquefied CO2, and for CO2 compressed to 11 MPa, respectively. When assumptions for supercritical plants were incorporated, results were in broad agreement with published values arising from process modelling. However, we show that energy use in existing capture operations is considerably greater than indicated by most projections. Full CCS demonstration plants are now required to verify modelled energy penalty values. However, it appears unlikely that CCS will deliver significant CO2 reductions in a timely fashion. In addition, many uncertainties remain over the permanence of CO2 storage, either in geological formations, or beneath the ocean. We conclude that further investment in CCS should be seriously questioned by policy makers. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it has been recently demonstrated that after prolonged anodic polarization an unusual promoted activity is observed for a certain time after current interruption. This phenomenon has been reported as permanent electrochemical promotion of catalysis (P-EPOC). In this work the oxygen storage reported as responsible of P-EPOC has been investigated by transient electrochemical techniques using an O2(g)Pt/YSZ cell. A model has been proposed involving place interchange of Pt and O species in Pt/YSZ system. This seems to be induced by the strong lateral interaction of Pt-O surface dipoles and by increasing electric field at the Pt/YSZ interface. Such a rearranged oxide, so-called ""phase oxide"" can have a lower free energy than the initial monolayer oxide. This cooperative interaction of Pt and O species can lead to further thickening of this ""phase oxide"" especially at high temperature and potentials (currents). Furthermore, as the charge involved in this oxide thickening shows a t1/2 dependency, the process seems to be diffusion controlled. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Instead of solving the Euler-Lagrange equations of the resulting minimization problem, we propose an efficient combinatorial optimization technique, based on graph cuts. Because of a simplification of the length term in the energy induced by the PCLSM, the minimization problem is not NP hard. Numerical experiments on image segmentation demonstrate that the new approach is very superior in terms of efficiency, while maintaining the same quality. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Combinatorial optimization techniques; Euler-Lagrange equations; Graph cut; Iterative numerical method; Level Set method; Minimization problems; Multi-phase images; Mumford Shah model; New approaches; NP-hard; Numerical experiments; Piecewise constant; Combinatorial optimization; Computer vision; Differential equations; Digital image storage; Drop breakup; Euler equations; Image segmentation; Lagrange multipliers; Level measurement; Solar cell arrays; Set theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69149093603

Whether or not such low targets can be achieved in the long-term depends on a number of assumptions about, for instance, technological change and the willingness of countries to immediately join a post-Kyoto agreement to limit anthropogenic climate change. As part of the EMF22 international scenarios study, our paper contributes to the ongoing discussion by conducting a scenario analysis in order to examine the influence of these assumptions on the feasibility of a set of radiative forcing targets. We distinguish between ""first-best scenarios"" with full participation, and ""second-best scenarios"" with delayed participation of Brazil, China, India, and Russia in 2030 and the rest of Non-Annex I countries after 2050. In addition, we explored the robustness of our ""first-best"" scenario results by varying the assumptions with regard to availability of key technology clusters. Accounting for the deep uncertainties associated with future global mean temperature change, we conduct a probabilistic assessment and explore the scenario's likelihood for staying below a range of different temperature thresholds. Our results indicate the need for a diverse portfolio of mitigation technologies in order to decarbonize the energy system. Efficiency and enhanced energy conservation play an important role across all scenarios. In addition, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is found to be important for achieving particularly low forcing targets as well as for avoiding pronounced overshoot of the target in the medium-term. Negative emission technologies such as bioenergy with CCS have a strong influence on the timing of mitigation; i.e. without their availability much more early action is needed. According to our analysis, significant delay in the participation of major emitters leads to the unattainability of the most stringent forcing targets. Moreover, delayed participation may lead to excessive additional global mitigation cost that may even exceed the mitigation costs of the most stringent forcing targets in the best case with full participation. We find that for countries that significantly delay their participation, the early gains from postponing mitigation may be offset to a large extent in the long-term, due to the need for more pronounced mitigation later in the century. Linking the radiative forcing targets with temperature change, we find that the chances of staying below certain temperature thresholds may be significantly lower over the course of the century than would be by looking exclusively at 2100. From a policy perspective our results therefore suggest that focusing on early abatement to avoid significant overshoot of concentrations may be as important as the long-term concentration target itself. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Optimizing these flow conditions can significantly improve mixing effectiveness. We focus on the evolution of a mixing layer in a temporal framework using direct numerical simulations, and optimize the initial disturbances on the layer such that maximal mixing is achieved after a selected simulation time horizon. A gradient-based optimization strategy is used, which employs adjoint-based gradient calculations formulated in a continuous framework. This allows us to limit disk storage needed for the adjoint simulation. We further concentrate on algorithms which impose the necessary energy and continuity constraints on the initial perturbations. For the continuity constraints, parameter elimination is used. For the energy constraint two methods are compared: the gradient projection and the augmented Lagrangian. Optimization with the gradient projection method is shown to be the more robust methodology. We found that the augmented Lagrangian method is very sensitive to small gradient inconsistencies which originate from the adjoint-based gradient calculation. Finally, optimization results are presented for two different time windows T = 20 and 40, using five different cost functionals. These are based on momentum thickness, turbulent kinetic energy, mean-flow kinetic energy, total kinetic energy, and enstrophy. It is found that the first three cost functionals lead to large-scale mixing with 2D vortex structures and virtually no diffusion, while the last two promote small-scale structures in the flow.","Adjoint; Energy constraint; Mixing layer; Optimization; Turbulent mixing","adjoint method; algorithm; flow modeling; kinetic energy; optimization; simulation; turbulent mixing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68949167800

Airtight storage of moist feed grain using the biocontrol yeast Pichia anomala as biopreservation agent can substantially reduce the process energy for grain storage. In this study we tested the potential of moist stored grain for bioethanol production. Results: The ethanol yield from moist wheat was enhanced by 14% compared with the control obtained from traditionally (dry) stored grain. This enhancement was observed independently of whether or not P. anomala was added to the storage system, indicating that P. anomala does not impair ethanol fermentation. Starch and sugar analyses showed that during pre-treatment the starch of moist grain was better degraded by amylase treatment than that of the dry grain. Additional pre-treatment with cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes did not further increase the total ethanol yield. Sugar analysis after this pre-treatment showed an increased release of sugars not fermentable by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Conclusion: The ethanol yield from wheat grain is increased by airtight storage of moist grain, which in addition can save substantial amounts of energy used for drying the grain. This provides a new opportunity to increase the sustainability of bioethanol production. © 2009 Passoth et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Amylase treatment; Bio-ethanol production; Biopreservation; Cereal grains; Degrading enzymes; Ethanol fermentation; Ethanol yield; Grain storage; New opportunities; Pichia anomala; Pre-Treatment; Process energy; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Storage systems; Stored grains; Sugar analysis; Temperate climate; Wheat grains; Biocontrol; Bioethanol; Cellulose; Climatology; Dewatering; Ethanol; Starch; Sugar (sucrose); Sugars; Yeast; Grain (agricultural product); biocontrol agent; ethanol; fermentation; wheat; yeast; Cellulose; Drainage; Ethanol; Grain; Meteorology; Starch; Sugar; Yeasts; Pichia anomala; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549084653

H atoms on a graphite (0001) surface can be either chemisorbed or physisorbed. The transition from the chemisorbed to the physisorbed state happens at sufficiently high rates. In the physisorbed state, H atom diffusion is essentially free of energy barriers. Physisorbed H atoms readsorb selectively adjacent to other chemisorbed H atoms.

The regulation of lipolytic activity is crucial to ensure energy balance and to avoid lipotoxic effects as exerted by products of lipolysis such as free fatty acids. Therefore, transcriptional and post-translational regulation are involved in the equilibrium between lipid storage and mobilization. Moreover, substrate accessibility, which may be governed by localization of lipases, is a key regulatory element.

The evidence that the gut microbiota composition can be different between healthy and or obese and type 2 diabetic patients has led to the study of this environmental factor as a key link between the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases and the gut microbiota. Several mechanisms are proposed linking events occurring in the colon and the regulation of energy metabolism, such as i.e. the energy harvest from the diet, the synthesis of gut peptides involved in energy homeostasis (GLP-1, PYY ...), and the regulation of fat storage. Moreover, the development of obesity and metabolic disorders following a high-fat diet may be associated to the innate immune system. Indeed, high-fat diet feeding triggers the development of obesity, inflammation, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis by mechanisms dependent of the LPS and/or the fatty acids activation of the CD14/TLR4 receptor complex. Importantly, fat feeding is also associated with the development of metabolic endotoxemia in human subjects and participates in the low-grade inflammation, a mechanism associated with the development of atherogenic markers. Finally, data obtained in experimental models and human subjects are in favour of the fact that changing the gut microbiota (with prebiotics and/or probiotics) may participate in the control of the development of metabolic diseases associated with obesity. Thus, it would be useful to find specific strategies for modifying gut microbiota to impact on the occurrence of metabolic diseases. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Bifidobacteria; Cardiovascular diseases; Gut bacteria; Gut peptides; High fat diet; Metabolic endotoxemia-obesity; Prebiotics","antibiotic agent; CD14 antigen; fatty acid; fructose oligosaccharide; glucagon like peptide 1; lipopolysaccharide; prebiotic agent; probiotic agent; toll like receptor 4; probiotic agent; atherosclerosis; Bifidobacterium; cardiovascular risk; Clostridium; clostridium coccoides; dietary fiber; endotoxemia; energy metabolism; Eubacterium; eubacterium rectale; human; inflammation; innate immunity; insulin resistance; intestine flora; lipid diet; lipid storage; metabolic disorder; microbial population dynamics; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; priority journal; review; animal; fat intake; gastrointestinal tract; immunology; metabolic disorder; metabolism; microbiology; obesity; pathophysiology; Animals; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Metabolic Diseases; Obesity; Probiotics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650604595

At all storage temperatures examined (0, 5, 10, 15 °C), the results showed that lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were the dominant bacteria and can be used as a good spoilage index of MAP minced beef. The end of product's shelf life as revealed by the sensory evaluation coincided with a LAB population level of 7 log10 CFU/g. For all temperatures tested, the growth of L. sakei in the TTI resembled closely the growth of LAB in the meat product, with similar temperature dependence of the μmax and thus similar activation energy values calculated as 111.90 and 106.90 kJ/mol, for the two systems, respectively. In addition, the end point of TTI colour change coincided with the time of sensory rejection point of the beef product during its storage under isothermal chilled temperature conditions. The estimated activation energy, Eα, values obtained for parameters related to the response of ΔE (total colour change of the TTI) describing the kinetics of colour change of the TTI during isothermal storage (i.e. the maximum specific rate of ΔΕ evolution curve, μΔΕ, and also the reciprocal of ti, time at which half of the maximum ΔΕ is reached), were 112.77 and 127.28 kJ/mol, respectively. Finally, the application of the microbial TTI in monitoring the quality deterioration of MAP minced beef due to spoilage was further evaluated under dynamic conditions of storage, using two separate low temperature periodic changing scenarios, resembling the actual conditions occurring in the distribution chill chain. The results showed that the end point of TTI, after storage at those fluctuating temperature conditions, was noted very close to the end of product's sensorial shelf life.

In this paper we describe the isolation of the full-length cDNAs of ovine urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) and its receptor (u-PAR) using a polymerase chain reaction based strategy. The ovine u-PA cDNA comprised of 2350 bp and it is characterized by a coding region of 1302 bp, and 5′- and 3′-UTR regions of 129 and 919 bp, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 433 amino acids. The ovine u-PAR cDNA is comprised of 1247 bp and it is characterized by a coding region of 957 bp and 5′- and 3′-UTR regions of 44 and 246 bp respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 318 amino acids. Three-dimensional models of the putative protein products of both cDNAs showed that the proteins bear a high similarity with their human counterparts. Real-time PCR revealed high levels of u-PA expression in the adipose tissue, followed by that in mammary gland and kidney. Lower levels of expression were detected in the adrenal glands, heart, ovaries, spleen, liver and cerebellum. A similar pattern was observed in u-PAR expression with noticeably lower levels of expression in heart, liver and cerebellum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper reporting expression of u-PA and u-PAR in the adipose tissue. These data strengthen the suggestion that adipose tissue functions as an endocrine organ besides an energy storage organ. Furthermore, u-PA and u-PAR mRNA levels were 7 and 8.5 fold higher respectively in involuting mammary tissue obtained from non-lactating ewes compared to that detected in mammary tissue obtained from lactating ewes. These data are consistent with the notion that upregulation of u-PA and u-PAR expression may play a key role in the process of involution of the mammary gland. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The new approach, although based on the traditional van der Waals-Platteeuw theory, has two significant advantages. The hypothetical state of an empty hydrate for the calculation of the chemical potential of water is replaced by the hydrate of the pure promoter whose properties can be determined through simple thermodynamic calculations. In addition, the computational difficulties related to the complete occupancy of the large cavities by the promoter are removed.

Mantra Energy's technology, named the electro-reduction of CO 2 (ERC), aims to take CO 2 directly from industrial waste gases and convert it to formate salts and/or formic acid, both valuable chemicals used in a variety of industrial applications. Formic acid also has the potential to play a leading role in fuel cell development, both as a direct fuel and as a fuel storage material for on-demand release of hydrogen. The ERC technology could provide a net revenue of ≤ $700/ton of CO 2 recycled, with an ROI previously forecast at 20%/yr, depending on local costs. Compared with CCS, the ERC provides a positive return on investment, not an unrecoverable cost.

These include improved sanitation and living conditions, vaccinations and antimicrobial therapy, together with declining family size and changes in dietary intake. Recent scientific advances demonstrate that the hygiene hypothesis needs to be extended in three respects. Firstly, rigorous research in the field of probiotics points to the importance of the collective composition and the compositional development of the gut microbiota in consolidation of healthy immune responsiveness. Secondly, immunomodulatory and suppressive immune responses have been shown to complement the original immunological basis of the hygiene hypothesis, the so-called T helper 1/T helper 2 paradigm. Thirdly, host-microbe interaction appears to affect the risk of developing not only atopic disease but also other inflammatory Western lifestyle diseases, including obesity. The results of experimental studies suggest that deviations in gut microbiota composition predispose to excessive energy storage and obesity, and, more recently in humans, aberrant compositional development of the gut microbiota has been shown to precede overweight, inviting enormous possibilities to reach preventive and therapeutic applications in weight management.

Overweight male rats were subjected to daily gavages of 10 nmol/g of OE or vehicle (control) for 10 days. A PF (pair-fed) vehicle-receiving group was used to discount the effects attributable to energy availability limitation. Interscapular BAT mass, lipid, DNA, mRNA and the RT-PCR (real-time PCR) expression of lipid and energy metabolism genes for enzymes and regulatory proteins were measured. BAT mass and lipid were decreased in OE and PF, with the latter showing a marked reduction in tissue mRNA. Maintenance of perilipin gene expression in PF and OE rats despite the loss of lipid suggests the preservation of the vacuolar interactive surface, a critical factor for thermogenic responsiveness. OE and, to a lesser extent, PF maintained the expression of genes controlling lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, but markedly decreased the expression of those genes involved in lipogenic and acyl-glycerol synthesis. OE did not affect UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) (decreased in PF), β3 adrenergic receptors or hormone-sensitive lipase gene mRNAs, which may translate in maintaining a full thermogenic system potential. OE rats were able to maintain a less energetically stressed BAT (probably through glucose utilization) than PF rats. These changes were not paralleled in PF rats, in which lower thermogenesis and glucose preservation resulted in a heavier toll on internal fat stores. Thus the mechanism of action of OE is more complex and tissue-specific than previously assumed. ©The Authors.","Brown adipose tissue (BAT); Energy metabolism; Lipogenesis; Oleoyl-oestrone (OE); Thermogenesis; UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1)","beta 3 adrenergic receptor; DNA; estrone; estrone oleate; glucose; messenger RNA; perilipin; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 1; antiobesity agent; drug derivative; estrone oleate; messenger RNA; oleic acid; oleoyl-estrone; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; brown adipose tissue; controlled study; DNA content; drug mechanism; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; gene expression regulation; glucose utilization; hormone action; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; male; metabolic rate; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; obesity; protein expression; protein function; protein transport; rat; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA analysis; thermogenesis; tissue specificity; weight reduction; animal; chemistry; drug effect; gene expression; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; metabolism; randomization; thermogenesis; Wistar rat; Rattus; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Energy Metabolism; Estrone; Gene Expression; Lipid Metabolism; Lipogenesis; Male; Oleic Acids; Overweight; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Wistar; RNA, Messenger; Thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70249110161

Nevertheless interaction phenomenon with carbon black and other additives did influencing significantly the performance of the silane and minimized its efficiency. Rheological measurements confirm this behaviour. Factors such as chemical reaction, physical adsorption and abrasiveness are involved in many of these situations.

The PMSs have been assessed on their capacity to meet the power load requirements through effective utilization of the electrolyzer and fuel cell under variable energy generation from RES (solar and wind). The evaluation of the PMS has been performed through simulated experiments with anticipated conditions over a typical four-month time period for the region of installation. The key decision factors for the PMSs are the level of the power provided by the RES and the state of charge (SOC) of the accumulator. Therefore, the operating policies for the hydrogen production via water electrolysis and the hydrogen consumption at the fuel cell depend on the excess or shortage of power from the RES and the level of SOC.

Numerous reports have established how AMPK responds to changes in the AMP:ATP ratio as a measure of cellular energy levels. In this way, it integrates control over a number of metabolic enzymes and adapts cellular processes to the current energy status in various cell types, such as muscle and liver cells. The role of AMPK in the development, function, and maintenance of the nervous system, on the other hand, has only recently gained attention. Neurons, while highly metabolically active, have poor capacity for nutrient storage and are thus sensitive to energy fluctuations. Recent reports demonstrate that AMPK may have neuroprotective properties and is activated in neurons by resveratrol but also by metabolic stress in the form of ischemia/hypoxia and glucose deprivation. Novel studies on AMPK also implicate neuronal activity as a critical factor in neurodegeneration.

The low temperature waste heat dissipated from the fuel cell stack was used to enhance and ensure the release of hydrogen from the storage unit. A water-heated MH-tank can be made more compact than an air-heated MH-tank with external heating fins, due to more direct heat transfer between MH-alloy and heating/cooling media. A water-heated MH-tank will therefore have the potential for better kinetics for absorption and desorption of hydrogen. The fuel cell stack and metal hydride storage unit were characterised and a control strategy was developed for fast start-up of the fuel cell stack. The main priority for the strategy was to maintain the metal hydride temperature at room temperature, while increasing the FC temperature to the specified operating temperature. The preferred strategy for this system was to increase the fuel cell temperature to at least 40 °C before starting to heat the metal hydride storage unit to 30 C.

One of these directions is in the transport sector, particularly personal transport using hydrogen as fuel, which logically leads on to the problem of hydrogen storage. This paper deals with the prediction of the effective conductivity of beds of metal hydride for hydrogen storage. To enable modeling of the effective thermal conductivity of these systems, it is necessary to arrive at the functional dependence of the thermal conductivity of the solid hydride on its hydrogen concentration or content. This is the inverse problem in thermal conductivity of multiphase materials. Inverse methods in general are those where we start from known consequences in order to find unknown causes. Using published and known data of the effective thermal conductivity of the hydride-hydrogen assemblage, we arrive at the unknown hydride conductivity by analysis. Among the models available in the literature for determination of the effective conductivity of the bed from the properties of the constituent phases, the model of Raghavan and Martin is chosen for the analysis as it combines simplicity and physical rigor. The result is expected to be useful for predicting the thermal conductivity of hydride particles and determining the optimum heat transfer rates governing the absorption and desorption rates of hydrogen in the storage system. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Hydrogen storage; Inverse method; Metal hydrides; Particle thermal conductivity","Constituent phasis; Desorption rate; Effective conductivity; Effective thermal conductivity; Functional dependence; Heat transfer rate; Hydrogen concentration; Inverse method; Inverse methods; Metal hydrides; Multiphase materials; Particle thermal conductivity; Solid hydrides; Storage systems; Sustainable systems; Transport sectors; Desorption; Fuel storage; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Inverse problems; Lithium batteries; Metals; Models; Thermal conductivity of solids; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic properties; Thermoelectricity; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68749086287

Endo-β-mannanases are hydrolytic enzymes that cleave the mannan backbone. They are active during seed germination and during processes of growth or senescence. The recent discovery that endo-β-mannanase LeMAN4a from ripe tomato fruit also has mannan transglycosylase activity requires the role of endo-β-mannanases to be reinterpreted.AimsIn this review, the role of endo-β-mannanases as mannan endotransglycosylase/hydrolases (MTHs) in remodelling the plant cell wall is considered by analogy to the role of xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs). The current understanding of the reaction mechanism of these enzymes, their three-dimensional protein structure, their substrates and their genes are reported.Future outlookThere are likely to be more endohydrolases within the plant cell wall that can carry out hydrolysis and transglycosylation reactions. The challenge will be to demonstrate that the transglycosylation activities shown in vitro also exist in vivo and to validate a role for transglycosylation reactions during the growth and development of the plant cell wall.","Cell wall; Endo-β-mannanase; Endohydrolase; Endotransglycosylase; Mannan","beta mannosidase; glycosyltransferase; vegetable protein; xyloglucan - xyloglucosyltransferase; xyloglucan xyloglucosyltransferase; biological development; cellulose; ecological modeling; enzyme activity; growth rate; physiological response; plant; polysaccharide; seedling; senescence; substrate; article; cell wall; classification; enzymology; genetics; metabolism; phylogeny; physiology; beta-Mannosidase; Cell Wall; Glycosyltransferases; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Lycopersicon esculentum; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68349148129

The present study explores the potential use of salt gradient solar ponds (SGSPs) for production of Artemia nauplii. An SGSP is a basin of water where solar energy is trapped and collected via an artificially imposed gradient. Three zones can be identified in an SGSP: upper and lower zones, which are both convective, and a middle zone, which is intended to be non-convective. The latter acts as a transparent insulation layer and allows for storage of solar energy at the bottom, where it is available for use. The combination of salt, temperature and high transparency could make SGSPs promising bioreactors for the production of Artemia nauplii. Using particle image velocymetry (PIV) and Shadowgraph visualisation techniques, the behaviour of Artemia nauplii under critical cultivation parameters (namely, salinity, temperature and light) was monitored to determine movement velocity, and how movement of Artemia affects the salt gradient. It was observed that Artemia nauplii constantly follow light, irrespective of adverse salinity and/or temperature conditions. However, despite the substantial displacement of Artemia following the light source, the salt gradient is not disrupted. The suitability of SGSPs as bioreactors for Artemia biomass production was then tested. The results were disappointing, probably due to the lack of sufficient O2 for Artemia survival and growth. Follow-up trials were conducted aimed at using the SGSP as a green and economically attractive energy source to induce faster hatching of cysts and improved Artemia nauplii growth. The results of these trials, and a case study of Artemia nauplii production using an SGSP, are presented. The authors constructed a Solar Pond device, which they suggest as a novel way of supplying thermal energy for Artemia biomass production in an aquaculture enterprise. Finally, the authors suggest a method of producing and collecting Artemia biomass, and of heating a fish larval tank, in an 'ideal' Solar Pond device, profiting from the low investment costs of using a decommissioned salt works. © 2009 Society for Industrial Microbiology.","Artemia nauplii; Particle image velocimetry; Shadowgraph; Solar Pond","sodium chloride; water; aquaculture; Artemia; article; biomass production; bioreactor; energy resource; environmental temperature; follow up; growth; larva; light; nonhuman; particle image velocimetry; pond; salinity; solar energy; species cultivation; storage; velocity; Animals; Aquaculture; Artemia; Behavior, Animal; Biomass; Light; Solar Energy; Artemia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68349127410

Furthermore, depletion of water-soluble B vitamins that play key roles in the production of cellular energy in patients with heart failure can contribute to depletion of energy reserves observed in the failing heart. A cross-sectional study recently reported that approximately one third of hospitalized patients with heart failure had tissue levels suggestive of thiamin deficiency (vitamin B-1). Riboflavin (vitamin B-2) and pyridoxine (vitamin B-6) are similar to thiamin in that they are water-soluble, subject to renal excretion, have limited tissue storage, and are dependent on intake. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the status of these B vitamins may also be adversely affected by heart failure. As a result, the prevalence of patients at risk of vitamin B-2 (erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient ≥1.2) and B-6 deficiency (plasma B-6 ≤20 nmol/L) was determined in a cross-section of 100 patients hospitalized with heart failure between April 2001 and June 2002 as well as in a group of volunteers without heart failure. Twenty-seven percent of patients with heart failure had biochemical evidence of vitamin B-2 deficiency, while 38% had evidence of B-6 deficiency. These prevalence rates were significantly higher than those observed in the volunteers without heart failure (2% and 19%, respectively; P≤0.02). Use of common B-vitamin-containing supplements by patients with heart failure did not significantly reduce deficiency rates in comparison with those who did not use supplements (B-2 P=0.38 or B-6 P=0.18)). Finally, while 80% of patients with heart failure took diuretics, neither the dose nor the duration of furosemide use was related to the presence of either B-2 or B-6 deficiency. Given the physiologic importance of these vitamins, further investigations aimed at determining the effect of heart failure on specific nutrient requirements as well as the safety and efficacy of B-vitamin supplementation are warranted. © 2009 American Dietetic Association.",,"pyridoxine; riboflavin; thiamine; aged; article; blood; Canada; chi square distribution; cross-sectional study; diet supplementation; female; heart failure; hospitalization; human; male; middle aged; nonparametric test; nutritional requirement; nutritional status; prevalence; pyridoxine deficiency; riboflavin deficiency; risk; risk factor; statistical model; thiamine deficiency; Aged; Chi-Square Distribution; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dietary Supplements; Female; Heart Failure; Hospitalization; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritional Requirements; Nutritional Status; Odds Ratio; Ontario; Prevalence; Riboflavin; Riboflavin Deficiency; Risk Factors; Statistics, Nonparametric; Thiamine; Thiamine Deficiency; Vitamin B 6; Vitamin B 6 Deficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67651002676

The distributions of the fuel cell power delivery, although different between the two systems, are within the region where the fuel cell efficiency is approximately constant. As a result, the rates of fuel consumption show no discernable difference between the two systems for all three driving cycles considered.

The MPPT control allows the extraction of the maximal output power delivered by the PV generator. The inverter ensures the PWM control of the asynchronous motor and a sine wave form of output signals.

Our first-principles calculations predict that the hydrogen adsorptive capacity of C120 nanocapsules is higher than that of C60 fullerene. This demonstrates that C120 nanocapsules could be a promising material for energy storage. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The consequence of the intimate mixing of these components in protein bars is that they can react together, creating sensory characteristics that are unacceptable to consumers. This study examined the changes occurring in a model protein bar during storage for 50 days at 20 °C. Over this time, fracture stress increased from 20.1 ± 1.8 to 201 ± 75 Pa at a rate that decreased slightly over time. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed that the molecular mobility of PHCs decreased dramatically over the first 5 days as the batter set into a solid bar. Over the first 17 h after manufacturing, protein particles became more clustered, and soluble protein appeared to precipitate, as shown by confocal microscopy. Reactive lysine fell 38% in the first 10 days of storage and was approximately constant thereafter. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed little change in protein molecular weights. Following the initial 'setting' phase of 5-10 days, fracture stress continued to increase and the molecular mobility of PHCs decreased. Changes in PHC molecular mobility were consistent with glucose crystallisation. Chemical changes were minimal during this phase, which suggests that chemical reactions play little part in the hardening of protein bars and that changes in molecular mobility and changes in microstructure driven by moisture migration may be more important. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The nanocomposite film was synthesized by sol-gel deposition of 30 nm Ag-TiO2 layer on ∼200 nm anatase(a-)TiO2 film previously doped by silver nanoparticles. Both Ag/a-TiO2 and Ag-TiO2/Ag/a-TiO2 films were transparent with a SPR absorption band at 412 nm. Depth profile X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed metallic silver nanoparticles with diameter of 30 nm and fcc crystalline structure were self-accumulated on the film surface at depth of 5 nm of the TiO2 layer and also at the interface of the Ag-TiO2 and a-TiO2 films (at depth of 30 nm). Both OH- bounds and H2O contents were concentrated on the film surface and at the interface, as a profit in releasing more ionic (not metallic) silver nanoparticles. Antibacterial activity of the nanocomposite film against E. coli bacteria was 5.1 times stronger than activity of the a-TiO2, in dark. Photo-antibacterial activity of the nanocomposite film exposed by the solar light was measured 1.35 and 6.90 times better than activity of the Ag/a-TiO2 and a-TiO2, respectively. The main mechanism for silver ion releasing was inter-diffusion of water and silver nanoparticles through pores of the TiO2 layer. Durability of the nanocomposite film was at least 11 times higher than the Ag/a-TiO2 film. Therefore, the Ag-TiO2/Ag/a-TiO2 photocatalyst can be nominated as one of the effective and long-lasting antibacterial nanocomposite materials. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

There are many available patterns of combining the power flows to meet load requirements making it difficult to analyze and evaluate a newly designed HEV. In order to enhance design of HEVs, the paper provides a stand alone analytical framework for evaluating energy conversion phenomena of different HEV topologies. Analytical analysis is based on the energy balance equations and considers the complete energy path in the HEVs from the energy sources to the wheels and to other energy sinks. The analytical framework enables structuring large amount of data in physically meaningful energy flows and associated energy losses, and therefore provides insightful information for HEV optimization. It therefore enables identification of most suitable HEV topology and of most suitable power ratios of the components, since it reveals and quantifies the instruments that could lead to improved energy conversion efficiency of particular HEV. The analytical framework is also applicable for correcting the energy consumption of the HEV to the value corresponding to balanced energy content of the electric storage devices. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This need has facilitated the increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG) technologies and primarily of renewable energy sources (RES). The extensive use of such energy sources in today's electricity networks can indisputably minimize the threat of global warming and climate change. However, the power output of these energy sources is not as reliable and as easy to adjust to changing demand cycles as the output from the traditional power sources. This disadvantage can only be effectively overcome by the storing of the excess power produced by DG-RES. Therefore, in order for these new sources to become completely reliable as primary sources of energy, energy storage is a crucial factor. In this work, an overview of the current and future energy storage technologies used for electric power applications is carried out. Most of the technologies are in use today while others are still under intensive research and development. A comparison between the various technologies is presented in terms of the most important technological characteristics of each technology. The comparison shows that each storage technology is different in terms of its ideal network application environment and energy storage scale. This means that in order to achieve optimum results, the unique network environment and the specifications of the storage device have to be studied thoroughly, before a decision for the ideal storage technology to be selected is taken. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, programming all these devices efficiently requires too much specific knowledge about the devices, their hardware architectures and specific programming languages, details about system communication low-level protocols, and other tricky details at the system level. To address these issues, this paper describes and analyses two of the most interesting service-oriented architectures (SOA) available, which exhibit characteristics that are well adapted to industrial robotics cells. To compare, discuss and evaluate their programming features and applicability a test bed was specially designed, and the two SOA are fully implemented to program the test bed. Special focus is given to the way services are specified and to the orchestration tools used to manage system logic. The obtained results show clearly that using integrations schemes based on SOA reduces system integration time and are more adapted to industrial robotic cell system integrators. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The idea is to exploit the near-linear dependence among the eigenvectors of the virtual-virtual block of the second-order Møller-Plesset density matrix. It is shown that FNO-CASPT2 recovers more than 95% of the full CD-CASPT2 correlation energy while requiring only a fraction of the total virtual space, especially when large atomic orbital basis sets are in use.

A wide zone can be created over which power transfer is relatively constant. This gives good tolerance to the alignment of the pickup relative to the track allowing simple low-cost pickup structures to be used. While three-phase IPT tracks make the vehicle pickup and power transfer simpler, they are difficult for the power supply to drive due to the presence of mutual coupling between the track phases resulting from the physical layout of the track. These mutual inductances induce voltages within each track phase that, because of the inductor-capacitor-inductor network, cause large currents within the power supply inverter and imbalances within the system. This paper presents an analytical assessment of the problems caused by the interphase mutual inductance, and three possible solutions.

Instructions or instruction sequences in the code are replaced with short code words. These code words are later used to index a dictionary which contains the original uncompressed instruction or an entire sequence. In this paper, we present a new method which improves on code density compared to previously published dictionary methods. It uses a two-level dictionary design and is capable of handling compression of both individual instructions and code sequences of 2-16 instructions. The two dictionaries are in separate pipeline stages and work together to decompress sequences and instructions. The impact on storage size for the dictionaries is rather small as the sequences in the dictionary are stored as individually compressed instructions, instead of normal instructions. Compared to previous dictionary code compression methods we achieve improved dynamic compression rate, potential for better performance with reasonable static compression rate and with still small dictionary size suitable for context switching. © 2009 IEEE.","Code density-optimization; Code generation; Dictionary code compression","Code density; Code density-optimization; Code generation; Code sequences; Code-words; Context switching; Dictionary code compression; Dictionary codes; Dictionary method; Dynamic compression; Embedded application; Instruction codes; Instruction fetch; Short codes; Static compression; Network components; Optimization; Codes (symbols)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650566219

Particle size, phase composition, rutile and anatase crystal sizes as well as the blue coloration were controlled by rapid quenching of the flame with a critical flow nozzle placed at various heights above the burner. The particles showed a broad absorption in the near-infrared region and retained their blue color upon storage in ambient atmosphere. A high concentration of paramagnetic Ti 3+ centres was found in the substoichiometric particles by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Furthermore particles with controlled band gap energy from 3.2 to 3.6 eV were made by controlling the burner-nozzle-distance from 10 to 1 cm, respectively. The color robustness and extent of suboxidation could be further enhanced by co-oxidation of TTIP with hexamethyldisiloxane in the flame resulting in SiO2-coated titanium suboxide particles. The process is cost-effective and green while the particles produced can replace traditional blue colored, cobalt-containing pigments. © 2009 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649592650

The maximum temperature in the solar collector reached 85°C, which was 55°C above the ambient temperature. The required drying time was 4.5 h, much reduced from the traditional solar drying time of 48 h. The final moisture content of the Roselle calyx was 12% w.b., which is the recommended storage moisture content. Measurements of ambient temperature and humidity, air temperature, and relative humidity inside the dryer as well as solids moisture loss-in-weight data are employed as a means to study the performance of the dryer. Solar drying was compared with conventional sun drying and heated air drying, using the following evaluation criteria: drying time, dried Roselle color, texture, taste, and production cost. For evaluation, a model-based Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methodology was used. After the evaluation, the proposed continuous solar dryer was found to be better than conventional drying and heated air drying due to slower drying rate and better quality of the dried Roselle.","Low cost; Parabolic collector; Roselle calyx; Solar dryer; Thermodynamics system","Air temperature; Ambient temperatures; Conventional drying; Drying rates; Drying systems; Drying time; Evaluation criteria; Final moisture content; Heated air; Low cost; Maximum temperature; Model-based; Moisture contents; Moisture loss; Parabolic collector; Production cost; Relative humidities; Roselle calyx; Solar drying; Sun drying; Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions; Atmospheric humidity; Costs; Dewatering; Drying; Hemp; Hot air heating; Moisture; Moisture determination; Solar collectors; Solar dryers; Solar energy; Solar heating; Temperature; Thermodynamics; Curing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650306623

Current methods used to reduce evaporation from open-water impoundments such as foating covers, modular covers, monolayers and shade structures have many disadvantages and negative impacts on the environment. These methods impact the natural/modifed aquatic ecosystem established in the dam; alter aesthetic qualities; increase the risk of dam failure in times of food; could potentially lead to an oxygen reduction in the water; and may compromise the natural water treatment functions and operations such as the reduction of harmful bacteria, exposure to sunlight (form of disinfection) and natural and mechanical aeration thereby increasing treatment costs. The methodology proposed in this paper to help reduce evaporation losses from open-water impoundments, which indirectly addresses problems of water shortage and the associated economic impacts, involves the destratifcation of the water body using a bubble plume operated with minimal energy input to reduce surface water temperatures, with, a subsequent reduction in evaporation. The literature, although limited, indicates that this proposed method has merit and requires further research to identify specifc reservoirs (size, depth, usage) that could beneft from such a destratifcation system. Evaporation suppression of as high as 30 % was achieved in some case studies.","Bubble plume; Destratifcation; Evaporation reduction; Evaporation suppression","Aesthetic qualities; Aquatic ecosystem; Bubble plume; Bubble plumes; Dam failure; Deep reservoirs; Destratifcation; Economic impacts; Evaporation loss; Minimal energy; Negative impacts; Oxygen Reduction; Shade structures; Subsequent reduction; Surface water temperature; Thermal mixing; Treatment costs; Water shortages; Waterbodies; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Cold storage; Compressed air; Dams; Electrolytic reduction; Lead removal (water treatment); Monolayers; Oxygen; Reservoirs (water); Surface waters; Vapors; Water recycling; Water supply; Thermal evaporation; aeration; aquatic ecosystem; bubble; cost-benefit analysis; esthetics; evaporation; impoundment; mixing; open water; plume; reservoir; temperature effect; water supply; water technology; water treatment; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650291033

The first author and his co-workers previously presented two parameters cubic theoretical based equation of state (MMM). This equation was used in PVT and vapour-liquid-equilibrium (VLE) calculations of pure and fluid mixtures. The comparisons for the different pure and mixture fluids calculations indicated the advantages of this equation of state over the well-known empirical-based two parameters cubic equation of state (RK EOS). In this study, PVT data for binary, ternary, quaternary and multicomponent oil mixtures at the different temperature and ambient pressure are measured, and reported. The measured PVT data were compared with those obtained by using the simple cubic equations of state.

Although the Obama Administration's focus on nearer-term technologies is on the right track, there remains a need for continued investment in longer-term, higher-risk, higher-payoff vehicle technologies that could be highly transformational with regard to reduced use of petroleum and reduced emissions. Such technologies include advanced batteries, technologies for hydrogen storage, and hydrogen/fuel cells. For researchers, contractors, and investors to be willing to make long-term commitments to these and other potentially important developing technologies, a consistent year-to-year level of support must be provided. Other recommendations within this report include incorporating a broader-scope approach to better consider total emissions and the full environmental impact of using various fuels and technologies; providing temporary reductions in cost-share requirements to ease the burden on prospective researchers; and providing direct funding to struggling automotive companies to help keep important in-house research programs active.

Design/methodology/approach – A surface water resources management model is developed using dynamic programming. The model inputs are the hydrological inflows from the different wadis in the project area, reservoirs characteristics and evaporation rates, system water demands. The model outputs are water deficits at the different demand areas, reservoirs storage and release sequences, water transfers and energy requirements and the associated costs. The average annual values of different performance criteria with the annual frequency curves are used to evaluate the implications of different water scenarios on the ISGP. Findings – The results show the efficiency of the ISGP model in reducing the water deficits in the demand areas as compared to predevelopment conditions. Increased demand scenario showed the importance of finding new water projects to supplement the Southern Ghor Area in the future in order to meet the increasing water demands. The proposed water transfer will reduce the resulting deficits at the agricultural areas without the expenses of increasing the water deficits at other demand areas. The application of this model is expected to enhance decision making regarding water policies in Jordan. Originality/value – This paper provides critical quantitative information to decision makers in Jordan about the potential of the different storage facilities and proposed transfers in meeting the required water demands in the Southern Ghor Project and assesses the required energy for that. This can help decision makers to have a holistic view about the expected water deficits in the area and therefore assist them in determining the areas impacted most and what alternative solution to use. The paper also shows the importance of using optimal control/management models to support water resources decision making in Jordan. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Dams; Decision support systems; Jordan; Modelling; Reservoirs; Water retention and flow works",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993037409

One of the approaches to enhance the lifetime of WSN is to allow only some nodes in a cluster of sensor nodes, called cluster heads, to communicate with the base station. In this paper, we take a unique look at the cluster head election problem, specifically concentrating on Homogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks.

Additionally, they act directly or indirectly as signaling molecules and, when bonded to amino acid side chains of peptides, anchor proteins in biological membranes. In vertebrates, FAs are predominantly stored in the form of triacylglycerol (TG) within lipid droplets of white adipose tissue. Lipid droplet-associated TGs are also found in most nonadipose tissues, including liver, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle. The mobilization of FAs from all fat depots depends on the activity of TG hydrolases. Currently, three enzymes are known to hydrolyze TG, the well-studied hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and monoglyceride lipase (MGL), discovered more than 40 years ago, as well as the relatively recently identified adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). The phenotype of HSL- and ATGL-deficient mice, as well as the disease pattern of patients with defective ATGL activity (due to mutation in ATGL or in the enzyme's activator, CGI-58), suggest that the consecutive action of ATGL, HSL, and MGL is responsible for the complete hydrolysis of a TG molecule. The complex regulation of these enzymes by numerous, partially uncharacterized effectors creates the ""lipolysome,"" a complex metabolic network that contributes to the control of lipid and energy homeostasis. This review focuses on the structure, function, and regulation of lipolytic enzymes with a special emphasis on ATGL.

This compressor working between 0.02 and 3.3 MPa could be an alternative for a mechanical compressor. In laboratory experiments, a model of the hydride compressor was used (scale 1:13). The compressor model uses LaNi4.8Sn0.2 (45 kg) and LaNi4.25Al0.75 (3.5 kg) alloys closed in two separate containers equipped with heat exchangers. The alloys were being heated and cooled by oil flowing through the containers. It was noticed that penetration of hydrogen to the alloy bed situated in the lower part of the containers was not sufficient. The experiments have shown a high efficiency of heat exchangers mounted in the container with LaNi4.8Sn0.2 (finned tubes) and too small efficiency of heat exchangers mounted in the container with LaNi4.25Al0.75 (smooth tubes). The initial research of the stability of alloys subjected to many hydrogen absorption-desorption cycles (207 cycles) was carried out for 0.3-3.3 MPa pressure range (LaNi4.8Sn0.2 at 310-450 K) and 0.02-0.3 MPa (LaNi4.25Al0.75 at 315-410 K). The desorption isotherm for LaNi4.8Sn0.2 at 293 K was also determined. The experiments revealed that energy losses were too high to use the hydride compressor instead of a mechanical compressor in an industrial application.

Membrane integrity was assessed with the HOS test and ATP content using a bioluminescence method. The time of storage had a significant effect on all studied parameters. However, motility and ATP content were significantly more affected than membrane integrity. After 48-h of preservation, sperm motility percentage and ATP content dramatically decreased by over 50%, while percentage of spermatozoa positively reacting to the HOS test decreased by approximately 14%. A significant correlation was found between the percentage of motile spermatozoa and intracellular ATP content (r = 0.59). HOS test score was correlated with neither sperm motility percentage nor sperm ATP content. The present results indicate that compared to membrane integrity, assessed with the HOS test, sperm ATP content and motility are more sensitive indicators of the effect of storage time on rabbit semen.

These multistate island clusters not only provide model arrangements of frustrated Ising-type nanomagnets but are also interesting for data storage applications. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.",,"Cluster state; Co/Pt multilayer; Data storage applications; Dipolar couplings; Dipolar energy; Energy distributions; Energy state; Lower energies; Magnetic state; Monodomain; Multi state; Nano-islands; Nanomagnets; Perpendicular anisotropy; Photoemission electron microscopy; Triangular lattice; Demagnetization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649548125

The article then suggests a tariff system aimed at encouraging customers with an air conditioning load to cooperate with the electric utilities toward saving energy, achieving diversity between the original load and the air conditioning component, applying cooling energy storage systems, and efficiently controlling the starting time and duration. A system of inverted energy blocks and an exponential penalty function are recommended in order to encourage the customer to operate the air conditioning during daily time intervals far from the customer's original peak. Both the combined maximum demand and the demand charge increase almost linearly with the p.u. energy consumption of the air conditioning load. If the cooling energy is taken over durations longer than 20 hr/day, the demand charge will be reduced to about 80%, based on the case in which the original and the air conditioning load are coincident. The more than proportional increase in the energy bill will encourage the customer to adopt some measures in order to save cooling energy. For a certain required air conditioning energy, the total monthly bill depends strongly on its staring time. The advantage of starting the air conditioning load before 0700 or after 2000 could be seen. With the shifting of the air conditioning load, the customer will realize that a monthly savings of up to approximately 17% can be achieved. The total monthly bill can fluctuate between a value in excess of $220,000 and approximately $150,000/month, depending on the way the air conditioning is operated. It could be found that there is a duration for which the total bill reaches a minimum with an optimal duration of 11.9 hr. The customer has to adjust the operation scenario of air conditioning such that the entire cooling load will take place during the off-peak period of the system's load curve. This will encourage the user to consider and check the feasibility of using cooling energy storage systems that can enable such shifting of the air conditioning load. It can be recognized that the proposed tariff structure can be an effective tool for implementing the recommendations of some utilities in this regard.","Air conditioning; Demand-side management; Energy storage system; Load management; Peak demand reduction","Air conditioning load; Cooling energy; Cooling energy consumption; Cooling load; Demand-side management; Effective tool; Electric power networks; Energy bills; Energy consumption; Energy storage system; Exponential penalty function; Load curves; Load management; Maximum demand; Monthly bills; Off-peak periods; Peak demand reduction; Power systems; Saving energy; Tariff structures; Tariff systems; Time interval; Cooling; Cooling systems; Customer satisfaction; Electric load management; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Flywheels; Laws and legislation; Sales; Air conditioning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449553541

Those parameters are as follows: carbon or glass fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) versus stainless steel, configuration and amount of NSM reinforcement, confinement via local jacketing, and type of bonding agent (epoxy resin or mortar). The results demonstrate that NSM FRP and stainless steel reinforcement is a viable solution toward enhancing the flexural resistance of RC columns subjected to seismic loads.

The region is characterized by sandy soils. Their low water storage capacity and the consequent moisture contrasts in dry summers played an important role in the detection of over1000 Bronze Age funeral monuments through aerial archaeology in the past few decades. At Koekelare, low attenuation of GPR waves resulted in the detection of a double and single circular ditch. A flux gate gradiometer survey and electromagnetic induction (EMI) measurements did not clearly reveal the ditches. For the GPR wave velocity analysis, constant velocity migration tests were combined with time-domain reflectometry(TDR). The TDR measurements were made at different depths within the ditches and in the adjacent undisturbed soil, so that the differences in the physical soil parameters could be assessed. At a depth of approximately 0.45 to 0.8 m, the relatively homogeneous ditch fill produces few GPR reflections compared with the undisturbed soil, and is visible as a weak negative anomaly on the horizontal slices. At this depth, the grey or brownish black ditch fill was found inaugering samples, clearly distinguishable from the yellowish brown sandy soil outside the ditches. The transition between the ditch and the underlying soil caused a gradual reflection of radar energy at a depth of approximately 0.8 to1.2 m, although TDR showed no marked differences in relative permittivity between the ditches and the surrounding soil, and no clear steps as a function of depth. © 2009 JohnWiley & Sons, Ltd.","Aerial archaeology; Augering; Bronze age funeral monuments; Ground-penetrating radar; Time-domain reflectometry; Wave velocity analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349467834

This flexibility could attract small municipal districts, buyers in developing countries where the transmission systems cannot handle conventional larger reactors, and could even draw the attention of industrial users with independent on-site generation needs. This potential decentralization and expansion of nuclear power and the fuel and waste that goes with it is likely to cause concern but according to B&W, its onsite fuel containment concept should diminish fears and minimize licensing challenges. The reactors are designed to be contained below ground with sufficient storage space to hold enough new and spent fuel to last its 60-yr lifespan. The design will be operated for 5 yr on one batch of fuel and this cut the cost of operating the plant.

The seasonal reproductive dynamics of both the species was investigated by taking into account the gonadosomatic index (GSI) and visual maturity data as a function of female size for the period 1993-1999, and also the seasonal pattern in condition factor per size classes. Larger females of common sardine (repeat spawners) have a reproductive peak earlier in the season than younger females at first maturity, while larger anchovy have a reproductive peak delayed as compared with first-time spawners. The condition factor of females exhibited an inverse cycle with the seasonal pattern of GSI, and delayed by approximately 6 months. Although larger females tend to present better and wider condition than smaller females, the condition of females seems to be delayed in larger females probably mediated by the seasonal pattern in food availability. This ""energy storage strategy"" in spring and summer time seems to be size-dependent and past energetic reserves could also affect the egg production and timing of reproduction. We concluded that the reproductive season of anchovy and common sardine is different and mediated by the length structure in the seasonal upwelling system off central southern Chile. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",,"breeding season; clupeoid; food availability; maturation; pelagic fish; reproductive strategy; spawning; teleost; Chile; South America; Engraulidae; Engraulis ringens; Strangomera bentincki",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349195440

Methods and Results: After incubation with the protectants glucose, sucrose, trehalose, and maltodextrin the concentrated bacterial suspensions were subjected to fluidized bed drying and lyophilization and subsequently stored at 4, 22, and 35°C for half a year. Lactobacillus plantarum turned out to be more sensitive to both drying methods than Ent. faecium. Without the addition of a protectant cells of both strains suffered higher losses during fluidized bed drying. Elevated storage temperatures correlate with a higher decline of viable bacterial cells. Conclusions: Although survival rates varied between the strains, the nonreducing disaccharides revealed overall best protection for both investigated lactic acid bacteria during processing and storage. The addition of protective carbohydrates can prevent the decline in viability during fluidized bed drying. Significance and Impact of the Study: The influence of protectants proved to be species specific and therefore needs to be determined on a case-to-case basis.

Storage of heat is effected through the use of a heat transfer fluid. The resultant mathematical formulation exhibits a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) structure, which yields a globally optimal solution for a predefined storage size. The concept of heat integration in batch plants with the objective of minimising energy use is indeed an aspect of cleaner production that has received very limited attention in published literature. This is largely because batch plants are perceived to be less energy-intensive compared to their continuous production counterparts which is untrue for some batch operations, like dairy and brewing processes; hence the need for dedicated techniques. Application of the proposed method to an agrochemical facility has shown savings of more than 75% in external utility steam consumption. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

CCS is widely seen as one of the essential interim technologies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, while still being able to utilize fossil fuels, which are relatively inexpensive and reliable in comparison to inherently low-carbon renewable resources. However, retrofitting power plants for CCS entails major capital costs as well as a reduction of thermal efficiency and power output. Thus, it is essential for planning purposes to implement the minimal extent of CCS retrofit that meets the sectoral carbon footprint targets. At the same time, it is necessary to plan for additional power generation capacity or efficiency enhancements to compensate for energy losses resulting from CCS retrofits. The simple graphical approach used in this paper is designed to determine such targets, and shares the same intuitive, insight-driven characteristics of pinch analysis techniques.

This paper analyses and evaluates this approach. The main goal is to provide quantitative forecasts for various performance measures of waste management systems. They include availability, downtimes, number of failures, and cost. Evaluation of these measures is important for optimal decision making.

To this aim, dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated using nanostructured TiO2 thin films and an organic dye as a sensitizer. Aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles was observed when paste was stored until deposition affecting film's porosity and surface roughness factor and as a consequence, reducing the efficiency of the solar cells. On the other hand, fewer cracks were developed during the drying process of the film when stored paste was used for film deposition instead of freshly prepared paste. This is due to the presence of large pores on films with significant particle agglomeration, which enhance evaporation of acetyl acetone and water, thereby reducing cracks. The development of cracks on the film's surface results to a decrease in the efficiency of the cell, albeit a slight one. One of the main aims of the present study was also the investigation of different methods for developing counter electrodes, as the properties of the counter electrodes can affect the efficiency of the solar cells considerably. Counter electrodes were prepared by two different methods, namely by electrodeposition using an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (0.002 M) and by thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 from isopropanol (5 mM).

Such Solar Hydroelectric Power Plant (SHE) uses solar energy as the only input for production of solar and hydro energy. Thereat, water reservoir serves for daily and seasonal energy storage, thus basically solving the problem of energy storage, which is the biggest problem of wider use of solar energy. The most expensive part of SHE is the PV generator, whose optimal sizing is essential for providing energetic independence of a settlement or isolated consumer. A systematic approach that includes all relevant elements of this system has been implemented for optimal sizing of the PV power plant. The developed model was used in analysis of certain parameters of the SHE system. The results of the analysis show the system characteristics and that the proposed model describes the operation of the power plant very well. The feasibility and characteristics of the power plant were tested on electric energy supply of the island of Vis in Croatia. It has been established that the system is real, feasible and can be very successfully applied on different locations, for different consumers and can vary in size. The prerequisite for realization of such system is the construction of a modified reversible HE power plant.

This paper investigates the innovative ways for transforming the coal in addition with renewable energy sources (biomass), through gasification into different energy vectors (power, hydrogen, heat etc.) simultaneous with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). Lately, solid fuel gasification is extensively evaluated being one of the energy conversion technologies having the highest potential to capture CO2 with low penalties in efficiency and cost. Also, gasification, compared with other technologies, has very good potential to generate by thermo-chemical conversion various energy vectors apart from power (e.g. hydrogen, substitute natural gas, liquid fuels etc.). The innovative energy conversion processes investigated in the paper were modeled and simulated using commercial process flow modeling software (ChemCAD) for technical evaluation of poly-generation processes (focused on poly-generation processes of power, hydrogen and heat) based on gasification with carbon capture and storage. The case studies investigated in the paper will produce a flexible ratio between power and hydrogen (in the range of about 400 MW electricity and 0 - 200 MW hydrogen) with more than 90 % carbon capture rate (design assumptions).

For a small number of encapsulated nitrogens, the N2 species exist in a nonbonded state within the cavities and form well defined molecular conformations such as linear chains, zigzag arrays, as well as both spheroidal and tubular configurations. However, with increasing the number of stored molecules, the interaction among the confined nitrogens as well as between the N2 species and the fullerene wall is not always mainly repulsive. Actually, at high densities of the encapsulated gas, we found both adsorption of N2 to the inner carbon surface together with the formation of (N2) m molecular clusters. Total energy DFT calculations reveal that the shape of the interaction potential of a test molecule moving within the carbon cavities strongly varies with the number and proximity of the coadsorbed N2 from being purely repulsive to having short-range attractive contributions close to the inner wall. In particular, the latter are always found when a group of closely spaced nitrogens is located near the carbon cage (a fact that will naturally occur at high densities of the encapsulated gas), inducing the formation of covalent bonds between the N2 and the fullerene network. Interestingly, in some cases, the previous nitrogen adsorption to the inner surface is reversible by reducing the gas pressure. The calculated average density of states of our considered carbon compounds reveals the appearance of well defined features that clearly reflect the occurring structural changes and modifications in the adsorption properties in the systems. Our results clearly underline the crucial role played by confinement effects on the reactivity of our endohedral compounds, define this kind of materials as nonideal nanocontainers for high density nitrogen storage applications, and must be taken into account when analyzing the diffusion properties of the encapsulated species. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.",,"Adsorption properties; Carbon cages; Carbon compounds; Carbon fullerenes; Carbon surface; Confinement effects; Density functional theory calculations; Density of state; DFT calculation; Diffusion properties; Endohedral; Endohedral compounds; Gas pressures; High density; Inner surfaces; Inner walls; Interaction potentials; Linear chain; Molecular clusters; Molecular conformation; Nanocontainers; Nitrogen adsorption; Nitrogen molecule; Nitrogen storages; Nonideal; Pseudopotential; Structural change; Test molecules; Total energy; Zigzag array; Chemical reactivity; Chemisorption; Density functional theory; Fullerenes; Gases; Molecules; Nitrogen; Physisorption; Probability density function; Sulfur compounds; Walls (structural partitions); Gas adsorption; carbon; fullerene derivative; nitrogen; adsorption; article; chemical model; chemical structure; chemistry; computer simulation; gas; pressure; surface property; Adsorption; Carbon; Computer Simulation; Fullerenes; Gases; Models, Chemical; Molecular Structure; Nitrogen; Pressure; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649130204

By covering the yoke with thermal insulation, 4.3 kW was collected at a temperature of 320 oC, which is interesting with a view to electricity production from waste heat.

The results showed exclusion of short chain branches from the crystallites leading to their perfection by decrease in the melt cooling rate. Accordingly, samples' ESCR increased because of the aforementioned crystal thickening. In addition, quantitative evaluation of crystal strength was performed for the first time by microhardness technique. Crystal strength or the required energy for plastic deformation of unit area of the crystals, Δh-lc, complemented crystal thickening hypothesis. The product of Δh and average crystal thickness, lc, was also proportional with storage modulus of the samples at ESCR test temperature. The evaluation of the results using the recently proposed model based on the analogy of crack growth through amorphous phase of semicrystalline polymers in harsh environments with crack growth at adhesive polymer-substrate interfaces showed reasonably good correlation.

The critical micelle concentration and the Gibbs energy of the surfactants were determined and discussed. For the first time, the surfactants were used to stabilize three-component olein oil-in-water high internal phase emulsions, with an oil volume fraction of 0.85, and which were easily prepared by one-pot homogenization. Proof of high stability was confirmed by the satisfactory rheological profiles and further enhanced by a three-month storage exercise at an elevated temperature which showed no significant physical and rheological changes. These results suggest that low concentration of the surfactants efficiently stabilized the emulsions with high content of oil. Based on the optical micrograph observation, an average droplet size of less than 10 μm increased with increasing ethylene oxide chain length and temperature. The varying degree of viscosity resulted from the various ethylene oxide chain lengths of the surfactants. The hydration efficacy of the emulsions was examined in vivo using a corneometer. The impressive hydration efficacy of olein oil suggests that it could well be a potential moisturizing lipid which might interest dermatologists. © AOCS 2009.","High internal phase emulsion; Hydration; Olein oil; Palm-based surfactants; Rheology","Elevated temperature; High internal phase emulsions; Hydrophile-lipophile balance; Low concentrations; Olein oil; Optical micrographs; Rheological change; Rheological profiles; Chain length; Critical micelle concentration; Dermatology; Emulsification; Hydration; Nonionic surfactants; Rheology; Palm oil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950951978

The power generated in electronic chips is dissipated in phase change material (PCM) (neicosane with melting temperature Tm= 36°C) that filled a rectangular enclosure. The advantage of using this cooling strategy is that the PCMs are able to absorb a high amount of heat generated by electronic component (EC) without acting the fan, during the charging process (melting of the PCM). A two-dimensional mathematical model was developed in order to analyze and optimize a heat sink. The governing equations for masse, momentum, and energy transport were developed and discretized by using the volume control approach. The resulting algebraic equations were next solved iteratively by using tri diagonal matrix algorithm. A series of numerical investigations were conducted in order to examine the effects of the heat generation based Rayleigh number, Ra, and the position of the bottom electronic component, Lh, on the thermal behavior of the proposed cooling system.

But, there are many parameters that affect solar water heater thermal performance. Tilt angle and orientation are considered as an important factors influencing, not only the thermal performance, but also the heat energy acquired by the solar system. Four identical solar water heaters were situated on the roof of Agricultural Engineering Department to investigate, under clear sky conditions, the effect of tilt angle and orientation on solar water heater thermal performance. They were mounted individually on movable frames which could be adjusted so that at any time the angle of incidence of the surface of the solar heater and the sun's rays could be set at zero. Water could be continually cycled through the SWH. After passing through the SWH, the heater water was stored in an insulated storage tank. The obtained result clarified that the solar heater which tracked the sun's rays once each half an hour from sunrise to sunset was more efficient than the other solar heaters. Overall thermal efficiencies for SWH1, SWH2, SWH3, and SWH4 were on average 72.83 %, 65.85 %, 61.60 %, and 55.98 %, respectively.",,"Angle of Incidence; Clear sky; Egyptians; Flat plate; Heat energy; Solar heater; Storage tank; Thermal efficiency; Thermal Performance; Tilt angle; Agricultural engineering; Heating equipment; Industrial applications; Mixed convection; Solar heating; Solar system; Solar water heaters; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76249095218

We show that hepatic type-I deiodinase (D1) is not affected by energy restriction, however, hepatic D2 is decreased on both transcriptional and enzyme activity levels. Furthermore, hepatic D3 is increased after feed restriction in the liver. We also show that the hypothalamic feedback is not involved in the changes in serum T 3 and T 4 concentrations.

A parametric study of heat exchanges between the PCM and flow (expressed by the Nusselt number) is reported for Reynolds numbers between 125 and 1000. The pitch to diameter ratios (PDRs) are varied and the Prandtl number is fixed at 0.71. The PCM melting time is predicted for the examined range of Reynolds numbers and PDRs. Plots of the velocity flow field and isotherms are presented. Results are compared favourably with published numerical results. The results indicated that the Reynolds number has a significant effect on the PCM melting time, whereas the PDR has an insignificant effect.","Cylinders array; Forced convection; Phase change materials","Cylinders array; Energy storage systems; Heat exchange; In-line; Melting time; Numerical results; Parametric study; Pitch-to-diameter ratios; Thermal analysis; Thermal behaviours; Transient forced convection; Transient laminar flow; Velocity flow; Atmospheric temperature; Buoyancy; Cylinders (shapes); Fluid dynamics; Forced convection; Heat exchangers; Laminar flow; Pulse code modulation; Reynolds number; Thermoanalysis; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650080550

The description and analysis of positive or negative soil-water stresses are the preconditions of the efficient control of their mechanisms, reversible and/or irreversible consequences. The most significant soil-water stress is extreme moisture regime: water surplus (flood, water-logging, over-moistening) or water deficiency (drought). Their main reasons are the irregular atmospheric precipitation; limited water infiltration into and storage within the soil; high evaporation, surface runoff and filtration losses. In addition to the direct impacts the consequences are the changes in the mass and energy regime of soils and in their biogeochemical cycles.

We studied the influence on the properties of the films of the pH control of the reaction solution. For this, we deposited two types of CdS films employing two different types of reaction solutions. The only difference between both reaction solutions was the addition of a pH buffer in one of them in order to control its pH throughout the deposition process. Several sets of CdS films were deposited from growth solutions with different contents of Cd to determine also the influence of this parameter on the properties of the films. The CdS films were studied by X-ray diffraction, optical transmission and reflection spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy measurements. We found that the properties of the films depend both on the amount of Cd in the growth solutions and on their pH control. The increase in Cd in the reaction solution yields to films with shorter lattice constant and then higher energy band gap. On the other hand, the pH control of the reaction produces higher deposition rate, larger final thickness and higher energy band gaps in the CdS films. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","A.

The structure, morphology, chemical composition and dehydriding properties were investigated by XRD, SEM, EDS, DTA-TG and the volumetric Sievert method. The commercial MgH 2 and Si powder mixture corresponded to the stoichiometry of the ideal Mg 2Si intermetallic compound was ball-milled under argon atmosphere to reach a nanocrystalline composite structure (&lt;50 nm). The ball-milling of the MgH 2-Si mixture leads to the formation only a small amount of the Mg 2Si compound. Microstructural studies showed that Si after ball-milling is heterogeneously distributed on the surface of MgH 2 particles and incorporated in the nanocrystalline MgH 2 matrix, forming a nanocomposite structure. The sluggish destabilization of MgH 2 by solid-state reaction with Si forming the Mg 2Si intermetallic compound was observed at 250 °C. The XRD and EDS analysis confirmed that the Mg 2Si compound is formed after the dehydrogenation of the synthesized MgH 2-Si composite. The activation energy of the destabilization reaction for the investigated composite significantly decreased (162 kJ/mol) as compared with unmilled MgH 2-Si powder mixture (213 kJ/mol).

By using Dimethylformamide (DMF) in electrolyte, regular structures and columns were formed and porosity increased. Our results showed that by using DMF, surface resistivity of PS samples increased and became double for free-standing porous silicon (FPS). The reason could be due to increasing surface area and adsorbing some more gas molecules. Activation energy of PS samples was also increased from 0.31 to 0.34 eV and became 0.35 eV for FPS.

These products are important energy substrates, precursors for other lipids, or lipid signaling molecules. Following their discovery by Hollenberg, C.H., Raben, M.S., and Astwood, E.B.(1961) and Vaughan, M., Berger, J.E., and Steinberg, D. (1964), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and monoacylglycerol lipase stayed in the focus of research for three decades. Within the last decade, however, it became evident that the lipolytic pathway is incompletely understood. Studies on the regulation of lipolysis and the characterization of HSL-deficient mice indicated that additional previously unrecognized factors that contribute to fat catabolism must exist. This led to the discovery of the perilipin, adipophilin, Tip47 (PAT) family of lipid droplet binding proteins and the identification of a novel TG hydrolase named adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). This review focuses on the importance of ATGL as TG lipase within the ""lipolytic machinery"" and the current knowledge of molecular mechanisms that regulate ATGL activity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The adipose tissue has an important function in energy storage, and plays an endocrine role through the production of several hormones and growth factors. There are few studies in humans regarding IGF-I and Insulin receptor signaling in adipocytes, particularly from AGA and SGA children. Methods: We studied 22 healthy prepubertal children (6.1 ± 0.4 years), born at term (11 SGA and 11 AGA), and normal BMI at the time of the study. Primary cell cultures were established from subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies. Preadipocytes were differentiated and stimulated with IGF-I or insulin and we studied IGF-IR, IR, AKT, and ERK content and phosphorylation. Results: The SGA children were shorter than the AGA children (height SDS -2.14 ± 0.11 vs. 0.02 ± 0.19, p < 0.05). A lower content of IGF-IR, IR, AKT, and ERK was observed in adipocytes from SGA compared with AGA children. IGF-I stimulation increased IGF-IR and ERK phosphorylation in adipocytes from AGA, but not from SGA children.

Four AC/DC thyristor rectifiers provide the desired current profiles in toroidal and poloidal coil systems. The start-up circuit, which provides a loop voltage necessary for the plasma generation, is based on fully solid-state switchers and two temporarily inserted resistors.

The model assumes local thermal equilibrium between the gas and solid phases, and incorporates the pressure and temperature-dependent hydrogen reaction rates, as well as heat transfer in the porous metal hydride bed. The model was verified through experimental data. The experiments were performed using a unit with hydrogen storage capacity of 130 Nl H2; the store was submerged in an isothermal water bath. Experiments at different water bath temperatures and charge/discharge hydrogen pressures indicated a relation between charge/discharge time and these parameters. The reactor's ability to deliver a constant hydrogen flow at different water bath temperatures was experimentally investigated. During simulations it was found that the model applied is sensitive to perturbations of some of its parameters; activation energy of absorption, effective conductivity and heat of reaction were found to be the most important ones.

The molecular bases that govern the recognition between carbohydrates and proteins have not been fully understood yet. In the present study, we have obtained a surface-area-based model for the formation heat capacity of protein-carbohydrate complexes, which includes separate terms for the contributions of the two molecular types. The carbohydrate model, which was calibrated using carbohydrate dissolution data, indicates that the heat capacity contribution of a given group surface depends on its position in the saccharide molecule, a picture that is consistent with previous experimental and theoretical studies showing that the high abundance of hydroxy groups in carbohydrates yields particular solvation properties. This model was used to estimate the carbohydrate's contribution in the formation of a protein-carbohydrate complex, which in turn was used to obtain the heat capacity change associated with the protein's binding site. The model is able to account for protein-carbohydrate complexes that cannot be explained using a previous model that only considered the overall contribution of polar and apolar groups, while allowing a more detailed dissection of the elementary contributions that give rise to the formation heat capacity effects of these adducts. © The Authors Journal compilation.","Carbohydrate; Hydration; Lectin; Molecular recognition; Structural energetics; Surface area model","Area-based; Cellular recognition; Formation heat; Heat capacities; Heat capacity change; Hydroxy groups; In-process; Lectin; Living cell; Molecular basis; Molecular type; Non-covalent interaction; Saccharide molecules; Solvation properties; Storage devices; Structural energetics; Surface area model; Theoretical study; Binding energy; Binding sites; Dissolution; Hydration; Molecular biology; Molecular recognition; Proteins; Specific heat; Carbohydrates; 1,3 propanediol; 1,4 butanediol; 1,5 pentanediol; 1,6 hexanediol; alcohol; arabinitol; butanol; carbohydrate; cyclohexanol; ethylene glycol; glycerol; hexanol; mannitol; methanol; pentanol; propanol; protein; ribitol; sorbitol; unclassified drug; xylitol; disaccharide; article; binding site; carbohydrate analysis; complex formation; controlled study; dissolution; hydroxylation; molecular model; molecular recognition; priority journal; protein analysis; protein carbohydrate interaction; solvation; structure analysis; surface property; thermodynamics; algorithm; chemical model; chemical structure; chemistry; protein binding; Algorithms; Carbohydrates; Disaccharides; Models, Chemical; Molecular Structure; Protein Binding; Proteins; Surface Properties; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66549116707

The aim of the concept is to obtain an easy to handle fuel with near-zero CO2 emission and reduced land-use requirements compared to first and second generation biofuels. The concept's key feature is the use of high-temperature heat from a solar concentrating tower to drive the chemical process of converting biomass toabiofuel, obtaining a near-complete utilization of carbon atoms in the biomass. H2 from water electrolysis with solar power is used for reverse water gas shift to avoid producing CO2 during the process. In a chemical process simulation, we compare the solar biofuel concept with two other advanced synfuel concepts: second generation biofuel and coal-to-liquid, both using gasification technology and capture and storage of CO2 generated in the fuel production. The solar-driven third generation biofuel requires only 33% of the biomass input and 38% of total land as the second generation biofuel, while still exhibiting a CO 2-neutral fuel cycle. With CO2 capture, second generation biofuel would lead to the removal of 50% of the carbon in the biomass from the atmosphere. There is a trade-off between reduced biomass feed costs and the increased capital requirements for the solar-driven process; it is attractive at intermediate biomass and CO2 prices. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"3rd generation; Biomass Gasification; Capital requirements; Carbon atoms; Chemical process; Chemical process simulation; Energy source; Fuel cycle; Fuel production; Gasification technologies; High temperature; Key feature; New concept; Reverse water gas shift; Second generation; Solar power; Third generation; Water electrolysis; Biofuels; Biomass; Chemical engineering; Coal storage; Gas generators; Gasification; Hydrogen; Land use; Metal recovery; Oxygen; Solar energy; biofuel; hydrogen; biofuel; biomass; concentration (composition); electrokinesis; high temperature; land use; solar power; temperature effect; trade-off; article; biomass; electrolysis; energy resource; gasification; high temperature; simulation; solar energy; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Biomass; Coal; Models, Theoretical; Solar Energy; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66249089503

Fitness of an individual then depends on decisions made concerning energy allocation to particular life-history traits in a given environment. In reptiles and other ectotherms, individuals on a poor diet commonly reach smaller size and invest less in reproduction, but they often produce larger eggs than well-fed individuals. Several lineages of reptiles including geckos have evolved an invariant clutch size as a derived mode of reproduction. Gecko females produce maximally two large eggs per clutch, but clutches are unusually frequent. Therefore, geckos serve as an interesting group for studying the generality of nutrition-dependent plasticity in life-history. In a laboratory experiment, we manipulated diet in adult females of the Madagascar ground gecko Paroedura picta. Both food-limited and well-fed females followed the same growth trajectory in body and head length. In contrast, allocation to reproduction was highly nutrition-dependent. Although females in both treatment groups reproduced, food-limited females compromised both quantity and quality of their progeny: they laid clutches of smaller eggs in longer intervals. Fat storage was formed only in well-fed females. We propose that the results are best explained by the consecutive hierarchical allocation of resources to growth, reproduction and storage, and discuss the consequences for investigation of life-history trade-offs. © 2008 British Ecological Society.","Canalization; Egg size; Geckos; Nutrition; Phenotypic plasticity; Reproduction","canalization (biology); clutch size; ectothermy; egg size; fitness; food limitation; laboratory method; life history trait; lizard; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive productivity; resource allocation; trade-off; Gekkonidae; Paroedura picta; Reptilia; Squamata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66149161459

In animal models, CD was recorded under partial or complete ischemia as well as when cortical spreading depression (SD) was induced externally or by internal stimulus. The development of CD in patients and the changes in various metabolic parameters, during CD, was rarely reported. Brain metabolic, hemodynamic, ionic and electrical responses to the CD event are dependent upon the O2 balance in the tissue. When the O2 balance is negative (i.e. ischemia), the CD process will be developed due to mitochondrial dysfunction, lack of energy and the inhibition of Na +-K+-ATPase. In contradiction, when oxygen is available (i.e. normoxia) the development of CD after induction of SD will accelerate mitochondrial respiration for retaining ionic homeostasis and normal brain functions. We used the multiparametric monitoring approach that enable real time monitoring of mitochondrial NADH redox state, microcirculatory blood flow and oxygenation, extracellular K+, Ca2+, H+ levels, DC steady potential and electrocorticogram (ECoG). This monitoring approach, provide a unique tool that has a significant value in analyzing the pathophysiology of the brain when SD developed under normoxia, ischemia, or hypoxia.

Kennedy 7, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia","Understanding forces that contribute to the success of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is very important, as these enterprises are vital for both developed and developing economies. Since innovativeness is among the most important means through which such businesses contribute to economic growth, numerous research studies were conducted to determine which factors positively impact SME's innovative efforts. This is an even more important issue for developing economies, where SMEs are often faced with inadequate infrastructure. Since there is a lack of studies on SME innovation in developing economies, often policy in such countries is based on findings from developed countries. In this paper, we explore factors that drive innovation activities in SMEs in a small emerging transition economy (Croatia), and compare it with findings from developed economies. In addition to factors used in most previous studies, we consider market scope, firm's market orientation and presence of strategic, managerial and marketing changes. We find that most factors that were found to be important in developed economies are important in developing economies as well. In addition to that, market scope was discovered to be a very important factor in both product and process innovation. Implementing corporate changes has positive impact on radical product innovation while implementing new organizational structures has positive effect on incremental innovation. When investigating determinants of product innovation, we distinguish new products of low novelty from new products of high novelty, and show that they need to be supported by different policies. To gain additional insight in innovation efforts, we examine obstacles to innovation. We find that firms that report facing obstacles are not less likely to innovate less, which suggests that innovators are able to work around obstacles without damaging effects to innovation.

In spite of these uncertainties and barriers, the CCS research community is generally very optimistic regarding CCS' development. The discrepancy between the uncertainties and the optimism is the point of departure in this study, which is based on interviews with 24 CCS experts. The aim is to analyse experts' framings of CCS with focus on two key aspects: (i) the function and potential of CCS and (ii) uncertainties. The optimism among the CCS experts is tentatively explained. The interpretative flexibility of CCS is claimed to be an essential explanation for the optimism. CCS is promoted from a wide variety of perspectives, e.g., solidarity and peace, bridge to a sustainable energy system, sustaining the modern lifestyle and compatibility with the fossil fuel lock-in. Awareness of the uncertainties and potential over-optimism is warranted within policy and decision making as they often rely on scientific forecasts and experts' judgements. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The SWHS was composed of a heating tank (HT), a hot water storage tank (ST) and an overhead tank (OT). The HT together with a specially designed valve act as a novel thermal water pump that gets power from hot water vapor and air pressure produced by a built-in electric heater in order to transfer heat from the HT to ST. The general operation of this pump has four stages for each cycle: heating, water circulating, vapor circulating and water supplying. The discharge water heads were varied with an increment of 0.25 m from 0.75 to 3 m. According to the experiment, it was found that the pump could operate at an average HT temperature of about 80-95 °C leading to 70-80 °C ST temperatures and 20-35 pumping cycles and consumed 17 MJ energy input during 9-h period.

Since the oil crisis of 1973, considerable progress has been made in the search for alternative energy sources. Among the candidates, hydrogen holds a pre-eminent position because of its high energy content, environmental compatibility and ease of storage and distribution. Hydrogen can be produced in a variety of ways. Water electrolysis is one of the most utilized industrial processes for hydrogen production. This article discusses advantages and disadvantages of hydrogen energy. Besides, barriers and challenges to hydrogen economy have been summarized. The current energy situation in Pakistan is presented followed by a road map to hydrogen economy in Pakistan. It is concluded that a combination of fuel cells and a hydrogen infrastructure is a way forward to combat the long-term challenges of climate change and energy security for Pakistan. The hydrogen economy potentially offers the possibility to deliver a range of benefits for the country; however, significant challenges exist and these are unlikely to be overcome without serious efforts. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Renewable energy systems were simulated using HOMER, the load profile of a hostel in Cameroon, the solar insolation of Garoua and the flow of river Mungo. For a 40% increase in the cost of imported power system components, the cost of energy was found to be either 0.352 €/kWh for a 5 kW pico-hydro generator with 72 kWh storage or 0.396 €/kWh for a 3 kWp photovoltaic generator with 36 kWh storage. These energy costs were obtained with a biomass resource cost of 25 €/tonne. The pH and PV hybrid systems both required the parallel operation of a 3.3 kW battery inverter with a 10 kW biogas generator. The pH/biogas/battery systems simulated for villages located in the south of Cameroon with a flow rate of at least 92 l/s produced lower energy costs than PV/biogas/battery systems simulated for villages in the north of Cameroon with an insolation level of at least 5.55 kWh/m2/day. For a single-wire grid extension cost of 5000 €/km, operation and maintenance costs of 125 €/yr/km and a grid power price of 0.1 €/kWh, the breakeven grid extension distances were found to be 12.9 km for pH/biogas/battery systems and 15.2 km for PV/biogas/battery systems respectively.

Morphological studies on ceria show the presence of various defect sites, both cerium and oxygen vacancies, which are believed to be the reason for the catalytic activity of the substrate. Of these defect sites, the reported calculations clearly show the preference for platinum to bind in cerium vacancies, as opposed to a defect-free surface or an oxygen deficiency site. Currently there are two main pathways proposed for this mechanism: a direct redox pathway and a formate-intermediate pathway. In both scenarios the initial step is the same: the oxygen storage capacity of ceria provides the oxygen necessary to oxidize CO into CO2; water then adsorbs and is dissociated in these oxygen vacancies helping reform the ceria surface. The key difference between the two mechanisms is either the desorption of CO2 and the formation of H2 when a second water molecule adsorbs at a site where water had been previously dissociated (catalyzed by platinum), or the formation of a formate species from the interaction of the adsorbed CO2 with adjacent water molecules. Energy pathways are mapped for both processes, demonstrating the preference toward the initial direct redox pathway. However, the resulting formation of adsorbed hydroxide species in the oxygen vacancies adjacent to the platinum hinders this pathway. A bifunctional mechanism is then presented as a means to remove these species and thereby form formate. The activation of these adsorbed hydroxides is also studied. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"A-density; Adsorbed CO; Bifunctional mechanisms; Catalytic activity; Defect sites; Defect-free surfaces; Energy pathway; Morphological study; Oxygen deficiency; Oxygen storage capacity; Water molecule; Water-gas shift reactions; Water-gas shifts; Carbon monoxide; Catalyst activity; Cerium; Cerium compounds; Density functional theory; Desorption; Molecules; Oxygen; Platinum; Surface defects; Time varying systems; Wave functions; Oxygen vacancies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66149174579

There have been limited attempts to grow high quality MnO2 thin films where high pressure and low substrate temperature are targeted to promote the formation of this phase. In this work, we have exploited the flexibility of Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) in order to synthesize thin films of MnO2 on Si substrates by laser ablation of a MnO target in oxygen gas ambient. Substrate temperature was varied from 25 to 800 °C aiming to grow films of good crystalline quality while investigating the temperature range where MnO2 phase is expected to be stable. We have also investigated the effect of oxygen pressure which was varied from 10 to 500 mTorr. X-ray diffraction and Fourier Transform Infra-Red analyses have confirmed the formation of the MnO2 phase for pressures above 250 mTorr, and an optimal deposition temperature of 500 °C, while Mn2O3 is obtained in the range between 550 and 650 °C.

There is greater H2 adsorption inside the carbon nanotube than in the interstitial space between the graphene layer and the carbon nanotube. The results are compared with the way the H2 molecule is adsorbed upon a lonely graphene layer and inside or outside the (6,6) carbon nanotube. It is studied if in the interstitial space close to the middle point between the wall and the graphene layer the hydrogen molecule could be adsorbed with a greater binding energy that in any other case. This was not possible for the selected supercell, but there are given some suggestions to be explored (using a nanotube with smaller radii or increasing the size of the supercell), that perhaps can optimize the binding energy for H2 adsorption. A general result is that the size of the cubic supercell can be selected to confine not only hydrogen inside the carbon nanotube but also in the interstitial space between the carbon nanotube wall and the graphene layer. It is believed that the studied system or a modification of this could sooner or later be used in a competitive way in comparison with other H2 storage materials respect to the hydrogen adsorption and desorption process. © (2009) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Carbon nanotube; Carbonaceous systems; Graphene; Hydrogen adsorption; Molecular hydrogen","Carbon nanotube walls; Carbonaceous systems; Desorption process; Graphene; Graphene layers; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen molecules; Interstitial spaces; Middle points; Molecular hydrogen; Planar graphene; Storage materials; Super cells; Theoretical studies; Binding energy; Binding sites; Desorption; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Nuclear energy; Potential energy; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65649132358

However, phenotypic characterization of these mice and embryo fibroblasts derived from them, has established the role of these modifications in the regulation of the size of several cell types, as well as pancreatic β-cell function and glucose homeostasis. A relatively passive behavior of these mice has raised the possibility that they suffer from muscle weakness, which has, indeed, been confirmed by a variety of physical performance tests. Methodology/Principal Findings: A large variety of experimental methodologies, including morphometric measurements of histological preparations, high throughput proteomic analysis, positron emission tomography (PET) and numerous biochemical assays, were used in an attempt to establish the mechanism underlying the relative weakness of rpS6P-/- muscles. Collectively, these experiments have demonstrated that the physical inferiority appears to result from two defects: a) a decrease in total muscle mass that reflects impaired growth, rather than aberrant differentiation of myofibers, as well as a diminished abundance of contractile proteins; and b) a reduced content of ATP and phosphocreatine, two readily available energy sources. The abundance of three mitochondrial proteins has been shown to diminish in the knockin mouse. However, the apparent energy deficiency in this genotype does not result from a lower mitochondrial mass or compromised activity of enzymes of the oxidative phosphorylation, nor does it reflect a decline in insulin-dependent glucose uptake, or diminution in storage of glycogen or triacylglycerol (TG) in the muscle. Conclusions/Significance: This study establishes rpS6 phosphorylation as a determinant of muscle strength through its role in regulation of myofiber growth and energy content. Interestingly, a similar role has been assigned for ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1, even though it regulates myoblast growth in an rpS6 phosphorylation-independent fashion. © 2009 Ruvinsky et al.",,"adenosine triphosphate; contractile protein; creatine phosphate; glucose; glycogen; insulin; mitochondrial protein; protein S6; triacylglycerol; adenosine triphosphate; creatine phosphate; glucose; glycogen; insulin; protein S6; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cell differentiation; controlled study; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; genotype; glucose transport; growth retardation; histopathology; lipid degradation; male; morphometrics; mouse; muscle cell; muscle mass; muscle strength; muscle weakness; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; pathogenesis; positron emission tomography; protein deficiency; protein phosphorylation; proteomics; animal; drug effect; growth, development and aging; metabolism; mitochondrion; muscle contraction; muscle weakness; organ size; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; Mus; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Glycogen; Insulin; Mice; Mitochondria; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Fibers, Skeletal; Muscle Weakness; Muscle, Skeletal; Organ Size; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Phosphocreatine; Ribosomal Protein S6; Signal Transduction; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66049157014

Box 349, Warkworth, New Zealand","Carbohydrates are a key ingredient in crustacean formulated diets because of their potential to greatly improve production efficiency. For the culture of spiny lobsters where daily food intake is limited, carbohydrates have the potential for delivering a low cost source of energy that could spare protein for growth. Therefore, the digestibility of different carbohydrate sources including refined sugars, mussel glycogen, algal polysaccharides, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and starches (i.e., native, dextrinised, gelatinised) were assessed in juvenile spiny lobster (30-60 g). This was done by measuring the rate of carbohydrate hydrolysis in vitro using enzyme homogenates and postprandial haemolymph glucose concentrations following ingestion of semi-purified diets containing different carbohydrate levels and sources. Fresh mussel gonads and a practical formulated diet were also included for comparison. Storage polysaccharides (i.e., gelatinised starches, dextrin, mussel glycogen) and the structural polysaccharide CMC were the best digested carbohydrate sources in vitro. CMC was more digestible than the algal polysaccharides, agar and alginate, and therefore may have potential as a binding agent in formulated diets for J. edwardsii. The poor hydrolysis of sucrose and trehalose suggests that their use as an energy source might be limited in J. edwardsii. Native wheat starch was the best digested among the various plant starches tested. Gelatinisation of starches markedly improved their digestibility suggesting that pre-treatment of the dietary starch source would have a beneficial influence on the digestibility of diets for J. edwardsii. Consumption of the semi-purified diets (i.e., 1% BW) containing the digestible starch sources (i.e., 27% dry weight), as well as the practical diet, resulted in high haemolymph glucose concentrations (&gt; 5 mmol l- 1) and a prolonged hyperglycaemic response (&gt; 24 h) suggesting that these carbohydrate sources are well digested and absorbed, but possibly poorly utilised. In contrast, the fresh mussel gonad diet (i.e., 27% glycogen by dry weight) appeared to be better utilised (reduced glycaemia after 12 h). A lower inclusion level (i.e., 7%) of gelatinised maize starch reduced the peak (1.87 mmol l- 1) and extent (12 h) of the glycaemic response. Using lower inclusion levels (&lt; 27%) of the rapidly digested starches (i.e., gelatinised, dextrinised) identified in this study, or incorporating digestible carbohydrate sources resulting in slower appearance of haemolymph glucose (i.e., native wheat starch, CMC), in formulated diets may have the potential to improve their utilisation for growth of juvenile spiny lobsters. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed energy function, which expresses the local smoothness of an image area, is derived by exploiting an intermediate step of modal analysis that is utilized in order to describe and analyze the deformations of a 3-D deformable surface model. The external forces that attract the 3-D deformable surface model combine the intensity of the image pixels with the spatial information of local image regions. The proposed image segmentation algorithm has two steps. First, a color quantization scheme, which is based on the node displacements of the deformable surface model, is utilized in order to decrease the number of colors in the image. Then, the proposed energy function is used as a criterion for a region growing algorithm. The final segmentation of the image is derived by a region merge approach. The proposed method was applied to the Berkeley segmentation database. The obtained results show good segmentation robustness, when compared to other state of the art image segmentation algorithms. © 2009 IEEE.","3-D deformable models; Color quantization; Color segmentation; Energy function; Image segmentation; Modal analysis","3-D deformable models; Berkeley Segmentation Database; Color quantization; Color segmentation; Color textures; Deformable surface models; Deformable surfaces; Energy function; Energy functions; External force; Image pixels; Image regions; Image segmentation algorithm; Modal energy; New approaches; Region growing algorithm; Region merge; Spatial informations; State of the art; Textured images; Color; Deformation; Digital image storage; Image segmentation; Modal analysis; Three dimensional",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649867122

Powder XRD, IR spectroscopy, DTA, BET measurements, SEM and XPS analyses were used for the characterization of the precursors and LiFePO4. IR spectroscopic study of the precursors shows that the deprotonated phosphate and formate ions are coordinated around the metal ions. The thermal heating of the lithium-iron phosphate-formate precursors at 350 °C for a short period yields stoichiometric defectless LiFePO4 having a high-specific surface area of about 35 m2/g, a mesoporous structure and containing up to 1.5 mass% carbon. By variation of the solutions concentration subjected to freeze-drying, the morphology of LiFePO4 and the carbon content are changed. The morphology of target LiFePO4 comprises micrometric aggregates, which are composed of nanometric particles with close particle size distribution in the range of 60-140 nm. The nanometric particles are interconnected in a way to form mesoporous network. This method is suitable for the preparation of LiFePO4 as cathode material for lithium-ion batteries since it allows affecting both the particle dimensions and carbon content. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, autonomous electrical networks are subject to strict constraints posing serious limitations on the absorption of renewable energy sources (RES)-based electricity generation. To bypass these constraints and also to secure a more sustainable electricity supply status, the concept of combining photovoltaic (PV) power stations and energy storage systems comprises a promising solution for small scaled autonomous electrical networks, increasing the reliability of the local network as well. In this context, the present study is devoted in developing a complete methodology, able to define the size of an autonomous electricity generation system, based on the maximum available solar potential exploitation at minimum electricity generation cost. In addition special emphasis is given in order to select the most cost-efficient energy storage configuration available. According to the calculation results obtained, one may clearly state that an optimum sizing combination of a PV generator along with an appropriate energy storage system may significantly contribute on reducing the electricity generation cost in several island electrical systems, providing also abundant and high quality electricity without the environmental and macroeconomic impacts of the oil-based thermal power stations. © 2009 by ASME.","Autonomous electrical network; Electricity production cost; Energy storage; Optimum solution; Photovoltaic generator","Electrical networks; Electricity production; Electricity production cost; Optimum solution; Photovoltaic generators; Cost reduction; Data storage equipment; Electric network analysis; Electric utilities; Electricity; Energy policy; Energy storage; Flywheels; Power plants; Renewable energy resources; Electric generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954860998

Another important aspect in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies on packaging is the recycling or treatment of packaging wastes. LCA studies of packed food include the packaging with specific focus on the contribution of the packaging to the total results. The consumption behaviour is often assessed only roughly. Packaging is facilitating the distribution of goods to the society. Broader approaches, which focus on the life cycle of packed goods, including the entire supply system and the consumption of goods, are necessary to get an environmental footprint of the system with respect to sustainable production and consumption. Materials and methods: A full LCA study has been conducted for two food products: coffee and butter packed in flexible packaging systems. The aim was to investigate the environmental performance of packaging with respect to its function within the life cycle of goods. The study looks at the environmental relevance of stages and interdependencies within the life cycle of goods whilst taking consumers' behaviour and portion sizes into consideration. The impact assessment is based on the following impact categories: non-renewable cumulative energy demand (CED), climate change, ozone layer depletion (ODP), acidification, and eutrophication. Results: The study shows that the most relevant environmental aspects for a cup of coffee are brewing (i.e. the heating of water) and coffee production. Transport and retail packaging are of minor importance. Brewing and coffee production have an impact share between 40% (ODP, white instant coffee) and 99% (eutrophication, black coffee). Milk added for white coffee is relevant for this type of preparation. The instant coffee in the one-portion stick-pack needs more packaging material per cup of coffee and is prepared by a kettle with lower energy demand, such as a coffee machine, thus leading to higher shares of the retail packaging in all indicators. A one-portion stick-pack can prevent wastage and resources related to coffee production can be saved. The most relevant aspect regarding the life cycle of butter is butter production, dominated by the provision of milk. Over 80% of the burdens in butter production stem from the provision of milk for all indicators discussed. Regarding climate change, methane and dinitrogen monoxide, emissions of milk cows and fodder production are most relevant. Fertilisation during livestock husbandry is responsible for most burdens regarding acidification and eutrophication. The distribution and selling stage influences the indicators CED and ODP distinctly. The reasons are, on the one hand, the relatively energy-intensive storage in supermarkets and, on the other hand, the use of refrigerants for chilled storage and transportation. The storage of butter in a refrigerator for 30 days is responsible for about 10% of the CED. Discussion: Several aspects have been modelled in a sensitivity analysis. The influence of coffee packaging disposal is very small due to the general low influence of packaging. In contrast, the brewing behaviour is highly relevant for the environmental impact of a cup of coffee. That applies similarly to the type of heating device-i.e. using a kettle or an automatic coffee machine. Wastage leads to a significant increase of all indicators. Under the wastage scenario, the coffee from one-portion stick-packs has a considerable better environmental performance concerning all indicators because, in case of instant coffee wastage of hot water and in case of ground coffee wastage of prepared coffee, has been predicted. Regardless of urban or countryside distances, grocery shopping has a low impact. The storage time of butter is relevant for the results in the indicator non-renewable CED. This is mainly the case when butter is stored as stock in the freezer. The end of life treatment of the packaging system has practically no influence on the results. Grocery shopping is of limited importance no matter which means of transport are used or which distances are regarded. Spoilage or wastage is of great importance: a spoilage/wastage of one third results in about 49% increased impacts compared to the standard case for all indicators calculated. Conclusions: The most important factors concerning the environmental impact from the whole supply chain of a cup of coffee are the brewing of coffee, its cultivation and production and the milk production in case of white coffee. The study highlights consumer behaviour- and packaging-related measures to reduce the environmental impact of a cup of coffee. The most relevant measures reducing the environmental impacts of butter consumption are the optimisation of the milk and butter production. Another important factor is the consumers' behaviour, i.e. the reduction of leftovers. The consumer can influence impacts of domestic storage using efficient and size-adequate appliances. The impacts of packaging in the life cycle of butter are not of primary importance. Recommendations and perspectives: This study shows that, in the case of packaging industry, a reduction of relevant environmental impacts can only be achieved if aspects indirectly influenced by the packaging are also taken into account. Thus, the packaging industry should not only aim to improve the production process of their packages, but also provide packages whose functionality helps to reduce other more relevant environmental impacts in the life cycle such as, for example, losses. Depending on the product, tailor-made packaging may also help to increase overall resource efficiency. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Backed goods; Brewing; Butter; Coffee; Cold storage; Consumer behaviour; Espresso; Flexible packaging; Food products; Milk","article; butter; coffee; food packaging; food storage; life cycle assessment; priority journal; recycling; sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67249096528

The prototype comprises a six-electrode cell assembly using an AB5 type metal hydride and Ni plates as counter electrodes, in a KOH solution. Metal hydride electrodes with chemical composition LaNi4.3Co0.4Al0.3 have been prepared by high frequency vacuum melting followed by high temperature annealing. X-ray phase analysis showed typical hexagonal structure and no traces of other intermetallic compounds belonging to the La-Ni phase diagram. Thermodynamic study of the alloy has been performed in a Sievert-type apparatus produced by Labtech Ltd. In the present prototype during charging, hydrogen is absorbed in the metal hydride and corresponding oxygen is conveyed out of the system. Conversely, in the case of discharging the hydrogen stored in the metal hydride it is released to an external H2 storage. Released hydrogen is delivered into the hydrogen storage up to a pressure of 15 bar. It is anticipated that the device will be integrated as a combined hydrogen generator in a stand-alone system associated to a 1 kW fuel cell. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Hydrogen generator/storage; Metal hydrides; Renewable hydrogen; Stand-alone systems","Chemical compositions; Counter electrodes; Electro-chemical systems; Electrode cells; Electrolyser; Hexagonal structures; High frequencies; High-temperature annealing; Higher efficiencies; Hydrogen generators; Intermetallic compounds; Koh solutions; Low costs; Metal hydride electrodes; Metal hydrides; Renewable hydrogen; Stand-alone systems; Thermodynamic studies; Vacuum melting; X-ray phase analysis; Electric inverters; Electrochemical electrodes; Fuel cells; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Intermetallics; Lithium batteries; Metals; Oxygen; Phase diagrams; Smelting; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65949096882

In this article, we review some of the new data concerning the possible short-term and long-term effects of nutrition on children's performance, current and future health. RECENT FINDINGS: Growing children engaged in strenuous exercise have several physiologic and metabolic characteristics that distinguish them from adults and require specific nutritional considerations. There is currently not enough evidence to support either carbohydrate loading or increased protein intake in the diet of the child athlete. Creatine use, although common among youth, is not recommended. Adequate hydration is essential to optimal performance. Consumption of iron-rich foods should be encouraged, as depleted iron stores are common in young athletes. In female athletes, nutritional deficiencies could lead to athletic amenorrhea and bone loss, and the resolution of energy deficits can restore normal bone formation and the return of menses. SUMMARY: In the highly competitive world of the child athlete, proper nutrition is of essence. Unfortunately, most of the knowledge in this field is based on adult literature. Age-specific research would lead to a better understanding of what constitutes 'a healthy diet' in the context of the growing athlete and may be a first step toward achieving these necessary insights. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Amenorrhea; Anemia; Exercise; Hydration; Protein","carbohydrate; creatine; iron; oral contraceptive agent; protein; recombinant somatomedin C; adult; amenorrhea; athlete; body weight; bone metabolism; calcium intake; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; child; competition; energy metabolism; exercise; food intake; health status; hormone substitution; human; hydration; iron deficiency anemia; iron storage; liquid; medical research; menstrual cycle; mental performance; nonhuman; nutrition; nutritional deficiency; ossification; osteolysis; physical performance; protein intake; review; sport; training; age; athletic performance; bone; child nutrition; exercise; female; metabolism; nutritional requirement; physiology; Age Factors; Athletic Performance; Bone and Bones; Child; Child Nutritional Physiology Phenomena; Exercise; Female; Humans; Nutritional Requirements; Sports",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65549146875

In both cases, the level of monosaccharides and water-soluble polysaccharides in the storage scale tissues increased, whereas the MS/WSP ratio in the bulbs planted in the open remained essentially the same and in case of forcing treatment decreased almost fivefold. In the apical bud tissues, the level of monosaccharides also rose in both cases, but the MS/WSP ratio in the open was greater throughout the whole experiment. The level of cytokinins in the apical bud tissues in the open was higher than in the forcing case, although the changes in their total content were identical following both treatments. Following the forcing treatment, the contents of free and bound ABA in the apical bud tissues increased reaching their peaks by the end of cold period. In the open, there were two peaks of free ABA: in October (when early frosts occurred) and in March (at the end of the wintering period). The winter forcing treatment resulted in rapid depletion of energy and plastic resources in T. bifloriformis and the death of 20% of embryonic flower buds (in the open, all flower buds survived). Nevertheless, plant adaptation potential ensured the development of generative shoots with 4-5 normal flowers, which makes it possible to use this species of multiflorous tulip for winter forcing in a greenhouse. © 2009 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","ABA; Bulb; Cytokinins; Embryonic flower bud; Growth and development; Monosaccharides; Stress; Tulipa bifloriformis; Water-soluble polysaccharides","Tulipa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65549125462

By using a continuous microwave belt drier, the microwave power was generated by means of 14 compressed air-cooled magnetrons of 800 W each that gives a maximum of 11.2 kW. The power setting could be adjusted individually in 800 W steps. Most importantly, this work focuses on the investigation of drying phenomena under microwave environment. In this analysis, the effects of the irradiation time and microwave power level on overall drying kinetics and mechanical properties were studied.

During the same period, the oil heating has decreased. Many former oil users that were used to almost maintenance-free heating systems now use pellets. Despite significant improvements of pellet quality and storage and burner equipment, there are still some problems that the household pellets user encounters. In this work, common end-user problems are identified. The cause of each problem, as well as whether a modified Swedish standard for pellets could reduce some of the problems encountered, is analysed. The results show that the most serious problems originate from the crumbling of pellets.

On the other hand, plans promoting the natural gas-based electricity generation in big islands (such as Crete) question the future of wind energy. To recover wind energy curtailments and benefit from the introduction of natural gas, the adoption of compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems suggests an appreciable energy solution. Furthermore, to improve the economic performance of the proposed system, it is decided that guaranteed energy amounts should be delivered to the local grid during peak demand periods. In an effort to obtain favourable negotiation conditions - for the selling price of energy delivered - and also improve the economic performance of the system, a dual mode CAES operation is currently examined. Proceeding to the economic evaluation of dual mode CAES configurations that ensure maximum wind energy recovery, the feasibility of the proposed system may be validated. Lower electricity production costs and considerable reduction of fuel consumption achieved - in comparison with the requirements of conventional peak demand power units - illustrate the system's advantages. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The focus is on the response to an assumed common stringent CO2-reduction target and on the role of carbon capture and storage technologies (CCS). Special emphasis is put on turn-over in capital stock, timing of investments and the infrastructural implications of large-scale introduction of CCS. The analysis is carried out through scenario analysis with the aid of a techno-economic model, in which a case including CCS is compared to a case excluding this option. The phase out of the present capital stock (power plants) is included from the Chalmers energy infrastructure databases, which gives information on present and planned power plants down to block level for plants exceeding 10 MW net electric power. Assuming technical lifetimes for these plants yield residual capacities in each year, here referred to as the phase-out pattern. CCS technologies are assumed to become commercially available in 2020. The age structure of the power plants indicate that full turn-over in capital stock will take several decades with the present generation capacities accounting for around 50% of generated electricity in 2020. The results show that CO2 emission reductions of 20% and 60% by the years 2020 and 2050, respectively, relative to 1990, can be met at a marginal cost of abatement of about 25-40 €/ton CO2 over the period studied if CCS is included as an option from 2020. At the same time the marginal cost of generating electricity lies in the range 45-60 €/MWh. Excluding CCS raises the marginal cost of abatement with about 10 €/ton CO2, whereas the marginal cost of electricity generation increases with roughly 5-10 €/MWh. The CO2 target by the year 2020 is met by implementation of renewable electricity and fuel shifting from coal to gas. After 2020 CCS technologies constitute an attractive way for cost efficient and almost CO2-free base load. However, wide-spread application of CCS is an infrastructural challenge with respect to implementing capture plants as well as building up a corresponding CO2 infrastructure for transportation and storage as well as in coal supply systems. Given the price assumptions applied, gas may not be competitive once CCS enters the system causing early retirements of such units or possibly stranded assets. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

One of these technologies is compressed air energy storage (CAES). In Denmark at present, wind power meets 20% and combined heat and power production (CHP) meets 50% of the electricity demand. Based on these figures, the paper assesses the value of integrating CAES into future sustainable energy systems with even higher shares of fluctuating renewable energy sources. The evaluation is made on the basis of detailed energy system analyses in which the supply of complete national energy systems is calculated hour by hour in relation to the demands during a year. The Danish case is evaluated in a system-economic perspective by comparing the economic benefits achieved by improving the integration of wind power to the costs of the CAES technology. The result is compared to various other storage options. Furthermore, a business-economic evaluation is done by calculating the potential income of the CAES technology from both spot markets and regulating power markets. The evaluation includes both historical hour by hour prices during a 7-year period on the Nordic Nord Pool market as well as expected future price variations. The conclusion is that even in energy systems with very high shares of wind power and CHP, neither the historical nor the expected future price variations on the spot market alone can justify the investment in CAES systems. Other storage technology options are significantly more feasible. CAES may operate both on the spot market and the regulating power market, which indicates potential feasibility. However, such strategy is highly risky because of the small extent of the regulating power market and if CAES is to become feasible it will depend on incomes from auxiliary services. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

External routines: ROOT [1] (http://root.cern.ch/). Nature of problem: The experimental and phenomenological study of multi-particle production in relativistic heavy ion collisions is expected to provide valuable information on the dynamical behavior of strongly-interacting matter in the form of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) [2-4], as predicted by lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. Ongoing and future experimental studies in a wide range of heavy ion beam energies require the development of new Monte Carlo (MC) event generators and improvement of existing ones. Especially for experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), implying very high parton and hadron multiplicities, one needs fast (but realistic) MC tools for heavy ion event simulations [5-7]. The main advantage of MC technique for the simulation of high-multiplicity hadroproduction is that it allows a visual comparison of theory and data, including if necessary the detailed detector acceptances, responses and resolutions. The realistic MC event generator has to include maximum possible number of observable physical effects, which are important to determine the event topology: from the bulk properties of soft hadroproduction (domain of low transverse momenta pT ≲ 1 GeV / c) such as collective flows, to hard multi-parton production in hot and dense QCD-matter, which reveals itself in the spectra of high-pT particles and hadronic jets. Moreover, the role of hard and semi-hard particle production at LHC can be significant even for the bulk properties of created matter, and hard probes of QGP became clearly observable in various new channels [8-11]. In the majority of the available MC heavy ion event generators, the simultaneous treatment of collective flow effects for soft hadroproduction and hard multi-parton in-medium production (medium-induced partonic rescattering and energy loss, so-called ""jet quenching"") is lacking. Thus, in order to analyze existing data on low and high-pT hadron production, test the sensitivity of physical observables at the upcoming LHC experiments (and other future heavy ion facilities) to the QGP formation, and study the experimental capabilities of constructed detectors, the development of adequate and fast MC models for simultaneous collective flow and jet quenching simulations is necessary. HYDJET++ event generator includes detailed treatment of soft hadroproduction as well as hard multi-parton production, and takes into account known medium effects. Solution method: A heavy ion event in HYDJET++ is a superposition of the soft, hydro-type state and the hard state resulting from multi-parton fragmentation. Both states are treated independently. HYDJET++ is the development and continuation of HYDJET MC model [12]. The main program is written in the object-oriented C++ language under the ROOT environment [1]. The hard part of HYDJET++ is identical to the hard part of Fortran-written HYDJET [13] (version 1.5) and is included in the generator structure as a separate directory. The routine for generation of single hard NN collision, generator PYQUEN [12,14], modifies the ""standard"" jet event obtained with the generator PYTHIA 6.4 [15]. The event-by-event simulation procedure in PYQUEN includes1.generation of initial parton spectra with PYTHIA and production vertexes at given impact parameter;2.rescattering-by-rescattering simulation of the parton path in a dense zone and its radiative and collisional energy loss;3.final hadronization according to the Lund string model for hard partons and in-medium emitted gluons. Then the PYQUEN multi-jets generated according to the binomial distribution are included in the hard part of the event. The mean number of jets produced in an AA event is the product of the number of binary NN subcollisions at a given impact parameter and the integral cross section of the hard process in NN collisions with the minimum transverse momentum transfer pTmin. In order to take into account the effect of nuclear shadowing on parton distribution functions, the impact parameter dependent parameterization obtained in the framework of Glauber-Gribov theory [16] is used. The soft part of HYDJET++ event is the ""thermal"" hadronic state generated on the chemical and thermal freeze-out hypersurfaces obtained from the parameterization of relativistic hydrodynamics with preset freeze-out conditions (the adapted C++ code FAST MC [17,18]). Hadron multiplicities are calculated using the effective thermal volume approximation and Poisson multiplicity distribution around its mean value, which is supposed to be proportional to the number of participating nucleons at a given impact parameter of AA collision. The fast soft hadron simulation procedure includes1.generation of the 4-momentum of a hadron in the rest frame of a liquid element in accordance with the equilibrium distribution function;2.generation of the spatial position of a liquid element and its local 4-velocity in accordance with phase space and the character of motion of the fluid;3.the standard von Neumann rejection/acceptance procedure to account for the difference between the true and generated probabilities;4.boost of the hadron 4-momentum in the center mass frame of the event;5.the two- and three-body decays of resonances with branching ratios taken from the SHARE particle decay table [19]. The high generation speed in HYDJET++ is achieved due to almost 100% generation efficiency of the ""soft"" part because of the nearly uniform residual invariant weights which appear in the freeze-out momentum and coordinate simulation. Although HYDJET++ is optimized for very high energies of RHIC and LHC colliders (c.m.s. energies of heavy ion beams sqrt(s) = 200 and 5500 GeV per nucleon pair, respectively), in practice it can also be used for studying the particle production in a wider energy range down to sqrt(s) ∼ 10 GeV per nucleon pair at other heavy ion experimental facilities. As one moves from very high to moderately high energies, the contribution of the hard part of the event becomes smaller, while the soft part turns into just a multi-parameter fit to the data. Restrictions: HYDJET++ is only applicable for symmetric AA collisions of heavy (A ≳ 40) ions at high energies (c.m.s. energy sqrt(s) ≳ 10 GeV per nucleon pair). The results obtained for very peripheral collisions (with the impact parameter of the order of two nucleus radii, b ∼ 2 RA) and very forward rapidities may be not adequate.

Running time: The generation of 100 central (0-5%) Au+Au events at sqrt(s) = 200 A GeV (Pb+Pb events at sqrt(s) = 5500 A GeV) with default input parameters takes about 7 (85) minutes on a PC 64 bit Intel Core Duo CPU @ 3 GHz with 8 GB of RAM memory under Red Hat Enterprise.

The larger fraction of cost in biomass energy generation originates from the logistics operations. A major issue concerning biomass logistics is its storage, especially when it is characterized by seasonal availability. The biomass energy exploitation literature has rarely investigated the issue of biomass storage. Rather, researchers usually choose arbitrarily the lowest cost storage method available, ignoring the effects this choice may have on the total system efficiency. In this work, the three most frequently used biomass storage methods are analyzed and are applied to a case study to come up with tangible comparative results. Furthermore, the issue of combining multiple biomass supply chains, aiming at reducing the storage space requirements, is introduced. An application of this innovative concept is also performed for the case study examined. The most important results of the case study are that the lowest cost storage method indeed constitutes the system-wide most efficient solution, and that the multi-biomass approach is more advantageous when combined with relatively expensive storage methods.

Most of these small islands face serious infrastructure problems, like the insufficient power supply and the low quality of electricity available at very high production cost. In an attempt to improve the life quality of all these isolated communities, an investigation concerning the financial viability of an integrated electrification solution based on one or more photovoltaic generators and an appropriate energy storage system is described. The main target of a similar solution is to maximize the contribution of the photovoltaic generator and minimize the life-cycle electricity generation cost of the remote island networks investigated. In addition, special emphasis is given in order to select the most cost-efficient energy storage configuration available. According to the results obtained for high and medium-high solar potential regions, the proposed configuration is found to be more cost-effective than the existing thermal power stations. Several side benefits like the improved electrical network reliability and the minimization of the environmental and macroeconomic impacts resulting from the replacement of the imported oil should also be considered. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanisms such as glutamate cycling between neurons and astrocytes and glycogen storage in astrocytes have been implemented. A unique feature of the model is its calibration using in vivo data of brain glucose and lactate from freely moving rats under various stimuli. The model has been used to perform simulated perturbation experiments that show that glycogen breakdown in astrocytes is significantly activated during sensory (tail pinch) stimulation. This mechanism provides an additional input of energy substrate during high consumption phases. By way of validation, data from the perfusion of 50 μM propranolol in the rat brain was compared with the model outputs. Propranolol affects the glucose dynamics during stimulation, and this was accurately reproduced in the model by a reduction in the glycogen breakdown in astrocytes. The model's predictive capacity was verified by using data from a sensory stimulation (restraint) that was not used for model calibration. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters, this showed that the control of energy metabolism and transport processes are critical in the metabolic behaviour of cerebral tissue. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.","Astrocytes; Brain energy metabolism; Kinetic modelling; Neurons; Systems biology","glutamic acid; lactic acid; propranolol; article; astrocyte; brain metabolism; calibration; controlled study; energy consumption; energy metabolism; energy transfer; glucose brain level; glucose metabolism; glycogen metabolism; mathematical computing; mathematical model; metabolic balance; neurochemistry; prediction; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; sensory stimulation; systems biology; Adenosine Triphosphate; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Animals; Astrocytes; Brain; Computer Simulation; Energy Metabolism; Glycogen; Lactic Acid; Models, Biological; Models, Neurological; Neurochemistry; Neurons; Nonlinear Dynamics; Physical Stimulation; Predictive Value of Tests; Propranolol; Rats; Restraint, Physical; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tail",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350575369

The micromagnetic Gibbs free energy is described in terms of these volume fractions. Hysteresis loops are computed by minimizing the mesoscopic Gibbs free energy using a modified gradient search for a sequence of external applied fields.

If the system frequency can not be controlled and kept in the acceptable range, the system may lose stability. To reduce system frequency fluctuation, a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) which is able to supply and absorb active power quickly, can be applied. In addition, variation of system parameters, unpredictable power demands and fluctuating wind power etc., cause various uncertainties in the system. A SMES controller which is designed without considering such uncertainties may lose control effect. To enhance the robustness of SMES controller, this paper focuses on a new robust control design of SMES for frequency control in a wind-diesel system. The coprime factorization is used to represent the unstructured uncertainties in a system modeling. The structure of a SMES controller is the practical first-order lead-lag compensator. To tune the controller parameters, the optimization problem is formulated based on loop shaping technique. The genetic algorithm is applied to solve the problem and achieve the control parameters. Simulation results confirm the high robustness of the proposed SMES controller with small power capacity against various disturbances and system uncertainties in comparison with SMES in the previous research. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

Following the atomic displacements of the unstable modes, we have obtained a new F 222 structure, which has a lower energy than all previously experimentally and theoretically proposed phases of Mg(BH4)2 and is free of imaginary eigenmodes. A new meta-stable high-density I41/amd structure is also derived from the phase. Temperatures for the decomposition are found to be in the range of 400-470K and largely independent of the structural complexity, as long as the primary cation coordination polyhedra are properly represented. This opens a possibility of using simple model structures for screening and prediction of finite temperature stability and decomposition temperatures of novel borohydride systems. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ab-initio; Acoustic instabilities; Acoustic phonons; Atomic displacements; Borohydride; Brillouin-zone boundaries; Cation coordinations; Decomposition temperatures; Density functional; Eigen-modes; Energy studies; Finite temperatures; High densities; Hydrogen storage materials; Lower energies; Meta stables; Phonon dispersions; Structural complexity; Structural stabilities; Unit cells; Unstable modes; Acoustics; Free energy; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Model structures; Phonons; System stability; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63849172450

Secondary ion mass spectroscopy and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements show that thermal annealing causes the diffusion of Ge in the oxide towards the Si substrate as well as oxidation of the Ge nanoclusters. The changes in the structural and chemical properties of the Ge nanoclusters are found to seriously affect the charge storage in the nanoclusters. It is observed that the electron trapping capability decreases with the annealing temperature as a result of the oxidation of Ge nanoclusters. On the other hand, the charge loss increases with the annealing temperature, but it decreases when the annealing temperature is higher than 1000 °C. This behaviour is attributed to the two competing mechanisms, i.e. the formation of leakage paths formed by the Ge atoms diffused in the gate oxide and the blocking of the leakage paths due to the oxidation of the Ge leakage sites. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Annealing; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Emission spectroscopy; Gates (transistor); Germanium; Ion bombardment; Ion implantation; MOS devices; Nanoclusters; Oxidation; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Semiconducting silicon compounds; Annealing temperatures; Charge loss; Charge storages; Competing mechanisms; Electron trapping; Gate oxides; Ge atoms; Leakage paths; Low energies; Low-energy ion implantations; Metal-oxide-semiconductor structures; Secondary ion mass spectroscopies; Si substrates; Thermal-annealing; X-ray photoemission spectroscopies; Semiconducting germanium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63649117653

Obtained binding energies, which include both ZPE and BSSE corrections, range from 7 to 14 kJ · mol-1 and 6 to 12 kJ · mol-1 for complexes of substituted formaldehydes and thioformaldehydes, respectively.

When replacing H by a halogen atom, the binding energy tends to decrease.

The reserve power requirements for a high renewable energy penetration could be met by an amount of V2G based electric vehicles less than 10% of the total vehicle need in Denmark.

To exploit such technology trends, we present a novel framework, a joint encoder-decoder framework (JEDF), which allows the decoder to tradeoff energy and memory consumption without sacrificing playback quality. We employ sum-of-powers-of-two (SOPOT) technique, an approximate signal processing (ASP) technique, in an MPEG AAC decoder to reduce the computational workload. The SOPOT introduces additional ASP noise (in the decoder) on top of the quantization noise introduced in the process of lossy compression (in the encoder). The sum of these two kinds of noise may become audible when it exceeds the masking threshold. We tackle this problem from a new perspective: the proposed JEDF allows the ASP and quantization noises to be shaped jointly to match the masking threshold. In the case that the perceptual room between the masking threshold and the quantization noise is insufficient for the ASP noise, the JEDF can reduce the quantization noise level which results in an increase in bitrate. To implement the proposed scheme, we have developed two new techniques: (1) SOPOT truncation noise shaping; (2) truncation noise allocation based on a perceptual model. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Energy efficiency; Joint ASP and quantization noise shaping; Joint encoder-decoder framework (JEDF); SOPOT; Workload reduction","Audio decoding; Battery technology; Bit rates; Computational workload; Critical limiting factor; Energy efficient; Joint ASP and quantization noise shaping; Joint encoder-decoder framework (JEDF); Joint encoders; Lossy compressions; Low power embedded systems; Masking threshold; Memory consumption; Noise-shaping; Perceptual model; Quantization noise; Semiconductor memory; SOPOT; Technology trends; Workload reduction; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Programmable robots; Semiconductor storage; Signal processing; Decoding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650921407

The EU, with an investment of $11.6 billion, leads all efforts, because it is forced to achieve a target to reduce carbon emissions by 20% of 1990 levels by 2020. Norway's financial and market incentives to develop ways to reduce carbon emissions have prompted some energy companies, including StatoilHydro to pursue carbon-capture projects. In December 2009, the governing body reached agreement on a climate and energy package, which includes a framework for CCS and a directive on the way EU members and Norway will regulate licenses to ensure reliable carbon storage. The US takes second place, earmarking $6 billion, and Canada is third, at $2.7 billion. This March 2009, StatoilHydro announced that the seismic data confirmed the gas in the sandstone formation is not leaking out but is spreading through the structure as expected. StatoilHydro was also actively pursuing solutions to capture carbon emissions from combustion-based point sources. Earlier in February 2009, it provided the government with a detailed plan for the establishment of a full-scale CCS facility at a combined heat and power plant under construction at an oil refinery cracker at Mongstad.

Clinical course of the disease ranges from severe infantile to milder juvenile type and includes mental retardation, skeletal deformities, coarse facies, hepatomegaly and hearing loss. The aim of the study was to analyse mitochondrial ultrastructure and function in cultivated fibroblasts from three patients with α-mannosidosis. All patients were homozygous for the c.2248C>T mutation in the MAN2B1 gene encoding lysosomal α-mannosidase. The mutation results in incorrect protein folding and severe decrease of α-mannosidase activity. The misfolded protein is retained by the control system of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In analysed fibroblasts, we observed dilated ER, higher amount of aberrant mitochondria and reduced mitochondrial mass compared to controls. Respiratory chain complex IV, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), activity and the ratio between COX and citrate synthase (control enzyme) were significantly increased in comparison to controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the activity at least from one of other respiratory chain complexes was increased in each studied cell line. Mitochondrial membrane potential as well as reactive oxygen species production were comparable with controls. Based on our results, we hypothesize more profound effect of swelled and damaged mitochondria and ER dilatation on tissues with higher energy demand than fibroblasts have. © 2009 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","α-mannosidosis; Endoplasmatic reticulum; Mitochondria; Ultrastructure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67049118216

However, application of manure may also cause P and N pollution of surroundings, odour emission and waste of energy. A solution may be to apply an improved liquid manure fraction resulting from manure separation and anaerobic digestion. As previous studies have only focused on the factors individually, we carried out here a system analysis with the aim of optimising all the factors simultaneously. We tested three solid-liquid separations on raw manure and manure pre-digested in a biogas reactor, with the separation treatments being coagulation, flocculation and filtration, which differed mainly with respect to coagulant volume, and the N:P ratio of the products was measured. The NH3 and odour emission was determined from the liquid fractions during storage and after soil application, while the energy produced at anaerobic digestion of the solid fractions was measured. Our results show that energy production at digestion increased with decreasing coagulant volume, but was largely unaffected by anaerobic digestion whether performed both before and after or only after separation. Odour generation was reduced by pre-digestion. With increasing coagulant volume and without pre-digestion, the nutrient value of the liquid fraction was improved the most, as shown by an increase in the N/P ratio of the liquid fraction and by a decrease in NH emissions from stores and fields. The data proved that mechanical separation of raw manure, added coagulant and polymer, followed by anaerobic digestion of the solid fraction was the optimum strategy from a whole animal manure management perspective. The coagulant volume can be adjusted to favour either nutrient value and NH emission, or energy production. © 2009 INRA EDP Sciences.","Animal slurry; Biogas; Flocculation; NH3 emission; Soil application; Solid-liquid separation; Storage","anoxic conditions; arable land; biogas; bioreactor; coagulation; emission; manure; nutritive value; odor; optimization; power generation; separation; slurry; testing method; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65349126029

Whereas insulin dominates periprandially, GH may be viewed as the primary anabolic hormone during stress and fasting. GH exerts anabolic effects directly and through stimulation of IGF-I, insulin, and free fatty acids (FFA). When subjects are well nourished, the GH- induced stimulation of IGF-I and insulin is important for anabolic storage and growth of lean body mass (LBM), adipose tissue, and glycogen reserves. During fasting and other catabolic states, GH predominantly stimulates the release and oxidation of FFA, which leads to decreased glucose and protein oxidation and preservation of LBM and glycogen stores. The most prominent metabolic effect of GH is a marked increaseinlipolysis and FFA levels.Inthebasal state, the effects of GH on protein metabolism are modest and include increased protein synthesis and decreased breakdown at the whole body level and in muscle together with decreased amino acid degradation/oxidation and decreased hepatic urea formation. During fasting and stress, the effects of GH on proteinmetabolismbecomemorepronounced;lackofGHduringfastingincreases protein loss and ureaproduction ratesby approximately 50%, with a similar increase in muscle protein breakdown. GH is a counterregulatory hormone that antagonizes the hepatic and peripheral effects of insulin on glucose metabolism via mechanisms involving the concomitant increase in FFA flux and uptake. This ability of GH to induce insulin resistance is significant for the defense against hypoglycemia, for the developmentof ""stress"" diabetes during fasting and inflammatory illness, and perhaps for the ""Dawn"" phenomenon (the increase in insulin requirements in the early morning hours). Adult patients with GH deficiency are insulin resistant-probably related to increased adiposity, reduced LBM, and impaired physical performance-which temporarily worsens when GH treatment is initiated. Conversely, despite increased LBM and decreased fat mass, patients with acromegaly are consistently insulin resistant and become more sensitive after appropriate treatment.

Supplementing diets with taurine or glycine modulates BA metabolism and enhances fecal BA excretion in rats. However, it is still unclear whether dietary proteins varying in taurine and glycine contents alter BA metabolism, and thereby modulate the recently discovered systemic effects of BAs. Here we show that rats fed a diet containing saithe fish protein hydrolysate (saithe FPH), rich in taurine and glycine, for 26 days had markedly elevated fasting plasma BA levels relative to rats fed soy protein or casein. Concomitantly, the saithe FPH fed rats had reduced liver lipids and fasting plasma TAG levels. Furthermore, visceral adipose tissue mass was reduced and expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure was induced in perirenal/retroperitoneal adipose tissues of rats fed saithe FPH. Our results provide the first evidence that dietary protein sources with different amino acid compositions can modulate the level of plasma bile acids and our data suggest potential novel mechanisms by which dietary protein sources can affect energy metabolism. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One result is that over-sizing the pond, leading to some rejection of the heat collected during the summer (which is referred to as peak clipping), will result in a higher utilisation factor of the desalination plant and a reduction in the summer/winter yield ratio. Optimum peak clipping days, leading to the minimum product water cost, for each storage zone temperature and performance ratio is presented. The sensitivity analysis of the various factors affecting the overall water costs show that the capital costs comprise about two thirds (2/3) of the total desalinated water costs. This demonstrates and re-emphasises the inherent and basic fact that solar desalination is a capital intensive enterprise.

The methodology adopted proposes various procedures based on the water consumption profiles, total head, tank capacity and photovoltaic array peak power. A method of the load losses probability (LLP) has been used to optimize sizing of the photovoltaic pumping systems with a similarity between the storage energy in batteries and water in tanks. The results were carried out using measured meteorological data for four localities in Algeria: Algiers and Oran in the north, Bechar and Tamanrasset in the south. The results show that the performance of the photovoltaic pumping system depends deeply on the pumping total head and the peak power of the photovoltaic array. Also, for the southern localities, the LLP method shows that the size of the photovoltaic array varies versus LLP on a small scale. On the other hand, for the northern localities, the sizing of the photovoltaic array is situated on a large scale power.

Little is known of the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying competitive interactions between these grasses and native taxa and how they are affected by resource supply. Consequently, this study compared Photosystem II function, photosynthetic pigment concentrations, gas and water exchange rates, Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) contents, flowering and biomass accumulation in a native geophyte Tritonia crocata (L.) Ker. Gawl. grown in monoculture and admixed with an alien grass Lolium multiflorum Lam at different levels of nutrient and water supply. Diminished stomatal conductances were the primary cause of reduced net CO2 assimilation rates and consequent decreased biomass accumulation in T. crocata admixed with L. multiflorum at all levels of water and nutrient supply with one exception. These corresponded with decreased soil water contents induced presumably by more efficient competition for water by L. multiflorum whose biomass was inversely correlated with soil water content. At low levels of water and nutrient supply, both stomatal and metabolic impairments to photosynthesis were apparent in T. crocata admixed with L. multiflorum. The metabolic impairments included a decline in the efficiency of primary photochemistry (trapping) (φP0/1 - φP0), associated with a decrease in leaf chlorophyll a and b content, a decreased efficiency of conversion of excitation energy to electron transport (Ψ0/1 - Ψ0) pointing to a reduction in electron transport capacity beyond QA- and a decline in apparent Rubisco activity (Vc,max) and Rubisco content. Under conditions of low nutrient and high water supply, only metabolic impairments to photosynthesis (decreased RC/ABS, chlorophyll a and Rubisco content) were apparent in T. crocata admixed with L. multiflorum. These impairments resulted in a down regulation of photosynthesis and a reallocation of fixed carbohydrate reserves to floral production which increased significantly in T. crocata under these conditions only and corresponded with a decline in the mass of its underground storage organ. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to compliance analysis the foci of the survey were: (i) evaluation whether the implementation has contributed to safety improvement, (ii) relation between safety performance indicators and Seveso II requirements, and (iii) how operators assess support of competent authorities in the process of achieving compliance. The results show a wide range of general compliance - e.g. 87% for submission of safety report to competent authority but only 45% for making information on safety measures available to the public. The survey also revealed that respondents assigned more credit to reactive, e.g. emergency planning, than to preventive, e.g. MAPP, safety measures. Related to the latter, 65% of respondents think that requirements imposed by the Directive are conceptually strong; however, in real life there is too much paperwork and duplication associated with demonstration of safety. Operators express different levels of satisfaction with the support by competent authorities in the process of achieving compliance and stressed the need for quantitative indicators for measuring/assessing safety performance in the context of the Directive.

Inactivation levels and the percentage of sub-lethal were dependent upon strain and type of inactivation technique used. Comparison of the mean time-to-detection (TTD) values under suboptimal conditions (increased NaCl concentration or reduced pH) showed that the longest TTD was at every pH observed for the cultures treated with ClO2, followed by LA and ILP. Under increased NaCl concentration LA treated cells required the longest TTD, followed by ClO2 and ILP, respectively. Significant difference in TTD between untreated and cultures treated with ClO2 and LA was observed. Recovery of ILP treated cultures was not always different from untreated cultures. The extended post-treatment effect based on the growth retardation or inhibition of injured cells under sub-optimal conditions is suggested as an important tool in conditioning of microbial food safety. Industrial relevance: Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the European economy. They are a key source of jobs and a breeding ground for implementation of research results. They are however the most sensitive of all to changes in the production practices coming as a consequence of increased consumers' awareness regarding fresh and natural-like foods. In order to respond to the changed consumption pattern, non-heat and so-called mild technologies have emerged. This research as a part of the EU Pathogen Combat project is tailor made to answer some of the burning issues when it comes to ""mild"" decontamination. Among the more established technologies used here is decontamination with lactic acid, followed by chlorine dioxide. Both are now under the eye of EU policy makers who are seeking relevant facts to adjust or not to adjust EU policy regarding decontamination of foods. Latest EFSA opinions have already pushed these agents forward, but relevant scientific facts were declared missing. Moreover, intense light pulses, as non-chemical alternative to pasteurization have a considerable potential not only in food surface decontamination, but also in the decontamination of packaging materials, industrial surfaces etc. The present research brought new facts into the light that might have a credible influence on understanding pros and cons of lactic acid, chlorine dioxide and intense light pulses as decontamination agents. The post-treatment, based on sublethal injury, effect is suggested as an important extension tool in shelf life extension and safety barrier. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In view of this, renewable solar energy sources are being increasingly exploited to meet the energy needs. Moreover, solar photovoltaic (PV)-diesel hybrid system technology promises lot of opportunities in remote areas which are far from utility grid and are driven by diesel generators. Integration of PV systems with the diesel plants is being disseminated worldwide to reduce diesel fuel consumption and to minimize atmospheric pollution. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (K.S.A.) being endowed with high intensity of solar radiation, is a prospective candidate for deployment of PV systems. Also, K.S.A. has large number of remote scattered villages. The aim of this study is to analyze solar radiation data of Rafha, K.S.A., to assess the techno-economic feasibility of hybrid PV-diesel-battery power systems to meet the load requirements of a typical remote village Rawdhat Bin Habbas (RBH) with annual electrical energy demand of 15,943 MWh. Rafha is located near RBH. The monthly average daily global solar radiation ranges from 3.04 to 7.3 kWh/m2. NREL's HOMER software has been used to perform the techno-economic evaluation. The simulation results indicate that for a hybrid system composed of 2.5 MWp capacity PV system together with 4.5 MW diesel system (three 1.5 MW units) and a battery storage of 1 h of autonomy (equivalent to 1 h of average load), the PV penetration is 27%. The cost of generating energy (COE, US$/kWh) from the above hybrid system has been found to be 0.170$/kWh (assuming diesel fuel price of 0.1$/l). The study exhibits that the operational hours of diesel generators decrease with increase in PV capacity. The investigation also examines the effect of PV/battery penetration on COE, operational hours of diesel gensets. Concurrently, emphasis has been placed on: un-met load, excess electricity generation, percentage fuel savings and reduction in carbon emissions (for different scenarios such as: PV-diesel without storage, PV-diesel with storage, as compared to diesel-only situation), COE of different hybrid systems, etc. The decrease in carbon emissions by using the above hybrid system is about 24% as compared to the diesel-only scenario. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In such systems, CAES plants will often operate on electricity spot markets by storing energy when electricity prices are low and producing electricity when prices are high. In order to make a profit on such markets, CAES plant operators have to identify proper strategies to decide when to sell and when to buy electricity. This paper describes three independent computer-based methodologies which may be used for identifying the optimal operation strategy for a given CAES plant, on a given spot market and in a given year. The optimal strategy is identified as the one which provides the best business-economic net earnings for the plant. In practice, CAES plants will not be able to achieve such optimal operation, since the fluctuations of spot market prices in the coming hours and days are not known. Consequently, two simple practical strategies have been identified and compared to the results of the optimal strategy. This comparison shows that, in practice, a CAES plant can be expected to earn 80-90 per cent of the optimal earnings. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

An electrical hot plate in thermal contact with a hollow copper spiral coil through which the oil flows simulates a solar collector/concentrator system. The hot plate heats up the oil which flows through the storage thus charging the TES system at a constant controlled temperature. The Schumann model and the modified Schumann model for the dynamic temperature distributions in the TES system are implemented in Simulink. The simulated results are compared with experimental results during the charging and discharging of the TES system. The Schumann model is in close agreement with experiment at lower TES temperatures during the early stages of the charging process. However, larger deviations between experiment and simulation are seen at later stages of the charging process and this is due to heat losses that are unaccounted for. The modified Schumann model is in closer agreement with experiment at later stages of the charging process. The discrepancies between experiment and simulation are also discussed.

A heat transfer fluid (HTF: water) flows by forced convection through the inner tube, and transfers the heat to PCMs. In order to compare the thermal performances of the latent heat storage unit using two phase change materials (LHSU2) and a single PCM (LHSU1), a mathematical model based on the conservation energy equations was developed and validated with experimental data. Several numerical investigations were conducted in order to examine the impact of the key parameters: the HTF inlet temperature (ranges from 50 to 60 °C), the mass flow rate of the HTF and the proportion mass of PCMs, on the thermal performances of the latent heat storage units using two PCMs and a single PCM, during charging process (melting).

Smaller solder bumps (SB95) lead to a faster decrease in bump shear strength. Increasing aging temperature and time brings about an increase in the final fracture area of the solder, from a ductile to a quasi-brittle failure mode. It is observed that the smaller solder bump (SB95) exhibits a faster rate of increase in final fracture area, than the bigger bump. A linear decrease of solder bump shear strength with intermetallic thickness is established for the systems studied. Degradation of solder bump shear strength is found to be affected by the relative volume of the solder bump with respect to Ni/ Au, such that a lower solder bump to Ni/Au volume ratio leads to faster shear strength degradation, due to the consumption of Cu in the bulk solder bump and the formation of brittle intermetallics. The overall intermetallic growth activation energies for the two solder bump sizes are found to be comparable, at 0.85- 0.86 eV.

Absorption of flavours into packaging material causes the loss of aroma or changes in the mechanical properties of package. Therefore, it results in reduced perception of the product quality. In this research, the effect of menthol absorption by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles on mechanical properties of the PET bottles was investigated through tensile test. The PET samples containing yogurt drinks with 100 ppm initial concentration of menthol were stored for about three months at 4°C, 25°C, and 45°C and the mechanical properties (tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and elongation) of PET bottles were measured periodically during the storage time. A new technique, dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME), was used before GC analysis for concentrating the acetone extraction solution containing menthol. The effect of menthol on mechanical properties of PET bottles was compared through tensile test results of the PET bottles containing yogurt drinks with 100 ppm menthol against PET bottles containing yogurt drink without initial concentration of menthol solution. Maximum effect of menthol on mechanical properties of PET bottles was observed on the samples stored at 45°C that could be due to the high amount of absorbed menthol at higher storage temperatures. It was also found that tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of PET bottles decreased with the absorption of menthol, while the elongation increased.","Absorption; Flavour; Mechanical properties; Menthol; Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)","Absorption; Acetone; Beverages; Bottles; Dairy products; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Electric field effects; Liquids; Packaging materials; Polyesters; Polyethylene terephthalates; Positron emission tomography; Solvent extraction; Strength of materials; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Acetone extractions; Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction; External environments; Flavour; Initial concentrations; Menthol; Modulus of elasticities; Packaged foods; Pet bottles; Product qualities; Storage temperatures; Storage time; Tensile tests; Mechanical properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62149139730

The validity of the method and applicability of the sensor were successfully tested by detection of phosphate in blood serum after deproteinization of sample without interference from sample matrix. The long-term storage stability of the electrode was studied. The experimental data is presented and discussed from which the new sensor is characterized. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Documenting both potentials may offer incentives for forest conservation and exploitation, and for the allocation of bonds for environmental services. We studied sites on lava flows of different ages (1835, 4200, 6200, 8000, 10,000 and 30,500 years B.P.) covered by volcanic ashes within the Sierra del Chichinautzin Volcanic Field, under pine or fir forest. We analyzed the accumulation of organic carbon in the soils and its relation with the evolution of site quality, forest productivity indicators and C storage in tree biomass. We also studied the relation between soil C accumulation and different soil properties as soil pH, clay contents and pyrophosphate extractable Al and oxalate extractable Al and Si contents. Results show that carbon accumulation in the soil increases linearly with age within 1835 and 10,000 years old sites with a mean accumulation rate of 4.33 kg m- 2 each 1000 years. However, between 10,000 and 30,500 years the amount of C stored decreases again by about 30% of the maximum soil C accumulation. During the first 8000 years of the chronosequence site quality improves with soil development. Tree growth indexes approach stabilization at sites of ages between 10,000 and 30,500 years. Adult pine trees reach an accumulation of 27 kg C per tree each year. During the first 10,000 years carbon accumulation in mineral surface horizons is associated with the formation of Al-bearing organo-mineral complexes (characterized by pyrophosphate extractions), which seem to compete with the neoformation of short range order clay minerals. As clay and Al-oxide formation progresses these soil variables contribute also to stabilize soil C, although they are by far not as efficient as the organo-mineral complexes. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, the thermal stability of four nitrocellulose samples containing various amount of nitrate groups was determined by differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) and simultaneous thermogravimetery-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) techniques. The results of TG analysis revealed that the main thermal degradation for the nitrocellulose occurs in the temperature ranges of 192-209 °C. On the other hand, the TG-DTA analysis of compounds indicates that nitrate content of nitrocellulose could has affect on its thermal stability and its decomposition temperature decrease by increasing its nitrogen percent. The influence of the heating rate (5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min) on the DSC behaviour of the nitrocellulose was verified. The results showed that, as the heating rate was increased, decomposition temperature of the compound was increased.

This study aimed to clarify whether chronic (56 d) exposure to a mixture of environmentally relevant concentrations of contaminants (tributyltin [TBT] and perfluorononanoic acid [PFNA]) spiked in clean sediment would affect the sediment-dwelling polychaete Hediste diversicolor. Endpoints were burial time, biomass change, and cellular energy allocation (CEA). Sediments were spiked with these two contaminants to produce different levels of contamination. Chemical analyses of the sediment following the exposure indicated that the spiking procedure was only partially successful and treatments were grouped into four categories according to contaminant concentrations: ""background,"" ""low,"" ""moderate,"" and ""high."" No significant differences were found between treatments with respect to burial time, biomass change, or energy storage fractions (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates) in the polychaetes. A significant increase in cellular respiration was found for polychaetes in ""moderate"" and ""high"" treatment groups compared to the ""background"" treatment group. This resulted in significantly lower cellular energy allocation values for ""moderate"" and ""high"" treatment groups compared to ""background."" Although the effects were not marked, the results show that sediment-dwelling organisms may be affected following chronic exposure to environmental contaminants. There is a need to clarify whether chronic exposures exert a negative effect on sediment-dwelling organisms.

The presence of this resonant circuit results in ac line current being drawn over much of the line cycle, as well as in soft switching of the power devices. The rectifier-compensated fundamental-mode approximation (RCFMA) method is used to provide an accurate yet simple analysis of the circuit.

The physicochemical, surface and catalytic properties of the thermally treated solids (500, 800 and 900 °C) were investigated using XRD, ESR, nitrogen adsorption at -196 °C and hydrogen peroxide decomposition in a aqueous solution at 30-50 °C. Experimental results show that Mn oxidation state changes from Mn4+ to Mn2+ by increasing the calcination temperature of solids studied. However, there are two unique features associated with CeO2 as a material of interest. The first favors the dispersion of manganese oxides deposited on γ-Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 500 °C. The second enhances the formation of Mn3O4 species from Mn2O3 deposited initially on the alumina support calcined at 800 and 900 °C. These conclusions can be discussed in terms of modifications of both the oxygen storage capacity of ceria and structural properties of manganese oxides which are found in the investigated solids. The specific surface area of Mn/Al mixed oxides system calcined at 500 °C was found to increase by increasing the amount of dopant added. Opposite effect was observed by increasing the clacination temperature from 500 to 900 °C. The doping process followed by calcination at different temperatures brought about an increase in the catalytic activity of mixed oxides system. These treatments did not modify the mechanism of the catalyzed reaction but changed the number of catalytically active sites taking place in it without changing the energetic nature of these sites. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Also the self-assembly of particles at interfaces offers potential for novel applications and structured particle films. As the colloidal interactions of colloidal particles at interfaces differ from those in bulk, colloidal microstructures can be achieved at an interface which cannot be produced in bulk. In the present work the particle shape, surface charge, and wetting properties are varied, and the resulting self-assembly of particles at a fluid interface is studied. Model monodisperse micrometer-sized ellipsoidal particles were prepared by a mechanical stretching method. These particles were chosen to be well-suited for investigation by optical microscopy. When deposited at an interface between two fluids, shape-induced capillary interactions compete with the electrostatic repulsion. Changing the surface charge and the position at the interface can be used to manipulate the experimentally observed self-assembly process. The initial microstructure of charged ellipsoids at a decane - water interface consists of individual ellipsoids coexisting with linear chains of ellipsoids, connected at their tips. The aggregation behavior in these monolayers was investigated by optical microscopy combined with quantitative image analysis and a dominant tip - tip aggregation was observed. Micro structural information was quantified by calculating the pair-distribution and orientation-distribution functions, as a function of time. Compared to particles at an oil - water interface, particles of the same surface chemistry and charge at an air - water interface seem to have weaker electrostatic interactions, and they also have a different equilibrium position at the interface. The latter leads to differences in the capillary forces. The subsequent change in the balance between electrostatic and capillary forces gave rise to very dense networks having as a typical building block ellipsoids connected at their tips in triangular or flower-like configuration. These networks were very stable and did not evolve in time. The resulting monolayers responded elastically and buckled under compression. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of these monolayers, as measured by surface shear rheology, showed that the monolayer of ellipsoids exhibit a substantial surface modulus even at low surface coverage and can be used to create more elastic monolayers compared to aggregate networks of spheres of the same size and surface properties. © Copyright 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Aggregation behaviors; Air-water interfaces; Building blocks; Capillary forces; Capillary interactions; Colloidal interactions; Colloidal microstructures; Colloidal particles; Dense networks; Electrostatic interactions; Electrostatic repulsions; Ellipsoidal particles; Equilibrium positions; Flower likes; Fluid interfaces; Function of time; Linear chains; Liquid interfaces; Mechanical stretching; Micro-structural; Monodisperse; Novel applications; Oil-water interfaces; Particle shapes; Quantitative image analysis; Self- assemblies; Self-assembly process; Structured particles; Surface coverages; Surface modulus; Surface shears; Two fluids; Water interfaces; Wetting properties; Agglomeration; Charged particles; Distribution functions; Elasticity; Electron energy levels; Electrostatics; Image analysis; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Monolayers; Optical data storage; Optical instruments; Optical microscopy; Paraffins; Plasticity; Rheology; Self assembly; Surface charge; Surface chemistry; Surface properties; Thickness measurement; Viscosity; Phase interfaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65249172441

The adaptation can be achieved by adjusting parameters such as frame rate, error protection ratio, and resolution. Ideally, the server should adapt the serving configurations with respect to the current network and user conditions to improve received video quality. However, adaptations that optimize playable frame rate require intensive computation, and storing all possible configurations requires a tremendous amount of storage. This brings forth the issues of how to obtain good video quality and reduce server resources usage at the same time. We address this issue in this paper. Our approach is based on the observation that transcoding between certain configurations can be performed very efficiently. We propose a framework to compute a set of configurations to store on the server by considering two opposing goals: (a) maximizing expected received quality of the video, and (b) minimizing server resource usage by lowering transcoding cost and expected number of switches between configurations. The second objective also reduces the number of configurations, and therefore reduces the total storage required. Our framework models the relationship among different configurations in a partial order, formulates the search of a good set of configurations as an energy minimization problem, and we use techniques in image segmentation to solve the problem. Experimental results show that our framework relieves the server load and increases the number of clients served, while only slightly reducing the expected frame rate. © 2006 IEEE.","Forward error correction (FEC) protection; Graph cut; Image segmentation; Media server; MPEG streaming; Rate adaptations","Forward error correction (FEC) protection; Graph cut; Media server; MPEG streaming; Rate adaptations; Digital image storage; Image segmentation; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Optimization; Video streaming; Videotex; Forward error correction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63349092314

Although the stocks of oil, gas and coal are rapidly shrinking, even more alarming is that the massive burning of fossil fuels is releasing huge amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere thereby warming up the climate and polluting human habitats. In order to make the economy and welfare sustainable, the fossil fuels must be replaced by carbon neutral, clean and endless energy sources. Both the fossil fuels and most of the renewable fuels are formed by plant and microbial photosynthesis that converts solar energy into chemical energy using water as a source of electrons. More than 2.5 billion years of photosynthesis has been required to accumulate the fossil energy stocks that we are using now. The idea of biofuels is to use online photosynthesis to satisfy the energy demands of human activities. However, the net productivity of world's vegetation is not high enough to substitute the fossil energy stocks and therefore more efficient innovations to harness solar energy by photosynthetic mechanisms are required. Moreover, it is crucial to find ways to make use of oceanic environments and deserts, which from one hand catch plenty of solar energy and from the other hand do not compete with food production. Here we give an overview of the reasons behind the limited capacity of the traditional biofuel feedstocks and illustrate possibilities to enhance the photosynthetic capture and storage of solar energy.","Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Biohydrogen; Biotechnology; Efficiency; Photosynthesis","Bio-hydrogen; Biofuel feedstocks; Food production; Human activities; Limited capacity; Microbial photosynthesis; Oceanic environments; Source of electrons; Arid regions; Biodiesel; Biotechnology; Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Oils and fats; Photosynthesis; Solar energy; Bioethanol; Harness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63049110082

The characterization of the Ni-based catalysts promoted with CeO2 and/or ZrO2 showed that the variations induced in the Al2O3 by the addition of CeO2 and/or ZrO2 alter the catalyst's properties by enhancing Ni dispersion and reducing Ni particle size. The promoters, especially CeO2-ZrO2, improved catalytic activity by increasing the H2 yield and the CO2/CO and the H2/CO values while decreasing coke formation. This results from the addition of ZrO2 into CeO2. This promoter highlights the advantages of oxygen storage capacity and of mobile oxygen vacancies that increase the number of surface oxygen species.

This research was carried out to investigate hydrogen demand and determine the optimum hydrogen delivery network employing truck transportation. Peninsular Malaysia was taken as a case study. The hydrogen demand was determined using two method: Firstly, by assuming that the hydrogen demand in Peninsular Malaysia as a function of total vehicle numbers, average total distance traveled and vehicle fuel economy were measured. While the second method investigated based on the current supply of gasoline and diesel from surveys on local petrol stations in Peninsular Malaysia. As a result, the second method was found as more accurate method and adopted as the overall energy demand in Peninsular Malaysia. Objective function for total investment cost for the future hydrogen infrastructure was developed based on the production technologies, type of transport, type of storage, product phase and plant type.

These lipid-related effects have been attributed to drug-mediated blockade or antagonism of histamine H1 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors as well as activation of hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase. We recently showed that APDs activate lipid biosynthesis in cultured liver cells through stimulation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors. Objective: The objective of the study was to search for clozapine-related lipogenic effects in peripheral tissues in vivo using rat liver as target organ. Materials and methods: Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered single intraperitoneal injections of clozapine (25 and 50 mg/kg). Hepatic lipid levels were measured during a 48-h time course. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to analyze expression of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, oxidation, efflux, and lipolysis. Results: We identified an initial up-regulation of central lipogenic SREBP target genes, followed by a marked and sustained down-regulation. We also observed a sequential transcriptional response for fatty acid β-oxidation and cholesterol efflux genes, normally controlled by the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha and liver X receptor alpha transcription factors, and also down-regulation of genes encoding major lipases. The transcriptional responses were associated with a significant accumulation of triacylglycerol, phospholipids, and cholesterol in the liver. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that acute clozapine exposure affects SREBP-regulated lipid biosynthesis as well as other lipid homeostasis pathways. We suggest that such drug-induced effects on lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues are relevant for the metabolic adverse effects associated with clozapine and possibly other APDs.","Antipsychotic; Clozapine; Energy metabolism; Gene expression; Lipid; Rat; RT-PCR","cholesterol; clozapine; lipid; liver X receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; phospholipid; sterol regulatory element binding protein; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cholesterol transport; controlled study; down regulation; drug effect; drug mechanism; fatty acid oxidation; female; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; lipid liver level; lipid storage; lipogenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; rat; single drug dose; upregulation; Animals; Antipsychotic Agents; Cholesterol Esters; Clozapine; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Injections, Intraperitoneal; Lipase; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Phospholipids; PPAR alpha; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1; Time Factors; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60449111934

Phase one of the country's SOR totaling 106 million bbl will provide China with 30 days of imports by 2010. It is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008. The first two bases, Zhenhai and Zhoushan, are located in the central province of Zhejiang. Each of the facility will have a storage capacity of 5.2 million cu m or 33 million bbl. Each tank has a standard capacity of 100,000 million cu m. Sinopec, with a refinery in Zhenhai, is tasked with the management of the Zhenhai SOR. Sinochem, which is already operating a crude and oil products terminal on Zhoushan, will be responsible for the Zhoushan SOR.

The high load of impurities in the environmental samples was dealt with by adding a density-gradient purification step to the staining protocol. Staining by SYBR Green, combined with either propidium iodide or ethidium bromide (EB)+DiBAC(4)3, was used to quantify the total cell population and further divide this population into: (1) intact cells with an unaffected membrane and energy metabolism. (2) De-energized cells unable to maintain membrane export (EB exclusion). (3) Depolarized cells unable to maintain membrane potential. (4) Permeabilized cells with a damaged membrane. During both stationary-phase storage and steps for preparation of formulation carrier, loss of intact P. fluorescens DR54 cells was quantitatively accounted for by depolarized and permeabilized states. Surviving inoculum cells subsequently proliferated on the germinating seeds, but with a surprisingly high abundance of de-energized cells.

In this work respiration rate of shredded carrots was measured at storage temperatures of 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 °C under different gas composition of O2 and CO2. As expected, temperature was the most influential factor on respiration rate, for all atmospheres tested; as it increased from 0 to 20 °C the values varied from 5.2 ± 0.5 to 51 ± 1 ml/(kg hr) for ambient air. The extreme gas mix (2% O2 + 16% CO2) reduced O2 consumption and CO2 production rates by 30-45%, when compared to the values observed for the samples stored in ambient air. Primary modelling showed that the effect of temperature followed an Arrhenius-type relationship and that the influence gas composition was best described by a Michaelis-Menten uncompetitive model. It was further observed that activation energy for both O2 and CO2, was not statistically different in the range of gas composition tested, thus RQ was considered to be constant (1.2).

The storage of catfish sperm at 4°C leads to ATP depletion and decreased sperm motility. The rate of intracellular ATP depletion can be diminished through the addition of energetic substrates to the sperm storage medium, with lactate + pyruvate being the most efficient substrates for maintaining ATP concentrations in catfish sperm. The decrease in ATP concentration is closely associated with increases in AMP and hypoxanthine content. In contrast to catfish sperm, carp sperm is able to maintain intracellular ATP concentration close to the physiological level during storage. Collectively, these results suggest that fish species differ in terms of the energy metabolism of their spermatozoa and that the semen storage medium must be carefully selected for a particular fish species so as to maintain the ATP concentration and adenylate energy charge close to physiological values as long as possible. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Adenylate energy charge; ATP; Carp; Catfish; Creatine kinase; Creatine phosphate; Herring; Spermatozoa","adenosine triphosphate; creatine kinase; creatine phosphate; lactate dehydrogenase; animal; animal disease; chemistry; comparative study; culture medium; energy metabolism; fish; male; metabolism; physiology; short survey; species difference; sperm preservation; spermatozoon; spermatozoon motility; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Creatine Kinase; Culture Media; Energy Metabolism; Fishes; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Male; Phosphocreatine; Semen Preservation; Species Specificity; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa; Clupeidae; Cyprinidae",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349519195

After photoexcitation with either 390 or 532 nm light, we find that the fragmentation takes place on a microsecond to millisecond time scale, and the channels are CH2COOH loss (β-cleavage reaction) and histidine loss from Fe(III)-heme+ and Fe(III)-heme+(His), respectively. These channels were also observed by means of collision-induced dissociation. Significant information on the nonradiative processes that occur after photoexcitation was revealed from the decay spectra. At early times (first two to three milliseconds), the decay of the photoexcited ions is well-described by a statistical model based on an Arrhenius-type expression for the rate constant. The activation energy and preexponential factor are 1.9 ± 0.2 eV and 1 x 1017 to 1 x 1021 s-1 for heme+ and 1.4 ± 0.2 eV and 1 x 1016 to 1 x 1019 s-1 for heme+(His). Decay on a longer time scale was also observed and is ascribed to the population of lower-lying states with higher spin multiplicity because intersystem crossing back to the electronic ground-state is a bottleneck for the dissociation. The measurements give lifetimes for these lower-lying states of about 10 ms after 390 nm excitation and we estimate the probability of spin flip to be 0.3 and 0.8 for heme+ and heme+(His), respectively. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Arrhenius; Cleavage reactions; Collision-induced dissociations; Decay spectrum; Electronic grounds; Fragmentation channels; Gas-phase; Intersystem crossings; Non-radiative process; Pre-exponential factors; Spin flips; Spin multiplicities; Statistical models; Time-scale; Activation energy; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Electrostatics; Gas absorption; Hemoglobin; Ions; Iron compounds; Photodissociation; Photoexcitation; Photolysis; Probability density function; Rate constants; Spin dynamics; Storage rings; Porphyrins; cation; ferric ion; heme; histidine; article; chemistry; electron; gas; kinetics; photolysis; static electricity; statistical model; thermodynamics; time; Cations; Electrons; Ferric Compounds; Gases; Heme; Histidine; Kinetics; Models, Statistical; Photolysis; Static Electricity; Thermodynamics; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63849298510

The main question is how the use of lifestyle categories in household research can be adapted to industrial SMEs. The rationale for using doing this is to find a new way to approach industrial energy use that can give new insight or raise new questions. Lifestyle categories capture the energy culture of a company, including how energy is perceived and what habits and routines are like. Lifestyle categorisation complements barrier analysis, deepening our understanding of how and why companies improve energy efficiency. Using lifestyle categories in an analysis can help policy makers, who can then direct specific policies to particular segments of companies. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Barriers; Energy efficiency; Household; Industry; Lifestyle; Policy; Sweden","Barriers; Household; Lifestyle; Policy; Sweden; Electric energy storage; Industry; Energy efficiency; energy efficiency; energy use; household energy; lifestyle; policy making; small and medium-sized enterprise; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649871462

We focus, in particular, on the role of the effective scattering length in determining the width of the modulation transfer function, covering a range of scattering lengths describing very opaque to very transparent glass ceramics. We find that the shape of the modulation transfer function is, in general, bimodal, with a broad contribution from the laser beam width, and superimposed a narrow one from scattering. The overall width of the modulation transfer function reaches a minimum when the scattering length is comparable with the beam width, and so scattering lengths either much greater or less than the beam width, corresponding to either strongly scattering or highly transparent glass ceramics, give the best expected spatial resolution. However, for a practical range of scattering parameters, transparent glass ceramics are predicted to have a superior resolution compared to very opaque ones. Simulations are included which also demonstrate the effect of particle size, optical absorption, and readout laser power. Stronger optical absorption at the wavelength of the stimulating beam in comparison with that at the wavelength of the emitted light has a markedly beneficial effect on the spatial resolution at the expense of sensitivity.

Our estimate for the global free energy of encapsulation yields ΔGenc∼-2.5 kbT. The decomposition of the average forces acting on the trapped ion reveals that the encapsulation is controlled by Coulomb interactions between the ion and OH groups in the CD, with a much smaller contribution from the solvent molecules. Changes in the previous results, arising from the partial methylation of the host CD and modifications in the charge distribution of the guest molecule are also discussed.

The chapter has demonstrated that the first-order temporal chromatic aberration can be compensated using a smooth electrostatic mirror but only within the boundary layer located in the turning point vicinity.",,"Digital image storage; Electron optics; Functions; Image converters; Image storage tubes; Imaging systems; Optical transfer function; Optoelectronic devices; Probability density function; Aberration coefficients; Axial symmetries; Chromatic aberrations; Electron images; Electrostatic mirrors; First orders; Frequency properties; Initial energies; Optical transfers; Practical use; Turning points; Aberrations",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58849151432

Low-grade and discard coals, of which South Africa has much, are a source of energy and amenable to combustion in circulating fluidized beds (CFBs). Foster Wheeler (FW) has a long record in developing this technology in boilers. The technology is flexible in burning a variety of fuels; low-grade, high-ash coals, good quality bituminous and anthracite coals, and biomass and waste fuels have all been used. CFB boilers are efficient, reliable and can be designed to meet tight emission standards. In recent years once-through supercritical (OTSC) CFB technology has been developed. It enables the next stage in CFB development to proceed to a medium-scale (500 MWe) utility in such projects as Lagisza, which runs at a net efficiency of nearly 44%. Scaling the technology up to 800 MWe with a net efficiency of &gt;45% is planned to be commercial during 2009. CFB technology can reduce CO2 emissions in the repowering of coal-fired and greenfield power plants. It does so through greater efficiencies and by co-combusting coal with biomass. FW has also developed CFB technology for the gasification of biomass, as, for example, in a pressurized gasifier to produce syngas, which can be used for the production of biodiesel, thereby reducing CO2 emissions from vehicles. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can potentially cut CO2 emissions in the generation of power from fossil fuels in the short term, provided that it gains public acceptance, that the required regulatory framework is created, and that emission-trading mechanisms or other incentives provide a solid return on the major investments required. Oxyfuel combustion is an option in CCS; Foster Wheeler is adapting its CFB combustion technology for oxyfuel combustion to meet this challenge. It is developing Flexiburn TM, which enables a plant to be operated either with or without carbon capture. This paper describes the status of CFB technology in terms of boiler efficiency and fuel flexibility. It highlights the advantages of CFB technology for oxyfuel combustion, presents a development plan for Flexi-burnTM, and discusses a pressurized gasifier for biodiesel applications. © The Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2008.",,"A plants; Boiler efficiency; Carbon capture; Carbon capture and storage; CFB boilers; CFB technology; CFB-combustion; Circulating fluidized bed; Development plans; Emission standard; Foster wheelers; Fuel flexibility; Gasifiers; Greenfield; High-ash coals; Oxyfuel combustion; Power cuts; Public acceptance; Regulatory frameworks; Repowering; Short term; Source of energy; South Africa; Super-critical; Syn-gas; Waste fuels; Biodiesel; Biomass; Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Fluidization; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gasification; Investments; Synthesis gas; Waste incineration; Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960081799

A significant proportion of the estimated cost of CCS for post-combustion capture from coal-fired power stations is due to the additional energy expended to capture the CO2 and compress it for transport and storage. The additional energy either reduces the power plant output or creates additional CO2 which will increase the CCS requirements. Therefore, reductions in the overall energy penalty of CCS by improving the efficiency of both the carbon capture processes and the integration of the capture technology with the power plant can lead to significant reductions in the cost of CCS. Pre-drying lignite using low temperature heat sources enables power stations to increase their energy efficiency by the use of low grade heat, providing energy that is less carbon intensive and potentially reducing the cost of electricity production. This work reviews the current thinking for integration of CO2 capture plants using solvent absorption for postcombustion coal fired power stations. It also reviews the integration potential of brown coal dewatering processes to a power plant with CCS. The review uses as a basis a 200MWe(nominal) train of an existing pulverised brown coal fired power plant using heat and process integration techniques such as heat pinch analysis to determine the potential for reductions in capture cost by minimising the energy penalty associated with the addition of the CCS. The study shows that the energy penalty reduces from 39% for a CCS plant with no heat integration to 24% for a plant with effective heat integration. The energy penalty can be further reduced by the addition of pre-drying of the coal. This study shows there is potential to reduce the energy penalty associated with the addition of CCS, however the heat exchanger network and the required modifications to the existing equipment have not been determined and further work identifying these issues is required and these will have a large impact into whether the reductions suggested by this study can be economically implemented. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Information from remote sensing techniques can help decision makers prepare resource map accurately in less time and cost. GIS assists in linking those maps with other information related to geographic location and helps modeling, analyzing a d solving complex problems. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of Morgan, Morgan and Finney (MMF) Model (Morgan et al., 1984) in predicting soil erosion in an agrarian Ekiti environment with highly dissected hilly and rolling terrain in southwestern Nigeria. Soil loss prediction by MMF approach involve factor maps from kinetic energy of rainfall, topsoil rooting depth, percentage rainfall contributing to permanent interception and stream flow, crop cover management factor, ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration, soil moisture storage capacity. These were used to generate output maps like volume of overland flow, rate of soil detachment by raindrop impact and transport capacity of overland flow. Annual soil loss estimation was calculated by comparing two maps of soil detachmentrate and transport capacity and taking the minimum value from them. Results showed that MMF model could predict erosion risks effectively in the highly dissected hilly and rolling landscape of Ekitienviron. Erosion was low in the area in spite of the landscape. The highest soil loss was 1.275 kgm -2 yr-1 from rock hill with slope greater than 15%. The lowest was 0.942 kgm-2 yr-1 at low lands covered with riparian forest. The average estimated annual soil loss of the study area was 1.112 kgm-2, which is less than tolerable standard of 1 kg 1233 m-2 yr-1. The MMF model shows that the current land-use/cover in Ekiti environs is sustainable because erosion risk is below the critical level. © 2009 Academic Journals.","Hilly landscape; Land use; MMF model; Nigeria; Soil erosion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350070106

The analysis is carried out with a techno-economic model (minimizing the system cost) including a detailed description of the present stationary European electricity generation system (power plants) and potential CO2 storage sites as obtained from the Chalmers Energy Infrastructure Database. Since the ability of different EU Member States and regions to facilitate and to benefit from CCS will most likely depend on local conditions in terms of current energy mix, fuel supply chains and distance to suitable storage locations, special emphasize is put on analyzing turn-over in capital stock of the existing power plant infrastructure, timing of investments and the infrastructural implications of large scale introduction of CCS on a regional perspective. The paper discusses the role of and requirements on CCS for meeting strict emission targets of 85% reduction while having a continued growth in electricity demand (according to EU projections). The results show that it is possible to meet an 85% CO2 reduction target by 2050, but this will require large contribution from CCS. As expected, regions which are currently high in carbon intensity and which are located nearby suitable storage sites will benefit mostly from CCS as an option.

This paper sets out and explains the approach. The legal framework comprises a Proposal for a Directive on the geological storage of sarbon dioxide (COM(2008)18 final) and explicit recognition of capture, transport and storage of CO2 in the proposal amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to improve and extend the greenhouse gas emissions allowance trading system of the Community (COM(2008)16 final). The first proposal covers the regulation of the elements of the CCS chain. Capture and transport are regulated using existing legal frameworks, but the proposal lays out a dedicated legal framework for storage. The framework builds on the IPCC 2006 Inventory Guidelines and the OSPAR 2007 risk management framework for CCS, and covers site exploration, selection, permitting, monitoring, reporting, measures in case of leakage, liabilities, financial provisions for any leakage, and access to the transport and storage network. The second proposal provides that capture, transport and storage of CO2 are activities under Annex I of the Emissions Trading Directive, without any free allocation (as they are abatement activities). Emissions captured, transported and safely stored will be considered as not emitted under the ETS, but allowances will have to be surrendered for any leakage. Auctioning revenues from the third phase of the ETS (which proposes full auctioning for the power sector) will provide a potential source of finance for CCS demonstration. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

With few other economically exploitable energy resources, and in common with similarly placed countries, such emissions are likely to continue, even in spite of renewable energy programmes and energy efficiency measures. Consequently, South Africa is investigating the use of carbon capture and storage as a green-house gas emission mitigation measure. It has been shown that of the more than 400 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted per year, approximately 60% is sequestratable -that is, point sources and capturable. Of that, nearly 30 million tonnes per year of ∼95% pure carbon dioxide is emitted by the synthetic fuel industry. It is therefore likely that any envisaged carbon capture and storage project in South Africa is most likely to make use of the almos t pure carbon dioxide stream emanating from the synthetic fuel plants-the capture element that comprises approximately half the cost having already been done. Preliminary studies and the subject of this paper have indicated that at least 100 gigatonnes of geological storage could be available-more than four times the capacity required to store 240 million tonnes per year for 100 years. Most of that pertains to deep saline aquifers, with some extra prospects of depleted gas fields and enhanced coal-bed methane recovery. Potential storage sites and their characterisation will be addressed in the form of a carbon geological storage atlas that is scheduled for completion by the end of 2009. Following that, it is contemplated that a small-scale demonstration project [say 10,000 tonnes per year] may be undertaken in order for local scientists and engineers to obtain first hand experience in this technology and to prove-up local geological formations. In order to develop capacity, both human and technical, is this relative new field, a Centre for Carbon Capture and Storage is to be established in the South Africa National Energy Research Institute. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, our findings and results since GHGT-8 as well as current activities and near-future plans regarding CO2 mineral carbonation are presented. The focus lies on the use of fluidised bed (FB) reactors for the carbonation of magnesium silicates via magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide intermediates, at temperatures and pressures up to 600 {ring operator}C, 100 bar (allowing for both sub- and supercritical conditions for CO2), supported by earlier experiments using pressurised thermogravimetric analysis (PTGA). In addition, as the production of reactive magnesium from silicate mineral is not straightforward, it receives special attention, and first results of magnesium hydroxide production from serpentine using different methods are presented. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Its basis on the thermodynamic laws is expressed in mathematical models for body-weight changes. Only a very small net energy surplus per time unit constitutes the energy deposition during weight gain, making measurements of its components difficult. The physical laws provide exact quantitative relationships between energy intake, energy expenditure and deposition of energy, but cannot disentangle the initiating and driving forces of the energy imbalance, which may also be an active storage of fat in adipose tissue. These and various other limitations of the energy balance model warrant cautiousness in using the model in studies of obesity causation. Weight gain may be self-promoting and mathematical feedback models allowing estimation of such effects show that they are realistic. Predisposition and susceptibility should be distinguished, and susceptibility as a modifiable predisposition, the genetic and environmental contribution to predisposition and its usefulness as targets for prevention and treatment are discussed. Current progress in unravelling genetic predisposition, the complex genetically-determined mechanisms, the slower progress in unravelling the environmental influences, the different nature of genetic and environmental influences, the possible pathways of environmental influences and the environmental influences as mediators of genetic effects are addressed. The evidence behind the prevailing concept of the obesogenic environment is critically analysed. Finally, particular opportunities for the identification of the causes of the obesity epidemic by detailed analysis of an observed irregular development of the epidemic over long time periods are presented, and evidence for predisposition as a result of postnatal environmental influences is inferred from these studies.","Causation of obesity; Energy balance; Obesity epidemic; Obesogenic environment","adult; article; caloric intake; causal attribution; child; disease predisposition; energy; energy balance; energy expenditure; environmental factor; epidemic; heredity; human; male; obesity; preschool child; school child; thermodynamics; weight change; weight gain; adipose tissue; adolescent; basal metabolic rate; diabetes mellitus; diet; eating; energy metabolism; environment; exercise; female; genetic predisposition; genetics; homeostasis; low birth weight; metabolism; newborn; obesity; theoretical model; time; Adipose Tissue; Adolescent; Basal Metabolism; Child; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Eating; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Environment; Exercise; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Homeostasis; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Male; Models, Theoretical; Obesity; Thermodynamics; Time Factors; Weight Gain; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65549140859

TEM micrographs show that MWNTs are shortened and open-ended after ball milling. The effects of different MWNT type and ball milling time on the discharging capacity were investigated. Among all the samples examined, the sample of short MWNTs with diameter of 5 nm and ball milling time of 12 h has the largest discharge capacity (741.1 mAh/g). According to the analysis of Raman spectra and nitrogen adsorption experiments, it can be inferred that the micropore volume, specific surface area and appropriate defects are crucial to the storage capacity. In the cyclic voltammograms, the hydrogen desorption peak appears prior to hydrogen oxidation peak, which is attributed to the slow reaction of hydrogen oxidation at MWNTs.

However, in Composite-CNT1-2, due to the overlong ball-milling time, the crystalline structure of the CNTs has been destroyed and amorphous carbons have formed. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectra measurements indicate that the CNT modification in Composite-CNT1-1 increases the electrocatalytic activity and surface area, which leads to its higher discharge capacity and HRD. The larger electrochemical reaction resistance caused by amorphous carbon in Composite-CNT1-2 results in its lower discharge capacity and HRD.

A range of power generation technologies integrated with carbon capture and storage (CCS) were examined as candidate options and compared with the business as usual scenario. Based on the input data and the assumptions made, the simulations indicated that the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology with pre-combustion CCS integration is the least cost option for the future expansion of the power generation system. In particular, the results showed that for a natural gas price of 7.9US$/GJ the IGCC technology with pre-combustion CCS integration is the most economical choice, closely followed by the pulverized coal technology with post-combustion CCS integration. The combined cycle technology can, also, be considered as alternative competitive technology. The combined cycle technologies with pre- or post-combustion CCS integration yield more expensive electricity unit cost. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been also carried out in order to examine the effect of the natural gas price on the optimum planning. For natural gas prices greater than 6.4US$/GJ the least cost option is the use of IGCC technology with CCS integration. It can be concluded that the Cyprus's power generation system can be shifted slowly towards the utilization of CCS technologies in favor of the existing steam power plants in order not only to lower the environmental emissions and fulfilling the recent European Union Energy Package requirements but also to reduce the associated electricity unit cost. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper builds upon several comprehensive databases designed during the work and considerable efforts have been made to review what must be considered the most reliable data. Global oil resources have been investigated on three levels; country, company and field levels. Although no decisive conclusions or quantitative assessments can be made with respect to the global oil resource base, remaining resources appear to be sufficient to meet demand up to 2030 as projected in the 2006 (and 2007) world energy outlook by the IEA. Significant resources have already been discovered beyond proven reserves, many prospective regions remain to be fully explored and there are vast volumes of recoverable unconventional oil. However, it is also concluded that global supply of oil probably will continue to be tight, both in the medium term as well as in the long term mainly as a consequence of above-ground factors such as investment constraints, geopolitical tensions, limited access to reserves and mature super-giant fields. Production of unconventional oil and synthetic fuels is not believed to significantly alter this situation. Although an increasing number of recent reports have indicated an imminent or ""soon to come"" peak in global oil supply, it has not been found that any of these reports have contributed with any new information on oil resources or oil supply ability. Nevertheless, there is a distinct possibility that global oil production may peak or plateau in a relatively near future, not caused by limited resources but because too many factors over long time constrain investments into exploration and production. The lack of transparency within the oil industry obviously prevents any accurate analysis of future production and supply ability. Moreover, our ability to analyse the sector will become more difficult in the future as oil increasingly will have to be sourced from countries with a poor transparency. The world will become increasingly dependent on a few countries in the Middle East and on Russia not only for the supply of oil but also for the supply of gas which to a large extent will be utilised for power and heat generation. A responsible policy should under these circumstances seek to enhance energy security which should be directed towards promoting energy efficiency measures (reduce demand) in combination with increased utilisation of indigenous fuel resources such as renewables and fossil fuels in combination with CO2 capture and storage. Such a policy would both facilitate the transmission to a more sustainable energy system in the future as well as enhance energy security. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The results are validated on a semi-insulating gallium arsenide (SI-GaAs) PIN structure. The numerical simulation is made by the resolution of the phenomenological transport's equations by adopting a new approach permitting to study the conduction phenomena through all the structure. From the 3D modelling, the variation of the potential profile, the free carriers and the space charge distributions, and the electrical field inside the structure are simulated. The effects of the traps are taken into account through the mechanisms of recombination and storage of a significant space charge, where the influence of the presence of these levels on the above factors is seen. Through this work a physical model intended for the study of the influence of the trap levels on the potential and the free carrier density distributions for weak lifetime semiconductors, more particularly on semi-insulating GaAs is introduced. Taking into account the trap centres is essential for a good comprehension and explanation of the transport phenomena. The present study consists to do a simulation and a modelisation of structures based on materials presenting a deep and a trap centres.

Antecedents of adoption include prior investments in AMT, developments in firms' manufacturing capabilities, technology strategy, absorptive capacity, and environmental pressures. Based on a sample of 87 Greek manufacturing SMEs, we find that AMT adoption follows an incremental, piecemeal progression from the least complicated through intermediate to integrated technologies. It is found that an increase in the firms' quality and flexibility capabilities induces them to adopt further AMT, whereas advances in low-cost, innovation, and delivery capabilities appear negatively related to further AMT adoption. Absorptive capacity, technology strategy and environmental pressures play a central role in decisions for additional investments in AMT.

Meanwhile, the contribution of renewable energy sources (RES) to the constant increase recorded in both the Aegean islands' annual electricity generation and the corresponding peak load demand is very limited. To compensate the unfavorable situation encountered, the implementation of energy storage systems (ESS) that can both utilize the excess/rejected energy produced from RES plants and improve the operation of existing thermal power units is recommended. In the present study, a techno-economic comparison of various RES-ESS configurations supported by the supplementary or back-up use of existing thermal units is undertaken. From the results obtained, the shift of direction from the existing oil-dependent status to a RES-based alternative in collaboration with certain storage technologies entails - apart from the clear environmental benefits - financial advantages as well. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Heat storage systems are used in applications where the available energy supply is not synchronous with the demand, such as solar thermal and waste heat recovery systems. The theoretical study conducted here - based on heat transfer and energy conservation equations - is intended to developing a theoretical model of the heat storage properties of phase change slurries capable of predicting the transient thermal response of a thermal energy storage system (TES).

Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) contribute substantially to environmental degradation, often not even being aware of their environmental effects. Therefore, several initiatives have been launched in Austria aimed at supporting waste prevention measures on the level of SMEs. To promote the most efficient projects, they have to be evaluated with respect to their contribution to the goals of waste management. It is the aim of this paper to develop a methodology for evaluating waste prevention measures in SMEs based on their goal orientation. At first, conceptual problems of defining and delineating waste prevention activities are briefly discussed. Then an approach to evaluate waste prevention activities with respect to their environmental performance is presented and benchmarks which allow for an efficient use of the available funds are developed. Finally the evaluation method is applied to a number of former projects and the calculated results are analysed with respect to shortcomings and limitations of the model. It is found that the developed methodology can provide a tool for a more objective and comprehensible evaluation of waste prevention measures. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - The reported system is explained in detail and a few practical examples are given that demonstrate its usefulness for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), where robots and humans need to cooperate to achieve a common goal (coworker scenario). The paper also explores the user interface software adapted for use by non-experts. Findings - The programming-by-demonstration (PbD) system presented proved to be very efficient with the task of programming entirely new features to an industrial robotic system. The system uses a speech interface for user command, and a force-controlled guiding system for teaching the robot the details about the task being programmed. With only a small set of implemented robot instructions it was fairly easy to teach the robot system a new task, generate the robot code and execute it immediately. Research limitations/implications - Although a particular robot controller was used, the system is in many aspects general, since the options adopted are mainly based on standards. It can obviously be implemented with other robot controllers without significant changes. In fact, most of the features were ported to run with Motoman robots with success. Practical implications - It is important to stress that the robot program built in this section was obtained without writing a single line of code, but instead just by moving the robot to the desired positions and adding the required robot instructions using speech. Even the upload task of the obtained module to the robot controller is commanded by speech, along with its execution/termination. Consequently, teaching the robotic system a new feature is accessible for any type of user with only minor training. Originality/value - This type of PbD systems will constitute a major advantage for SMEs, since most of those companies do not have the necessary engineering resources to make changes or add new functionalities to their robotic manufacturing systems. Even at the system integrator level these systems are very useful for avoiding the need for specific knowledge about all the controllers with which they work: complexity is hidden beyond the speech interfaces and portable interface devices, with specific and user-friendly APIs making the connection between the programmer and the system. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Control technology; Robotics; Speech recognition; Systems software; User interfaces","Computer software; Concurrency control; Electric energy storage; Industrial robots; Robotics; Robots; Speech analysis; Speech recognition; Teaching; User interfaces; Code generations; Control technology; Design/methodology/approach; Desired positions; Device interfaces; Engineering resources; Guiding systems; Industrial robotic systems; Interface devices; Line of codes; Practical implications; Robot controllers; Robot programs; Robot systems; Robotic Manufacturing Systems; Robotic systems; Small- to medium-sized enterprises; Specific knowledges; Speech interfaces; System integrators; System uses; Systems software; User commands; User interface softwares; Robot programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58349119990

The hydrogels exhibit pH close to 8 and are physically stable. Titration with NaCl revealed a high degree of counterion condensation C-AZI. The release of AZI in a Franz cell was almost negligible when the receptor compartment was filled with water but was increased about 20 times as water is replaced by NaCl solution. Two analytical methods were used to evaluate the effect of the counterionic condensation on the chemical stability of AZI, a microbial assay and an HPLC method. Degradation of AZI in buffered aqueous solution was used as reference. The stability of AZI was significantly improved in the hydrogels retaining more than 75% of the initial concentration along a period of 18-20 months evaluated and the self life (t90) of the drug was increased 27 and 20 times over the reference.

A sudden change in active load will cause both a phase jump and a magnitude fluctuation in the bus voltage (voltage at the PCC), whereas reactive load changes mainly affect the voltage magnitude. With the addition of energy storage to a static synchronous compensator (StatCom), it is possible to compensate for the active power change as well as providing reactive power support. In this paper effective active power compensation schemes are proposed. Simulation and experimental results verify the compensation schemes by showing that a StatCom with energy storage can significantly reduce phase jumps and magnitude deviations of the bus voltage under load disturbances. © 2009 IEEE.","Active power compensation; Energy storage; Phase jump; StatCom; Voltage dip; Voltage source converter (VSC); Weak network","Electric fault currents; Energy storage; Flywheels; Power converters; Power quality; Synchronous machinery; Active power compensation; Phase jump; StatCom; Voltage dip; Voltage source converter (VSC); Weak network; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60149109046

This work presents different approaches to build 1,2-dioleolyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) layers doped with a monosialoganglioside (GM1) supported on silica surfaces, which are stable toward buffer rinsing and washing with surfactant (Tween 20). The three methods employed were: method 1, coadsorption of DOPC:GM1 (0-10 mol%) with the surfactant n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) from micellar solutions, with successive adsorption and rinsing steps; method 2, vesicle fusion from DOPC: GM1 (0-10 mol%) liposomes; and method 3, deposition of GM1 from organic solvent (chloroform) and exposure to an aqueous environment (hydration method). The vesicle fusion method was also tested in polystyrene surfaces. Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was used to detect the presence of GM1 on the formed layers. The results indicated that the vesicle fusion was the only method that was successful in creating stable mono- and bilayers onto hydrophobized and hydrophilic silica, respectively. The mixed micellar solution method was suitable for creating pure lipid (DOPC) monolayers but the incorporation of GM1 in the micelles led to monolayers which were very unstable with respect to buffer rinsing. The hydration method led to monolayers of GM1 that were partly rinsed off by a continuous buffer flow. Adsorption of CTB was found to be proportional to the amount of GM1 present in the liposomes. The amount of CTB adsorbed onto the lipid bilayers was roughly the double as the one determined on the monolayers with the same liposome compositions. The vesicle fusion method was also able to create monolayers of pure DOPC and DOPC:10 mol% GM1 on the polystyrene surfaces. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, the best antioxidative effect was observed when it was added at a concentration of 660 μg/g fish oil. In contrast, prooxidative effects were observed when using either γ-tocopherol at concentrations below 220 μg/g fish oil, or the hydrophilic caffeic acid, or the amphiphilic ascorbyl palmitate at concentrations of 75, 150 and 300 μg/g fish oil.

Objective: The aim was to assess the effects of fructose, a potent stimulator of hepatic de novo lipogenesis, on intrahepatocellular lipids (IHCLs) and insulin sensitivity in healthy offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes (OffT2D) - a subgroup of individuals prone to metabolic disorders. Design: Sixteen male OffT2D and 8 control subjects were studied in a crossover design after either a 7-d isocaloric diet or a hypercaloric high-fructose diet (3.5 g·kg FFM-1·d-1, +35% energy intake). Hepatic and whole-body insulin sensitivity were assessed with a 2-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (0.3 and 1.0 mU·kg-1·min -1), together with 6,6-[2H2]glucose. IHCLs and intra-myocellular lipids (IMCLs) were measured by 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results: The OffT2D group had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher IHCLs (94%), total triacylglycerols (+35%), and lower whole-body insulin sensitivity (-27%) than did the control group. The high-fructose diet significantly increased IHCLs (control: +76%; OffT2D: +79%), IMCLs (control: +47%; OffT2D: +24%), VLDL-triacylglycerols (control: +51%; OffT2D: +110%), and fasting hepatic glucose output (control: +4%; OffT2D: +5%). Furthermore, the effects of fructose on VLDL-triacylglycerols were higher in the OffT2D group (group x diet interaction: P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: A 7-d high-fructose diet increased ectopic lipid deposition in liver and muscle and fasting VLDL-triacylglycerols and decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity. Fructose-induced alterations in VLDL-triacylglycerols appeared to be of greater magnitude in the OffT2D group, which suggests that these individuals may be more prone to developing dyslipidemia when challenged by high fructose intakes.

Other parts of the food system contribute carbon dioxide emissions that emanate from the use of fossil fuels in transportation, processing, retailing, storage, and preparation. Food items differ substantially when GHG emissions are calculated from farm to table. A recent study of ≈20 items sold in Sweden showed a span of 0.4 to 30 kg CO2 equivalents/kg edible product. For protein-rich food, such as legumes, meat, fish, cheese, and eggs, the difference is a factor of 30 with the lowest emissions per kilogram for legumes, poultry, and eggs and the highest for beef, cheese, and pork. Large emissions for ruminants are explained mainly by methane emissions from enteric fermentation. For vegetables and fruits, emissions usually are ≤2.5 kg CO2 equivalents/kg product, even if there is a high degree of processing and substantial transportation. Products transported by plane are an exception because emissions may be as large as for certain meats. Emissions from foods rich in carbohydrates, such as potatoes, pasta, and wheat, are &lt;1.1 kg/kg edible food. We suggest that changes in the diet toward more plant-based foods, toward meat from animals with little enteric fermentation, and toward foods processed in an energy-efficient manner offer an interesting and little explored area for mitigating climate change. © 2009 American Society of Nutrition.",,"carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; methane; nitrous oxide; bovids; climate change; conference paper; feeding behavior; food industry; food intake; human; nonhuman; protein intake; agriculture; air pollution; animal; article; climate; diet; egg; greenhouse effect; legume; meat; physiology; Animalia; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Animals; Climate; Diet; Eggs; Fabaceae; Food Habits; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Meat; Ruminants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65549146790

After oil extraction, milkweed remaining cake retained approximately 10% residual oil, 47% protein, and 10% moisture. The fiber (300 μm) was added at 85 : 15 and 70 : 30 PLA : Fiber and blended by extrusion (EX) followed by injection molding (IM). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used for testing the composites. After melting in the DSC sealed pans, composites were cooled by immersion in liquid nitrogen and aged (stored) at room temperature for 0, 7, 15, and 30 days. After storage, samples were heated from room temperature to 180°C at 10°C/min. The pure PLA showed a glass transition (Tg) at 60.3°C and the corresponding ΔCp was 0.464 J/g/°C followed by crystallization and melting transitions. The enthalpic relaxation (ER) of neat PLA and composites steadily increased as a function of storage time. Although the presence of fiber had little effect on ER, IM reduced it. The percentage crystallinity of neat unprocessed. PLA dropped by 95 and 80% for the EX and IM, respectively. The degradation activation energy (Ea) of neat PLA exhibited a significant drop in nitrogen environment, whereas increased in air, indicating PLA resistant to heat degradation in the presence of oxygen. Overall, IM appeared to decrease Ea of the composites, whereas milkweed significantly reduced Ea values in nitrogen environment. Enzymatic degradation of the composites revealed higher degradation rate for the EX samples versus IM, whereas 30% milkweed exhibited higher weight loss compared to the 15%. The degradation mechanism was observed by looking at the percent conversion as a function of Ea from the TGA data, where multisteps degradation occurred mostly in air. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Composites; Degradation kinetics; DSC; Glass transition; Gordon-Taylor-Fox; Milkweed; Poly(lactic acid); TGA","Composites; Degradation kinetics; DSC; Gordon-Taylor-Fox; Milkweed; Poly(lactic acid); TGA; Acids; Activation energy; Biological materials; Body fluids; Crops; Differential scanning calorimetry; Digital cameras; Electric resistance; Extrusion molding; Fibers; Glass; Glass transition; Gravimetric analysis; Lactic acid; Laser interferometry; Liquefied gases; Liquid nitrogen; Nitrogen; Oil well production; Organic acids; Oxygen; Thermodynamic properties; Thermogravimetric analysis; Degradation; aging; composite; crystallinity; enzymatic degradation; extrusion; injection molding; kinetics; oil; oxygen; polylactic acid; thermal property; thermogravimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149213840

Containing the means to define the variations within the cylinder while employing detailed chemistry, micro mixing and heat transfer modeling, the interaction between heat transfer, exhaust gas energy and the combustion process can be studied with the SRM. A multidimensional study was setup with the SRM to investigate the interaction between heat transfer, exhaust gas energy and the combustion process and its dependency from level of cylinder wall thermal insulation or heat storage, inlet pressure, inlet temperature, mixture strength, mixture and temperature stratification, compression ratio, valve timing, residual gas amount and fuel effects. The investigation reaches into combustion and engine operating regimes that so far have not been investigated experimentally before. It is found that by using this combined approach a multidimensional span of engine and combustion characteristics can be produced, giving deeper insights in the potential for efficiency increase through combined low temperature combustion and low heat rejection.

One critical research area is related to achieving a full understanding of the impact of biodiesel fuel blends on advanced emission control systems. In addition, the use of biodiesel fuel blends can degrade diesel engine oil performance and impact the oil drain interval requirements. There is limited information related to the impact of biodiesel fuel blends on oil dilution. This paper assesses the oil dilution impacts on an engine operating in conjunction with a diesel particle filter (DPF), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) storage, a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) emission control system, and a 20% biodiesel (soy-derived) fuel blend. The main focus was on the biodiesel oil dilution levels observed during an accelerated aging protocol and an assessment of the potential impacts on the engine and emissions control systems. For the NOx storage system (which requires a late in-cylinder fuel injection for regeneration), biodiesel oil dilution levels ranged from 5%-10%. For the SCR system (which used a urea solution as a reductant and late in-cylinder fuel injection for diesel particle filter regeneration), biodiesel oil dilution ranged from &lt;4%-8%. These observations were made over typical oil drain intervals. Despite these observed biodiesel oil dilution levels, there were no observed impacts on performance of the engine or the emission control systems.

The relation between these properties determines the optimal control of the EGU, and this is thus the mechanism behind all optimal control problems using a similar model setup.

Damage assessments continue. On August 31, Secretary of Energy Bodman indicated that the Bush Administration was authorizing releases of Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) crude oil. Operating refineries whose crude supply has been interrupted by the hurricane can request a loan or swap of crude from the SPR. By September 2, three requests for loans totaling 8.5 million barrels had been approved; a few others are pending. The Administration also announced it was making 30 million barrels available. However, as a policy tool to respond to the crisis, the SPR has limitations, because a barrel of crude contributes to product supply only if there is refining capacity to turn the crude into gasoline or diesel fuel. Consequently, recovery from the hurricane’s effects will depend on resumption of production and refining operations in the Gulf, and ability to transport petroleum products. On August 8, 2005, the President signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (H.R. 6). The bill as enacted permanently authorizes the SPR and requires, “as expeditiously as practicable,” expansion of the SPR to its authorized maximum of 1 billion barrels. The SPR, with a capacity of 727 million barrels, currently holds 700 million barrels, though the amount will decline some as refiners borrow crude. Congress authorized the SPR in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA, P.L. 94-163) to help prevent a repetition of the economic dislocation caused by the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. The program is managed by the Department of Energy (DOE). Physically, the SPR comprises five underground storage facilities, hollowed out from naturally occurring salt domes in Texas and Louisiana. Four of the storage sites are operable at this time. A Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) holds 2 million barrels of heating oil in aboveground storage. A formula governs its use, and it has yet to be tapped. In mid-November 2001, President Bush ordered fill of the SPR to its capacity (at that time) of 700 million barrels, principally with oil acquired as royalty-in-kind (RIK) for production from federal offshore leases. Deliveries of RIK oil ended in August 2005 when the SPR reached 700 million barrels. The bill signed by the President also requires the Secretary of Energy to fill the SPR to its authorized size of one billion barrels. Within one year of enactment, the Secretary will select sites — from among those that have been previously studied — for the expansion. The Secretary is also required to develop procedures for achieving the fill objective without “incurring excessive cost,” or using fill options that would place upward pressure on prices. Any fill policy is also to take into consideration minimizing income foregone to the Treasury by filling the SPR with additional RIK oil. Given these parameters and the difficulty of predicting the state of oil markets in the future, it is unclear whether, once sites are identified, fill will be resumed The Administration request for FY2006 for the SPR itself was $166.0 million, a reduction of roughly $4 million from the FY2005 appropriation. No new money was requested for the NHOR in FY2006 owing to prior year balances of $5.3 million. The Houseand Senate-passed versions of the FY2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill support the levels proposed by the Administration. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Research on the development and enhancement of these models is performed on two tracks: on one hand by defining the model topology, where a trade-off is sought between the reduction of components in the model equivalent scheme and the ability of the model to describe all potential system behaviour and, on the other hand by improving the method of calculating the magnitudes of the different components in the model. The storage devices examined in this paper are divided in two groups, electrochemical devices and electrical double layer capacitors. The first group consists of lead-acid, lithium, Ni-Cd and Ni-MH batteries. The second group comprises of Electric Double-Layer Capacitors (EDLC). For every model used to describe a battery or EDLC, different techniques are implemented to calculate the magnitude of the components. The work presented in this paper will elaborate to the calculating method used in NREL's FreedomCAR test-manual adapted to fit different battery- and EDLC models. This method consists of an iterative approach to the equations of the model using data gathered from performing tests on the battery or supercapacitor. Validation of the models obtained through this calculating method will be done by performance tests on the storage devices. As the models of batteries and supercapacitors are a key aspect in the simulation software for hybrid-vehicles more accurate models result in more accurate simulations. These simulation programs depend upon the underlying component models, the data generated by which determines the accuracy of the program's data-output. The availability of reliable storage RESS models will thus be a key element in to allow overall vehicle modelling. © 2009 AVERE.","Battery model; EDLC; Simulation","Battery management systems; Cadmium alloys; Computer software; Economic and social effects; Electromagnetic wave emission; Iterative methods; Lead acid batteries; Lithium batteries; Supercapacitor; Topology; Virtual storage; Battery modeling; EDLC; Electrical double layer capacitor; Electrical parameter; Energy storage systems; Simulation; Simulation software; Underlying components; Nickel metal hydride batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042301136

Renewable energy is regarded as a solution to this problem, mainly in its transformation to electricity. This, however, excludes the impact of the transportation sector that represents a significant component of the imported fuels consumption. Other main limitation associated to renewable electricity consists on the need to increase the storage capacity that might attenuate the effect of intermittence of renewable energy sources and the disparity between supply and demand. In both problems - that are associated with renewable energy management - Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV) could be a part of the solution in that the use of vehicle to grid (V2G) technology can provide storage of electric energy during low demand times and use it to match the demand in peak hours and/or to avoid fossil fuel consumption. Therefore, some of the main questions are: could the large scale PEV penetration lead to increases in the fraction of electricity produced from renewable? Is the usage of PEV batteries as a storage system truly the best solution? São Miguel Island is the main electricity consumer in the whole Azores's archipelago. There is no power connection to any major grid or even with other Islands.

The coordination of the charging gives an improvement of the grid exploitation in terms of reduced power losses and voltage deviations with respect to uncoordinated charging. The vehicles must be dispatchable to achieve the most efficient solution. As the exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, stochastic programming is introduced. Two main techniques are analyzed in this paper: quadratic and dynamic programming. Both techniques are compared in results and storage requirements. The charging can be coordinated directly or indirectly by the grid utility or an aggregator who will sell the aggregated demand of PHEVs at the utility. PHEVs can also discharge and so inject energy in the grid to restrict voltage drops. The amount of energy that is injected in the grid depends on the price tariffs, the charging and discharging efficiencies and the battery energy content. The impact of a voltage controller embedded in a PHEV charger is regarded in this paper. A day and night tariff are applied. The charging and discharging of vehicles can respond to real-time pricing or on a price-schedule as well.

The environmental impact of hydrogen - used in a fuel cell (FCEV) or internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) - depends strongly on the production pathway for hydrogen and should therefore be evaluated on a well-to-wheel basis. In this paper, the Ecoscore methodology is used to assess the environmental impact of H2-ICE and fuel cell vehicles on a well-to-wheel basis. The Ecoscore is an environmental indicator for vehicles taking into account the impact on global warming, air quality depletion (divided into impact on human health and ecosystems) and noise. The Ecoscores of two FCEV and one H2-ICEV are calculated for different hydrogen production pathways (electrolysis and Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)), as well as for different methods of hydrogen storage (compression and liquefaction) and distribution (pipeline and truck). The highest Ecoscores - and thus best results - are obtained for vehicles using hydrogen from electrolysis produced with 100 % renewable energy, followed by SMR and then electrolysis using the Belgian electricity mix. Compression appears to be better than liquefaction to store hydrogen due to the high energy use for the liquefaction process, and this compressed hydrogen should be transported through pipelines in stead of by trucks to obtain the best environmental performance. © 2009 AVERE.","Energy; Environment; Fuel cell; Hydrogen; ICE (internal combustion engine)","Acid rain; Air quality; Alternative fuels; Combustion; Ecosystems; Electrolysis; Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Ice; Internal combustion engines; Liquefaction; Pipelines; Steam reforming; Trucks; Vehicle wheels; Compressed hydrogens; Energy; Environment; Environmental analysis; Environmental indicators; Environmental issues; Environmental performance; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042267106

There are two major applications of HBr fuel cells and electrolyzers: electrical energy storage systems (ESSs) and hydrogen production. The HBr system is attractive for energy storage applications because of the high reversibility of both hydrogen and bromine electrodes, which allows a single electrochemical unit to be used in both fuel cell and electrolyzer modes. The hydrogen oxidation catalyst with the highest activity is platinum (or its alloys), and it is used in most hydrogen-oxygen proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. However, there is continuing effort to find better and lower cost catalysts. In HBr fuel cells and electrolyzers, the membrane does not completely prevent the crossover of bromides or bromine species. Therefore, these species tend to poison the hydrogen electrode catalyst, and thereby reduce the catalyst activity.

Each infant was studied at baseline for 3 days of stool collection, at the end of which energy expenditure (EE) was measured 1 hour after meals. Each infant was then supplemented with 3 g CO/kg/d for 3 days, after which the study was repeated. Stools were collected for fat analysis. EE increased from 58 ± 6.8 to 62.4 ± 4.6 kcal/kg/24 hours after introduction of CO (P &lt; .03). Stool fat increased from 1.37 ± 1.2 to 2.18 ± 1.2 g/kg/d. Of the fat added, 27% was lost in stools, and 17% was wasted as spent energy. The increase in EE correlated significantly with the coefficient of fat absorption (R2 = 0.56, P = .029).

A number of renewable electricity technologies, such as wind, wave, tidal, solar, and run-of-river hydro share a characteristic that distinguishes them from conventional power plants: their output varies according to the availability of the resource. This is commonly perceived to be challenging at high shares, but there is no intrinsic, technical ceiling to variable renewables' potential. Variability has to be looked at in the context of power system flexibility: if a power system is sufficiently flexible, in terms of power production, load management, interconnection and storage, the importance of the variability aspect is reduced. A flexible electricity system is one that can respond reliably, and rapidly, to large fluctuations in supply and demand. Flexibility is already present in all power systems, in order to manage fluctuations in demand, and it is crucial for high performance and economic and reliable operation. Consequently, low shares of variable renewables will present little additional impact in all but the least flexible (often the smallest) power systems. With large additions of supply-side variability, as fluctuations in output approach the scale of fluctuations in demand, additional measures must be taken to increase flexibility, in order to maintain reliability.The net variability in the combined output of many variable renewable electricity plants, based on different resources, at different locations over a wide area, is smoother than the output of individual power plants. This smoothing effect can be taken advantage of if the power plants are connected by adequate transmission capacity, and may reduce the need for additional system flexibility.The flexibility resource of any power system consists of a number of factors. On the supply side, chief among them are quickly dispatchable power plants, interconnection among adjacent power systems, and energy storage. However, a significant flexibility resource is also available on the demand side: changing the ""shape"" of demand to suit fluctuations in supply. This is as yet under-exploited.Both physical and market access to the flexibility resource are essential to increase the potential for variable renewables. In some countries, electricity is traded at shorter timescales relative to the traditional model of long-term bilateral contracts, through spot markets, and shorter gate closure times within such markets enable faster response to fluctuating supply and demand. An increasingly flexible approach to trading reduces the impact of forecast errors both in supply and demand, and increases access to the existing flexibility resource, reducing the need for additional fast response power plants, interconnection or storage. Much of existing transmission hardware in OECD countries was built in the middle of the last century, and a new investment cycle is due. This is a rare window of opportunity to improve on their design, bringing benefit not only to variable renewables but to the whole power system. This improvement can be made at three different levels: optimising the use of existing capacity, intelligent network operation, and new transmission technologies. Modification of transmission systems is likely to be a very slow process, and planning needs to begin urgently if potential for additional variable renewables uptake is to be exploited. The measures to increase flexibility proposed in this paper are available today, but careful cost/benefit analysis is essential, and specific national and regional circumstances will influence the choice of option(s). Quantification of the associated costs of these measures, and resulting benefits in terms of variable renewable share, will be addressed in a further phase of work. © OECD/IEA, 2008.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957743420

The main capture technologies in the field of hydrogen production are compared with capture technologies for electricity generation. Following the process chain of carbon capture and storage (CCS), transport and storage options for CO2 are discussed. Further societal issues, such as legal and regulatory aspects, as well as public perception are examined. Why carbon capture and storage?. The world energy supply is still strongly dependent on fossil fuels. According to the IEA (2006), in 2004 some 80% of the world total primary energy supply originated from fossil fuels. As described in Section 2.1.2, the use of fossil fuels and the associated greenhouse-gas emissions are the major source for human-induced climate change; nevertheless, there is a good probability that fossil fuels will also play an important role for energy supply in the coming decades. This holds true not only for the conventional applications, such as electricity, but possibly also for the generation of hydrogen. Reasons for the continued use of fossil fuels are, amongst others, the favourable economics and the physical properties, such as high energy density for use in the transport sector. Increasing energy efficiency and energy production from renewable sources have the potential to reduce GHG emissions in the long term. © Cambridge University Press 2009 and 2010.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen production; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Electricity generation; Energy productions; High energy densities; Public perception; Regulatory aspects; Renewable sources; Transport sectors; Carbon capture",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928772024

Hydrogen is expected to play a key role in this development (Satyapal et al.,2006). Hydrogen storage is regarded as one of the most critical issues that has to be solved before a technically and economically viable hydrogen economy can be established. In fact, without effective storage systems, a hydrogen economy will be difficult to achieve. One of the most challenging applications in this field is hydrogen storage for mobile applications. This chapter addresses the current state of the various on-board hydrogen-storage systems. Requirements for hydrogen storage. In hydrogen-fuelled passenger cars, 4–5 kg (130–160 kWh) H2 must be stored in a small, preferably lightweight, tank in order to achieve a driving range of 500 km (i.e., 80–125 km/kg H2). However, whereas the gravimetric energy density of hydrogen is extremely high, the volumetric storage density of the lightweight gas is low. At ambient temperature and pressure, 5 kg H2 would fill a ball 5 m in diameter, which is roughly comparable to the volume of an inflated hot-air balloon. Consequently, the most important technical and economic challenges to be overcome in a practical hydrogen-storage system are the storage density related to the system (including tank, heat management, and valves), the costs of the system, its safety, a short refuelling time, and the ability to deliver enough hydrogen during the driving cycle. © Cambridge University Press 2009 and 2010.",,"Density of gases; Economics; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Safety valves; Tanks (containers); Economic challenges; Economically viable; Gravimetric energy densities; Hydrogen storage system; Mobile applications; Sustainable energy technology; Temperature and pressures; Transport sectors; Hydrogen storage",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928757060

Planning has been based on hourly energy balance by use and adaptation of H2RES computer program. The H2RES model has ability to integrate different storages into energy system in order to increase the penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources or to achieve a 100 per cent renewable island, region or country. Paper also represents stepping stone for studies which will give wider picture for matching renewable energy sources potential and electricity supply. The special attention has been given to intermittent sources like wind, solar and waves which should be coupled by appropriate energy storages filled by excess of produced electricity. Storage will also decrease requirements for installed power of generating units; it will help to avoid unnecessary rejection of renewable potential and will represent certain security of energy supply. The big energy storages like reversible hydro power plants could also serve for insurance of system's voltage and frequency control by providing auxiliary power if majority of generating units will use intermittent renewables which without special electronics are not suitable for power system control. Paper gives short overview of H2RES model, logic behind it and describes methodology used in calculations. It also presents results for the first calculations of 100% renewable electricity production in Portugal and discusses referent scenario in compression with results of calculations. The biggest challenge was to make constraints on available resources biomass, waste, wind, wave, and solar energy and to find optimal size of storages between reversible hydro and hydrogen loop. These problems were partially solved by application of RenewIslands and ADEG methodology for selection and optimization for applications of decentralised energy generation. Methodologies enable assessment of technical feasibility of various options for integrated energy and resource planning and they helps in choosing energy and resource flows integration, based on the community needs, its resources, and the applicable technologies. © 2009 by ABCM.","H2RES; Renewable energy; Sustainable energy planning","Electric power generation; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy resources; Energy security; Energy storage; Environmental impact; Natural resources; Solar energy; Solar power generation; H2RES; Intermittent renewables; Renewable electricity production; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Selection and optimizations; Sustainable energy planning; Voltage and frequency control; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925071253

Novel nanocomposite hydride materials proposed for anodes in hydride based rechargeable Ni- MHx batteries may successfully solve this problem. Generally, these materials can be synthesized by mechanical alloying (MA) of two components: a major component having good hydrogen storage properties and a minor component used us surface activator. In this work, we have synthesized an amorphous hybrid Mg2Ni-Nix-30%La (x=50, 100, 200%) nanocomposites. The Mg2Ni electrode, mechanically alloyed, displayed the maximum discharge capacity (90 mA h g-1) at the 1st cycle but degraded strongly with cycling. The poor cyclic behaviour of Mg2Ni electrodes is attributed to the formation of Mg(OH)2 on the electrodes, which has been considered to arise from the charge-discharge cycles. To avoid the surface oxidation, we have examined the effect of nickel and/or lanthanum addition in Mg2Ni-type material. This alloying greatly improved the discharge capacities. For example, Mg2Ni|100%Ni|30%La alloy presents higher electrochemical capacities than amorphous or nanocrystalline Mg2Ni. The experimental XPS valence bands measured for studied nanocomposite alloys showed a significant broadening compared to that obtained for the microcrystalline alloys. Results showed that the strong modifications of the electronic structure of the nanocrystalline alloys could significantly influence on their hydrogenation properties. © 2009 TANGER Ltd.","Mechanical alloying (MA); Nanocomposite hydride materials; XRD analysis","Alloys; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Electronic structure; Hybrid materials; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Lanthanum alloys; Mechanical alloying; Nanocomposites; Nanocrystals; Nickel; Nickel metal hydride batteries; Storage (materials); Charge-discharge cycle; Electrochemical capacities; Environmental pollutions; Hydrogen storage properties; Hydrogenation properties; Microcrystalline alloys; Nanocomposite hydride; XRD analysis; Nanocrystalline alloys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924310188

To achieve useful utilisation of regenerative energy and reduce the overall energy consumption, the braking energy should be temporarily saved in an energy storage system ESS, based on supercapcitor, until another power consumer is connected to the overhead line. Such a storage system is able to cope with the common task of peak power reduction and overhead voltage stabilization. ESSs could be installed stationary at substations, weak spots of network or on-board vehicle. The purpose of this paper is to develop model for transport control system is to coordinate energy consumption of multiple various participants of traffic. The transport system is a cooperative system, where behaviour of one participant depends on other. Therefore, the negotiation process between vehicles is necessary. Each vehicle has electronic device which controls his own object sending data to the control centre, which is responsible for optimization and coordination of negotiation process. Controller for speed prediction of electric transport is based on nonlinear autoregressive neural network with exogenous inputs. Inputs of controller are current tram speed, distance from the beginning of the route, type of next speed change point, light upon arrival to the traffic light on the way, time interval between current time and directive time. Training set for the controller is received from the simulation model of T3A tram, moving on the part of route containing two passenger stops and traffic light. Neural network is trained and results of its workability are proposed.

CCS involves the capture, transport and long-term storage of carbon dioxide, usually in geological reservoirs deep underground that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide capture and storage offers important possibilities for making further use of fossil fuels more compatible with climate change mitigation policies. The largest volumes of CO2 could be captured from large point sources such as from power generation, which alone accounts for about 40 per cent of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The development of capture technologies in the power generation sector could be particularly important in view of the projected increase in demand for electricity in fast developing countries with enormous coal reserves (IEA 2002a). Although, this prospect is promising, more research is needed to overcome several hurdles such as important costs of capture technology and the match of large capture sources with adequate geological storage sites.

Conducting an LCA involves collecting data on raw material and energy consumption and on waste emissions to air, water and land. Data is collected for every stage of the life cycle of the product, from mining or cultivation of the raw materials through to processing, transporting, consumption and disposal. Based on a relevant functional unit for the system under study, the collected data is aggregated and modeled into a life cycle inventory, which in turn is classified and characterized to determine the environmental impacts of the entire system. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has standardized the process for conducting LCA in their ISO 14040 series. Many companies have turned to a life-cycle approach in an attempt to properly assess the full environmental impact of their products. This paper presents an environmental life cycle analysis of chocolate produced in Ghana. The study was conducted in accordance with the international ISO procedural framework for performing and presenting LCA results.

The reduced models are obtained by performing MOR directly to the FEMs through Krylov subspace and Arnoldi algorithm.

Constant frequency control is carried out by the load angle ‘δ’, without rotor speed control, while constant terminal voltage control is achieved via the modulation index ‘m’. The ‘SEIG’ magnetisation characteristic and the ‘STATCOM’ rating are taken into consideration to determine the load interval where the terminal voltage and frequency can be controlled.

Under consideration are heating and cooling devices such as refrigerators, freezers, water boilers and heat pumps, which are usually characterized by an intermittent (duty cycle) operation. Without influence from the outside, an internal hysteresis switching controller toggles the ""on/off"" state of a device when its temperature boundary is reached. In order to realize the approach proposed here, the devices are connected to a central control entity by two-way communication. The coordination consists of a step-wise heuristic solution of a binary optimization problem, which serves to select a number of devices in each time step that are subject to compulsory switching, i.e. toggling the ""on/off"" state. It allows a large group of devices to track a setpoint trajectory with its aggregated power consumption, acting like a distributed virtual energy storage, while the individual temperature bounds of the appliances are not violated. This behavior can be used for grid-control purposes, such as the provision of active power reserves. It will be shown that the group of appliances can be characterized by an approximate aggregated dynamical model consisting of a first-order differential equation together with an approximate aggregated nonlinear cost function penalizing the control actions. The developed methodology is evaluated in a numerical simulation with a small appliance cluster corresponding to a residential housing area.","Binary control; Electrical appliances; Load modeling; Load regulation; On-off-controllers; Switching algorithms","Controllers; Cost functions; Differential equations; Domestic appliances; Electric load management; Heating; Housing; Nonlinear equations; Power control; Refrigerators; Binary controls; Electrical appliances; Load modeling; Load regulations; ON OFF controllers; Switching algorithms; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894583352

More specifically, the integrated system consists of a 10kWp photovoltaic (PV) array and three wind generators rated at 1kWp each. A lead-acid accumulator with nominal capacity of 3,000Ah/48V is used to absorb the short energy fluctuations and to regulate the operation and integrity of the system. Furthermore, the long-term needs are fulfilled via a hydrogen based system. Hydrogen is produced by a 4.2kWp PEM electrolyzer and stored in cylinders under pressure for subsequent use in a 4kWp PEM fuel cell. A diesel engine can also be used to provide power in cases of subsystems failure. In the present study the infrastructure of the control system is presented along with the algorithm for the automatic operation which is used to implement the power management strategy. Moreover, experimental results from the operation of each subsystem will be given and a discussion on them will take place. Finally, two operation strategies will be applied through an one-year simulation study, in order to identify their possible implementation in the real system that currently operates under a system operator either remotely or on site.","Automation system; Electrolyzer; Fuel cell; Hydrogen; Operation & control strategies; Renewable energy sources; Stand-alone power system","Automation; Diesel engines; Electric power system control; Electrolytic cells; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Photovoltaic cells; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Solar power generation; Wind power; Automation systems; Control strategies; Electrolyzers; Renewable energy source; Stand alone power systems; Power control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894539865

Transportation is one exception. The global oil consumption shifted dramatically towards transportation (1971: ca. 1/3 of total oil demand; 2008: ca. 1/2). Light-duty vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles, minivans and light trucks) account for more than 45 % of the transport sector's total oil consumption. With the emergence of hybrid vehicles and their market penetration worldwide, the end of rapid demand growth from this segment is in sight. The article sheds light on the chances and challenges of using energy storage system modeling and battery simulation for developing hybrid electric and pure electric vehicles. The task is to develop a physical model describing the complex energy storage systems. Describing analytically the exact dynamics of the system using expressions that are too cumbersome, too messy, or too ill-conditioned is not useful. In this paper a survey on balanced truncation model order reduction for modeling of complex energy storage systems such as super cap batteries is presented. Using this method the complex dynamic behaviour of a super cap battery with multiply degrees of freedom is transfered into a energy storage system model with exactly two degrees of freedom. The efficiency of this method is demonstrated by numerical experiments.","Balanced-truncate model oder reduction; Battery simulation; Hybrid electric vehicles; Super cap","Automobiles; Automotive batteries; Control theory; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Numerical methods; Petroleum industry; Petroleum transportation; Utility trucks; Battery simulation; Energy storage systems; Numerical experiments; Pure electric vehicles; Real-time application; Sport utility vehicles; Super cap; Two degrees of freedom; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868533536

Unfortunately, Romania is in the situation so as the waste landfilling is still considered as a suitable solution for waste management. European Union imposed a number of regulations and programs in the field of waste treatment and management that Romania must comply. The paper describes some aspects regarding characterization of the leachate originating from the Tomesti landfill (situated in Iasi County, Romania) as well as quality assessment on the local environment considering the results of this research. One of the most important problems with designing and maintaining a landfill is managing the leachate that is generated when water passes through the waste. Tests performed on the old landfill in Iasi County have shown that the organic components and heavy metals present in the leachate that penetrates through infiltrations in soil induce impacts and risks in environment, so that European norms which have to be applied for the new landfill need to solve this problem. The experimental results showed that most of the parameters examined in the leachate samples such as colour, BOD, pH, heavy metals concentration were found at high levels. Therefore, the storage of any waste material in the landfill poses environmental problems. It was found that the chemical quality of leachate varies as a function of a number of factors including the original nature of the buried waste materials and the various chemical and biochemical reactions that may occur as the waste materials decompose, seasonal evolution etc. The impact the leachate induced in the environmental components was assessed and the results showed that contamination of soil, groundwater and surface water that may occur as leachate produced by water or liquid wastes moving into, through and out of the landfill, migrates into adjacent areas can affect in a major degree the site characteristics as well as the environmental health. These data were considered when the new landfill was decided to be designed and built according EU norms.","Groundwater; Impact; Landfill; Leachate; Risk; Waste",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956964706

Total motility and PMI of spermatozoa decreased over time. The metabolic activity of spermatozoa was significantly higher in the extenders containing LPF than in the K3 extender. Marked changes in the sperm metabolic activity observed during storage of semen samples at 5°C indicated that glycolysis (fructolysis) was the major metabolic pathway. It seemed likely that mitochondrial respiration was the predominant metabolic activity exhibited by spermatozoa during storage at 16°C.

This method is ineffi cient, energy wise, very costly, and should be replaced with more energy efficient desalting system such as seawater reverse osmosis SWRO system. This can save up three-fourth of the fuel energy used for desalination and substantially reduces the desalting water cost. Another non-conventional water resource is the treated wastewater. It should be fully utilized since its cost is much cheaper than desalting seawater or brackish water, and its amount increases with the increase of population and their consumption. The per capita water consumption in extremely high, and should be reduced through an effective water demand management program.

The possibility of using photovoltaics (PV) as a power source to run a house-hold RO unit has been investigated. Experiments on the laboratory household unit were performed using water with two different total dissolved solid (TDS) concentrations (350 mg/L and 720 mg/L). During the period from February 28, 2007 to November 30, 2007 the unit was entirely powered by photovoltaic cells and operated with and without storage batteries. Without batteries the rate of production of fresh water varied throughout the day according to the available solar power, but was steady when operated with batteries. The specific energy consumption ranged from 1.1 kWh/m3 to 4.3 kWh/m3 for the battery system and ranged from 1.1 kWh/m3 to 1.5 kWh/m3 for the battery-less system. Two membranes (CSM and FILMTEC) were utilized. The CSM membrane was used from February 28, 2007 to June 18, 2007 (period of storage batteries), while the FILMTEC membrane was used during the battery-less period from October 1, 2007 to November 30, 2007. The FILMTEC membrane performed better than the CSM membrane, producing, on average, 8 L/h of drinking water (about 16 mg/L. TDS) at specific energy consumption of 1.3 kWh/m3. Several effects on the performance of the RO unit were investigated, but the temperature effect was the most significant. © 2009 Desalination Publications.","Energy consumption; Photovoltaics; Reverse osmosis; Water treatment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954207589

Establishment of pore pressure equilibrium in shale is a time dependent process which is characterized by shale intrinsic properties i.e., porosity, permeability, fluid and rock stiffness parameter etc. In shale, water movement is greatly restricted by the low permeability of shale which may cause pore pressure storage. The Influence of induced pore water pressure and its dissipation is critical for the evaluating of time delayed borehole stability. This paper discusses and presents a sensitivity analysis of the impact of shale intrinsic properties on transient pore pressure and its impact on time delayed mechanical borehole instability. The aims are to establish pore pressure trend, material plasticity, and time delayed borehole collapse risk. In an attempt to minimize transient pore pressure related instability problems, detailed and careful analyses are highly dependent on the constitutive models adopted for the shale. In this study, a physical model was used to introduce hypotheses of time delayed stability and both analytical and numerical models were developed to verify the hypotheses. The analytical model is based on poroelastic constitutive model, coupled with pressure diffusivity formulation. A numerical material model is developed based on finite elements. The analytical model quantifies shale intrinsic properties vs time delayed stability; whereas, the numerical model diagnoses pore pressure storage effect during underbalanced drilling in shale and its impact on mechanical instability. The undrained condition (immediately after the wellbore is drilled) as well as the drained condition was analyzed. The integrated approach in this study may give a clear picture on shale complexicity and its adverse effect on time delayed stability. Wellbore stability models that include some aspects of coupled have already been developed. However, time delayed borehole instability in shales in UBD condition is a new research area; adjustments are required in existing model. The analytical simulation results show that shale permeability higher than 40 ηD, the difference of the consolidation time for different finite characteristic time are insignificant and converge to zero while permeability 100 ηD. In addition to shale permeability, other parameters (i.e. pore fluid viscosity, porosity and fluid bulk modulus) are influencing the consolidation processes. This paper demonstrates the effects of such parameters also. The numerical results implies that a M-C elastic - plastic model is capable of evaluating plasticity and material deformation effects in UBD conditions along with accounted time delayed transient pressure trend in shale. It was shown that the shale behaviour during UBD is a transient problem, and can not be described without a fluid diffusion process. It is also noted that shale intrinsic parameters are playing a significant role in time delayed borehole stability analysis.

Condensate stabilizing is a process that mainly uses for separation of mentioned components from raw gas condensate in order to meet product specifications which is on-spec RVP, water and salt contents for the ultimate product. At the overall view point, condensate stabilizing process consist of four main parts which are; separation of free aqueous phase and light HC from heavy HC in a high pressure three phase separator, desalting and sludge removal using desalter, separation of remained light HC by a medium pressure distillation tower and finally degassing of column stabilized product plus with debutanizer bottom product (C5 +) in a low pressure flash drum in order to produce final product for sending to atmospheric storage tanks. As a real case in our gas plant, due to low performance of stabilizer reboiler, efficiency of process was reduced gradually and caused off-spec product to be produced. So, other operational parameters affect on process efficiency was changed and optimized in order to compensate product specification and meet on-spec values. The most operational parameters which affect product specifications are as below: 1. Changing demulsifier and water wash injection to desalter mean while draining of interface layer of desalter once per each operating shift. 2. Optimization differential pressure of the desalter mixing valve. 3. Effect of stabilizing column pressure reduction to the optimum value, in a way that does not affect proper working of off-gas compressor. 4.

Those solutions are based on the Deformable Models, with slight difference in the method for describing the shapes of interests - instead of using a contour or a surface they represented the segmented objects with a mesh structure, which allows to describe not only the surface of the objects but also to model their interiors. This is obtained by dividing the nodes of the mesh in two categories, namely internal and external ones, which will be responsible for two different tasks. In our new approach we propose to negate this separation and use only one type of nodes. Using that assumption we manage to significantly shorten the time of segmentation while maintaining its quality. ©2009 IEEE.","Deformable models; Energy function; Image segmentation","Deformation; Digital image storage; Imaging systems; Three dimensional; Two dimensional; 3D image segmentation; Active nets; Active volumes; Deformable models; Energy function; Energy functions; Mesh deformation; Mesh structures; New approaches; Segmented objects; Image segmentation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951964765

Advanced nuclear fuel cycles are being studied worldwide. They aim at making more efficient use of the available resources, reducing the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons, and facilitating the management of the resulting radioactive waste. Recently, the Red-Impact project has investigated the impact of a number of representative advanced fuel cycles on radioactive waste management, and more specific on geological disposal. The thermal output of the high-level waste arising from advanced fuel cycles in which all the actinides are recycled is reduced with a factor 3 for a 50 years cooling time and with a factor 5 for a 100 years cooling time in comparison with the spent fuel arising from the once-through fuel cycle. This reduction of the thermal output allows for a significant reduction of the length of the disposal galleries and of the size of the repository. Separation of Cs and Sr drastically reduces further the thermal output of the high-level waste, but it requires a long-term management of those heat generating separated waste streams, which contain the very long-lived 135Cs. Recycling all the actinides strongly reduces the radiotoxicity in the waste, resulting in significantly lower doses to an intruder in the case of a human intrusion into the repository. However, the reduction of radiotoxicity has little impact on the main safety indicator of a geological repository, i.e. the effective dose in the case of the expected evolution scenario; for disposal in clay formations, this dose is essentially due to mobile fission and activation products. The deployment of advanced fuel cycles will necessitate the development of low activation materials for the new nuclear facilities and fuels and of specific waste matrices to condition the high-level and medium-level waste streams that will arise from the advanced reprocessing plants. © 2009 Materials Research Society.",,"Actinides; Chemical activation; Clay products; Free energy; Fuels; Geology; Global warming; Nuclear energy; Nuclear weapons; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive waste storage; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Reactor cores; Recycling; Activation products; Advanced fuel cycle; Geological disposals; Long-term management; Low activation materials; Nuclear facilities; Nuclear fuel cycles; Once-through fuel cycle; Nuclear fuel reprocessing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951687529

This paper shows the functional blocks proposed to integrate a defibrillator and discusses some particular issues. The defibrillator can determine the patient's transthoracic impedance and allows the implementation of an energy correction method that compensates for the transthoracic impedance of the patient, supplying a discharge adjusted to his characteristics. The high voltage block is integrated by three functional units. The first of these determine, based upon the impedance value and the energy selected, the set of voltages required to end the charge of the internal high energy capacitor and to control both phases of the discharge. Besides, it controls the sequence of the process and adds safety to the system. The second functional unit is intended for the generation and monitoring of the voltage on the high energy storage capacitor. Finally, a third unit is used for controlling the discharge path through the patient's thorax switching current with discrete semiconductors. Results testing the high voltage block are presented and discussed. The proposed architecture combines several microcontrollers with special modules for digital signal processing and serial communication between the high voltage block and the rest of the functional blocks, i.e. ECG acquisition module, pulse oximetry, electronic datalogger module, peripheral interfaces (display, buzzer) as well as voice prompts for assisting lay personnel in operating the defibrillator. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Biphasic defibrillator; Defibrillation; Design requirements; Patient safety","Biomedical engineering; Biophysics; Digital signal processing; Medical Physics; Noninvasive medical procedures; Ophthalmology; Oximeters; Safety engineering; Acquisition modules; Defibrillation; Electrical architecture; Energy storage capacitor; Patient safety; Peripheral interfaces; Proposed architectures; Serial communications; Defibrillators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950129472

However, unlike hydro or geothermal energy sources that can account for the base load, intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar energy, have to tackle the need for energy storage. Advanced energy planning must be used to combine different intermittent and regular sources in order to match electricity demand and assure security of supply. In this study, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach is used to determine the optimal configuration of power generating systems in an island with renewable energy using hourly data over one year. The energy system analysed is a hybrid system constituted by a photovoltaic system, batteries and the existing diesel generator in Monte Trigo village, in the island of Santo Antão, Cape Verde. The objective function of the GA is the total cost of the electricity produced over one year.

Surplus energy is supplied to a PEM electrolyzer and the produced hydrogen is used in a PEM fuel cell to provide power in cases of energy deficit. In order to account for short-term needs, a lead-acid accumulator is employed and charged by the RES or the fuel cell depending on the availability of the RES and the accumulator State-of-Charge, SOC. Power management strategies that aim at the efficient operation of every subsystem are developed. Moreover, the current study presents a novel design approach that optimally determines the capacity requirements for all subsystems and further calculates the optimal operating conditions of the power management strategies. An optimization method in the form of simulated annealing is employed to identify the solution to the resulted large scale, discontinuous and discrete optimization problem.

Liquid at two or more dissimilar temperatures is stored within the same tank to provide a buffer for variations in heating and cooling loads. Control of the thermocline between the hot and cold fluid regions is needed to minimise thermocline growth and maximise operation of the storage tank. An experimental programme using a scale model of an industrial stratified tank (aspect ratio 3.5) and Perspex tank (aspect ratio 8.2) is reported. The behaviour and growth of the hot-cold thermocline under various operating conditions is presented. A siphoning method to re-establish the thermocline without interrupting the use of the tank is tested. Siphoning of the thermocline region from either 20%), 50% or 80%) of the tank height is an effective strategy for uninterrupted interface re-establishment. However, the rate and position of siphoning and the load balance of the exit streams are critical variables for minimising the time for effective re-establishment of the two temperature zones.

Which technology pathway (combination of technologies and system solutions) holds the greatest potential for future profits and reduction of global CO2 emissions depends both on mill-specific conditions and on the surrounding energy system through e.g. policy instruments and energy market prices. In this paper the trade-off, in terms of system revenue and global CO2 emission consequences, between different technology pathways for utilization of excess heat at chemical kraft pulp mills is investigated for a case depicting a typical Scandinavian mill of today. The trade-off is analysed for four future energy market scenarios having different levels of CO 2 charge. The technology pathways included in this study are (1) increased electricity production in new condensing turbines, (2) production of district heating, (3) increased sales of biomass in the form of bark and/or lignin, and (4) carbon capture and storage (CCS). Lignin extraction and CCS are considered as new and emerging pathways and the other pathways are considered to be well-tried. The results show that well-tried pathways such as increased electricity production in new turbines, selling bark and district heating production are economically robust, i.e. they are profitable for all of the studied energy market scenarios. The new and emerging technology pathways such as carbon capture and storage and lignin extraction hold a larger potential for reduction of global CO2 emissions, but their economic profitability is more dependent on the development of the energy market. All in all, it can be concluded that to realize the larger potential of reduction of global CO 2 emissions a high carbon cost alone may not be sufficient. Other economic stimulations are required, e.g. technology-specific subsidies. Copyright © 2009, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75749090414

The need to store intermittent energy is an important issue in the island of Porto Santo, since it is a small and isolated network. H2RES was used to model the energy storage scenarios for this island. One scenario was chosen to evaluate the potential of hydrogen as an energy storage vector and a pilot system of two 5kW fuel cells, one electrolyser of 13 kW, and a 55 m3 storage tank was built. The main objective of this system is to produce hydrogen from electricity from wind mills that otherwise would be wasted, and to use this hydrogen for electricity during peak time.

Thus, the CO2 is inherently separated from the flue gases with a potential for considerably lower energy penalty and cost compared to other techniques for CO2 separation. The oxygen carrier is circulated between two reactors, a fuel and an air reactor, where the flue gas from the air reactor contains oxygen depleted air and the flue gas from the fuel reactor contains mainly CO2 and H2O. The water can easily be condensed and the remaining CO 2 can be transported for underground storage. Most of the prior work with CLC has focused on using natural gas and syngas as fuel and oxygen carrying material normally produced from pure chemicals. However, recent work on adapting the CLC process for solid fuels with ores and natural minerals as oxygen carrier shows promising results. This paper will present results from reactivity investigations in a laboratory fluidized-bed reactor system using previously investigated natural mineral ilmenite as oxygen carrier and a bituminous Colombian coal as fuel. Experiments were conducted at a temperature of 970°C with N2, steam, and/or CO2 in the fluidizing gas. Synergy effects between steam and CO2 on fuel conversion was noted. The results show that the fuel conversion was a roughly a factor 5 faster with steam as compared to CO2 in the fluidizing gas.","Chemical-looping combustion; Ilmenite; Oxygen carrier","Bituminous coal; Carbon dioxide; Chemical reactors; Coal combustion; Flue gases; Flues; Fluidized beds; Fuels; Ilmenite; Natural gasoline plants; Oxygen; Steam; Chemical looping combustion; Colombian coals; Combustion technology; Fluidized bed reactors; Fuel conversion; Natural minerals; Oxygen Carrier; Underground storage; Fluidized bed combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75149170238

In 2007 approximately 6.5 million tons of ash was acquired as a byproduct of using oil shale for energy production. Approximately 1.5 million tons of that was ash from CFB boilers. Such ash is deposited in ash fields by means of hydro ash removal. Ash field material properties have undergone changes as a result of CFB ash deposition - the ash field surface is not stabilising, the ash is not becoming petrified and is unsuitable for building dams needed for the hydro technology application. The analytical research was dedicated to determining the reasons for this different ash field behaviour of ash from CFB and pulverised firing (PF) boilers based on changes of ash properties. Comparative CFB and PF ash studies were conducted: chemical analysis, surveys with X-ray diffractometers (XRD) and scanning electron microscopes (SEM), study of binding properties. Bottom and electrostatic precipitator ash was scrutinised, with its typical rougher and finer particles, accordingly. Such ash types comprise the predominant current ash deposit content in ash fields. The ash samples were taken from boilers of the Balti Power Plant. The Estonian oil shale mineral part consists mainly of the following minerals: calcite 44.0%, dolomite 19.5%, quartz 8.7%, orthoclase 10.5%, hydromuscovite 8.6%. These minerals comprise 91.3% of the mineral part and it should be noted that 63.5% of that are minerals in the carbonaceous part and 27.8% - in the terrigeneous part. When oil shale is fired, thermal decomposition of these minerals occur into simpler compounds, coupled with volatilisation of some compounds and formation of novel minerals, and there are changes in the mineral phase state as well. The ash binding properties and behaviour in ash fields depend on these changes, the extent of which is determined by the firing temperature in the boiler furnace. The comparative studies indicate that the introduction of the CFB method of firing has caused several important changes in the mineralogical composition and properties of oil shale ash. The reason behind this is that the CFB boiler furnace firing temperature is approximately 600°C lower than in the PF counterpart, resulting in weaker fuel mineral decomposition and lower novel mineral formation intensity during combustion. The ash solidification tendency is in this instance substantially less than that observed in PF ash. The compressive strength of the electrostatic precipitator ash test samples from CFB boilers was 4.4 N/mm2; from PF boilers -15.3 N/mm2, the corresponding specific surface area: 4 533-9 806 cm2/g and 707-3 966 cm2/g. The obtained data confirms the need to alter the ash storage technology.","Circulating fluidised bed combustion; Estonian oil shale ash; Pulverised firing","Ashes; Binding energy; Boiler firing; Calcite; Chemical analysis; Coal fueled furnaces; Compressive strength; Decomposition; Digital storage; Electrostatic precipitators; Electrostatics; Fluidized beds; Oil shale; Power plants; Precipitation (chemical); Pulverized fuel fired boilers; Scanning electron microscopy; Analytical research; Circulating fluidised bed; Comparative studies; Estonian oil shale; Mineralogical compositions; Pulverised firing; The scanning electron microscopes (SEM); X ray diffractometers; Fluidized bed combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75149145620

During frying Maillard reaction takes place contributing to colour and taste development in potato products. As one of the main factors influencing the colour formation is the amount of reducing sugars available for Maillard reaction while non-reducing sugar - sucrose is responsible for the taste. Storage of potatoes at temperature below 9 °C induces an increase in th e sugar content, resulting in the development of a darker colour of the product after frying. The aim of this research was to study the effect of potato storage and various cooking methods on the amount of non-reducing and reducing sugars. In cooperation with the State Priekuli Plant Breeding Institute (Latvia) five table potato varieties were selected: 'Lenora', 'Brasla', 'Imanta', ZiIe' and 'Madara'. Selected potato varieties were analyzed shortly after harvesting (in 2 weeks necessary for sizing) and after 6.5 month storage (before new harvest) at 5±1 °C temperature and relative air humidity (RH) 80±5%. Potato samples were prepared using common cooking methods: deep fat frying (180±5 X)), shallow frying (150±5 X) and ba king In oven (210±5 °c). Afterwards analyses were done on the amount of fructose, glucose, sucrose and dry matter content as well. In the potato variety 'Brasla' glucose content before storage was the highest as well (i.e. 0.516 g 100 g -1), while after the storage period - in ZiIe' (i.e. 0.808 g 100 g-1). In regard to the amount of fructose - the highest content both: before and after storage was found in potato variety 'Lenora'. Content of sucrose after the storage shows slight decrease in almost all suydied potato varieties except 'Lenora'-with sharp decrease. Potato storage and heat treatment processes strongly influence both reducing and non-reducing sugar content. Comparing all the obtained results after applying selected processing methods shows that potato variety 'Lenora' had one of the highest reducing and non-reducing sugar contents.","Non-reducing sugars; Potato; Processing; Reducing sugars; Storage","Chemical reactions; Color; Cooking; Energy storage; Fructose; Glucose; Glycosylation; Processed foods; Processing; Quality management; Sugar (sucrose); Sugar industry; Dry matter content; Heat treatment process; Maillard reaction; Potato; Potato varieties; Processing method; Reducing sugars; Relative air humidities; Food storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74549222602

Due to the high aspect ratio of MIMCap structures, highly conformal deposition techniques are needed, triggering a substantial effort to develop Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) processes for the deposition of metal gates and high-k dielectrics.

In 2007, the shipment of 16 VPVR/M casks with EK-lOfuel of 10 wt% 235 U, IRT-2Mfuel of 80 wt% 235 U, and IRT-2M fuel of 36 wt% 235 U expended at the LVR-15 research facility since 1957 was realized. The VPVR/M cask was designed for all fuel types used in Russian research reactors of similar designs, which were built in many countries outside of Russia. A revised version of the ORIGEN 2.2 code was used for depletion calculations of 35 types of irradiated fuel. Shielding analyses of the VPVR/M cask were performed using the DORT code with the revised BUGLE-96 multi- group cross-section library based on ENDF/B-VI Release 3. The criticality of the cask loaded with the highest- reactivity fuel was evaluated with the MCNP code using the DLC-200 cross-section data library using the fresh fuel approach. The isotopic inventory of IRT-3M fuel of 36 wt% 235U burned up to 184 MWd/kg U was identified as the bounding value. The sources of gamma rays for shielding calculations, neutron sources for shielding and criticality calculations, and heat sources were consequently evaluated. The original design of the cask was optimized with respect to the minimum weight needed for the conservation of the required shielding properties. In compliance with the regulatory requirements for spent-fuel storage and transport casks, the subcriticality of the system met the criticality safety criterion of keff&lt; 0.95 for all the fuel types evaluated.

One of the challenging problems for such systems is to stabilize the sensitive rotor due to disturbances and plant uncertainties. In this paper, an optimal control system is proposed by incorporating cross-coupling technology into the control architecture, so that the synchronization performance of the rotor in the radial direction can be improved. The control scheme is based on minimization of a new quadratic performance index in which the synchronization errors in the radial direction are embedded. Stability of the control scheme is investigated through Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) optimal control technique. It has been shown that with adequate control parameters the closed-loop stability can be guaranteed theoretically, and the resulting control system can provide satisfactory synchronization performance. Simulations on a compact and efficient FESS with integrated magnetic bearings demonstrate that the proposed approach is very effective to suppress the gyroscopic effort caused by the outside disturbances and model uncertainties. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The main benefits realized were an increased level of friction reduction along with an enhanced rate of inversion. These benefits were obtained without compromising the emulsion storage stability. These improvements were gained primarily by optimizing the breaker surfactant package used to release the polymer from its delivered form into the aqueous based treatment fluid. Friction reducers are often a significant portion of the aqueous based chemical stimulation package used in either the stimulation and/or completion of oil/gas wells. Common friction reducers used for fresh water operations typically have a decline in performance when exposed to aqueous based fluids of increased salt content. The performance decline is not solely due to the nature of the polymer, but rather the mechanism of polymer release from its inverse emulsion state. The presence of salt not only affects the polymer configuration but also the ability of the inverse emulsion to release the polymer from its water internal phase into the water continuous stimulation fluid. The new friction reducer was developed by examination of various surfactants by way of simple additions to ternary mixture designed experiments. A variety of bench top performance tests were used to narrow the selection yielding a final surfactant package. The final candidates were then screened using an in-house friction loop. The improved friction reducer dosed at 0.5gpt had a 29% increase in ultimate friction reduction in fresh water and a 119% increased performance in 2% KC1 when compared to a standard friction reducer of similar charge and molecular weight. Ultimate performance enhancement was gained within reasonable raw material costs and stability limits. With the increased ultimate friction reduction and superior inversion rate, this new product will reduce the energy required to deliver a specific volume at a set rate or increase the rate of the delivered volume at the same power for water based systems containing up to 2% KC1 for stimulations and/or completions.

Major CO2 emissions sources are located within power and industrial sectors where fossil fuels are consumed to generate energy. With the anticipated escalation of global energy demand, CO2 emissions are also expected to grow. Therefore, reducing CO2 emissions to atmosphere is a fatal issue worldwide. Capturing CO2 from emissions sources and injected into safe geological places for storage shows a practical mitigation strategy through CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS) practices. In CCS projects, several options are available for CO2 storage such as subsurface aquifers, coalbed bed methane formations, or depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Alternatively to these storage places, CO2 can be utilized to enhance oil production from mature oil reservoirs. Utilization of CO2 in enhanced oil recovery techniques (EOR) is a well known practice in oil industry. Therefore, synchronizing between the objectives of storing CO2 and enhancing oil production to meet global demand can be achieved through CO2-EOR projects. The giant oil reservoirs in the Middle East represent potential places for CO2-EOR projects. In this paper, oil reservoirs located in the Middle East are selected to evaluate the potential of CO2-EOR projects in the region. These reservoirs were subjected to CO2-EOR screening where the fluid and rock properties are compared with a well known criteria. Furthermore, an analytical model is used to predict the performance of CO2-EOR in these reservoirs.

Connecting people and improving technology and workflows allow the right decisions to be made at the right time while spending the least amount of effort. Today, necessity drives new and more dynamic integrated operations; and more efficient working relationships are evolving. This paper will discuss the challenge of doing more with less, exploiting more difficult reserves while lowering costs, increasing profits while reducing risk, and speeding up work processes while cutting non productive time.

Miscanthus bales were stored under three treatments, outdoor uncovered, outdoor covered and indoor. The miscanthus bales were selected from three stands at three initial moisture conditions (13%, 32% and 39%) wet basis (wb). The storage trial was arranged in a 3 × 3 factorial experiment with two replicates laid out as a completely randomised design. Bale percent moisture content was repeatedly measured. Uncovered bales stored outdoors gained on average 24% moisture (wb), with resultant degradation of the material quality. Bales stored outdoors covered or indoors lost on average 4.3% and 6.8% moisture (wb) respectively. The energy content of bales stored outdoors uncovered was considerably lower than that of bales stored outdoors covered or indoors. The average lower heating value (LHV) of bales stored outdoors uncovered was 9.34 MJ kg-1 compared to a LHV 15.33 MJ kg-1 for bales under covered storage.

Aim: Our aim was to evaluate the impact of body composition on adiponectin and IR determined by homeostasis model assessment(HOMA)in a population-based study on relatively healthy young men, minimizing the possible effects of age, obesity, and severe comorbidity. Design, Methods, and Subjects: Apopulation-based, cross-sectional study of 783 men aged 20-29 yr, randomly drawn from the Danish Central Personal Registry. Adiponectin was assessed using an in-house assay, and IR was determined usingHOMA.Central fat mass (CFM) and lower extremity fat mass (LEFM)wasmeasuredbydual-energyx-rayabsorptiometry,andvisceraladiposetissue(VAT), scadipose tissue (SAT), and thigh fat area (TFA) were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Using multiple linear regression analysis, adiponectin correlated negatively with CFM (r = -0.27; P < 0.001) and SAT (r = -0.20; P < 0.001) and positively with LEFM (r = 0.19; P < 0.001) and TFA (r = 0.18; P < 0.001), whereas VAT did not associate significantly. In multiple linear regression analysis, HOMA-IR (dependent variable), correlated significantly with CFM(r = 0.27; P < 0.001) and SAT (r = 0.15; P < 0.001), whereas LEFM, VAT, or TFA did not correlate. Adiponectin was an independent predictor of HOMA-IR in both analyses (r = -0.14; P < 0.001). Conclusion: SAT rather than VAT was inversely associated with adiponectin levels, and, interestingly, fat on the lower extremities was positively associated with adiponectin. Focusing on insulin resistance, SAT rather than VAT and TFA independently predicted a higher HOMA-IR. The observation that adiponectin was independently associated with lower HOMA-IR must be repeated in other populations.

Decentralized renewable energy sources are alternatives. Among these alternatives are hybrid photovoltaic systems which combine solar photovoltaic energy with other renewable energy sources like wind. A diesel backup system can be used when PV system fails to satisfy the load and when the battery storage is depleted. If the hybrid systems are optimized, these would be cost effective and more reliable. This paper presents an optimal design of a solar PV-diesel hybrid mini-grid system for a fishing community in an isolated island-Sandwip in Bangladesh. The electrical load is considered based on the local needs and the electrical load demand is 15 kWh. This load is based on 2 lights (compact florescent bulb, 230 V, 15 W), 1 fan (ceiling fan, 230 V, 40 W) and 1 television (TV, 230 V, 80 W) for each family of the rural settings of the island. The system is optimized using genetic algorithms. If the renewable energy source produces more than the one required by the loads, the excess energy can be used to charge the battery while if the amount of energy demand is higher than the one produced by the renewable energy source, the control strategy determines the most economical way to meet the energy deficit. The optimized system configurations are: 4s × 12p 50 W PV panels, 4s × 3p 200 Ah batteries, 230 V 1.9 kVA ac generator and 3300 VA inverter. The system supplies 48 V dc and 230 V ac. The major share of the energy (23,077 kWh) comes from solar while the contribution of diesel generation is very small (35 kWh).This study reveals that the major shares of the cost are for solar panels and batteries. Technological development in solar photovoltaic technology and economic production of batteries would make rural electrification in the isolated islands more promising and demanding. Finally, the sustainability of solar-diesel hybrid mini-grid for an isolated island-Sandwip is discussed. © 2009 International Energy Initiative.","Genetic algorithms; Mini-grid; Optimization; Solar-diesel hybrid","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Genetic algorithms; Hybrid systems; Natural resources; Optimal systems; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Rural areas; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Hybrid photovoltaic systems; Mini grids; Renewable energy source; Rural electrification; Solar photovoltaic energies; Solar photovoltaic technology; Solar-diesel hybrid; Technological development; Renewable energy resources; cost-benefit analysis; decentralization; electrification; energy use; fishing community; genetic algorithm; island; optimization; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; solar radiation; technological development; Asia; Bangladesh; Eurasia; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349443407

The hybrid system with 23% of photovoltaic energy penetration and comprised of 2 kW PV array, diesel generator with a rated power of 4 kW and 2 storage batteries in addition to 2 kW converter was found to be the optimal system and it becomes economically feasible for diesel prices greater than 0.15 $/L. This is in favor of utilizing the hybrid system to supplement the off-grid remote house with electricity, since the current diesel price in Jordan is about 0.238 $/L. Utilizing this system for electricity generation decreased the operating hours of the diesel generators by 19.3% and diesel consumption by 18.5% in comparison with the diesel-only situation. This in turn led to about 18% reduction in emissions of green house gases. Moreover, this investigation has examined the effect of battery storage and photovoltaic penetration on the performance and the cost of generated electricity by the feasible hybrid system.

Results are presented through a case study of a Norwegian island with good wind resources, a weak connection to the main transmission grid and a commuting ferry, constituting the H2 load. Main results show that if H 2 consumers are willing to pay at least 0.31-0.34 ε per Nm 3, the wind power penetration could be cost-effectively increased by 1.8-1.9 MW by including an average H2 load of 1.36 MW. The H 2 plant is very dependent on power import and H2 storage capacity is only 1.5 - 2 days of average demand. The operational flexibility of the H2 plant opens for a more optimal power exchange with the grid. It is concluded that H2 produced from wind power could be competitive with fossilfuels. H2 is however not cost-effective as electric energy storage for wind power plants operating in power markets.","Distributed generation; Hydrogen; Quadratic optimization; Renewable energy; Weak grids; Wind power","Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Electric power plants; Electric power system economics; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Power markets; Quadratic programming; Wind power; Wind turbines; Operational flexibility; Quadratic optimization; Renewable energies; Storage capacity; Techno-economics; Transmission grids; Weak grid; Wind power penetration; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68949192369

Load voltage regulation using reactive power (RRP) is proposed to be used together with the classical restoration function using active power. The RRP function can be used to compensate swells, and some sag cases if the load power factor allows its possibility. The use of reactive power to regulate the load voltage means that no energy is needed to be provided from or absorbed by the capacitor bank energy storage. This is accomplished by making the compensation voltage to be in quadrature with the fundamental component of the system current. This gives a significant advantage, since the equipment can compensate swells without the need of regeneration, of the oversizing of the dc link, or of dissipation means; and can compensate sags without using the energy of the storage. For the sag cases where the RRP is not possible to apply, the classical restoration function using the active power of the energy storage is activated, injecting the missing voltage in back phase.

Small particle diameter of GPCC allows simple mixing of two or three ranges of GPCCs in a packed bed for enhancement of storage unit performance. Experiments have been carried out to characterize the phase changing characteristics of two GPCCs chosen for this purpose. Packed bed column experiments have been carried out to provide basic understanding of the heat transfer process in the composite bed consisting of a mixture of GPCCs at different values of mixing ratio. A mathematical model has been developed for the analysis of charging and discharging process dynamics. Once validated, the model has been used to perform a parametric study to investigate the overall bed performance at different values of mixing ratio and Reynolds number. An optimization of the value of mixing ratio has been obtained based on the overall charging and discharging times as well as the exergy efficiency. It has been demonstrated that, as compared to the use of single GPCC, careful choice of the mixing ratio of GPCCs in a composite bed can result in a significant enhancement of the overall storage unit performance. As compared to the use of multiple sequential layers of GPCCs, using units composed of a mixture of GPCCs with an optimized mixing ratio results in a remarkable improvement of the unit performance without limitations on the charging and discharging directions during practical applications. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, the strategies for energy sources' control and management have been evaluated by using a standard test cycle (Artemis) in the test platform, in which the power supply, supercapacitor energy storage and traction system are composed. The test results show that the power supply can be directly or indirectly controlled to provide a continuous current, while the supercapacitor energy storage is controlled to provide the peak current or recuperate the regenerative braking energy. This feature can ensure the good operating condition of the power supply (e.g., fuel cell, battery). Hence, a long lifetime of the power supply, a high efficiency of the propulsion system and good dynamics of hybrid vehicles can be achieved by using the strategies presented in this paper.

However, such systems are strongly questioned due to extreme life-cycle (LC) energy requirements. For similar installations to be considered as environmentally sustainable, their LC energy content must be compensated by the respective useful energy production, i.e. their energy pay-back period (EPBP) should be found less than their service period. In this context, an optimum sizing methodology is currently developed, based on the criterion of minimum embodied energy. Various energy autonomous stand-alone PV-lead-acid battery systems are examined and two different cases are investigated; a high solar potential area and a medium solar potential area. By considering that the PV-battery (PV-Bat) system's useful energy production is equal to the remote consumer's electricity consumption, optimum cadmium telluride (CdTe) based systems yield the minimum EPBP (15 years). If achieving to exploit the net PV energy production however, the EPBP is found less than 20 years for all PV types. Finally, the most interesting finding concerns the fact that in all cases examined the contribution of the battery component exceeds 27% of the system LC energy requirements, reflecting the difference between grid-connected and stand-alone configurations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Labelling the nanoproducts as ""nanomaterials"" is one of the prerequisite conditions for market acceptance. One approach consists in encouraging manufacturers to insert labels since the nanoparticles synthesis, at the last step of the production reactors, in order to give consumers useful information related to nano-fillers contained in commercial products. The first level of information could be the specification of the presence of nanoparticles in the product: a kind of tag indicating ""nanomaterials inside"". The second level of labelling could supply more complex information such as: the type of nanoparticles, the manufacturer name, the batch number, the toxicity class, etc. In European Nanosafe2 project, two main routes have been investigated: the previous one is using biomarkers based tracers. In that case the information is available thanks to conventional biological methods. The second way requests fluorescent nanotracers which are less powerful in terms of data storage but may be more resistant against chemicals, temperature, UV aggressions and could be red in a few seconds by field operational portable decoding devices. For economical reasons it is necessary to introduce a very small quantity of tracers in the nanoparticles. Nevertheless, for certain applications for which a high purity level of the nanoparticles is requested (e.g. microelectronics) this small amount can be redhibitory. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650970764

An electrical hot plate in thermal contact with a steel spiral coil (SSC) is used to charge the TES system under different hot plate temperatures and under different average charging flow rates. Thermal performance during charging is presented in terms of the axial temperature distribution, the axial degree of thermal stratification, the total energy stored and the total exergy stored. The energy and exergy delivery rates of the energy delivery device (EDD) are also evaluated in relation to the thermal performance of the storage system. Results of charging the storage system under different hot plate temperatures indicate that there is an optimal charging temperature for optimal thermal performance. The results also indicate that exceeding this optimal temperature leads to a degradation of the thermal performance due to increased heat losses. Charging at the same temperature conditions under different flow rate regimes suggests that there is an optimal charging flow rate.

A large portion of its power plants is old and inefficient, and it is expected that India in the coming 10-15 years will need to upgrade and extend its power sector significantly. This may give rise to new initiatives that bring the harnessing of indigenous coal in a green manner into question. This article takes into consideration opportunities of emerging polygeneration schemes intended (mainly) for the electric power sector with inclusion of additional yields like synthetic fuels, chemicals and heat. Reference is made to European-based initiatives pertaining to the capture and storage of carbon dioxide (CCS) - especially a Sino-European project COACH11Cooperation Action within CCS China-EU, EC/FP6 Contract #038966, co-ordinated by Institut Français du Petrole (IFP), France. that is operated under the auspices of the European Commission and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST). Some main principles of COACH have been transferred from the EU-based DYNAMIS22Towards Hydrogen and Electricity Production with Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage, EC/FP6 Contract #019672, co-ordinated by SINTEF Energy Research, Norway. project, although in a different setting. Both projects emphasise technologies and options that can be realised by 2012 (and beyond) for co-production of hydrogen and electricity via pre-combustion decarbonisation from fossil fuels with safe geological storage of the CO2. It is believed that the European Commission - in due course - will make provisions for similar arrangements with India. A main challenge of CCS - in any context - is the techno-economic aspect of fuel penalty and cost. In addition to the higher investment cost, an energy potential corresponding to 20-30% additional fuel is inherently sacrificed in order to isolate and compress the CO2 stream before it can be injected into a permanent sink. For this reason CCS is entirely policy driven rather than motivated by profit. Although CCS is far more costly and requiring substantially more primary energy, it is likely to assume that India will be forced to either implement CCS or to retire parts of its generating capacity. This suggests that India may become attractive for industrialised countries to make ""green"" investments in its power sector provided however, that CCS will become eligible for joint mitigation actions beyond the Kyoto treaty that expires by 2012. The energy supply situation of India is seen as a matter of growing concern. In contrast to Europe where the issue of greenhouse gas emissions is high on the political agenda, India seemingly is more focused on cost, energy supply and local pollution. Coal is still the prevalent fuel in the Indian power sector, and is likely to be so in the foreseeable future. This suggests that time is due for India to embark on pre-normative research and technology initiatives in order to pave the ground for a cleaner energy policy in an Indian context. One step in this direction is to gain knowledge on prevalent carbon capture techniques - in theory and via major CCS projects and storage sites. © 2009 International Energy Initiative.","Carbon capture and storage; CCS; Clean fossil fuels; Co-production of electric power and chemicals; CO2; CO2 compression","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal storage; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy resources; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Investments; Precombustion; Synthetic fuels; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon dioxide capture and storage; CO2 compression; Electric power; Electric power sector; Electricity production; Indian power sectors; Ministry of science and technologies; Carbon capture; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; coal; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; emission; energy policy; fuel; greenhouse gas; investment; policy implementation; profitability; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65549094061

Gari and tapioca are storage-cupboard convenience foods obtained from the tubers of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). They are important staples in Nigeria and many African countries where malnutrition is a major problem. Tapioca is a quick-cooking food made from partly gelatinized starch and gari is a fermented, roasted, granular food made from cassava pulp. Objective. Gari and tapioca are nutritionally inferior and need to be fortified. This paper reports the macro-and micronutrient profiles of soybean-fortified gari and tapioca. Methods. Gari and tapioca were fortified with soybean flour or soybean residue at 25% of dry weight. Standard methods were used for the determination of proximate parameters such as crude protein, fat, ash, carbohydrate and moisture content. All the samples were analyzed for phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, manganese, iron, copper and zinc. Results. Unfortified tapioca had significantly lower (p < .05) proximate values (protein: 0.31%; fat: 0.17%; ash: 0.34%) than unfortified gari (protein: 1.50%; fat: 1.56%; ash: 1.35%). The fortification of both gari and tapioca significantly (p < .05) increased the contents of crude protein, phosphorus, fat, and ash as well as all the monitored macro- and micronutrients. These values (%) increased from 1.50-9.31, 0.06-0.11, 1.56-4.31 and 1.35-1.64 for gari-soybean fortified gari; and 0.31-12.56, 0.03-0.12, 0.17-5.45 and 0.34-1.41 for tapioca to soybean fortified tapioca respectively. Soybean flour increased the nutrient content of the fortified gari and tapioca compared to soybean residue. Data from this study suggest that both soybean flour-fortified tapioca and soybean flour-fortified gari are effective means of meeting the daily requirements of minerals, protein, and energy. Conclusions. Both soybean flour-fortified tapioca and soybean flour-fortified gari could be used to fight macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies, not only in Nigeria and other African countries where these two cassava products are staples, but also in other cassava-consuming developing nations. © 2009, The United Nations University.","Fortification; Gari; Macronutrient; Micronutrient; Millennium development goals; Tapioca","cassava; comparative study; developing world; malnutrition; moisture content; nutritional requirement; nutritive value; soybean; Gari; Glycine max; Manihot esculenta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65349172663

However, unlike many other low-carbon technologies, the idea remains untested. The most frequent criticism of the sector's development is that the demonstration projects needed to prove that carbon capture and storage (CCS) can operate safely and economically at scale are not sufficiently advanced. There is a gap in the strategy that needs to be plugged immediately, according to Gardiner Hill, director of CCS technology at BP. However, there is still hope that some CCS demonstration projects could be operating as early as 2015, according to Hill. As soon as projects are under way, operating experience will generate efficiency gains and technology improvements, accelerating the industry's wider development. Some progress on the ground is being made. The FEED study for a 400 Mw hydrogen power plant in Abu Dhabi, being developed by Hydrogen Energy, is more than 50% complete. The company would be able to supply &gt; 5% of Abu Dhabi's power at a cost equivalent to conventional electricity. Reinjecting captured CO2 into oilfields could boost Abu Dhabi's oil production by 1 billion-3 billion bbl. Another problem for high-cost CCS projects is that they may become lesser priorities for governments grappling with the more immediate problem of stopping the economic rot. However, CCS could help move economies out of trouble, generating jobs, and economic growth, according to Hill.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65249146587

It was found that water circulation within the SWHS ranged between 15 and 65 l/d depending upon solar intensity and discharge head. Moreover, the max water temperature in the storage tank is around 59 °C. The max daily pump efficiency is about 0.0017%. The SWHS could have max daily thermal efficiency of about 21%. It is concluded that the thermal efficiency was successfully improved, except for the pump one. The new SWHS with 1 m discharge head or lower is suitable for residential use. It adds less weight to a building roof and saves electrical energy for a circulation pump. It has lower cost compared to a domestic SWHS. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Although TABS are increasingly used, in many cases control has remained an issue to be improved. In this paper, a method is outlined allowing for automated control of TABS in intermittent operation with pulse width modulation (PWM). This method represents one part of a TABS control solution with automatic switching between cooling and heating modes for variable comfort criteria which was published before. A first pulse width modulation control solution is derived based on a simple 1st order model of TABS. Then a second, even simpler solution is given that significantly reduces the tuning effort.

In this paper the authors have compared technologies to produce the electricity using natural gas and coal. The objective of this paper consists in evaluation of the life cycle assessment of the natural gas and coal in order to compare their greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. In this way, three systems with and without CCS were examined: one using the natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) and two using the coal: pulverized coal with sub-critical and super-critical parameters and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC). The study shows that life cycle GHG emissions from fossil fuel power stations with carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be reduced by 75-84% relative to the reference case. IGCC is found to be favorable with a reduction of GHG emissions to less than 160 g/kWh. For NGCC power plants, the amount of methane leakage from natural gas extraction and transport has a significant effect on life cycle GHG emissions.","CCS; Coal; Energy; Life cycle assessment; Natural gas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62749102783

A diesel generator is added to ensure continuous power supply and to take care of intermittent nature of wind and photovoltaic. The paper reports results of the technical-economic optimization study of photovoltaic/wind/diesel hybrid with battery storage in Algeria. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the appropriate dimension of stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic/wind/diesel with battery storage that guarantee the energy autonomy of typical remote consumer with lowest cost of energy. A secondary aim is to study the impact of renewable energy potential quality on the system size. The optimum dimensions of the system are defined for six sites in Algeria. In this context, a complete sizing model is developed in Matlab/Simulink V.6.5, able to predict the optimum system configuration. The simulation results indicate that the hybrid system is the best option for all the sites considered in this study. Thus, it provides higher system performance than photovoltaic or wind alone. It s shown that the principal advantage of photovoltaic/wind/diesel hybrid with battery storage are used all together, the reliability of the system is enhanced. The economic analysis has resulted in the calculation of kWh cost of energy for different types of resources and optimized cost of hybrid energy system. It s revealed too that the energy cost depends largely on the renewable energy potential quality.

The thermal performance of these materials is evaluated in terms of the axial temperature distribution, the total energy stored, the total exergy stored and the transient charging efficiency. The results indicate that not only is the value of the total amount of energy stored important for the thermal performance of oil-pebble-bed systems but also that the amount of exergy stored and the degree of thermal stratification should be considered.

In this context, an integrated electrification solution based on a photovoltaic generator along with an appropriate energy storage device is investigated. One of the main targets of the proposed solution is to maximise the solar energy exploitation of the area at minimum electricity generation cost, while special emphasis is given to the selection of the most cost-efficient energy storage configuration available.

However, normally the available raw natural gas is mixed with some heavy components such as C3 + and/or some impurities such as CO2, N2 and sulfur compounds (H2S and RSH). The raw gas should be treated in order to meet the international specifications and eliminate or at least minimize the emission of toxic and/or pollutant gases to the surrounding area. Mellitah Plant applies the latest technology in order to meet the international standards. In this paper, we will present the different process at Mellitah site in which we produce a clean natural gas for export and recover 99.8 wt% of associated sulfur compound with the raw gas and/or acid gas. The recovered sulfur is produced in liquid phase then dried for storage in solid phase. The solid sulfur is exported to international market. The emission control at Mellitah plant is optimized and controlled as per the latest available technology. The fuel gas utilized for all the process is completely clean gas; flue gas contains always less than 10 ppm of H2S.

First, an analysis of incineration of wastes taking into account environmental limits is performed. This analysis is aimed at a typical arrangement of a conventional oxidizing incineration plant consisting of waste storage and feeding systems, two-stage incinerator (primary and secondary combustion chambers), heat recovery system involving co-generation and off-gas cleaning system. It is also focused on a new arrangement where the primary combustion chamber (rotary kiln) is substituted by gasification reactor. The proposed concept with a fluidised bed reactor utilizes results of experimental research with various mixtures of wastes (e.g. shredded textile and rubber) considering typical conditions of operation. Experiments provide us with various important characteristics (heat value of produced syngas vs. temperature in the gasification reactor, temperature in the secondary combustion chamber vs. oxygen concentration in outlet flue gas and heat value of syngas, etc.). Then it is possible to make a comparison of conventional incineration and gasification for a concrete industrial process involving a unit for thermal treatment of hazardous industrial waste mixed with municipal solid wastes with capacity of 10,000 t/year. The application of gasification technology brings about the whole range of benefits like minimizing the consumption of auxiliary fuel and decreasing size of the secondary combustion chamber and other subsystems of the incineration plants. Involving such a system with energy and investment cost reduction into an industrial process contributes to meeting cleaner production and environmental legislation regulations. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Gasification; Incineration; Off-gas cleaning; Waste; Waste to energy","Chemical reactors; Cleaning; Combustion chambers; Cost reduction; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Fluidized beds; Gasification; Incineration; Industrial waste treatment; Investments; Laws and legislation; Municipal solid waste; Pollution control; Secondary recovery; Synthesis gas; Textile industry; Waste heat; Wastes; Environmental legislations; Fluidised bed reactors; Gas cleaning; Gasification technologies; Hazardous industrial wastes; Oxygen concentrations; Secondary combustion chamber; Waste to energy; Waste incineration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60649111055

It includes an offshore section, a combined gas carrier, and an onshore integrated receiving terminal. Due to utilization of the cold exergy both in the offshore and onshore processes, and combined use of the gas carrier, the transport chain is both energy and cost effective. In this paper, the liquefied energy chain (LEC) is explained, including novel processes for both the offshore field site and onshore market site. In the offshore section, natural gas (NG) is liquefied to LNG by liquid carbon dioxide (LCO2) and liquid inert nitrogen (LIN), which are used as cold carriers. The LNG is transported in a combined gas carrier to the receiving terminal where it is used as a cooling agent to liquefy CO2 and nitrogen. The LCO2 and LIN are transported offshore using the same combined carrier. Pinch and Exergy Analyses are used to determine the optimal offshore and onshore processes and the best transport conditions. The exergy efficiency for a thermodynamically optimized process is 87% and 71% for the offshore and onshore processes, respectively, yielding a total efficiency of 52%. The offshore process is self-supported with power and can operate with few units of rotating equipment and without flammable refrigerants. The loss of natural gas due to power generation for the energy requirements in the LEC processes is roughly one third of the loss in a conventional transport chain for stranded natural gas with CO2 sequestration. The LEC has several configurations and can be used for small scale (&lt;0.25 MTPA LNG) to large-scale (&gt;5 MTPA LNG) transport. In the example in this paper, the total costs for the simple LEC including transport of natural gas to a 400 MWnet power plant and return of 85% of the corresponding carbon as CO2 for a total sailing distance of 24 h are 58.1 EUR/tonne LNG excluding or including the cost of power. The total power requirements are 319 kWh/tonne, hence the energy costs are 31.9 EUR/tonne LNG adding up to 90.0 EUR/tonne LNG. The exergy efficiency for this energy chain including power production and CO2 capture is 46.4% with a total cost of 20.4 EUR/MWh for the produced electricity. The total emissions (in CO2 equivalents) in the chain are 1-1.5% of the transported CO2. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The same carrier is used to transport the LNG onshore, where the NG can be used for power production with CO2 capture. The combined carrier consists of 10 cylindrical tanks with a diameter of 9.2 m and varying lengths from 14 to 40 m. The total ship volume is 13,000 m3. Assuming 85% capture rate of the CO2, the maximum ship utilization factor (SUF) is 63.4%. Due to the combined use of the storage tanks, the SUF is decreased with 1.4% points to 62%.

The highest exergy destruction (56.8%) occurs within the throttling valves followed by the exergy destruction in the two-stages RO units (about 21%). The exergy destruction in the pumps and motors account for 19.6% of the total. The second law efficiency of the plant is very low, 4.1%.

A solar collector was modified from corrugated metal roofing with a copper tube attached beneath. The performance of the solar water heater was tested, and models for the collector efficiency and storage tank were developed and used for the evaluation of their performance when combined with a heat pump system. The performance of the combined solar water heater and heat pump was investigated using a simulation program. In this analysis, a model for a heat pump using the refrigerant mixture R22/R124/R152a was selected. From the simulation program, the results show that the highest performance occurred at a mass fraction of R22 = 20%, R124 = 57% and R152a = 23%, a compressor speed of 20 rps, and mass flow rate of refrigerant at 0.01 kg/s. The coefficient of performance (COP) of this system is between 2.5 and 5.0. Moreover, economic analysis shows that the suitable mass of hot water in the storage tank is 400 kg and that the payback period for this system is 2.3 years. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Hot-air heating was applied only during the night. The hot air was distributed to the crop via perforated polyethylene sleeves placed on the ground between the rows of plants. To determine the effect of a thermal screen on the energy consumption and on the greenhouse microclimate under cyclic heating, a horizontal 20%-aluminised thermal screen was automatically deployed every night between 18:00 and 06:00, at a height of about 2.5 m above the ground. The screen was deployed during two of the four weeks of data collection. The air temperature in the greenhouse at night was usually maintained at 16-18 °C by an on-off controller. The thermal screen did not reduce the heat loss from the greenhouse because it was relatively small in area and only 20% of its area was covered by reflective aluminised material. Yet, despite this, it kept the canopy temperature slightly higher than without a screen. Two different models were used to determine the global heat transfer coefficient from the greenhouse: the first assumed a quasi-steady-state heating condition; the second used a transient approach in which heat storage in the greenhouse air and crop was taken into account. It was found that there was a small difference between the results of the two models. A simple model for calculating leaf temperature is offered and used for calculating the temperature of an upper leaf. The model and experimental results are in good agreement even under unsteady heating. © 2008 IAgrE.",,"Crops; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Greenhouses; Heat losses; Heat storage; Heating; Canopy temperature; Data collection; Global heat transfer coefficients; Greenhouse microclimate; Heating conditions; Leaf temperature; Quasi-steady state; Simple modeling; Greenhouse effect; Rosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58749089064

Chain extenders containing urea groups or an aromatic amino-acid derivative were incorporated in the SPU formulation to strengthen the hard segment interactions through either bidentate hydrogen bonding or π-stacking interactions, respectively. By varying the composition of the hard segment (diisocyanate and chain extender), its structure was varied to investigate the structure-property relationships. The different chemical composition and symmetry of hard segment modulated the phase separation of soft and hard domains, as demonstrated by the thermal behavior. Hard segment association was more enhanced by using a combination of symmetric diisocyanate and urea-diol chain extenders. The hard segment cohesion had an important effect on the observed mechanical behavior. Polyurethanes synthesized using HDI (Series H) were stronger than those obtained using LDI (Series L). The latter SPU exhibited no tendency to undergo cold-drawing and the lowest ultimate properties. Incorporation of the aromatic chain extender produced opposite effects, resulting in polyurethanes with the highest elongation and tearing energy (Series H) and the lowest strain at break (Series L). Since the synthesized biodegradable SPU possess a range of thermal and mechanical properties, these materials may hold potential for use in soft tissue engineering scaffold applications. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Acid derivative; Caprolactone (PCL); Chain extender (CE); Chain extenders (CE); Chemical compositions; Di isocyanates; Hard segments; Hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI); Hydrogen bondings; Mechanical behaviors; Methyl esters; Segment chemistry; Soft tissues; Ultimate properties; Urea groups; Amines; Amino acids; Aromatic compounds; Esters; Hydrogen; Hydrogen bonds; Mechanical properties; Metabolism; Nonvolatile storage; Phase separation; Polymers; Polyurethanes; Tissue engineering; Urea; Materials properties; aromatic amino acid; estradiol; hexamethylene diisocyanate; hydrogen; polycaprolactone; polyurethan; urea; amino acid composition; article; biochemical composition; biodegradability; chemical bond; chemical composition; chemical structure; energy; glass transition temperature; hydrogen bond; phase separation; physical chemistry; priority journal; protein domain; structure analysis; synthesis; tensile strength; young modulus; Biocompatible Materials; Biomechanics; Cyanates; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Materials Testing; Molecular Structure; Polyesters; Polyurethanes; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Tensile Strength; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58549095235

Obesity is also associated with hypertriglyceridemia that may involve greater production and impaired removal of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglycerides (TG). In these studies, we assessed the impact of body composition on basal VLDL-TG production, VLDL-TG oxidation, and VLDL-TG storage. VLDL-TG kinetics were assessed in 10 UBO, 10 LBO, and 10 lean women using a bolus injection of [1-14C]VLDL-TG. VLDL-TG oxidation was measured by 14CO2 production (hyamine trapping) and VLDL-TG adipose tissue storage by fat biopsies. Insulin sensititvity was assessed by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique and body composition by dual X-ray absorptiometry in combination with computed tomography. Hepatic VLDL-TG production was significantly greater in UBO than in lean women [(μmol/min) UBO: 64.8 (SD 40.0) vs. LBO: 42.5 (SD 25.6) vs. lean: 31.8 (SD 13.3), P = 0.04], whereas VLDL-TG oxidation was similar in the three groups and averaged 20% of resting energy expenditure [(μmol/min) UBO: 38.3 (SD 26.5) vs. LBO: 23.5 (SD 13.5) vs. lean: 21.1 (SD 9.7), P = 0.09]. In UBO women, more VLDL-TG was deposited in upper body subcutaneous fat [VLDL-TG redeposition in abdominal adipose tissue (μmol/min): UBO: 5.0 (SD 2.9) vs. LBO: 4.0 (SD 3.2) vs. lean: 1.3 (SD 1.0), ANOVA P = 0.01]; in LBO women, more VLDL-TG was deposited in femoral fat [VLDL-TG redeposition in femoral adipose tissue (μmol/min): UBO: 5.1 (SD 3.1) vs. LBO: 5.8 (SD 4.3) vs. lean: 2.3 (SD 1.5), ANOVA P = 0.04]. Only a small proportion of VLDL-TG (8-16%) was partitioned into redeposition in either group. We found that elevated VLDL-TG production without concomitant increased clearance via oxidation and adipose tissue redeposition contributes to hypertriglyceridemia in UBO women.

The high UWB peak data rate allows for medium average data rates in combination with a very low duty cycle, which is the key for a very low power consumption. Devices in a wireless BAN require low complexity. Hence, mainly non-coherent receivers such as energy detector and transmitted-reference receiver are suited. In this paper, the symbol-wise maximum-likelihood (ML) detectors for pulse position modulation (PPM) and transmittedreference pulse amplitude modulation (TR PAM) are derived assuming partial channel state information (CSI) at the receiver. Additionally, also the ML detectors for a combination of PPM and TR PAM are presented. The performance of the derived receiver structures is evaluated using a novel BAN channel model not distinguishing line-of-sight and non line-of-sight situations. This simple channel model is based on 1100 channel measurements in the frequency range between 2 and 8 GHz, which were measured in an anechoic chamber. Using the BAN channel model, performance of the derived receiver structures is evaluated showing that the knowledge of the average power delay profile (APDP) at the receiver improves performance substantially. Requiring only slightly more complexity such receivers are a well suited alternative to non-coherent receivers for the use in a BAN. © 2006 IEEE.","Body area network; Channel model; Non-coherent receiver structures; Ultra wideband","Amplitude modulation; Architectural acoustics; Associative storage; Broadband networks; Channel capacity; Channel state information; Communication channels (information theory); Communication systems; Detectors; Information retrieval; Local area networks; Model structures; Modulation; Pneumatic drives; Pulse amplitude modulation; Pulse modulation; Pulse position modulation; Signal receivers; Telecommunication systems; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Average datums; Average powers; Body area network; Body Area Networks; Channel measurements; Channel model; Data rates; Duty cycles; Energy detectors; Frequency ranges; Low complexities; Low powers; Maximum-likelihood; Ml detectors; Non-coherent receiver structures; Partial channel state informations; Receiver structures; Transmittedreference pulses; Ultra wideband; Ultra wideband communications; Uwb receivers; Wireless body area networks; Wireless networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149510239

Primarily designed for monitoring purposes, many sensor applications require continuous collection and processing of sensed data. Due to the limited power supply for sensor nodes, energy efficiency is a major performance concern in query processing. In this paper, we focus on continuous kNN query processing in object tracking sensor networks. We propose a localized scheme to monitor nearest neighbors to a query point. The key idea is to establish a monitoring area for each query so that only the updates relevant to the query are collected. The monitoring area is set up when the kNN query is initially evaluated and is expanded and shrunk on the fly upon object movement. We analyze the optimal maintenance of the monitoring area and develop an adaptive algorithm to dynamically decide when to shrink the monitoring area. Experimental results show that establishing a monitoring area for continuous kNN query processing greatly reduces energy consumption and prolongs network lifetime. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,"Energy consumptions; Limited power supplies; Localized schemes; Nearest neighbors; Network lifetimes; Object movements; Object tracking sensor networks; On the flies; Optimal maintenances; Query points; Sensor applications; Sensor nodes; Adaptive algorithms; Data processing; Data storage equipment; Energy efficiency; Hybrid sensors; Military applications; Monitoring; Query processing; Sensor networks; Sensors; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149473594

In this environment, one of the most challenging and important tasks for a GenCo is developing effective strategies to optimize hourly offer curve. In this paper, focusing on Iran's electricity market structure, we model the bidding problem from the viewpoint of a GenCo in a pay-as-bid (PAB) auction. Our goal is to present a tool for determining the optimal bidding strategy of a price-taker producer in an electricity PAB auction taking into account the relevant risks. Due to uncertainties in power market, the market-clearing price (MCP) of each hour is assumed to be known as a probability density function (pdf). The optimal solution of bidding problem is obtained analytically based on the classical optimization theory. Also, the analytical solution for a multi-step bid protocol is generalized and the properties of the generalized solution are discussed. A model is developed to consider concept of risk using two different methods. The two proposed methods are then compared and the results interpreted using numerical examples. In addition, the effect of variation of MCP's pdf parameters on supplier's profit is studied.

The secondary fluid was prepared by mixing ethyl alcohol and water to obtain initial alcohol concentration of 10.3% (initial freezing temperature -4.4 °C). The pressure drop tests were conducted to cover laminar and slightly turbulent flow with ice mass fraction varying from 0% to 30% depending on test conditions. Results from flow tests reveal much higher pressure drop for higher ice concentrations and higher velocities in comparison to the single phase flow. However for ice concentrations of 15% and higher, certain velocity exists at which ice slurry pressure drop is same or even lower than for single phase flow. It seems that higher ice concentration delay flow pattern transition moment (from laminar to turbulent) toward higher velocities. In addition experimental results for pressure drop were compared to the analytical results, based on Poiseulle and Buckingham-Reiner models for laminar flow, Blasius, Darby and Melson, Dodge and Metzner, Steffe and Tomita for turbulent region and general correlation of Kitanovski which is valid for both flow regimes. For laminar flow and low buoyancy numbers Buckingham-Reiner method gives good agreement with experimental results while for turbulent flow best fit is provided with Dodge-Metzner and Tomita methods. Furthermore, for transport purposes it has been shown that ice mass fraction of 20% offers best ratio of ice slurry transport capability and required pumping power. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The ECG signal is partitioned into blocks and the MDCT is applied to each block to decorrelate the spectral information. Then, the DWT is applied to the resulting MDCT coefficients. Removing spectral redundancy is achieved by compressing the subordinate components more than the dominant components. The resulting wavelet coefficients are then thresholded and compressed using energy packing and binary-significant map coding technique for storage space saving. Experiments on ECG records from the MIT-BIH database are performed with various combinations of MDCT and wavelet filters at different transformation levels, and quantization intervals. The decompressed signals are evaluated using percentage rms error (PRD) and zero-mean rms error (PRD1) measures. The results showed that the proposed method provides low bit-rate and high quality of the reconstructed signal. It offers average compression ratio (CR) of 21.5 and PRD of 5.89%, which would be suitable for most monitoring and diagnoses applications. Simulation results show that the proposed method compares favourably with various state-of-the-art ECG compressors. © 2009 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Binary-significant map coding; Data compression; Discrete cosine transform; Electrocardiogram; Energy packing; Wavelet transform","Applications.; Binary-significant map coding; Coding techniques; Compression ratios; Discrete cosines; ECG signals; Electrocardiogram; Energy packing; High qualities; Mit-bih databases; Modified Discrete Cosine transforms; Monitoring and diagnoses; RMS errors; Signal compressions; Simulation results; Spectral informations; Spectral redundancies; Storage spaces; Wavelet coefficients; Wavelet filters; Compression ratio (machinery); Computerized tomography; Cosine transforms; Data compression; Discrete cosine transforms; Electrocardiography; Electrochromic devices; Image coding; Mathematical transformations; Programming theory; Signal processing; Wavelet transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; article; data base; discrete wavelet transform; electrocardiogram; electrophysiology; energy; filter; modified discrete cosine transform; quality control; signal detection; simulation; spectral sensitivity; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Data Compression; Electrocardiography; Humans; Models, Cardiovascular; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149173320

As regards Swedish industry, it has been faced with substantial increases in energy prices in recent years. Barriers to energy efficiency such as imperfect information inhibit investments in energy efficiency measures, energy audits being one means of reducing barriers and overcoming imperfect information. However, an evaluation of such energy audits in Sweden reveals that it is chiefly low-cost measures that are undertaken as a result of an audit. Moreover, these audits often tend to focus on support processes such as ventilation, lighting, air compressors etc., while measures impacting production processes are often not as extensively covered, which underlines the need for further support in addition to energy audits. Decision support is practised in a variety of different disciplines such as optimization and simulation and the aim of this paper is to explore whether investment decision support practices may be used successfully towards small and medium-sized manufacturers in Sweden when complex production-related investment decisions are taken. The optimization results from the different cases, involving a foundry's investment in a new melting unit, indicate that with no electricity price fluctuations over the day, the investment seems sound as it lowers the overall energy costs. However, with fluctuating electricity prices, there are no large differences in energy costs between the option of retaining the existing five melting furnaces at the foundry and investing in a twin furnace and removing the holding furnaces - which was the initial investment plan for the foundry in the study. It would not have been possible to achieve this outcome without the use of investment decision support such as MIND. One of the main conclusions in this paper is that investment decision support, when strategic investment decisions are to be taken, may be a means of emphasising energy efficiency for energy-intensive SMEs beyond the level of traditional energy auditing. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Scratch-pad memories are completely software-controlled memories with predictable behaviour and good performance and energy characteristics, thus they tend to become a standard feature in many embedded systems. However, their predictability is not helping if the application accesses its data dynamically, when the addresses of the accessed data depend on the application's input. In such cases, predetermining the scratch-pad content at design-time is not always possible as the compiler cannot predict the runtime input. Moreover, in this case, both data reuse and data placement in the scratch-pad are inefficient because chunks of data already stored cannot be efficiently reused and combined with the runtime accessed data blocks. State-of-the art techniques copy each new data block to the scratch-pad without considering whether portions of them are already in it. Such dynamic temporal locality cannot be predicted or exploited by the compiler. The authors here present a system architecture, strongly connected to the system's scratch-pad and the processor's compiler, which is able to efficiently exploit run-time data reuse in the scratch-pad by being capable of holding valuable information, such as the exact data contents of the scratch-pad at runtime, and using it to do all the necessary operations for placing each new data block in scratch-pad. It is fine tuned for applications with run-time reuse between rectangular data blocks. The application domain of the proposed architecture is multimedia applications with run-time reuse, certain applications with linked lists and multi-threaded applications. It operates in a time and energy-efficient manner when compared with existing scratch-pad architectures without the authors' scratch-pad accelerator engine, showing its higher normalised performance and lower normalised energy consumption. Experimental results show up to 2.5 times performance increase compared with existing scratch-pad architectures and 5 times compared with cache architectures and energy decrease up to 1.9 and 3.9 times, respectively. © 2009 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Applications; Architecture; Code converters; Computer architecture; Computer programming languages; Data storage equipment; Energy efficiency; Integrated circuits; Program compilers; Application domains; Cache architectures; Data blocks; Data contents; Data placements; Data reuses; Embedded applications; Energy characteristics; Energy consumption.; Energy-efficient; Its datums; Low powers; Multimedia applications; Proposed architectures; Strongly connected; System architectures; Temporal localities; Time budgets; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049089710

In the event of water-bearing fractures making contact with the bentonite barrier, generation and transport of colloidal particles will strongly depend on groundwater composition and the surface properties of the colloidal particles. The bentonite barrier will unavoidably be exposed to ionizing radiation from the spent nuclear fuel but very little is known about effects of ionizing radiation on bentonite concerning colloidal stability. In this work we have studied the effect of γ-radiation on the stability of dilute colloidal Na+-montmorillonite dispersions using a Cs-137 γ-source (doses of 0-53.2 kGy). Aggregation kinetics and sedimentation experiments revealed significant radiation effects, evident as increased colloid stability. The only rationale for this is a γ-radiation induced increase in surface potential.

The cauterizer uses a battery recharged from a solar panel to provide the energy required during cutting. The system was energy-optimized in order to use the smallest solar cell to decrease high initial costs. Cuts at 150 °C destroyed thorns and cauterized the fruits.

Samples are prepared from MgxFe (x: 2, 3 and 15) elemental powder mixtures via low energy ball milling under hydrogen atmosphere at room temperature. The highest yield is obtained with Mg15Fe after 150 h of milling (90 wt% of MgH2). The thermodynamic characterization carried out between 523 and 673 K shows that the obtained Mg-Fe-H hydride systems have similar thermodynamic parameters, i.e. enthalpy and entropy. However, in equilibrium conditions, Mg15Fe has higher hydrogen capacity and small hysteresis. In dynamic conditions, Mg15Fe also shows better hydrogen capacity (4.85 wt% at 623 K absorbed in less than 10 min and after 100 absorption/desorption cycles), reasonably good absorption/desorption times and cycling stability in comparison to the other studied compositions. From hydrogen uptake rate measurements performed at 573 and 623 K, the rate-limiting step of the hydrogen uptake reaction is determined by fitting particle kinetic models. According to our results, the hydrogen uptake is diffusion controlled, and this mechanism does not change with the Mg-Fe proportion and temperature. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As an alternative to semiconductor nanoparticles which have been intensively investigated, metallic nanoparticles have been recently also used since they have the potential for more versatile engineering of energy barriers. This would allow improved data retention for memory devices operating at low voltages.

These models describe the early stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, in particular the spatial distribution of the transverse energy deposition which ultimately leads to production of particles from the interaction region. The original geometric distribution of sources in the transverse plane can be superimposed with a statistical distribution simulating the dispersion in the generated transverse energy in each individual collision. The program generates inter alia the fixed-axes (standard) and variable-axes (participant) two-dimensional profiles of the density of sources in the transverse plane and their azimuthal Fourier components. These profiles can be used in further analysis of physical phenomena, such as the jet quenching, event-by-event hydrodynamics, or analysis of the elliptic flow and its fluctuations. Characteristics of the event (multiplicities, eccentricities, Fourier coefficients, etc.) are stored in a ROOT file and can be analyzed off-line. In particular, event-by-event studies can be carried out in a simple way. A number of ROOT scripts is provided for that purpose. Supplied variants of the code can also be used for the proton-nucleus and deuteron-nucleus collisions. Program summary: Program title: GLISSANDO. Catalogue identifier: AEBS_v1_0.

The CdS thin films were grown from different baths by varying the S/Cd ratio. The variation of the S/Cd ratio allowed us to control the morphology and the density of defects, thus giving rise to better quality CBD CdS films. Depending on the S/Cd ratio an improvement of the morphology and capacitance signal was observed, these factors have also an influence on the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, fill factor and conversion efficiency of the solar cell. The variation with time of these parameters in our devices was tracked during a period of 3 years measured directly on the exposed back contact regions (CdTe/Cu/Au). A discussion on the deterioration of the photovoltaic (PV) performance of the solar cells is presented in correlation with the local environmental conditions. This particular environment has contamination, and represents another type of stress for standard PV operations. These conditions reduce the mean life time of solar cells beyond short periods; this can be of interest for PV community. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

During charging mode, a heat transfer fluid (hot water) from the solar collector passes through the tubes and transfers the collecting heat of solar radiation to the PCM. The heat stored in the liquid PCM is next transferred to water during discharging mode to produce heating water. A simulation program based on the finite volume approach was also developed to numerically evaluate the thermal performance of the LHSU. The model was first validated by comparing the results of numerical simulations to the experimental data. A series of numerical simulations were conducted for three kinds of PCM (n-octadecane, Paraffin wax and Stearic acid) to find the optimum design for a given summer climatic conditions of Marrakech city: solar radiation and ambient temperature. Optimization of the LHSU involves determination of the mass of the PCM, the number of tubes, and the flow rate water in solar collector that maximise the thermal storage efficiency. Several simulations were also made to study the effect of the flow rate water on its outlet temperature, during the discharging mode. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The methods perform expressing the desired closed-loop energy, interconnection and damping properties on a so-called target bond graph, which is built as follows on the plant bond graph: (i) adding virtual storage elements enforces a minimum on the target bond graph energy at a prespecified stable closed-loop equilibrium state, (ii) changing the R-field and its interconnection with the rest of the graph assigns a new dissipation function, and (iii) suitably inserting of power conserving elements (bonds and other structural BG-elements) among junctions yields the desired power conserving interconnection structure. The control law is then determined developing physically based heuristics and formal techniques on the target and plant bond graphs, which deliver a set of partial differential equations to be solved. The method to achieve integral control consists in adding to the target bond graph virtual elements representing the integral action and a change of variables, and then computing the integral control law with standard BG equation-reading procedures. These BG heuristics and prototyping allow to provide integral action on outputs of relative degree greater than one, a contribution of this work not previously available in the literature. This shows that the physical properties of bond graphs are beneficial not only to expediently perform methods contributed by control theory, but also to derive new theoretical results. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This is done first establishing equivalences among key variables in both domains through the comparison of the expressions of the stored system energy in both formalisms. Later, with the help of the general field-representation of bond graphs and its associated standard implicit form, the functions characterizing this class of Port-Hamiltonian Systems, i.e., interconnection, dissipation and input/output matrices, as well as their properties, are immediately expressed in terms of bond graphs parameters. Under suitable assumptions, the method supports the direct derivation of Input-State-Output Port-Hamiltonian Systems - which is an explicit type of PHS - even from bond graphs having causally coupled dissipators and storages in derivative causality, which are known to imply algebraic and implicit differential equations. The methods are illustrated with some application examples covering different causal situations.

The results show that Morin molecule, acting as an intercalator, is inserted into the cavity of the β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) as well as into the base stacking domain of the DNA double helix. The interaction of Morin-Cu complex or the inclusion complex of Morin-β-CD with ds-DNA causes hypochromism in the absorption spectra, along with pronounced changes in the electrochemical behavior of the Morin complexes. An isobestic point and a new spectrum band appeared indicating the formation of the new system of Morin-Cu-DNA at λm = 391 nm and Morin-β-CD-DNA at λm = 375 nm. The intercalation of Morin-Cu and Morin-β-CD complexes with DNA produces an electrochemically inactive supramolecular complex. The binding constants were calculated from the increase of the solubility, the strong hypochromism, and the decrease in peak current of Morin and its complexes upon the addition of the host molecules.

The deaerators had water temperatures ranged from 110 to 130 °C while the pressure was only a few bar. It was established that (a) both ECP readings exhibited good agreement, (b) the reference electrodes showed good durability over testing periods of between 1000 and 1700 h service and (c) an initial hysterisis period of around 400 h was observed before ECP levels attained a minimum value. Also, it was shown that when few transients occurred during the start-up period the minimum ECP value was around -350 mV while in the case where significant transients occurred the minimum ECP value was only -100 mV. This effect of transients was important in the prediction of the occurrence of environmentally assisted cracking, EAC, in deaerator welds inasmuch that when few transients occurred EAC was only expected in oxidized weld runs with bulk sulphur levels of around 0.025%S and in Pd coated weld runs of some 0.05%S. In the case where a significant amount of transients took place EAC was predicted to occur in all oxidized weld runs and in Pd coated weld runs with bulk sulphur levels above only 0.015%S. Such effects of start-up conditions will have a significant influence on the working life of deaerator storage vessels since EAC growth rates can be typically 10 to 100 times faster than normal air based fatigue crack growth rates. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

For a purification process, impurities have great impacts on the design, operation and optimization through their impacts on the thermodynamic properties of CO2-streams. Study results show that the increments of impurities will make the energy consumption of purification increase; and make CO2 purity of separation product and CO2 recovery rate decrease. In addition, under the same operating conditions, energy consumptions have different sensitivities to the variation of the impurity mole fraction of feed fluids. The isothermal compression work is more sensitive to the variation of SO2; while the isentropic compression work is more sensitive to the variation of Ar. In the flash system, the energy consumption of condensation in is more sensitive to the variation of Ar; but in the distillation system, the energy consumption of condensation is more sensitive to the variation of SO2, and CO2 purity of separation is more sensitive to the variation of SO2. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
