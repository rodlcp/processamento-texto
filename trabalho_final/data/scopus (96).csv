One possibility is to inject carbon dioxide into underground aquifers. Injection wells consist of steel casings supported by cement (or plugged by cement, if abandoned), which contains large quantities of calcium oxide that can react with carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate. Cement also contains various other clay materials similar to calcium carbonate. Pores between steel and cement make an ideal environment for corrosion due to saltwater and even more so due to the acidic environment, which may reach pH < 3, depending on temperature and pressure. Thus, surfaces of the pores transform into calcium carbonate and iron oxide, potentially reducing the integrity of the wells. Sodium and chloride ions will arrange in distinct layers reaching approximately one nanometer outside the surface and will interact with the acidic environment. To properly understand how adsorbed sodium chloride affects corrosion processes at the nanoscale we employed molecular dynamics simulations, where effects on adsorption free energies and density profiles were investigated. It was found that water densities within one nanometer from the surfaces were reduced as a consequence of adsorbed sodium chloride, thus lowering the absolute value of water adsorption free energy. Furthermore, even small amounts of hydronium and bicarbonate could alter the qualitative behavior of sodium and chloride density profiles. However, the strongest effects of adsorbed sodium and chloride ions were seen on free energies of hydronium and bicarbonate. Absolute values of adsorption free energies, as well as desorption free energy barriers, decreased at both surfaces for positive ionic species and increased for negative ionic species, suggesting that the primary mechanism was of an electrostatic nature. It was found that all major changes in free energy, due to adsorbed sodium chloride, were caused by interactions with the first layer of adsorbed sodium and the first layer of adsorbed chloride. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Abandoned wells; Adsorption; Aquifers; Calcium carbonate; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Cements; Free energy; Hydrogeology; Injection (oil wells); Ions; Iron oxides; Lime; Molecular dynamics; Nanotechnology; Seawater corrosion; Sodium chloride; Acidic environment; Adsorption free energy; Corrosion process; Molecular dynamics simulations; Primary mechanism; Qualitative behavior; Temperature and pressures; Water adsorption; Steel corrosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027330343

The new wind power plants are replacing many of the conventional large power plants that ensure power balancing and ancillary services for stable and reliable operation of the grid. Therefore, new solutions for power balancing reserves have to be explored and utilized by the grid utilities. To meet these challenges, large sizable loads like alkaline electrolysers, heat pumps and electric vehicles which are gaining popularity can provide system support to the grid through their inherent flexibility and energy storage characteristics.

Besides implementing various control techniques, mainly based on energy storage systems, improving the response of RES-based generators and increasing the controllability at the consumption level are among the most discussed techniques to achieve high levels of reliability and robustness for the future MG. On this topic, the current paper presents a control solution for active loads (AL), which can be developed based on non-critical loads, in order to provide dynamic support during fast frequency variations. The study shows that implementing a frequency controller based on the derivative of the estimated frequency provides an improvement of the MG transitory behaviour, but due to the difficulty of accurately measuring the MG frequency, the method can also worsen the AL input current distortion. Therefore, the paper presents an original harmonic compensation technique, which can mitigate the current distortions in certain limits. The presented results show that the dynamic frequency response is improved by the action of AL, the feature being optimally used along with the proposed harmonic compensation technique. © 2016 IEEE.","Active load; Frequency control; Harmonic compensation; Microgrid",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010030991

The aim of our scheme is to provide incentives for nodes to deliver a message from a source node to a destination. In order to extend the reward-based incentive mechanism already discussed in related literature, we allow nodes to form coalitions. The relay nodes that belong to the same coalition share obtained reward after a successful delivery, and/or undergo some penalty in case of a failure delivery. Namely, we propose a coalitional game wherein relays of the same coalition cooperate while competing with relays of other coalitions to deliver the message. In this game, when a message is generated by a source, each candidate relay has two strategies: either to participate to forward the message, we refer to this by the 'accept' 'A' strategy. On one hand, when a relay chooses strategy 'A', it seeks to receive a reward in case it is the first to get in contact with the destination. Otherwise, a penalty in terms of maximum energy consumption is applied. We consider that transmission, reception, storage and coalition formation operations are all energy consuming. On the other hand, i.e., when all relays of a coalition decide not to participate by choosing strategy 'R', possibly to save energy, all of them undergo some penalty in form of a regret. Our approach is designed to ensure an efficient trade-off between the overall delivery probability and the energy consumption. Next, we propose two algorithms to allow relay node to converge to the stable partition. Extensive simulation runs illustrate the impact of many parameters on the coalitions' configuration at the equilibrium. We also exhibit how an efficient energy-delivery trade-off can be met. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Radio communication; Routers; Wireless networks; Coalition formations; Coalitional game; Coordination frameworks; Delivery probabilities; Energy delivery; Extensive simulations; Incentive mechanism; Store and forward; Delay tolerant networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010030261

Batteries and Ultracapacitors (UC) are used as SD and the common DC-link is fed by alternative sources such as photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and fuel cells as well. The batteries are used to supply/absorb extra power in steady-state regime while the UC absorbs the power transients caused by variations on the power production or load connections. The proposed strategy uses as input for the batteries control only the DC-link voltage and state of charge (SOC), while for the UC only the DC-link voltage and UC terminal voltage are used to achieve the power sharing among the storage devices, equalization of the batteries and voltage restoration of the UC without HBC. The DC-link voltage is not restored in order to work as the sharing signal between storage devices. Additionally, the DC Microgrid is connected to the AC grid in order to deliver the extra power to the distributed system; however, the voltage variation on the DC-link does not affect the power quality of the produced energy.

To find the ideal places, the geographic and climatic circumstances for many regions worldwide were reviewed. After finding the places, the next objective was to determine the load curve for settlements with 10 000 inhabitants. In the next step, the energy production side was defined. The generation of power for the weather-dependent (solar, wind) and -independent (water, biogas) renewable sources was analyzed. In favour of the energy balance, the required storage capacities were analyzed. Most importantly, the electricity supply should be secured under any weather conditions.

We wish to increase the energy storage capacity, that is, the energy difference between the dihydroazulene and vinylheptafulvene isomers, of the photoswitch by computational molecular design and have performed over 9000 electronic structure calculations using density functional theory. Based on these calculations, we obtain design rules for how to increase the energy storage capacity of the photoswitch. Furthermore, we have investigated how the activation energy for the thermally induced vinylheptafulvene to dihydroazulene conversion depends on the substitution pattern, and based on these results, we have outlined molecular design considerations for obtaining new desired target structures exhibiting long energy storage times.

Important factors also include the methods used for conveyor belt storage. Long-term storage, which is not compliant with the applicable standards, contributes to the shortening of a belt's service life.

Especially in devices involving programmable processors, the energy consumption of integrated memories often plays a critical role. Consequently, contemporary memory technologies focus more on the energy-efficiency aspects with new custom CMOS SRAM cells with tailored energy consumption profiles constantly being proposed. This paper proposes a method that exploits such contemporary low power SRAM memories that are energy optimized for storing a certain logic value to improve the energy-efficiency of instruction fetching, a major energy overhead in programmable designs. The method utilizes a low overhead xor-masking approach combined with statistical program analysis to produce optimal masks to reduce the occurrence of the more energy consuming bit values in the fetched instructions. In comparison to the ""bus invert"" technique typically used with similar SRAMs, the proposed method incurs minimal area overhead while still reducing the total energy consumption of an example LatticeMico32 core up to 5%. The improvement to instruction memory energy consumption alone is up to 13% with a set of benchmarks. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Computation theory; Cost reduction; Energy utilization; Signal processing; Static random access storage; Ubiquitous computing; Energy overheads; Energy reduction; Instruction memory; Memory technology; Program analysis; Programmable processors; Total energy consumption; Ultra low power; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013157947

Data centres are the core of present information and communication economy. Since the early days of telecom's facilities, the operators' main challenges were the equipment placement, capacity planning, expansion, redundancy and availability of services, all these factors leading to power consumption inefficiencies. The evolution of Information and Communication Technology (ICT or IT&C) and cloud computing, increase the storage and processing capacity conduct to an exponential growth of Information Technology (IT) resources that have to be hosted and provide continuing operation. Beside of availability factor, the optimal utilization of the capacity and energy efficiency are the main characteristics of Data Centre facility. The overall efficiency of a data centre has to be precisely calculated to establish parameters of comparison, estimate environmental impact and to decide the specific measures for reducing energy consumption. The practical design, simulation and measurement have made it possible a comparison of efficiency parameters regarding energy consumption and IT utilization density. © 2016 IEEE.","data centre; energy efficiency; metrics","Computer aided software engineering; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Data centres; Energy efficiency assessment; Information and communication; Information and Communication Technologies; metrics; Processing capacities; Reducing energy consumption; Simulations and measurements; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010443374

The mechanic energy that is captured through the wind turbine (WT) is converted into electric energy by a generator, for example, permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). The synchronous generator provides energy, using a rectifier, in an electric accumulator (EA). Using classic mathematical models for the wind turbine, permanent magnet synchronous generator and the electric accumulator it has been proved be simulations that the WT + PMSG + EA system can operate in the optimal energy area regardless wind speed values if the generator's voltage level is properly chosen and the transformation ration (TR) corresponds to it. The electric system is self-regulating, adapting to the wind speed variation. By analyzing several cases, we were able to establish the basic values leading to optimum performance. © 2016 IEEE.","mechnical inertia; movement equation; optimum angular mechanical velocity; wind system","Electric generators; Magnets; Mathematical transformations; Permanent magnets; Synchronous generators; Wind; Wind effects; Wind power; Wind turbines; Electric accumulators; Mechanical velocity; mechnical inertia; Movement equations; Optimum performance; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; Wind speed variations; Wind systems; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010369768

To get benefit from the concept of dc micro grids, the problem of circulating currents among parallel energy sources must be solved. Due to very low resistance of dc micro grids, a voltage difference of few millivolts between two energy sources may cause one source to operate at full load while the other being idle.

They are a guarantee of food security for developing countries. The production of these crops and the transformation into food-derived commodities is increasing, it represents a profitable business and farmers generate substantial income from their market. However, there are some important concerns related to the food safety and food security. The high post-harvest losses, mainly for yam, the contamination by endogenous toxic compounds, mainly for cassava, and the contamination by external agents (such as micotoxins, pesticides, and heavy metal) represent a depletion of economic value and income. The loss in the raw crops or the impossibility to market the derived foodstuffs, due to incompliance with food regulations, can seriously limit all yam tubers and the cassava roots processors, from farmers to household, from small-medium to large enterprises. One of the greatest challenges to overcome those concerns is the transformation of traditional or indigenous processing methods into modern industrial operations, from the crop storage to the adequate package of each derived foodstuff. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cassava; food safety; food security; tropical crops; yam","Agriculture; Commerce; Crops; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Food safety; Food supply; Heavy metal compounds; Heavy metals; Nutrition; Tropics; Cassava; Food security; Indigenous processing methods; Industrial operations; Manihot esculenta Crantz; Nutritional value; Post-harvest loss; Tropical crops; Plants (botany); cyanide; heavy metal; mycotoxin; pesticide; analysis; catering service; chemistry; crop; food analysis; food contamination; food control; food safety; Manihot; nutritional value; yam; Crops, Agricultural; Cyanides; Dioscorea; Food Analysis; Food Contamination; Food Microbiology; Food Safety; Food Supply; Manihot; Metals, Heavy; Mycotoxins; Nutritive Value; Pesticides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983036078

Volt-VAR optimization (VVO) is a well-known problem to reduce the losses along the distribution lines. Current VVO does not endorse the role of elastic and inelastic loads, EVs, and RESs to decrease the reactive losses and hence the cost of generation. We propose a mathematical model VVCO/OECM to solve the VVO problem by considering load shifting, EV as storage, and use of RES. The system also admits the efficiency of the electrical equipment to enhance the life of the devices. We develop a non-cooperative game to solve the VVCO/OECM problem. To evaluate the performance, we simulate the VVCO/OECM model and compare with the existing VVO solution (VVCO). We found that our method took nearly a constant time to produce a solution of VVO despite the size of the network. It outperforms the existing VVO solution by reducing the generation cost and flatten the load. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Game theory; Problem solving; Renewable energy resources; Value engineering; Distribution lines; Electrical equipment; Generation cost; Integration of renewable energies; Noncooperative game; Reactive loss; Renewable energies; Residential loads; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010209426

Geological sequestration of CO2 involves risks and the capability to predict the response of a geologic system to variations in thermodynamic variables for short- and long-term situations is needed. We have utilized an existing CO2 hydrate reactive transport simulator, which incorporates a full kinetic description of competing hydrate phase transitions through Gibb's free energy minimization under the constraints of mass and heat flux. Hydrate formation from gas and liquid water and from water and dissolved hydrate formers was considered. Simulations were used to conduct sensitivity studies on some of the main reservoir parameters to understand which characteristics that appeared to have most impact on stability of CO2 storage in the form of hydrate. Hydrate formation was studied for various operational conditions of CO2 injection using a two-dimensional model reservoir. CO2 was injected into a structure consisting of two aquifer zones, one caprock zone, one fracture, and two injection wells. At this stage of the simulator, a fracture is modeled as a zone of very high porosity and permeability. It was found that porosity in the regions of hydrate stability varied linearly with respect to fracture porosity, matrix porosity, injection temperature, injection pressure and water saturation, within the studied ranges. However, porosity followed approximately a second-order polynomial with respect to fracture permeability. Our model was most sensitive to changes in the matrix porosity, whereas changes in temperature, within a realistic range, appeared to have small effects. Variations in either pure calcite or pure quartz only resulted in moderate effects on porosity. A geochemical mineral composition of equal amounts of calcite and quartz, however, appeared to result in substantial reduction in hydrate formation according to the samplings from the model studies.

One of the solar still is filled up with NJ zeolite beneath the basin liner surface of average grain-sized particles between 0.4 and 4 mm. The experimental results illustrated that adding the NJ zeolite beneath water basin and using a centrifugal fan working with photovoltaic solar panels become applicable in increasing the productivity of freshwater. The research was conducted for the range of zeolite mass starting from 500 to 1,500 g. It was found that the amount of zeolite played a major role toward increasing freshwater production.

Here, partition coefficients (K-factors) of organic solutes between water and supercritical carbon dioxide have been correlated with extended linear solvation energy relationships (LSERs). In addition to the Abraham molecular descriptors of the solutes, the explanatory variables also include the logarithm of solute vapor pressure, the solubility parameters of carbon dioxide and water, and the internal pressure of water. This is the first attempt to include also the properties of water as explanatory variables in LSER correlations of K-factor data in CO2−water−organic systems. Increasing values of the solute hydrogen bond acidity, the solute hydrogen bond basicity, the solute dipolarity/polarizability, the internal pressure of water and the solubility parameter of water all tend to reduce the K-factor, that is, to favor the solute partitioning to the water-rich phase.

The proposed EMS is based on the model predictive control (MPC) approach. The hybrid energy source consists of dispatchable; nondispatchable; and battery storage, which can work in both grid-connected and isolated modes. Moreover, the demand-side management is considered by the inclusion of deferrable and dump loads in the optimization problem. The uncertainties associated with renewable energy sources such as the wind speed and the solar irradiation as well as the demand power are taken into account. The optimization problem was formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear (MINL) programming framework with three objectives: (1) to minimize the total operating cost, (2) to minimize the pollutant gas emissions, and (3) to minimize the dump energy, especially in the isolated mode. The battery daily number of cycles (DNC), the minimum state of charge (SOC), and the initial SOC are considered as decision variables in the optimization problem which are optimally determined by the EMS to minimize the total system operating cost while considering all the practical performance and side constraints of the different energy sources. Four different case studies are considered to verify the proposed EMS system. The results show that the values of the optimal DNC, the minimum SOC, and the initial SOC of the BS, which depend on the pool price variation, have a significant effect on the total operation cost. © 2016 IEEE.","Energy management; optimization; predictive control; remote community","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Costs; Electric batteries; Electric utilities; Energy management; Gas emissions; Integer programming; Model predictive control; Operating costs; Optimization; Predictive control systems; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Wind; Different energy sources; Hybrid energy sources; Optimization problems; Predictive control; Programming framework; Remote communities; Renewable energy source; Total operation costs; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010629637

For reaching the widest possible audience, video service providers usually need to generate multiple video representations from the input stream suitable for different clients, which can increase the server-side energy consumption and processor load. HTTP streaming enables client adaptation against network fluctuations, but the server is usually unaware of the client(s) network capacity and device characteristics. With this knowledge, the server could control and allocate the encoding resources better according to the client(s) needs and reduce the server energy consumption and load. In this paper, we provide energy-aware dynamic encoding control for MPEG-DASH live streaming, which can benefit especially when representations are unpopular or network is under congestion. To achieve this, we utilize messages between client and encoding server based on the upcoming MPEG standard initiative Server and Network Assisted DASH (SAND). The results indicate that our dynamic encoding control signaling can reduce energy consumption in the server, create storage savings and therefore decrease also server costs. © 2016 University of Split, FESB.",,"Computer networks; Encoding (symbols); Energy utilization; HTTP; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Video streaming; Control signaling; Device characteristics; Http video streaming; Network Capacity; Network fluctuations; Reduce energy consumption; Video representations; Video service providers; Power management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010432759

Microgrids as an integral part of the power system, combine distributed energy sources, energy storage and load.

On-site solar thermal (ST) systems have the potential to reduce coal consumption in the boiler and to partly replace bagasse as a heating fuel. This paper, based on the heat and mass balance of a representative sugar mill with limited energy efficiency measures, identifies the most promising solar heat integration points and pre-ranks them according to their potential energetic and economic benefits. Hydraulic schemes to integrate solar heat into the processes are presented, system operation is discussed, and solar gains are calculated. The investigated opportunities for solar process heat (SPH) integration are the generation of live steam and exhaust steam, the pre-heating of boiler feed water, the drying of bagasse and raw sugar, and the heating of clear juice. Without additional thermal storage, ST systems can supply between 12 and 27 % of the heat demand of these processes. The estimated levelised costs of heat (LCOH) for the SPH systems range from 2.57 Eurocent/kWh (0.42 ZAR/kWh) for solar drying of raw sugar during the crushing season (CS) to 4.57 Eurocent/kWh (0.75 ZAR/kWh) for all-year solar live steam generation with concentrated solar power parabolic troughs. This study assumes that SPH has to compete with coal, which is the cheapest energy source, to replace bagasse. Using current coal prices and past price increase rates, the estimated achievable internal rate of return (IRR) for solar live steam generation is 4.6 % if the steam can be used during the whole year, e.g. for electricity export. The highest IRR of 9.1 % is expected for sugar drying during the crushing season, followed closely by solar drying of bagasse.","electricity export; Energy efficiency; Feasibility; Solar process heat; Sugar production","Bagasse; Boilers; Coal; Competition; Cost estimating; Crushing; Drying; Earnings; Heat storage; Solar dryers; Solar energy; Solar heating; Steam; Sugar factories; Sugar industry; Concentrated solar power; Cost competitiveness; Economic benefits; Efficiency measure; Electricity export; Feasibility; Internal rate of return; Solar process heats; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054583456

Samples were cured from the top at T-S distances of 2mm, 6mm and 10mm for 20 seconds. A MARC-Resin-Calibrator™ recorded the transmitted irradiance reaching the bottom of the sample, in real time. The VH was measured at the top and bottom after 24h of dark storage. Both the total light energy (TLE) transmitted through the samples and their VH ratios were reduced with increasing T-S distance. At 10mm T-S distance, the VH ratio values of samples cured with Bluephase G2 LCU were significantly greater than the samples cured with the other LCUs while the samples cured with Bluephase® 'turbo tip' showed the lowest values. It can be concluded that TLE transmitted through bulk-fill RBCs and their VH ratio reduces with increasing T-S distance but the rate of decline is LCU dependent.

The DFFs were designed and fabricated in a low-power commercial 65 nm bulk CMOS process and were tested using heavy ions with linear energy transfer (LET) between 5.1 MeV - cm2/mg and 99.1 MeV - cm2/mg. Results show an increasing SEU vulnerability with decreasing supply voltage, for most of the DFFs. Nevertheless, radiation tolerant topologies exhibit 14× to 1328× better SEU tolerance than a standard non-radiation tolerant DFF, depending on supply voltage and LET. The general observation is that at normal incidence, while taking the entire LET spectrum into account, the dual interlocked storage cell (DICE) DFF has the best SEU tolerance at supply voltages of 1 V and 0.5 V. At a supply voltage of 0.25 V, a temporal redundant DFF shows the best SEU tolerance, while the TMR DFF shows the best SEU tolerance at a supply voltage of 0.18 V. At supply voltages of 0.5 V and below, increasing the angle of incidence to 45 degrees can increase the SEU rate of the implemented DICE DFF by up to a factor of 22×, making it one of the most SEU sensitive DFFs. Furthermore, utilizing high drive strength components in temporally redundant DFFs can reduce the SEU sensitivity by a factor of 3× to 112×, compared to when standard drive strength components are used. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS); flip-flop; low power; radiation tolerant; single event transient (SET); single event upset (SEU); supply voltage","CMOS integrated circuits; Energy transfer; Fault tolerant computer systems; Heavy ions; Metals; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Radiation hardening; Redundancy; Transients; Complimentary metal oxide semiconductors; Low Power; Radiation tolerant; Single event transients; Single event upsets; Supply voltages; Flip flop circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027497961

This limit of battery lifetime is generally related to the intermittent operation conditions or the low quality of the manufacturing process. Among the processes involved in the manufacturing of lead acid battery, the formation process is a key stage in which the cured plate is converted into active mass such as lead dioxide (PbO2) in the positive electrode and spongy lead (Pb) in the negative electrode. During this process, the formation current profile should be taken into accounts the specific chemical processes that occur in the battery and reduces the gassing amount to increase the formation efficiency with minimum time. Methods: The goal of this work is to analyze the impact of the formation current profiles on the lead acid battery quality by adopting an approach based on the dependability analysis tools. This approach presents a functional study of the soaking and formation processes of lead acid battery with Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT). The detailed analyze of the lead acid battery degradation during the formation process is described by the Causal Tree Analysis (CTA). The limit of battery performances is generated by the low electrical penetration into the pores or the corrosion of the electrodes. Then, qualitative and quantitative analysis of the battery performance under the different formation profiles is given by analyze the gassing amount. Results: The results indicate that the multistep current profile ensures the high efficiency of formation with the minimum gassing energy compared to the other profiles. Conclusion: This profile allows avoiding the corrosion of electrode by overcharge in order to increase the battery performance and lifetime during the operation conditions. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.","Formation current profile; Gassing phenomena; Lead acid battery; Manufacturing","Chemical analysis; Corrosion; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Lead; Manufacture; Quality control; Secondary batteries; Current profile; Dependability analysis; Gassing phenomena; Intermittent operation; Manufacturing process; Operation conditions; Qualitative and quantitative analysis; Renewable energy applications; Lead acid batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013850783

The suggested control methodology involves load frequency control coordinated with battery energy storage systems. A recently developed meta-heuristic algorithm called multi-verse optimizer was applied to design an intelligent load frequency control scheme in the aim to handle the frequency fluctuation due to load changes and wind farm integration. The multi-verse optimizer algorithm was used to optimize the proportional–integral–derivative controller parameters for the load frequency control loop. The proposed controller was coordinated with two different kinds of storage system, which are redox flow batteries and electric vehicles. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, the simulation was performed under step load changes and then was extended with doubly-fed induction generator wind farm integration. Furthermore, to show the potential of multi-verse optimizer algorithm, a comparative study was done with other approaches available in the literature. In addition, robustness analysis was carried out. The obtained simulation results show that the proposed strategy is a very effective means for providing robust load frequency control controller and to avoid hybrid system instability. Furthermore, the system frequency can be improved using an optimal power management of the stored energy in both redox flow batteries and electric vehicles to compensate the load frequency control capability of the diesel groups, which allow to the possibility of integration of a large penetration of wind farms. In summary, the proposed control strategy may be helpful to identify the needed load frequency control capacity in the presence of dispersed generation’s units. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","doubly-fed induction generator wind farm; electric vehicles; load frequency control; Micro-grid; multi-verse optimizer; redox flow batteries; wind–diesel hybrid system","Asynchronous generators; Controllers; Electric batteries; Electric control equipment; Electric frequency control; Electric load management; Electric machine control; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Flow batteries; Heuristic algorithms; Hybrid systems; Integration; Optimization; Press load control; Secondary batteries; System stability; Vehicles; Wind power; Battery energy storage systems; Derivative controllers; Doubly fed induction generator wind farms; Frequency fluctuation; Load-frequency control; Meta heuristic algorithm; Micro grid; Optimizers; Electric power system control; algorithm; control system; design; diesel; electric vehicle; energy flow; wind farm",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009461439

The major concern, which the research community should be dealing with, is the limited and rather poor rechargeability of these systems. The challenges we are covering in this review are related to the initial limited discharge capacities and cell performances. By comprehensively reviewing the studies conducted so far, we show that the implementation of advanced materials is a promising approach to increase metal–air performance and, particularly, metal surface activation as a prime achievement leading to respectful discharge currents.

The options required to meet the targets are discussed, with particular emphasis on the necessity for CCS. The electrical sector in México is one of fast growth, with the installed capacity essentially doubling over the next 15 years. This growth has to be compatible with the commitments that the country has made to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. Sector's development strategy includes new technologies such as renewables, nuclear energy and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), in amounts larger than the minimum values established in the legislation. It is also concluded that CCS will be a necessity for Mexico. It is proposed that the energy policies to be established should be accompanied by industrial development policies, in order to maximize the participation of the Mexican Industry in the supply chain of the energy systems. © 2016 by De Gruyter 2016.","carbon capture and storage; energy planning; Mexican electrical sector","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Supply chains; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Development strategies; Electrical generation; Energy planning; Industrial development; Industry participations; Installed capacity; Mexican electrical sector; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999084671

Hydrogen produced via water electrolysis has been identified as one of the most promising means to help achieve this goal, especially by enabling energy storage in a sustainable and non-polluting way. In recent years, this situation has triggered novel developments in water electrolysis technologies and patenting of new inventions. Objective: The aim of this work is to review the state-of-the-art in hydrogen production from water electrolysis using a patent search and analysis. The paper also reviews, in brief, some relevant patents on water electrolysis technologies. Method: The patent search was carried out on the European Espacenet database. The research method was based on the use of keywords and subsequent content analysis. Patent data was discussed and analyzed in terms of production technology, year of publication, geographical area of the holder and applicant type. Results: A total of 103 patent documents were identified, most of them (75%) reporting developments on conventional water electrolysis technologies. Patents on emergent technologies were mostly granted after 2005. Global research effort was mainly supported by academia both in Europe and the US. Industry played an important role in Japan. Conclusion: Patent data suggests that water electrolysis technologies are either in their early stages of growth (High Steam Temperature Electrolysis, High Pressure Electrolysis) or in a phase of growth/maturity (Alkaline Electrolysis, Solid Polymer Electrolysis) with novel developments still needed and more patents foreseen in the future. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.","Alkaline electrolysis; Electrolysers; Hydrogen production; Patent analysis; Sustainable; Water electrolysis","Digital storage; Electrolysis; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Patents and inventions; Renewable energy resources; Alkaline electrolysis; Electrolysers; Patent analysis; Sustainable; Water electrolysis; Hydrogen production",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995961508

Consequently, a nitrogen deficiency results in carbon excess. For the first time, the biological adaptation of Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 to nitrogen starvation has been deeply characterized at the cellular structure scale. The results indicated that the carbon excess is rerouted into carbon storage granules, such as the polyhydroxyalkanoate and glycogen granules corroborating existing data. Additionally, this photosynthetic organism hugely secreted exopolysaccharides, which could constitute another biological carbon reservoir. It has been reported that few cells in trichomes of Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 still display a high level of fluorescence after a long-term nitrogen starvation.

Different FOS mixtures were enzymatically obtained from sucrose and further purified by removing the monosaccharides produced as secondary products. Their glass transition temperatures (Tg) were determined at 11, 22 and 33% relative humidity (RH). Bacterial cultures were freeze-dried in the presence of 20% w/v solutions of the studied FOS. Their protective effect during freeze-drying was assessed by bacterial plate counting, and by determining the lag time from growth kinetics and the uptake of propidium iodide (PI). Plate counting during bacterial storage at 4 °C, and 11, 22 and 33% RH for 80 days completed this rational analysis of the protective effect of FOS. Purification of FOS led to an increase of Tg in all the conditions assayed. Microorganisms freeze-dried in the presence of non-purified FOS were those with the shortest lag times. Bacteria freeze-dried with pure or commercial FOS (92% of total FOS) showed larger lag times (8.9–12.6 h). The cultivability of microorganisms freeze-dried with non-purified FOS and with sucrose was not significantly different from that of bacteria before freeze-drying (8.74 ± 0.14 log CFU/mL). Pure or commercial FOS were less efficient in protecting bacteria during freeze-drying. All the protectants prevented membrane damage. The cultivability of bacteria freeze-dried with FOS decayed &lt; 1 logarithmic unit after 80 days of storage at 11% RH. When storing at 22 and 33% RH, pure and commercial FOS were those that best protected bacteria, and FOS containing monosaccharides were less efficient. The effect of FOS on bacterial protection is the result of a balance between monosaccharides, sucrose and larger FOS in the mixtures: the smallest sugars are more efficient in protecting lipid membranes, and the larger ones favor the formation of vitreous states. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Freeze-drying; Fructo-oligosaccharides mixtures; Lactobacilli; Protective effect; Storage; Vitreous transition temperature","Bacteria; Drying; Energy storage; Food storage; Glass transition; Glucose; Growth kinetics; Low temperature drying; Microorganisms; Mixtures; Oligosaccharides; Purification; Sugar (sucrose); Temperature; Bacterial cultures; Freeze drying; Fructo-oligosaccharides; Lactobacilli; Lactobacillus delbrueckii; Protective effects; Rational analysis; Stabilizing agents; Food additives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994449417

The photovoltaic electricity is firstly converted into heat that subsequently is used for nuclear steam superheating. The hybrid plant is equipped with thermal energy storage. The storage technology under evaluation in this study is borrowed by the concentrated solar power plants. When photovoltaic electricity is available, electric heaters heat molten salts. The steam that is generated in a small modular nuclear reactor is heated with hot molten salts in the external superheater. The hybrid plants and its PV section are modelled and simulated with appropriate software tools. As a result of the higher turbine inlet temperature, the hybrid configuration is more efficient than ordinary NPP. The efficiency of the hybrid nuclear plant can be considerably increased up to the effectiveness level of the modern thermal power plants. The additional power generated by the PV-nuclear plant is approaching the capacity of the standalone NPP. The integrated thermal storage acts as indirect and large electricity storage.

The authors propose a combined design and control optimization that takes intermittent renewable energy sources into account and adds two steps to the literature. First is the use of multiple temperature levels, which allows a more realistic representation of energy storage and conversion efficiencies. Second is the explicit inclusion of a simplified representation of the electricity generation side, which allows quantifying the value of flexible electricity demand. The proposed modeling framework is applied to nine scenarios for the electricity generation mix in Belgium. The results indicate that a hot water storage tank is not an attractive technology in the presented scenarios, altering the CO2 emissions less than 0.05 ton per building per year. This lowers the added value of modeling the temperature levels. The combination with the electricity generation system allows for a thorough assessment of the CO2 emissions. Within the boundary conditions of the case study, combining an air coupled heat pump, floor heating and PV panels reduces yearly CO2 emission up to 2 ton per building for an increase in annual cost below 350 EUR. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Control optimization; Design optimization; Heating system; Renewable energy; Residential buildings","Carbon dioxide; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Heat pump systems; Heating equipment; Housing; Natural resources; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Control optimization; Design optimization; Heating system; Renewable energies; Residential building; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992491032

The first reaction step was the acylation of tryptamine leading to the corresponding acyltryptamines, followed by a ring-closure step affording the tricyclic target molecules. In the present paper, possible mechanisms are proposed for the acylation of tryptamine with benzoic acid and for the closure of the β-carboline ring, including a detailed discussion of the effect of the T3P® reagent. In order to compare the innovative T3P®-promoted method with the traditional POCl3-promoted one, mechanistic computations have been performed for both methods. The computed mechanistic pathways explain why less than two equivalents of the T3P® reagent are sufficient for the two consecutive reaction steps and a parallelism is shown between the energetics of the T3P®-disruption and the biological energy storage of ATP. It can also be understood, why a higher temperature and a longer reaction time are required for the T3P®-promoted synthesis.

In this context, this work aims to elucidate whether TGF-β and Smad-dependent or Smad-independent signaling pathways contribute to regional differentiation of AT in high-fat diet (HFD) and energy-restricted (ER) rat models. For this, TGF-β, TGF-β receptors I and II, PAI-1 and GLUT4 mRNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR, and western blotting assays allowed the semiquantification of TGF-β and proteins from Smad3, ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways in subcutaneous and visceral (epididymal, retroperitoneal and mesenteric) fat depots from control, HFD and ER-treated rats. HFD was associated to increased levels of TGF-β and PAI-1 mRNA in epididymal and retroperitoneal visceral fat depots, while ER diet induced a reduction of TGF-β mRNA levels in mesenteric, but surprisingly an increase in retroperitoneal fat. Regarding the different signaling pathways, contrarily to what was found for Smad3, activation of ERK1/2 and Akt in response to HFD was detected in all the visceral but not in subcutaneous fat depots. ER-treated rats presented a more heterogeneous signaling response, as well as decreased TGF-β receptors expression, in the different visceral fat depots. In conclusion, subcutaneous and visceral AT respond differently to distinct diet patterns regarding TGF-β expression and activated signaling pathways. Furthermore, the present study points that visceral AT should not be understood as a homogeneous entity since that response also varied in the different fat depots. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Adipose tissue; Energy restriction; High-fat diet; Obesity; Signaling pathways; Transforming growth factor beta","glucose transporter 4; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; protein kinase B; Smad protein; Smad3 protein; transforming growth factor beta; transforming growth factor beta receptor 1; transforming growth factor beta receptor 2; Akt1 protein, rat; fish oil; lard; protein kinase B; protein serine threonine kinase; TGF-beta type I receptor; Tgfb1 protein, rat; transforming growth factor beta receptor; transforming growth factor beta1; transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; caloric restriction; controlled study; epididymis fat; intraperitoneal fat; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; mesenteric fat; nonhuman; protein analysis; protein expression; protein folding; protein phosphorylation; protein secretion; rat; retroperitoneal fat; signal transduction; subcutaneous fat; weight gain; animal; antibody specificity; fat intake; gene expression regulation; genetics; intraabdominal fat; lipid diet; low fat diet; metabolism; obesity; pathology; randomization; reproducibility; Sprague Dawley rat; Adiposity; Animals; Diet, Fat-Restricted; Diet, High-Fat; Dietary Fats; Fish Oils; Gene Expression Regulation; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Male; Obesity; Organ Specificity; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Random Allocation; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta; Reproducibility of Results; Signal Transduction; Subcutaneous Fat; Transforming Growth Factor beta1",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991503722

The technical constraints introduced by diesel-generators along with the high cost of storage options confine the penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) in these systems. This paper examines the possibility of utilizing a RES-hybrid system for a small Greek island by exploring three different case scenarios. The first two include system configurations with gradual conventional fossil-fuel power reduction while in the third one we investigate if a nearly 100% renewable system is feasible. Techno-economic analyses ensure the technical feasibility of the systems and address their economic viability. Results showed that the conventional fossil-fuel power required for the first and the second scenario could be decreased 52% and 74% compared to the existing system and the system's overall by 17% and 26% respectively. RES-penetration reached 68% (first-scenario) and 74% (second-scenario) while the NPC value was calculated to 1.84 and 2.25 million euro respectively. A nearly 100% renewable energy system (third scenario) could be technically feasible but it would require the installation of enormous RES equipment capacity dramatically increasing the total cost.

In this paper, we study numerically the contribution of phase change materials (PCMs) for solar thermal energy storage (TES) in buildings. The studied configuration is a plane solar collector incorporating a PCM layer and coupled to a concrete slab (a roof of a building). The study is conducted for Casablanca (Morocco) meteorological conditions. Several simulations were performed to optimize the melting temperature and the PCM layer thickness. The results show that PCM imposes, on the roof, a temperature close to its melting temperature. The choice of a melting temperature Tmelt22 C (the local indoor temperature Tc is fixed as Tc22 C) limits the losses through the concrete slab, considerably. This last seems to be, nearly, adiabatic, in this case. Also, the energy released by PCM solidification, overnight, increases the outlet temperature of the coolant fluid to 35 C and the useful flux to 80 W/m2, increasing the efficiency of the solar collector by night. The PCM functioned both as an energy storage material for the stabilization of the coolant fluid temperature and as an insulating material for the building.

A recent techno-economic study found that packed rock bed thermal storage systems can be constructed with capital costs of less than 10 United States dollar (USD)/kWht, significantly cheaper than the two-tank molten salt thermal storage currently used in CSP plants (about 22-30 USD/kWht). However, little work has been published on determining optimum rock bed design parameters in the context of a CSP plant. The parametric study in this paper is intended to provide an overview of the bed flow lengths, particle sizes, mass fluxes, and Biot numbers which are expected to minimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for a central receiver CSP plant with a nominal storage capacity of 12 h. The findings show that rock diameters of 20-25 mm will usually give LCOE values at or very close to the minimum LCOE for the combined rock bed and CSP plant. Biot numbers between 0.1 and 0.2 are shown to have little influence on the position of the optimum (with respect to particle diameter) for all practical purposes. Optimum bed lengths are dependent on the Biot number and range between 3 and 10 m for a particle diameter of 20 mm.

High shares of solar PV (photovoltaics) were deemed to be feasible at extreme northern latitudes when supported by flexibility harnessed from other aspects of the energy system, suggesting that high variations in solar irradiation throughout the year may not be a barrier to the implementation of solar PV closer to the poles. A 100% RE system corresponds to a highly competitive cost solution for Finland, as total system costs decrease through interaction between the power, heating/cooling and mobility sectors. We incorporate these sectors on an hourly resolution using historical data and the EnergyPLAN modelling tool. In addition, we offer full transparency of all assumptions regarding the Finnish energy system. In 2050, a 100% renewable energy scenario has the lowest overall annual cost, at 24.1 b€/a. This is followed by several scenarios that feature increasing levels of nuclear power, which range in annual costs to 26.4 b€/a. Scenarios were also modelled with varying levels of forest-based biomass. Results suggest that annual costs do not increase dramatically with reduced levels of forest-based biomass fuel use. At the same time, it must be kept in mind that assigning costs to the future is inherently uncertain. How future societies assign risk to technologies or place value on emissions can make the scenarios under investigation more or less attractive. The 100% RE scenarios under investigation were seen as less exposed to such uncertainty. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy storage; Energy system analysis; Finland; Power-to-Gas; Renewable energy","Costs; Digital storage; Energy storage; Forestry; Nuclear fuels; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Competitive costs; Energy system analysis; Feasibility analysis; Finland; Northern latitudes; Power to gas; Renewable energies; Solar irradiation; Risk perception",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983534999

The optimal sizing of these components for applying the method was found for different wind conditions. The results of simulations with high temporal resolution data and experiments showed that the proposed system is able to shave stochastic power peaks and shift electrical loads.

However, processing promotes a decrease in fruits stability with faster physiological and microbiological deteriorations. Food stability is strongly attributed to its molecular dynamics and “water availability”. Understanding changes in water location/mobility is of utmost importance, since water dynamics profoundly influences physic-chemical and microbiological quality of foods. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a methodology used to study the food constituents' molecular dynamics. The aim of this study is to use NMR to evaluate changes in water mobility that occurred in fresh-cut pear tissues during storage, by measuring the transverse relaxation time (T2) parameter. Results showed the existence of three water classes in the cells after processing, with T2 values of 10 ms, 187 ms and 3s for cellular wall, cytoplasm and vacuole, respectively. Also, the obtained results demonstrated that T2 was affected by processing and storage. Moreover, a relationship between T2, microstructure and the quality parameters was established. T2, maximum value increased with pear hardness as well as water activity. On the contrary, a decrease in total colour difference (TCD) was found with T2.

The ERS is connected to the dc-link of the elevator motor drive through a bidirectional dc-dc converter for storing and then recovering the braking energy. A system of two fuzzy-logic controllers is introduced for online adjusting the dc-link voltage through the dc-dc converter of the ERS, according to the elevator operating conditions and the ac-grid voltage variations. Thus, the reduction in the consumed energy by the grid in an elevator operating cycle and, therefore, increase in the elevator system efficiency is achieved. Also, the developed control system keeps the SCs current ripple low in order to protect the SCs from overheating and, therefore, preserves their energy storage capability and operating lifetime. The proposed control scheme can be easily installed without requiring modifications to the elevator motor drive and, thus, it can be applied to any elevator system, even existing elevator installations. The effectiveness and the resulting operational improvements of the proposed control scheme have been experimentally validated on a real elevator system. © 2016 IEEE.","Braking energy; control system; elevator motor drive; energy storage; supercapacitor","Braking; Control systems; DC-DC converters; Electric drives; Electric inverters; Electric motors; Elevators; Energy storage; Fuzzy logic; Power converters; Predictive control systems; Recovery; Bidirectional DC-DC converters; Braking energy; Elevator installation; Energy recovery system; Fuzzy logic controllers; Motor drive; Operational improvements; Super capacitor; Traction motors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978634464

By tradition, the target of the demand side response is to shift the loads from high price or peak-load periods to low price or low consumption periods. The economic effect is derived from reduced energy purchasing costs. This paper focuses on the possibility to provide demand side response for a wind park through direct cooperation by means of reduced production forecast errors. These errors are costly, as in open electricity market, overproduction is usually sold at a lower price and in underproduction it is required to purchase balancing energy from an electricity market. Forecasting errors always occur, as a forecast consists of wind speed predictions and does not take into account unexpected stops. Demand side response will reduce the imbalance between forecasted and actual production in wind parks. Direct cooperation between a response provider and a wind park is complex, as the forecast errors will define the need for the demand side response. For that reason, it is required to analyze wind park forecast errors in order to define the requirements for the demand side response capacity and an energy storage size. On the other hand, the solution proposed in this paper has benefits, as a demand side response provider does not need to participate in energy market. From that fact electricity market requirements are not applicable, as an example there is no need to have certain capacity available to participate in market. © 2016 IEEE.","demand response; energy storage; forecasting; wind farms","Commerce; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric industry; Energy storage; Engineering education; Errors; Power markets; Wind; Wind power; Demand response; Demand side response; Forecasting error; Market requirements; Open electricity markets; Reduced production; Wind farm; Wind speed prediction; Forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010053510

The mix proportions of LWC were designed using Taguchi method. L9 orthogonal array with four factors viz., water/cement (W/C) ratio, water content, PCMPC content and sand/cement (S/C) ratio were selected for the optimization of LWC. The most important factors influencing the properties of LWC were investigated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Based on the results, the phase transition and latent heat of PCMPC showed good thermally reliable and chemically stability after thermal cycling test. The density and compressive strength of samples containing the PCMPC were in the range of 1711–1812 kg/m3 and 33–53 MPa, respectively. The density and compressive strength of samples can meet the requirement of lightweight concrete for structure application according to ASTM C330/C330M-14. The results also showed that PCMPC was the most significant factor for heat storage coefficient. The thermal energy absorption and release characteristics of LWC containing PCMPC were significantly better than those of the control sample.

Some of the households own renewable energy systems and energy storage systems (ESS) and sell the excess renewable energy to the residences that need electrical energy. The proposed strategy comprises methods that provide benefits for the residential electricity users and for the load aggregator. Specifically, we propose an off-line algorithm that schedules the renewable resources integration by trading energy between the renewable energy producers and buyers. Moreover, we propose a geometric programming based optimization method that uses the ESS for balancing the community's power grid load and for reducing the grid consumption cost. Simulations show that the proposed method may lead to a community's grid consumption cost reduction of 10.5%. It may also achieve balanced load profiles with peak to average ratio (PAR) close to unity, the average PAR reduction being 52%. © 2016 IEEE.","Demand response; Geometric programming; Load balancing; Optimization; Renewable energy; Smart grids","Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Housing; Mathematical programming; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Resource allocation; Signal processing; Demand response; Geometric programming; Peak to average ratios; Renewable energies; Renewable energy integrations; Renewable energy systems; Residential electricity; Smart grid; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85005950867

In the polyoxometalate-based photocatalytic systems proposed in the past, middle/near UV light irradiation and noble-metal catalysts were mainly used. Although recently polyoxometalates were sensitized in visible light, photosensitizers or catalysts based on noble metals, and/or poor activity of polyoxometalates were generally obtained. Here we show the highly efficient [turnover number (TON)=215] hydrogen evolution induced by the zinc(II) mesotetrakis(N-methyl-pyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin (ZnTMPyP4+) sensitization of a series of polyoxometalate catalysts (two Dawson type, P2Mo18O62 6− and P2W18O62 6− anions, and one Keplerate {Mo132} cluster) in a visible-light-driven, noble-metal-free, and fully water-soluble system. We attributed the high efficiency for hydrogen evolution to the multi-electron reduction of polyoxometalates and found that: (a) both Dawson polyoxometalates exhibit higher hydrogen evolution efficiency upon ZnTMPyP4+ sensitization in relation to the direct photoreduction of those compounds; (b) the P2Mo18O62 6− anion is more efficient (TON=65 vs. 38, respectively) for hydrogen evolution than the P2W18O62 6− anion; and (c) the high nuclearity Keplerate {Mo132} cluster exhibits the highest efficiency (TON=215) for hydrogen evolution compared with the polyoxometalates studied. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This study focused on the development of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system sizing application with battery storage that is applicable for all major locations in Zimbabwe. The developed system was applicable for sizing backup systems as well as remote homes in rural areas where access to grid electricity is difficult. In designing the solar system sizing application, a database was integrated with a Visual Basic 6.0 program. The information contained in the integrated database was based on 30 locations in Zimbabwe. Information relating to each of the geographical locations such as average peak sunshine hours values, latitude as well as the insolation values of each place was also included in the code. The sizing procedure consisted of the total load calculation followed by the determination of the solar array size, the tilt angle, inverter size and the charge controller. The load requirements at night were also determined and hence the battery bank was calculated. The application goes ahead to perform a cost analysis in order to determine the average cost per kWh of the generated electricity as well as determine the overall cost of the installation. Results showed that the sizing system developed was able to reduce overdesign installation costs due to generic designs by at least 6%, power losses due to nonoptimal tilt angle by 8% and solar system design time by 85%. © 2016 IEEE.","optimization; Renewable energy; solar energy; system sizing; tilt angle","Application programs; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric batteries; Energy policy; Location; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Secondary batteries; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar system; Visual BASIC; Electricity supply; Geographical locations; Installation costs; Integrated database; Renewable energies; Solar photovoltaic system; System sizings; Tilt angle; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006812938

As a result of this planning there is an energy flow command issued from the level of microgrid energy flows optimization towards the management systems of individual energy storages in the microgrid. As the energy flow command can be achieved by different control sequences on the management level of the storage unit, there is a need to assess the optimal control sequence for the energy storage as well as to see how the alternative, simplified approaches to realize the energy flow command perform in comparison. In this work we focus on the battery management system that is subordinated to the microgrid energy flow optimization and compare the approaches of the optimal battery current, constant current and constant power, whereas the optimality is formulated with respect to residual state of charge available after the energy flow command is realized on the battery. On a selected example of valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) battery we show that these approaches to battery management yield comparable results which suggests that the mentioned simplified approaches are quite near to the optimal ones with respect to the amount of residual state of charge. We further show how the dynamical model of the optimally managed battery looks like for the case of battery representation via a hybrid electrical model. © 2016 IEEE.","battery management system; energy flow optimization; hybrid electrical model; microgrid; state of charge","Charging (batteries); Electric batteries; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Lead acid batteries; Motion control; Power control; Power electronics; Secondary batteries; Storage management; Battery Management; Electrical modeling; Energy flow; Energy storage unit; Micro grid; Microgrid operations; State of charge; Valve-regulated lead-acid batteries; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008255151

The BESS in such a system can have a significant role in covering the power fluctuations in the network. The BESS can cover the power unbalance between the supplied power and the load of the grid by storing the excess energy or supplying the residual demand. An advantage of implementing the BESS is faster provision of power compared to the DGs which can also help improve a system stability. In this paper, the influence of BESS is analyzed by conducting Generation Adequacy analysis and Transient Stability studies using DIgSILENT Power Factory software. Generation Adequacy analysis is carried out using Monte Carlo simulation technique. Typical factors such as Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) and Expected Demand Not Supplied (EDNS) are calculated. Furthermore, the size of BESS required to cover for the intermittent nature of renewables is determined. Dynamic models of DGs, WTG, PV and BESS are developed for the purpose of transient stability studies. Contingencies such as three phase fault, tripping of DG and cloud covering PV field are simulated with and without BESS in order to clearly determine its influence on system stability. © 2016 IEEE.","Battery Energy Storage System; Generation Adequacy; Hybrid Grid; Micro Grid; Photovoltaic; System Stability; Wind Turbine","Electric batteries; Electric power system stability; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Intelligent systems; Loss of load probability; Monte Carlo methods; Turbogenerators; Wind turbines; Battery energy storage systems; Generation adequacy; Hybrid grids; Micro grid; Photovoltaic; System stability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006427829

Due to the dependence of such systems on the weather conditions the electricity injected into the grid is intermittent in nature with potentially negative impact on the grid operation. The quality and quantity of the electrical power produced from solar systems is directly related to the available solar irradiance and therefore any disturbances to the latter affect the produced power. In this paper, the characterisation and classification of the daily solar irradiance from 12 locations in mainland USA is presented based on 4 years of ground measurements. The K-POP method used evaluates the quantity and quality of solar irradiance for a day and as a consequence classifies the day based on these two indices. The statistical analysis of the results shows high correlation through the years for each station. This is a strong indication that the sky conditions are predictable and that with the utilisation of mechanisms, such as storage, spinning reserve, etc. solar systems can become a major contributor to the energy mix. Finally, this analysis provides better insight into the solar resource of a given location. © 2016 IEEE.","clearness index; probability of persistence; sky conditions","Meteorology; Organic pollutants; Solar radiation; Solar system; Clearness indices; Electrical power; Grid operation; Ground measurements; Sky condition; Solar irradiances; Solar resources; Spinning reserves; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003601741

Whether etched top-down, or grown from catalyst nanoparticles bottom-up, nanowire growth relies on heterogeneous material seeds. Converting surface oxide films, ubiquitous in the microelectronics industry, to nanowires and nanowire networks by the incorporation of extra species through interdiffusion can provide an alternative deposition method. It is shown that solution-processed thin films of oxides can be converted and recrystallized into nanowires and networks of nanowires by solid-state interdiffusion of ionic species from a mechanically contacted donor substrate. NaVO3 nanowire networks on smooth Si/SiO2 and granular fluorine-doped tin oxide surfaces can be formed by low-temperature annealing of a Na diffusion species-containing donor glass to a solution-processed V2O5 thin film, where recrystallization drives nanowire growth according to the crystal habit of the new oxide phase.

Our major finding is that we suggest a market-based approach to ensure that competitive forces rather than governmental interferences as capacity mechanisms shape the future of the energy system. The major conclusions of this analysis are: The transition towards a competitive and sustainable future electricity system will be based on an approach of “new thinking” which is to accept a paradigm shift in the whole electricity system.

One important inconvenience of these technologies is their intermittency of power generation. This variability of energy production leads to an increased need of services such as reliability, regulation and transmission congestion. In order to make the electric grid reliable and efficient, system operators have to deploy cost-effective ways to balance supply and demand in real time. Energy storage is considered a viable solution and can mitigate several problems. However, it is still unclear whether or not energy storage will generate enough profit by interacting with energy and ancillary markets. Current economic studies on the energy storage technologies are limited because they do not explore possibilities of using storage in arbitrage and ancillary services in both day-ahead and real time markets. This paper focuses on the economics of energy storage participating in arbitrage and regulation services within different markets.

A convenient “top-down” process was proposed to obtain nanoparticle products of tetragonal barium titanate (BaTiO3) with highly accurate stoichiometry and morphological control. The key point of this work emphasized that a micrometer-sized precursor decreases to nanometer-sized product particles, and its irregular shape changes to nearly spherical with narrow size distribution. Both XRD and Raman results of BaTiO3 nanoparticles indicated a tetragonal crystal structure. The 77.5 ± 2.5 nm sized BaTiO3 powder product still polarized spontaneously at room temperature and the ferroelectric phase transition was confirmed at around 127 °C. Dielectric permittivity was found to be ~ 166.42 by Landauer-Bruggeman effective medium approximation (LB-RMA). Experimental procedures revealed a possible process mechanism observed within the etched surface and Oriented-attachment growth models, and this demonstrated approach could be used as an excellent platform for preparing ceramic nanoparticles. It also could be extended to synthesize complex oxide of functional materials for the preparation of other ceramic/polymer-based nanocomposites that achieve desirable properties. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Barium titanate; Dielectric materials; Ferroelectric materials; Nanoparticles; Surface active etching","Barium; Barium compounds; Barium titanate; Ceramic materials; Crystal structure; Dielectric materials; Etching; Ferroelectricity; Functional materials; Micrometers; Nanoparticles; Permittivity; Titanium compounds; Bruggeman effective medium approximation; Dielectric permittivities; Energy storage applications; Ferroelectric phase transition; Narrow size distributions; Surface active; Tetragonal barium titanate; Tetragonal crystal structure; Ferroelectric materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980360896

Alternative production systems are therefore sought to improve the sustainability of pig production. A promising alternative is to use proteinaceous feed from grass, produced in a green bio-refinery (GBR), to substitute part of the cereals in the feed. Cultivation of grass on arable land can reduce nitrogen leaching and pesticide application, and increase carbon storage. The GBR using grass as feedstock also produces valuable byproducts, e.g. fibre and biogas. In this study we combine a life-cycle analysis (LCA) and a cost-benefit analysis to compare the economic and environmental effects of producing the pig feed to produce 1 ton of pork using two feeding systems. We apply this approach to the intensive Danish pork production as a case study. The results show that compared with traditional cereal-based feeding system for producing a ton of pork, using proteinaceous concentrate from small-scale GBR will (1) decrease the average feed cost by 5.01%; (2) produce a profit of 96 € before tax in the GBR; and (3) decrease the nitrogen leaching (NO3-N) by 28.2%. However, in most of the scenarios (except for G2), the nitrogen emissions into the air (N2O-N) will also increase because of the increased N fertilizer application compared to a cereal-based system. In most of the scenarios (except for S1 and G1), the energy and land use will also be saved. However, some important factors, e.g. the soil characteristics, pressed juice fraction in fresh biomass and scale of GBR, could subvert the conclusion about energy and land use saving in the alternative feeding system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biotechnology; Cost-benefit analysis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Nitrogen leaching; Proteinaceous feed; Sustainable agriculture","Agriculture; Biotechnology; Byproducts; Carbon; Costs; Cultivation; Economic analysis; Economics; Feeding; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Leaching; Life cycle; Mammals; Materials handling equipment; Meats; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Sustainable development; Alternative production systems; Life cycle analysis; Nitrogen emissions; Nitrogen leaching; Pesticide applications; Soil characteristics; Sustainable agricultural; Sustainable agriculture; Cost benefit analysis; fertilizer; nitrogen; alternative agriculture; biotechnology; carbon emission; cost-benefit analysis; environmental effect; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; livestock farming; nitrogen; sustainability; agricultural management; animal food; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; cereal; cost benefit analysis; economic evaluation; environmental factor; green biorefinery; herd; leaching; life cycle assessment; pig; pork; priority journal; soil; uncertainty; analysis; animal; animal husbandry; cost benefit analysis; Denmark; economics; pig; procedures; Suidae; Animal Feed; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Denmark; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979233753

This paper assesses the use of fast charging stations for EVs in conjunction with VRFBs (Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries). These batteries are charged during low electricity demand periods and then supply electricity for the fast charging of EVs during day, thus implementing a power peak shaving process. Flow batteries have unique characteristics which make them especially attractive when compared with conventional batteries, such as their ability to decouple rated power from rated capacity, as well as their greater design flexibility and nearly unlimited life. Moreover, their liquid nature allows their installation inside deactivated underground gas tanks located at gas stations, enabling a smooth transition of gas stations' business model towards the emerging electric mobility paradigm. A project of a VRFB system to fast charge EVs taking advantage of existing gas stations infrastructures is presented. An energy and cost analysis of this concept is performed, which shows that, for the conditions tested, the project is technologically and economically viable, although being highly sensitive to the investment costs and to the electricity market conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle; Energy storage; Fast charging; Flow battery; Peak shaving; Vanadium Redox Flow Battery","Battery electric vehicles; Cost benefit analysis; Economics; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Flow batteries; Gases; Investments; Secondary batteries; Vanadium; Vehicles; Conventional batteries; Economically viable; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity demands; Fast charging; Fast charging stations; Peak shaving; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Charging (batteries); cost analysis; demand analysis; electric vehicle; electricity supply; energy conservation; equipment component; investment; market conditions; redox conditions; vanadium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961262565

Secure communication mechanisms in WSNs have been widely deployed to ensure confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of exchanging data. The authentication is- sue related to such networks has become a crucial service because the nodes are typically deployed in an unattended environment leaving them open to attack. Moreover, this is due to the resource-constrained nature of the sensor nodes, which are limited in computing power, data storage and communication capabilities. Any authentication protocol must be designed to operate efficiently in a resource con- strained environment. In this paper, we propose an efficient trust-ticket based authentication protocol for multi-domain applications in WSNs. Through the security analysis, we demonstrate the robustness of our protocol against some well known attacks. Moreover, we perform an overall eval- uation of our protocol through simulations in function of the network size, where we consider two scenarios accord- ing to the trusted authority number. The simulation results highlight the advantages of our protocol in terms of energy consumption. © 2016 ACM.","Authentication; IBE; Public-key; Security; Trust-ticket; WSNs","Authentication; Big data; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Network security; Sensor nodes; Wireless telecommunication systems; Authentication protocols; Communication capabilities; Communication mechanisms; Public keys; Security; Trust-ticket; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); WSNs; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015032716

Furthermore, with high penetration levels of photovoltaic energy sources being integrated into the current electric power grid, the performance of the conventional synchronous generators is being changed and grid inertial response is deteriorating. This paper proposes a combined virtual inertia emulator (VIE) and a hybrid battery-supercapacitor-based energy storage system for enhancing the stability of the Microgrids and smoothing the short-term power fluctuations simultaneously. Not only could the suggested system overcome the slow response of battery system (including dynamics of battery, controller, and converter operation) by redirecting the power surges to the supercapacitor system, but also enhance the inertial response by emulating the kinetic inertia of synchronous generator. Control systems for the VIE and battery-supercapacitor storage system are presented in this paper. Correspondingly simulation results are discussed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. In this paper, Matlab Simulink software has been considered to develop control designs of VIE and Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS). Through these studies, it will be demonstrated that the recommended method is capable of achieving voltage and frequency regulation and effective management of the hybrid storage system. Since the suggested technique focuses on short-term fluctuations and includes no long-term power regulation, it needs no mass storage device. Thus, the method is economical.

However, the wide-scale application of high-energy SCs using ILs is limited owing to a serious reduction of the energy with increasing power. The introduction of macropores to the porous material can mitigate the reduction in the gravimetric capacitance at high rates, but this lowers the volumetric capacitance. Synthetic polymers can be used to obtain macroporous frameworks with high apparent densities, but the preservation of the frameworks during activation is challenging. To simultaneously achieve high gravimetric capacitance, volumetric capacitance, and rate capability, a systematic strategy was used to synthesize a densely knitted carbon framework with a hierarchical pore structure by using a polymer. The energy of the SC using the hierarchically porous carbon was 160 Wh kg−1 and 85 Wh L−1 on an active material base at a power of 100 W kg−1 in an IL electrolyte, and 60 % of the energy was still retained at a power larger than 5000 W kg−1. To illustrate, a full-packaged SC with the material could store/release energy comparable to a Ni–metal hydride battery (gravimetrically) and one order of magnitude higher than a commercial carbon-based SC (volumetrically), within one minute. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

One goal of the European Union is to achieve emission parity between passenger cars (EURO 6) and motorcycles (EURO 5) in 2020. The hybridization of motorcycle powertrains is one way to achieve these strict legislation limits. In the automotive sector, hybridization is well investigated and has already shown improvements of fuel consumption, efficiency and emission behavior. Equally, motorcycle applications have a high potential to improve efficiency and to meet customer needs as fun to drive as well. This paper describes a methodical approach to analyze conventional motorcycles regarding the energy and power demand for different driving cycles and driving conditions. Therefore, a dynamic or forward vehicle simulation within MATLAB Simulink is used. Within this simulation the energy and power requirement for overcoming the driving residence is calculated. By a detailed analysis of the load points over the separate parts of a driving cycle (e.g. WMTC) potentials and requirements are displayed. The results of this research shows that with a proper selection of the hybridization-level, dimensioning and assembly of the vehicle components (ICE, E-Motor, Electrical Storage,...) improvements are still possible. Furthermore, the impacts of different hybridization levels on the homologation process are shown. In this case, the focus is put on the fuel consumption calculation which is prescribed by the European Union.

The purpose of this paper is to validate the results obtained from a developed LabVIEW simulation model by comparing its results of a specific case study to those obtained from HOMER. HOMER software was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to assist engineers in the design of micro-power systems and makes extensive use of environmental parameters specific to a given location. The LabVIEW simulation model was developed to demonstrate fundamental principles of an energy generation system, with specific reference to a standalone PV system, where energy flow, efficiency and storage are demonstrated. Correlating the results between the LabVIEW simulation model and HOMER reveals that both simulation packages propose a minimum array size of 10 kW for a specific case study. The LabVIEW simulation module can thus be used with confidence. © 2016 IEEE.","energy flow; learning styles; PV systems","Graphical user interfaces; Signal processing; User interfaces; Energy flow; Environmental parameter; Fundamental principles; Learning Style; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; PV system; Renewable energy systems; Stand-alone PV systems; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006747542

Those systems provide only local/self-consumption. The implementation of other grid- or market-related services such as frequency and voltage control would allow for a tighter system integration and a possible improvement of the economic feasibility. Providing multiple service in one system leads to interoperability, flexibility, complexity (overlapping of functions) issues. In order to cope with those issues a framework for rapid prototyping of control applications focused on energy storage systems is proposed. In this context, it can be a useful tool to aid component manufacturers in the development of novel storage applications. Also smart grid system integrators and energy utilities can profit using this kind of tool-support.

Conventional mechanic springs impose some limitations on the system regarding mainly compactness, friction, material fatigue and failure. Magnetic springs show the potential to overcome these issues especially for long stroke high frequent operation. This paper investigates the integration of a magnetic spring into a linear oscillatory motor, without any changes to the permanent magnet arrangement on the mover. The focus lies on a compact design with maximum energy storage capacity. The proposed design guidelines are used as starting point for a finite-element based optimization. Moreover the investigation covers the expected losses and demonstrates that a correct choice of materials is crucial for an efficient operation.

Importantly, it includes Unifier-an engine that allows transforming input data into generic units reusable by other services, and Analyzer-an engine that allows advanced analysis of input data, such as combining different data sources into new output parameters. In this paper, we describe the architecture of W2E and demonstrate its applicability by using it for unifying data from four consumer activity trackers, using a test base of 20 subjects each carrying out three different tracking sessions. Finally, we discuss challenges of building a scalable Unifier engine for the ever-enlarging number of new devices. © 2013 IEEE.","Data unification; data warehousing; energy expenditure (EE); physical activity; semantic interoperability","Application programming interfaces (API); Bridges; Computer software reusability; Data warehouses; Engines; Health; Input output programs; Interface states; Metadata; Reusability; Semantics; Warehouses; Advanced analysis; Data unification; Different services; Energy expenditure; Health monitoring devices; Physical activity; Representational state transfer; Semantic interoperability; Interoperability; activity tracker; adult; algorithm; factual database; female; human; information retrieval; male; procedures; semantics; young adult; Adult; Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Female; Fitness Trackers; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Male; Semantics; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027682504

However, the vessel?s operating profile at reduced M/E power and speed does not justify the use of full capacities. In this article, a data-driven process controller is proposed to adjust the speed of E/R ventilation fan motors according to the variation of combustion air-flow and heat emission requirements to optimize energy efficiency during a ship's seagoing and cargo operation periods. The dynamics of the adaptive controller are established through parameter monitoring, regardless of the model of the controlled plant. For the tanker vessel under investigation, a case study initially defines the plant operational constraints and its power-saving potential. The proposed variable-frequency process control topology is then applied as a retrofit installation to the existing 18.5-kW E/R fan motor starters. Onboard experimental results show significant improvement in the vessel's power balance, D/G fuel consumption, and level of emission factors [carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx)], validating the performance of the proposed control topology, which is implemented using commercial programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and variable-frequency drive (VFD) units. © 1975-2012 IEEE.",,"Air; Air pollution control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Controllers; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Engines; Marine boilers; Marine engines; Nitrogen oxides; Programmable logic controllers; Sulfur dioxide; Topology; Variable speed drives; Ventilation; Adaptive controllers; Control topologies; Diesel generators; Operational constraints; Parameter monitoring; Process controllers; Variable frequencies; Variable frequency drives; Process control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027533448

Snow is also the largest varying landscape feature of the Earth's surface. Snow cover influences several processes that occur at or near earth surfaces. The snow cover extent of the snowpack is an extremely useful snow hydrology and climate variable for a number of reasons. The major problem in snow cover mapping is cloud because of high altitude position. Due to similar reflectance between snow and clouds it can be difficult to distinguish the snow information with spectral information alone. NASA's satellites Aqua and Terra MODIS have 36 channels onboard which significantly contributes to study the snow parameters. However, persistent cloud cover over Himalayan region limits the applicability of individual MODIS image with cloud cover. One solution to minimize the effect of cloud cover is to produce a composite image of cloud free pixels selected from several satellite passes of the same area and separated by time using image compositing algorithm. In this study to identify the cloud region MODIS cloud mask product MOD35 is used. This cloud mask products ability to mask the cloudy pixels over snow cover region gave better results than other methods. To check the accuracy of this method snow cover area has been calculated by different existing image compositing method. Further, the results were compared with snow cover area value derived from a cloud free dated image. This comparative study shows accuracy of the new compositing method using MODIS cloud mask product MOD 35. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud mask; Image Compositing; MOD 35; MODIS; Snow cover",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007472452

The objective is to minimize the total combined weighted operating cost of thermal, wind, battery and emission cost subject to power balance, thermal operating limits, ramp rate limits, prohibited operating zones, wind operating limit and BES operating & state-of-charge limits over a 24-hour time horizon. The cost of wind power consists of direct, overestimation and underestimation cost function. The Weibull probability density function model is used to determine the overestimation and underestimation costs. The BES is also used to compensate the overestimation and underestimation cost of wind generation. If the charging cost of BES is lower than overestimation cost of wind generation, the excess power from wind turbines will be stored in the BES. On the other hand, if the discharging cost of BES is lower than underestimation cost of wind generation, the shortage of wind power will be compensated by BES. Different operating costs with battery and without battery in system will be compared. Test results indicate that the proposed method renders a lower cost than Basic Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), Particle Swarm Optimization with Time-Varying Acceleration Coefficients (PSO-TVAC) and Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO). © 2016 Asian Institute of Technology.","battery energy storage; Dynamic combined economic and emission dispatch; penalty cost; stochastic weight trade-off particle swarm optimization; weibull probability density functions","Charging (batteries); Cogeneration plants; Cost functions; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric batteries; Energy storage; Operating costs; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Probability density function; Secondary batteries; Small power plants; Stochastic systems; Weibull distribution; Wind power; Wind turbines; Adaptive particle swarm optimizations; Battery energy storage; Economic and emission dispatch; Optimal power dispatch; Penalty cost; Prohibited operating zone; Time-varying acceleration coefficients; Trade off; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007137363

One major challenge regarding the use of Lithium-ion batteries in such applications is their higher cost-in comparison with other storage technologies or with the traditional frequency regulation methods-combined with performance-degradation uncertainties. In order to surpass this challenge and to allow for optimal sizing and proper operation of the battery, accurate knowledge about the lifetime of the Li-ion battery and its degradation behavior is required.

In all the supercapacitors, activated carbon is used as the active layer and graphite ink as the current collector, with various aluminium or copper structures applied to enhance the current collectors’ conductivity. The capacitance of the supercapacitors was between 0.05 F and 0.58 F and their equivalent series resistance (ESR) was from <1 Ω to 14 Ω, depending mainly on the current collector structure. Furthermore, leakage current and selfdischarge rates were defined and compared for the various architectures. The barrier properties of the supercapacitor encapsulation have a clear correlation with leakage current, as was clearly shown by the lower leakage in devices with an aluminium barrier layer. A cycle life test showed that after 40000 charge-discharge cycles the capacitance decreases by less than 10%.

This has been achieved through multiple engines and advanced dynamic positioning systems. This in combination with high safety standards set by the oil companies has resulted in a general operational pattern with vessels running multiple engines at low-to-medium loads to be prepared for unexpected incidents to happen at any time. At medium-to-high power, the combustion engine produces each kilowatt hour with the lowest fuel consumption and the lowest emissions. When engines operate at low power, fuel consumption per kilowatt hour produced increases. For the cost of the operation, this increase in specific fuel consumption at lower loads makes a small impact compared to the total cost of the operation, while for emissions low loads implies that emissions of exhaust gases such as nitrogen oxides and aerosols such as black carbon increases rapidly due to less favorable combustion conditions. This study investigates potential emission and fuel consumption reductions, which can be achieved by introduction of hybrid technologies including their climate mitigation potential. In this context, hybrid means engines of different sizes, battery storage of energy to take peak power requirements, and power management systems with a more balanced focus on reducing emissions and energy consumption while maintaining a high safety standard. Our results indicate that hybrid technologies reduce both emissions and fuel consumption, and that the climate impact of the emission reduction is much larger than the impact due to the reduction in fuel consumption alone.","Abatement options; GHG; GWP; Hybrid engine configurations; Marine operations and environment","Carbon; Combustion; Emission control; Energy utilization; Engines; Exhaust gases; Fuels; Marine engines; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Ocean currents; Power management; Safety engineering; Abatement options; Combustion condition; Fuel consumption reduction; Hybrid engines; Marine Operations; Operational patterns; Power management systems; Specific fuel consumption; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992207304

This research began as a mitigation measure against the low thermal qualities of existing buildings in Argentina, the energy crisis and its environmental consequences. Strategies of morphological and technological-constructive criteria according to representative typologies were adopted. In order to evaluate energy consumption, a method was implemented which considered the relationship between energy savings and initial investment cost through an “energy-economic efficiency index”. An application example on an existing building is exposed in order to visualize the analysis developed. Its implementation on relevant typologies allows us to expand the results and to analyse mitigation levels in the representative urban areas and thus replicate improvement proposals promoting a significant reduction in residential consumption considering its envelope as energy storage. The results show that savings of 20% would be achieved in the sector, noting that the participation of this sector represent almost a quarter of the national energy matrix. This (theoretically) reduction in energy demand is beneficial both for all individual users (who can amortize initial retrofitting costs in a brief time of 10 years or less according to energy subsidy levels), as for the group of the population and the state, because this reduction would allow dispensing with fuel imports and reframing subsidy policies. In conclusion, this paper shows how the proper use of energy storage technologies in residential dwellings may largely reduce the energy needs while delivering better indoor environment quality and providing the basis for future implementation of renewable sources. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Buildings retrofitting; Energy efficiency; Technological and constructive alternatives; Thermal energy storage","Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Housing; Investments; Retrofitting; Thermal energy; Application examples; Energy storage technologies; Environmental consequences; Indoor environment quality; Mitigation measures; Residential consumption; Residential dwelling; Technological and constructive alternatives; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992070910

Measures of regional obesity may be used to predict insulin resistance. In the present study we compared fat distribution in patients with PCOS vs. controls and established the best measure of fat mass to predict insulin resistance in patients with PCOS. Material and methods: The study was cross-sectional in an academic tertiary-care medical center with 167 premenopausal women with PCOS and 110 controls matched for ethnicity, BMI and age. Total and regional fat and lean body mass were assessed by whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Anthropometric measures (BMI, waist) and fasting metabolic analyses [insulin, glucose, lipids, Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), lipid accumulation product, and visceral adiposity index] were determined. Trial registration numbers: NCT00451568, NCT00145340. Results: Women with PCOS had higher central fat mass (waist, waist–hip ratio, and upper/lower fat ratio) compared with controls. In bivariate associations, the strongest associations were found between HOMA-IR and the fat mass measures trunk fat (r = 0.59), waist (r = 0.57) and BMI (r = 0.56), all p &lt; 0.001. During multiple regression analyses, trunk fat, waist and BMI were the best predictors of HOMA-IR (R2= 0.48, 0.49, and 0.47, respectively). Conclusions: Women with PCOS were characterized by central obesity. Trunk fat, waist and BMI were the best predictors of HOMA-IR in PCOS, but only limited information regarding insulin resistance was gained by whole body DXA scan. © 2016 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology","body mass index; Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan; lean body mass; lipid accumulation product; regional fat mass; visceral adiposity index; waist","glucose; insulin; lipid; adult; age; anthropometric parameters; Article; body composition; body mass; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; ethnicity; fat mass; female; homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance; human; insulin resistance; lean body weight; lipid storage; major clinical study; metabolic parameters; ovary polycystic disease; prediction; premenopause; priority journal; trunk; visceral adiposity index; waist circumference; waist hip ratio; adolescent; body fat distribution; case control study; clinical trial; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; insulin resistance; metabolism; middle aged; Obesity, Abdominal; ovary polycystic disease; pathophysiology; photon absorptiometry; physiology; young adult; Absorptiometry, Photon; Adolescent; Adult; Body Fat Distribution; Body Mass Index; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Middle Aged; Obesity, Abdominal; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Waist Circumference; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991738649

This paper presents a mathematical model to describe the evolution in water vapour, O2 and CO2 concentrations in the packaging headspace, the weight loss of the product and the condensation of water in a MAP system with perforations. Transpiration was considered as the sum of water transferred out from the product due to the gain of energy from its respiration process and the difference in water activities between the product and the surrounding atmosphere. Respiration was represented using Michaelis–Menten enzyme kinetics. The gas transfer through the packaging and the perforations was described with Fick equations. The temperature influence on these processes was considered to follow the Arrhenius' law. To experimentally determine the model parameters, feijoa fruits (Acca sellowiana Berg) were stored under different storage conditions: packaging type, relative humidity and temperature. The completed model was subsequently validated in a MAP test by packaging fruits in perforated polypropylene (PP) and polylactic acid (PLA) bags for 13 days at 12 °C and 75% RH. Inside the PP bags, a saturated atmosphere (100% RH) was reached and 1.48% of the initial weight in the packed fruit was lost by day 13, while in the PLA bags, an equilibrium RH of 83% and a fruit weight loss of 3.29% were measured. The prediction capacity of the model was satisfactory, with coefficients of determination (R2) between 0.88 and 0.99 for the different tests. © 2016 IAgrE","Modelling; Respiratory heat; Transpiration; Water vapour exchange; Weight loss","Carbon dioxide; Enzyme kinetics; Fruits; Models; Packaging; Polypropylenes; Transpiration; Water vapor; Fruit weight loss; Model parameters; Poly lactic acid; Relative humidity and temperatures; Storage condition; Temperature influence; Water vapour; Weight loss; Modified atmosphere packaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991276575

It is one member of the long-chain of Zn hybrids of the series (n-CnH2n+1NH3)2ZnCl4 (n = 8–18) and hence it belongs to the class of thermal energy storage materials. Our data evidenced that the hybrid undergoes a first order solid-solid structural phase transition from an intercalation to a non-intercalation at ≈373 K which is associated with an increase in the interlayer spacing “d” by 19.3%. In the room temperature phase, the hybrid is intercalated and tends to crystallize in an isolated square tetrahedra of zero-dimensional (0D) but arranged in the crystal system in two-dimensional (2D) via the assisted charge hydrogen bonds N[sbnd]H…Cl. It is therefore highly packed and hence have a highly transition temperature, highly thermal energy storage compared with other hybrids of the same n but of different M. These novelties characteristics suggested that the hybrid is more suitable for solar energy research.

Nonetheless, recovery of rare earth elements (REEs) with or without other metals from bauxite residue, and utilization of the left-over residue in other applications like building materials may be a viable alternative to storage. Hence, different processes developed by the authors for recovery of REEs and other metals from bauxite residue were compared. In this study, preliminary energy and cost analyses were carried out to assess the feasibility of the processes. These analyses show that the combination of alkali roasting-smelting-quenching-leaching is a promising process for the treatment of bauxite residue and that it is justified to study this process at a pilot scale. © 2016, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.",,"Metal recovery; Recovery; Smelting; Bauxite residue; Comparative analysis; Energy and cost; Environmental concerns; Pilot scale; Rare earth elements (REEs); Rare earths",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988699002

Imagine, there are several claims about the risks that lie ahead as conventional energy resources terminated, as populations increase, and as assumption accelerate. Therefore, the future societies will be subject to creative development and wide-ranging transformation to optimize their energy consumption. The SG can integrate an assorted set of electricity resources, containing large power plants as well as distributed renewable energy resources, electric energy storage, demand response, and electric vehicles. In line with many visions for the SG, consumers will play a more ‘active’ role in the future energy systems. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure customers’ acceptance to successfully build a SG. The eventual deployment of the SG depends on the consumers’ acceptance of SG products and services. Yet fully engaging the residential space in the SG remains a challenge.

The current paper provides fresh ideas on the relevant issues associated with the intermittence and low performance, which are considered among the main drawbacks of solar-driven adsorption cooling systems. Its primary aim is to design and analyze a solar continuous adsorption cooling system whose design consists mainly of combining a two-tank thermal energy storage system with two adsorbent beds. The operating process is based on storage of excess thermal energy, supplied by means of a solar parabolic trough concentrator, and on its subsequent recovery for producing an additional amount of cold. The simulation results indicate that, under the system conditions (design, working and weather), the solar coefficient of performance and daily cooling production are considerably improved when a latent heat storage unit is integrated with the system. The study reveals also that, thanks to this novel process, the number of refrigeration cycles achieved per day could be significantly increased, which means that the intermittence disadvantage could widely be overcome. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Adsorption; Continuous cycle; Cooling; Modeling; Solar parabolic trough collector; Thermal energy storage","Adsorption; Cooling; Energy storage; Heat storage; Models; Refrigeration; Renewable energy resources; Solar collectors; Thermal energy; Thermoelectric equipment; Coefficient of Performance; Continuous cycle; Latent heat storage units; Parabolic trough collectors; Parabolic trough concentrators; Performance enhancements; Renewable energy source; Thermal energy storage systems; Cooling systems; adsorption; cooling; design method; numerical model; performance assessment; renewable resource; simulation; solar activity; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981169891

In this paper, we consider one contested technology still in development, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), from a socio-cultural perspective. CCS is widely deemed to be a necessary bridging technology to a low-carbon economy, but the technology needs to pass considerable hurdles before widespread use. The importance of cultural issues in CCS deployment has been acknowledged, but research on the large-scale cultural patterns is lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we combine aggregated individual level measurements of technology opinions with indicators that characterize national cultures. We use survey data from a Eurobarometer together with prior cross-cultural data to show that nation-specific cultural issues can be used as a macro-level approximation of public reactions to CCS technology. Public reactions incorporate cultural factors such as the degree of separation between groups, strength of institutions over space, time and social roles, and society's tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity. On the basis of the analysis, we provide a richer frame for analysts wishing to understand why and how societies and societal actors challenge and contest technologies and energy regimes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","CCS; National culture; Risk perception; The general public",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979295916

Unlike conventional carbons, the textural properties of nanostructured carbons can be easily adjusted during synthesis. This design of the mesostructure allows to process large molecules by addressing the diffusional limitations/pore blockage which might occur in purely microporous carbon materials. Many synthetic approaches have been reported for the synthesis of mesoporous materials, either with a disordered mesoporosity (carbon gels), or with ordered porous systems (templated carbons). Carbon gels are synthesized by sol-gel processing through the polymerization of hydroxybenzenes and aldehydes. On the other hand, carbons with a periodically arranged mesoporous network can be obtained from the same precursors in the presence of templates, which may be rigid inorganic solids (hard-templating) or supramolecular assemblies (soft-templating). Controlling the surface chemistry is also a critical step in the development of high-performance materials; this can be achieved by doping with heteroatoms and functionalization with surface groups. The design of both texture and surface chemistry allows tuning the properties, thus leading to materials that meet the requirements of the targeted applications.

A 2015 survey (n = 509) investigated perceptions of demand reduction, load shifting and energy storage technologies as prosumer activities in Israel. Israelis showed little interest in remote controlled household appliances to facilitate load shifting, preferring to respond personally via smart controls to information communicated by the grid. There was similar low interest in permitting grid access to electricity stored in personal electric vehicle batteries. Financial incentives increased acceptance in both cases to a third of respondents. The survey identified various barriers to acceptance: health and privacy concerns about smart meters; low trust in the institutions overseeing these technologies; perceived low public support to reduce electricity demand; how incentives were framed and no perceived relationship with meeting national energy priorities such as affordability and energy independence.

It has been shown that this technique can be used to assess the effects of the leather-making processes on the final leather. From the results, each process of the leather making can be customized for certain application fields. For instance, tanning has shown to enhance the storage modulus (E′), shear stress (σ) and thermal stability at all frequencies and temperatures while decreases the loss modulus (E″), loss factor, viscosity (η) and shear strain (ε). All the properties exhibited dispersion with two distinct frequency ranges: 0.1–30 and 30–100 Hz. The properties become less frequency dependent at frequencies higher than 30 Hz. Tanning enhances E″ at frequencies lower than 30 Hz but lowers E″ at higher frequency than 30 Hz. The dominant elastic nature of hides implies that the majority of the mechanical energy is dissipated by elastic deformation. The properties investigated showed an increase with temperature before drastic drops at specific temperatures. It can be noted that tanned hide stores more residue stress, and its molecular chains are easier to slide over each other when shearing forces are applied compared to pickled hide. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Bovine hide; Chrome-tanning; Collagen; DMTA; Temperature scans; Viscoelastic","Collagen; Dynamics; Leather; Mammals; Shear strain; Shear stress; Tanning; Thermoanalysis; Viscoelasticity; Bovine hide; Chrome tanning; DMTA; Temperature scans; Viscoelastic; Dynamic mechanical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969988866

Recently, stoichiometric theory linked these levels through changes in body stoichiometry, predicting that both higher temperatures and predation risk induce shifts in energy storage (increases in C-rich carbohydrates and reductions in N-rich proteins) and body stoichiometry (increases in C : N and C : P). This promising theory, however, is rarely tested and assumes that prey will divert energy away from reproduction under predation risk, while under size-selective predation, prey instead increase fecundity. We exposed the water flea Daphnia magna to 4 °C warming and fish predation risk to test whether C-rich carbohydrates increase and N-rich proteins decrease, and as a result, C : N and C : P increase under warming and predation risk. Unexpectedly, warming decreased body C : N, which was driven by reductions in C-rich fat and sugar contents while the protein content did not change. This reflected a trade-off where the accelerated intrinsic growth rate under warming occurred at the cost of a reduced energy storage. Warming reduced C : N less and only increased C : P and N : P in the fish-period Daphnia. These evolved stoichiometric responses to warming were largely driven by stronger warming-induced reductions in P than in C and N and could be explained by the better ability to deal with warming in the fish-period Daphnia. In contrast to theory predictions, body C : N decreased under predation risk due to a strong increase in the N-rich protein content that offsets the increase in C-rich fat content. The higher investment in fecundity (more N-rich eggs) under predation risk contributed to this stronger increase in protein content. Similarly, the lower body C : N of pre-fish Daphnia also matched their higher fecundity. Warming and predation risk independently shaped body stoichiometry, largely by changing levels of energy storage molecules. Our results highlight that two widespread patterns, the trade-off between rapid development and energy storage and the increased investment in reproduction under size-selective predation, cause predictable deviations from current ecological stoichiometry theory. © 2016 The Authors.

A photovoltaic system is an arrangement of components; generally PV panels, converters and storage components designed to supply usable electric power for a variety of purposes. Stand-alone photovoltaic systems could assure this power if the optimal sizing is reached especially in small scales. They are ideal for remote rural areas and applications where other power sources are either impractical or are unavailable. This paper presents a method for techno-economic optimization for the optimal stand-alone PV system sizing in hourly scale basing on hourly solar radiation classification and the loss of load probability (LLP) calculation. For this task, the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm was applied to extract useful information from hourly solar radiation time series. To this end, an inclined solar radiation data from the site of Ghardaia, Algeria with an inclination angle equals to 32° for 2012 is used. Secondly, the lowest solar radiation was chosen for the reliability sizing based on the numerical method for a desired LLP equal to 1%. Finally, the genetic algorithm optimization method was used for choosing the best configuration with the lowest cost. The simulation results show the simplicity, rapidity and the accuracy of the proposed method. The sizing in hourly solar radiation scales (CA=0.91;CS=3.2) gives better results than daily solar radiation scales (CA=1.09;CS=4.4). © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Clustering; Hourly solar radiation; Loss of load probability; Sizing; Stand-alone PV systems","Algorithms; Copying; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric load loss; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Loss of load probability; Numerical methods; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Radiation; Solar radiation; Clustering; Fuzzy C-means algorithms; Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms; Genetic algorithm optimization method; Sizing; Stand alone photovoltaic system; Stand-alone PV system sizing; Stand-alone PV systems; Clustering algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961613745

Methods: Plasma irisin and insulin concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoradiometric assay (IRMA), respectively, in a cohort of 80 mothers delivering LGA (n = 30), IUGR (n = 30) and AGA (n = 20) singleton full-term infants. Results: Maternal irisin concentrations were similar among LGA, IUGR and AGA groups and did not correlate with respective insulin ones or maternal body mass index. In a combined group, maternal irisin concentrations decreased with advancing gestational age (p < 0.001) and were lower in multi-, compared to nulliparous women (p = 0.004). In the IUGR group, maternal irisin concentrations were higher in cases of smoking (p = 0.006). Conclusions: Irisin may not be differentially regulated in insulin resistance-associated pregnancy disorders resulting in fetal macrosomia and IUGR. Maternal irisin down-regulation with advancing gestation could possibly contribute to the observed maternal fat accumulation and progressive insulin resistance towards term. Similarly, lower maternal irisin concentrations in multiparous women may reflect the documented positive association between parity and fat deposition.

Several chemicals are known to be TH-disrupting compounds (THDCs) and have been shown to interact with virtually all elements of TH homeostasis such as feedback mechanisms with the hypothalamus-pituitary axis, TH synthesis, TH storage and release from the thyroid gland, transport protein binding and TH distribution in tissues and organs, cellular TH uptake, intracellular TH metabolism, and TH receptor binding. Therefore, chemicals interfering with the TH homeostasis have the potential to interact with many of these important processes, and especially early-life stage exposure results in permanent alterations of tissue organization and homeostatic regulation of adaptive processes. This is not only of theoretical importance as the reported plasma concentrations of THDCs in human plasma fall well within the range of reported in vitro effect concentrations, and this is of even higher importance as the developing fetus and young children are in a sensitive developmental stage. © 2016 S.

Therefore, it is considered as the best candidate for integrating hybrid energy sources, especially when renewable sources are locally available, to supply low-to medium-power range applications such as microgrids, rural areas, military camps and critical industrial zones. In this paper, a comprehensive energy management system (EMS) of MPEI for hybrid energy sources based on model predictive control (MPC) is proposed. The proposed system consists of a grid-connected MPEI that integrates three types of energy sources - dispatchable, nondispatchable, and energy storage - to feed a local load. The objectives of the proposed EMS are to minimize the total daily operating cost of the system with the optimal use of the energy resources, minimize diesel fuel consumption, and minimize pollutant gas emissions while considering the physical and practical constraints of different energy sources. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear dynamic optimization framework that can be solved using the SCIP solver, which is non-commercial solver that solves these kinds of problems.

The pre-defined tabularized data are used where the efficiency estimates for different number of pumps operated at various speeds are collected. Thanks to accounting the motor drive power losses, maximal system efficiency is obtained as the main outcome without equipment oversizing. The total head and pressure management strategy is proposed basing on both the analytical performance characteristics and the experimental efficiency distribution diagrams of a multi-pump station. Using this efficiency distribution, the efficiency map is proposed where the optimal numbers of pumps are recorded aiming to maintain the system performance in one of the best efficiency regions. An appropriate control algorithm is described. Finally, some experimental results validated the new control methodology are discussed. © 2016 IEEE.","energy efficiency; Energy management; predictive control; pumps; variable speed drives","Centrifugation; Digital storage; Electric drives; Energy management; Power quality; Pumps; Variable speed drives; Analytical performance; Control methodology; Efficiency distributions; Energy efficient; Predictive control; Pressure management; Programmable logical controller; System efficiency; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000643999

Regarding the lower quantization domain, the variable node units operate on q/2+1 resolution, while check node units process q/2-bit messages.

It studies the effect of adding a battery energy storage on a microgrid efficiency. A new designed Finnish-townhouse building is applied to model the power flow and converter types. Losses related to wirings, converters and dis/charging of the energy storage are calculated in a minute resolution to enhance the accuracy of the results. Ultimately, efficiency is derived for a range of converters' switching frequencies from 4 to 15 kHz while considering the microgrid possible voltage fluctuations in both AC and DC systems. Results represent higher efficiency in the DC microgrid in both cases with and without the existence of the storage. Furthermore, less discrepancy is obtained in the DC microgrid efficiency when the storage is added comparing to the AC microgrid. Accordingly, switching to DC distribution inside the building concerning the fast developments in power conversion devices seems promising in increasing the efficiency of the power systems. © 2016 IEEE and EPE Association.","DC power supply; Efficiency; Energy storage; Microgrid; Renewable energy systems","Efficiency; Electric batteries; Electric load flow; Energy storage; Power converters; Power electronics; Rectifying circuits; Renewable energy resources; Battery energy storage; Dc distribution; DC power supplies; Higher efficiency; Micro grid; Power conversion; Renewable energy systems; Voltage fluctuations; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996790698

The target storage temperature range was between 5 and 15°C. A model refrigerator was designed and constructed in the mechanical engineering workshop of Cape Peninsula University of Technology. It was installed and tested in outdoor conditions to get the effect of different weather conditions. The model consisted of a typical vapour compression system powered by a 12 V solar PV system. A DC compressor was used, and therefore, there was no inverter. The model was tested first without product and then with 20 kg batches of different fruits for a period of two weeks in April 2016. Wind speed, ambient temperature and solar radiation intensity data were monitored and collected from a Campbell Scientific weather station mounted on the roof adjacent the model. From hourly monitoring of temperatures and compressor current, refrigeration effect, power consumption and coefficient of performance were determined. The overall COP based on input solar energy was 2.8. It was thus proved that a suitably sized PV system could be designed and implemented at farm level to cool harvested fruits from ambient to storage temperature without use of an inverter. This could go some way to help retard deterioration of fruits and vegetables before delivery to a marketplace or to storage. © 2016 Cape Peninsula University of Technology.","fruit and vegetable preservation; post-harvest losses; solar PV refrigeration","Digital storage; Electric inverters; Harvesting; Refrigeration; Solar energy; Vegetables; Wind; Coefficient of Performance; Fruit and vegetables; Fruits and vegetables; Post-harvest loss; Refrigeration effect; Solar PVs; Solar radiation intensity; Storage temperatures; Fruits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995810423

As such bulk milk coolers (BMC's) are used to achieve the required storage temperature. This research focused on a low-cost empirical modeling to determine cooling savings on a dairy farm using a milk pre-cooler. A mathematical model was built with cooling water inlet temperature and outlet temperature of the raw milk to the BMC as the predictors for the electrical energy consumption of the BMC. A data acquisition was designed and built to measure the predictors of the electrical energy consumption of the BMC. Data analysis was done using Matlab software. The study revealed that an average of 39.6% savings on milk cooling can be achieved in dairy farms using a pre-cooler. A reliefF statistical test on predictors depicted that both the predictors are primary contributors to the desired output and a correlation coefficient of 0.987 indicated that there is a strong relationship between the actual and the modeled cooling savings. The findings from the empirical model will be used in future work on energy efficiency in the dairy sector for performance monitoring of the cooling system and optimization. © 2016 Cape Peninsula University of Technology.","Bulk Milk Cooler; Dairy farm; Multi linear regression models; pre-cooler; ReliefF algorithm; Vapour compression refrigerant cycles VCRC","Cooling; Cooling systems; Cooling water; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Farms; MATLAB; Plants (botany); Regression analysis; Bulk Milk Cooler; Dairy farms; Multi-linear regression; Pre-cooler; Refrigerant cycles; Relieff algorithms; Dairies",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995794363

The system is ordinarily based on power electronics, with interface converters allowing the sources to supply power to the system and the loads to draw power from the common bus in a controllable fashion. A MG is normally designed such that renewable energy sources (RESs) supply the average load demand, while ESSs, nonrenewable generation, and the grid are used to ensure that the loads enjoy a continuous supply of power in the presence of variable RES production. This chapter describes some specific features of DC MGs in terms of power architecture, control, and protection. It also reviews several uncommon power electronic interfaces. Regarding control, operation without critical communication links between units is an attractive solution from the point of view of both reliability and wiring hardware savings. Therefore, the conventional droop control concept from the bulk AC power systems was used at the primary control level because it requires only locally obtainable measurements. However, the higher control level becomes a challenging task with an increase in the number of units with different characteristics and topology complexity. It has to deal with RESs, which are controllable only within the limits imposed by natural phenomenon, while the battery recharging usually has to be done in a specific way. Moreover, the technical constraints such as stability margins and maintenance of acceptable voltage deviation within the system must also be respected while the aforementioned issues are considered. While a centralized control is commonly deployed for this purpose, distributed techniques are explained in this chapter.

This requires newer strategies to be incorporated to keep the power stability among green energy resources and micro-grid/Utility Grid. This paper presents a novel technique for power management in Grid-connected photovoltaic system with an energy storage system under a set of constraints, including weather conditions, load-shedding hours, peak pricing hours, by using rule-base fuzzy smart controller to schedule power coming from multiple sources (Photovoltaic, Grid, Battery) under the above set of constraints. The technique fuzzify all the inputs and establishes fuzzify rule set from fuzzy outputs before deffuzification process. Simulations are run for 24 hour period and rule base power scheduler is developed. The Proposed fuzzy control strategy is able to sense the continuous fluctuations in photovoltaic power generation, Load Demands, Grid (load Shedding patterns), and Battery State of Charge in order to make correct and quick decisions. The Suggested Fuzzy Rule based scheduler can operate well with vague inputs, thus doesn't not require any exact numerical model and can handle nonlinearity by combining the human heuristics into computer assisted decisions. This technique also provides a framework for extension to handle multiple special cases for an optimized working of the system. © 2015 IEEE.","Depth of Discharge (DOD); Distributed Generators (DG); Fuzzy Inference (FI); Fuzzy Logic (FL); Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC); Load Shedding (LS); Memebership Functions (MFs); Photovoltaic (PV); State of Charge (SOC)","Artificial intelligence; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Computer circuits; Electric batteries; Electric load shedding; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy resources; Fuzzy control; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Photovoltaic cells; Power management; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Depth of discharges; Distributed generators; Fuzzy logic controllers; Load-shedding; Memebership Functions (MFs); Photovoltaic; State of charge; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997426725

This paper proposed an operational control algorithm that will be used to control and supervise the operations of PV/Wind-Diesel hybrid power generation system for GSM base station sites. The control algorithm was developed in such a way that it coordinates when power should be generated by renewable energy (PV panels and Wind turbine) and when it should be generated by diesel generator and is intended to maximize the use of renewable system while limiting the use of diesel generator. Diesel generator is allocated only when the demand cannot be met by the renewable energy sources including battery bank. The developed algorithm was used to study the operations of the hybrid PV/Wind-Diesel energy system. The control simulation shows that the developed algorithm reduces the operational hours of the diesel generator thereby reducing the running cost of the hybrid energy system as well as the pollutant emissions. With the data collected from the site, a detailed economic and environmental analysis was carried out using micro power optimization software homer.

It is based on the Modified Electric System Cascade Analysis method. The Power Pinch analysis is used as a guideline for development of an isolated power supply system, which consists of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and energy storage units. The design procedure uses a simulation model, developed using MATLAB/SIMULINK and applies the developed algorithms for obtaining an optimal design. A validation of the Modified Electric System Cascade Analysis method is performed by comparing the obtained results with those from the Homer Pro software. The procedure takes as inputs hourly wind speed, solar radiation, demands, as well as cost data, for the generation and storage facilities. It is also applied to minimize the loss of power supply probability and to minimize the number of storage units. The algorithm has been demonstrated with a case study on a site in Oujda city, with daily electrical energy demand of 18.7 kWh, resulting in a combination of photovoltaic panels, wind turbine and batteries at minimal cost.

The adsorption module operates with the silica-gel/water pair and is capable of storing the thermal energy received from the hot water of the storage tank where it is immersed, to give it back later as adsorption heat. The module is applied to a solar thermal energy system and assessed through a set of parametric tests. It is found that higher condenser lengths and larger pre-heating water tank volumes always improve the system's performance. For a selected fixed heat exchange area, smaller evaporator tube diameters are found to improve the system's performance, while reducing the number of tubes of a settled diameter has a negative effect. It is also found that the system's performance tends to decrease by increasing the main tank's volume, thus requiring even larger adsorbers for larger tanks.

The most mature technology for capturing solar energy in high temperature levels is the parabolic trough collectors (PTC). In this study, an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) coupled with PTC is analyzed parametrically in order to be optimized financially and energetically. The first step is the thermodynamic investigation of the ORC by using various working fluids. The second step is the energetic and financial investigation of the total system which includes the solar field, the storage tank and the ORC module. By testing many combinations of collecting areas and storage tank volumes, finally cyclohexane proved to be the most suitable working fluid for producing 1 MWel with PTC. Specifically, in the optimum situation a solar field of 25,000 m2 with storage tank of about 300 m3 leads to a payback period of 9 years and to an internal rate of return (IRR) equal to 13.46%.

This is in contrast with energy and exergy efficiencies, which compare SSTES with only the perfectly stratified store. A dimensionless unsteady axisymmetric model of vertical cylindrical SSTES was implemented using a finite volume numerical scheme. The effect of some significant parameters on SSTES performance were considered by performing computations for aspect ratios (AR) between 1 and 4, Peclet number (PeD) varying from 5×103 to 100×103, Richardson number (Ri) varying from 10 to 104, and overall heat loss coefficients (U) varying from 0 to 100 W m−2 K−1. η‾x increases with PeD, Ri and AR, with the most significant increases occurring at low values of these parameters, and appreciable increases are no longer obtained beyond PeD≈30×103, Ri≈103 and AR≈3. η‾x also falls monotonically as the U values increase. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","CFD analysis; Exergy performance analysis; Normalized exergy efficiency; Stratified thermal storage","Aspect ratio; Computational fluid dynamics; Heat storage; Axisymmetric modeling; CFD analysis; Energy and exergy efficiency; Exergy efficiencies; Heat loss coefficients; Performance analysis; Performance assessment; Thermal storage; Exergy; computational fluid dynamics; energy budget; energy efficiency; exergy; numerical model; performance assessment; Richardson number; stratification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979249239

Therefore, the energy management can play an important role to achieve the selfgoverning operation of the Smart Micro Grid. The distributed generators can t ensure energy for the area with the same frequency like power plants. But, the problem is to evaluate the outage (categories, time to be reconnected), how identify entities to include in the selection, manage their demand response with the existed resources (stored or local produced...) and the possibility to include other entities to the selection in the emergency case. This paper reviews some of the major challenges of islanding, and we propose a classification of demand by priority, the classification depends also on the typology of the area (industrial zone, city, medical zone ), and if contains some regional resources. In this paper we study a static area isolation that contains some static entities like hospital, factory, green houses, renewable energy, hotel, plugin vehicles, and storage farm. The objective is to propose a solution as a Dynamic Energy Management (DEM) to perform distributed control on the islanded area and to response to citizen demand (health , work , energy for crucial industrial/hospital machines) during the islanding time , we add a new level of control in the standard smart grid architecture to allow real time exchanging status and data from a different selected entities who demand energy to a regional data center, The regional data center will be a selfdecisive system and his role is to manage and control the regional grid to ensure a successful island operation.

In this setting, active residential load management can play an important role to help end-users optimizing the usage of energy resources (grid, local generation, storage and loads) to minimize the overall energy cost without compromising comfort. The scheduling of load control actions should take into account energy costs, end-users preferences and requirements, potential dissatisfaction when the operation cycle of loads is changed, technical constraints, weather forecasts, the existence of local generation and storage systems. A multi-objective optimization approach has been developed to assist decisions weighing the minimization of the energy cost and the minimization of end-user s dissatisfaction associated with the implementation of management strategies. Due to the combinatorial nature of this model, an evolutionary algorithm has been designed to optimize the integrated usage of multiple residential energy resources considering a vast set of potential management strategies taking into account the end-user s profile regarding the acceptable balance between the cost and comfort dimensions. Those energy resources include the grid, local generation, shiftable loads, thermostatically controlled loads and storage systems (stationary and electric vehicle). The evolutionary algorithm makes the most of the physical characteristics of the problem to obtain results that can be implemented in practice with a mild computational effort. Results of case studies have shown that savings can be achieved with an energy management system based on this approach, although dependent on the end-user s preferences and willingness to accept automated control. © 2016 IEEE.","demand response; energy management systems; smart grids","Costs; Electric load management; Electric machine control; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Energy resources; Evolutionary algorithms; Housing; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Smart power grids; Weather forecasting; Computational effort; Demand response; Management strategies; Physical characteristics; Smart grid; Technical constraints; Thermostatically controlled loads; Willingness to accept; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995665382

While these networked devices and associated communications can increase the energy demands exponentially and end up harming the environment seriously. Currently most researchers and practitioners have dedicated their efforts on improving the resource efficiency of IoT systems itself, while missing that there is a great potential to fully utilize the advanced capabilities of storage and communications in IoT devices, especially their movability which can carry the data to the destinations too. In this paper, we are paving a novel communications paradigm, named as Context-aware tethering communications hangout using Mobile encounter (CatchMe). A time-space matrix has been proposed to capture human mobility preferences, as well as a similarity analytical framework has been developed for mobile encountering analysis and predication, which are pillar stones of CatchMe paradigm. It aims to fully utilize the devices' mobility to create their encounter opportunities for short-range device to device (D2D) communications. Based on the real mobility traces, two case studies for mobility analysis have been conducted and the results confirm that there are reasonable opportunities existing for mobile encountering among most users, thus CatchMe is feasible. The extra numerical study demonstrates that CatchMe has great promises to significantly reduce the energy consumption, comparing with the infrastructure-based transmission approach which has been taken for granted in daily use. The current stage of proof-of-concept on CatchMe paradigm does not yet lend itself to sweeping prescription. Nevertheless, we believe this research direction is thoughtprovoking and opening a new conversation for researchers to rethink and redesign more sustainable communications and networking by fully exploring the moveable IoTs. © 2016 IEEE.","Delay tolerant network; Device-to-Device (D2D) communications; Internet of Things; Mobility; Opportunistic routing; Similarity analysis; Sustainable communications","Carrier mobility; Delay tolerant networks; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Communications and networkings; Deviceto-device (D2D) communication; Internet of Things (IOT); Network connectivity; Opportunistic routing; Resource efficiencies; Short range devices; Similarity analysis; Big data",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995393690

The method is based on a fragmentation approximation: the correlation contributions of the individual electron pairs are evaluated in domains constructed for the corresponding localized orbitals, and the correlation energies of distant electron pairs are computed with multipole expansions. The required electron repulsion integrals are calculated directly invoking the density fitting approximation; the storage of integrals and intermediates is avoided. The approach also utilizes natural auxiliary functions to reduce the size of the auxiliary basis of the domains and thereby the operation count and memory requirement. Our test calculations show that the approach recovers 99.9% of the canonical MP2 correlation energy and reproduces reaction energies with an average (maximum) error below 1 kJ/mol (4 kJ/mol).

Given initial and final desired state of charge (SOC) of the battery, the optimal distribution of power between both sources, battery and engine, can be computed off-line for a known driving cycle. In the case of a range extender (REX) with an engine switched between two operating points, the solution boils down to a sequence of engine state changes. However, applying this profile to the vehicle under general traffic conditions proves very inefficient, as the required traction power over time will change strongly according to the actual traffic and load situation. Instead, this paper suggests to use a spatial-domain SOC trajectory based on off-line optimization results as reference quantity, for which simulations indicate a smaller sensitivity to varying traffic conditions. The paper shows the a posteriori computation of an energy efficient control sequence as well as an on-line implementation that utilizes model predictive control (MPC) and a short-term prediction of the future power demand. Evaluation is performed using a detailed nonlinear simulation model and real traffic data where the limited loss of optimality due to changes of traffic but also due to the driver's style is confirmed. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric drives; Energy efficiency; Engines; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Secondary batteries; Application fields; Hybrid electric drives; Nonlinear simulations; Off-line optimization; Operating points; Optimal distributions; Short term prediction; Traffic conditions; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994226764

Firstly, a µSAT-3 general description is performed, detailing its sub-systems and on-orbit mission characteristics. The micro-satellite obtains energy through a set of four high-performance solar panels fixed in its lateral sides. In order to sizing the batteries, the energy required during three consecutive orbital periods without receiving solar radiation is estimated. In the battery design it is suitable to use Li-ion cells of small size and divide the total capacity among a greater number of cells to increase design versatility. Regarding battery charge/discharge protocol, it is proposed a battery cycling between voltage values away from the recommended ends, in order to prolong its cycle life. To conclude, a stand-alone Energy Management System is presented, which optimize available energy and avoid critically low levels. © 2016 IEEE.",,"DNA sequences; Energy management; Lithium-ion batteries; Orbits; Storage management; Available energy; Battery cycling; Charge/discharge; General description; Low earth orbits; Micro satellite; Orbital periods; Storage systems; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994530347

The storage system considered is composed by a bank of lead-acid batteries that provide high energy density and an ultracapacitor, a high power. One of the control strategies was already proposed in a previous work, a cascade topology that uses monitors of state (ME, in Spanish) and the other strategy, extracted from the literature, is based on the use of voltage feedback (LT in Spanish) for the energy management. This comparison shows that the ME strategy has advantages over the LT strategy due to its extra degrees of freedom which permit a better tuning. Among other advantages of ME, it is possible to specify the immediate recovery of the ultracapacitor, which is not a remarkable characteristic of LT.

XRD analysis revealed that amorphous and crystalline oxide structures were synthesized. Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed rod-like α-MnO2 for the pristine sample, while cubic Mn3O4 and irregularly shaped MnO2 structures anchored on the AC substrate, with the nanostructures being uniformly distributed on the AC. The electrochemical tests of the composites as electrodes showed that the amorphous AC-MnO2 had a specific capacitance of 180 F g-1, nearly four times higher than that of the crystalline AC-Mn3O4 composite electrode (55 F g-1). The coulombic efficiency for the AC-MnO2 cell was 98% after 5000 cycles, indicating only a small loss of capacitance.

The current drive to develop cooperative autonomous vehicular systems to carry out surveying and other complex missions in the ocean critically depends on the existence of such communication links to share sensory and coordination information. This paper presents a compact, low power consumption, cost-efficient, and lightweight optical modem designed for fast data transmission between MEDUSA underwater vehicles at ranges on the order of 10 m. The transmitter uses LEDs for ON-OFF keying, while the receiver front-end adopts a transimpedance architecture with a photodiode detector. This simplistic transmission and reception technique reduces the overall design and hardware complexities compared to, e.g., laser diodes and photomultiplier tubes. The LEDs are arranged in a circular array, with a photodiode at the centre to enable half-duplex operation. These modems are designed to achieve data rates of 20-200 kb/s over short-range, line-of-sight, configurations. A transparent casing is customised to fit the Medusa vehicles, with proper alignment for inter-vehicle communication when they move in formation. © 2016 IEEE.","autonomous underwater vehicles; Medusa AUVs; optical modems; Underwater wireless optical communications","Cooperative communication; Coordination reactions; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Light emitting diodes; Modems; Optical communication; Photodiodes; Photomultipliers; Telecommunication links; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Acoustic communications; Fast data transmission; High-speed data transmission; Inter vehicle communications; Low-power consumption; Medusa AUVs; Underwater wireless optical communications; Wireless optical communication; Autonomous underwater vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994476529

When the system is active, refresh commands render DRAM banks unavailable for increasing periods of time. These refresh operations can interfere with regular memory operations and hurt performance. In addition, when the system is idle, DRAM self-refresh is the dominant source of energy consumption, and it directly impacts battery life and standby time. Prior refresh reduction techniques seek to reduce active-mode auto-refresh energy, reduce self-refresh energy, improve performance, or some combination thereof. In this paper, we present CLARA, a circular linked-list based refresh architecture which meets all three goals with very low overheads and without sacrificing DRAM capacity. This approach exploits the variation in retention time at a chip granularity as opposed to a DIMM-wide, rank granularity in prior work. CLARA reduces auto- and self-refresh by 86.2%, independent of workload. Auto refresh reduction improves average CPU performance by 3.1% and 6.5% in the normal and extended temperature range, respectively. GPU performance improves by 2.1% on average in the extended temperature range. DRAM idle power during self-refresh is reduced by 44%. The area overhead of CLARA in the DRAM is about 0.085% and negligible in the memory controller. © 2016 ACM.","Auto refresh; DRAM; Self refresh","Energy utilization; Memory architecture; Auto refresh; Circular linked lists; Improve performance; Memory controller; Memory operations; Refresh reductions; Self refresh; Temperature range; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995503414

Solar energy has great potential as an alternative energy source. However, variations in solar radiation require the use of additional energy sources, to keep a continuous drying process. An option is to accumulate solar energy using phase-change materials. In the present work, an advanced multivariable control system using fuzzy logic was implemented and applied to a solar dryer equipped with thermal energy storage system, with a capacity of 25 kg of agro-products. Two control systems were implemented: the first considering the ambient temperature and solar radiation as input variables, where the manipulated variables were the opening level of the solar panel and energy solar accumulator valves. The controlled variable in the second control system was the relative humidity content at the outlet of the drying chamber, and the manipulated variable was the opening of the air recirculation valve. The opening of the valves in both control systems was performed properly with variations of solar radiation, ambient temperature, and air moisture during the dehydration of mushrooms, plumbs, and peaches. Solar drying, together with a proper control system, reached 80% energy savings compared to conventional drying. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Control system; fuzzy logic; PCM; solar energy","Carbon dioxide; Computer circuits; Control systems; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Fuzzy control; Fuzzy logic; Heat storage; Humidity control; Multivariable control systems; Multivariable systems; Operating costs; Phase change materials; Pulse code modulation; Reconfigurable hardware; Solar dryers; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Temperature; Thermal energy; Air re-circulation; Alternative energy source; Controlled variables; Conventional drying; Experimental evaluation; Input variables; Manipulated variables; Thermal energy storage systems; Drying",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988734748

Furthermore, we have used a detector to detect any tripping of any wind turbine and substitute the shortage of power due to this loss of wind turbines immediately through SMES. The Active network in this paper should have a minimum of 150 MW power to be supplied by controlling the SMES unit (absorbing or providing power according to the system requirement).

This thesis discusses explanations for the links between abnormalities in glucose metabolism, the steroid synthesis pathway, the growth hormone-insulin growth factor-1 axis, and chronic changes in adipose tissue distribution. Specifically, the mechanisms by which low-grade inflammation may affect the normal stimulatory effect of insulin on glucose and fat storage are reviewed. We propose that both chronic low-grade inflammation from HIV infection and treatment with HAART trigger cellular homeostatic stress responses with adverse effects on glucose metabolism. The physiological outcome is such that the total energy storage in the adipocytes is decreased, and the remaining adipocytes resist further energy storage. The excess circulating and dietary lipid metabolites, normally metabolised by adipose tissue, are deposited ectopically in the muscle, liver, or visceral adipose tissue, where they impair insulin action. This deposition of lipid metabolites leads to a vicious circle of insulin resistance and lipotoxicity leading to lipoatrophy or a mixed-type with increased visceral adipose tissue and a clinical phenotype of HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome with an elevated waist-to-hip ratio. This HIV-associated inflamm-ageing syndrome can provide a platform for further studies in HIV-infected patients and act as a model for biological accelerated ageing.",,"complication; health; HIV Infections; human; inflammation; Metabolic Diseases; morbidity; severity of illness index; trends; Global Health; HIV Infections; Humans; Inflammation; Metabolic Diseases; Morbidity; Severity of Illness Index",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012833482

This energy intensive process is regulated through multiple mechanisms including receptor-mediated signaling, control of phago-lysomal fusion events and promotion of bactericidal activities. Inherent macrophage activities therefore are dynamic and are modulated by signals and changes in the environment during infection. So too does the way these cells obtain their energy to adapt to altered homeostasis. It has emerged recently that the pathways employed by immune cells to derive energy from available or preferred nutrients underline the dynamic changes associated with immune activation. In particular, key breakpoints have been identified in the metabolism of glucose and lipids which direct not just how cells derive energy in the form of ATP, but also cellular phenotype and activation status. Much of this comes about through altered flux and accumulation of intermediate metabolites. How these changes in metabolism directly impact on the key processes required for anti-microbial immunity however, is less obvious. Here, we examine the 2 key nutrient utilization pathways employed by innate cells to fuel central energy metabolism and examine how these are altered in response to activation during infection, emphasising how certain metabolic switches or ‘reprogramming’ impacts anti-microbial processes. By examining carbohydrate and lipid pathways and how the flux of key intermediates intersects with innate immune signaling and the induction of bactericidal activities, we hope to illustrate the importance of these metabolic switches for protective immunity and provide a potential mechanism for how altered metabolic conditions in humans such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia alter the host response to infection. © 2016","Diabetes; Glucose metabolism; Glycolytic reprogramming; Interleukin-1&beta; Lipids; Macrophage; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Trained immunity","agents affecting metabolism; cholesterol; glucose; immunomodulating agent; lipid; liver X receptor; nitric oxide; sterol regulatory element binding protein; glucose; antigen presentation; autophagy; cell activation; cell energy; cell metabolism; cholesterol synthesis; cholesterol transport; diabetes mellitus; drug repositioning; energy metabolism; glucose metabolism; glycolysis; host resistance; human; hyperlipidemia; immunocompetent cell; immunotherapy; inflammation; innate immunity; intracellular signaling; lipid homeostasis; lipid metabolism; lipid transport; lysosome; lysosome storage disease; macrophage activation; malignant neoplastic disease; metabolic syndrome X; nuclear reprogramming; obesity; pathogenesis; regulatory mechanism; Review; smoking; T lymphocyte activation; transcription regulation; animal; cytology; drug development; drug effects; energy metabolism; genetics; host pathogen interaction; immune system; immunity; immunology; immunomodulation; inflammation; metabolism; Animals; Drug Discovery; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Immune System; Immunity; Immunomodulation; Inflammation; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolic Networks and Pathways",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001828635

FAODs and GSDs can be divided into two main clinical phenotypes; those with static symptoms related to fixed muscle weakness and atrophy, and those with dynamic, exercise-related symptoms that are brought about by a deficient supply of ATP. Together with mitochondrial myopathies, metabolic myopathies are unique among muscle diseases, as the limitation in exercise performance is not solely caused by structural damage of muscle, but also or exclusively related to energy deficiency. ATP consumption can increase 50–100-fold in contracting, healthy muscle from rest to exercise, and testing patients with exercise is therefore an appropriate approach to disclose limitations in work capacity and endurance in metabolic myopathies. Muscles rely almost exclusively on muscle glycogen in the initial stages of exercise and at high work intensities. Thus, patients with GSDs typically have symptoms early in exercise, have low peak work capacities and develop painful contractures in exercised muscles. Muscle relies on fat oxidation at rest and to a great extent during prolonged exercise, and therefore, patients with FAODs typically develop symptoms later in exercise than patients with GSDs. Due to the exercise-related symptoms in metabolic myopathies, patients generally have been advised to shun physical training. However, immobility is associated with multiple health issues, and may even cause unwanted metabolic adaptations, such as increased dependence on glycogen use and a reduced capacity for fatty acid oxidation, which is detrimental in GSDs. Training has not been studied systematically in any FAODs and in just a few GSDs. However, studies on single bouts of exercise in most metabolic myopathies show that particularly moderate intensity aerobic exercise is well tolerated in these conditions. Even low-intensity resistance training of short duration is tolerated in McArdle disease. Training in patients with FAOD potentially can also expand the metabolic bottleneck by increasing expression of the defective, but partially functional enzyme. Exercise performance in metabolic myopathies can be improved by different fuel supplementations and dietary interventions and should be considered as adjunct therapy to exercise training. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS","Exercise training; Glycogenosis; Metabolic myopathies; Myoglobinuria; Substrate supplementation","carbohydrate; fat; glycogen; carbohydrate metabolism; energy metabolism; exercise; genetic disorder; glycogen muscle level; glycogen storage disease type 2; glycogen storage disease type 5; glycogenolysis; human; lipid oxidation; metabolic disorder; metabolic myopathy; myopathy; nonhuman; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; supplementation; kinesiotherapy; Metabolic Diseases; Muscular Diseases; procedures; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Metabolic Diseases; Muscular Diseases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994498904

To investigate fossil-fuel chemical looping combustion in fluidized bed columns, a dynamic mathematical model was herein developed. The complex phenomena taking place in the iron-based chemical looping combustion process are described by assuming a pseudo-homogeneous system and a plug–flow regime for the fluidized columns. The mass and energy balance equations were written by using partial differential equations for both the gaseous and solid phases present in the process. The distribution and temperatures profiles of the gaseous and solid components as well as a study on the influence of the superficial gas velocity on the particle distribution were generated by model simulation.

In this report, we demonstrate environmentally friendly synthesis of a carbon-rich layer on the surface of SiC by anodic etching at room temperature in a highly diluted solution of hydrofluoric acid in ethylene glycol. In our opinion, the carbon-rich layer was formed thanks to the fact that we have used the etching conditions in which the rate of removal of carbon from SiC has become significantly lower compared with the silicon removal rate. More specifically, we have created an environment for SiC anodic etching where there is little water. In such conditions, silicon is still being removed from SiC, thanks to the direct dissolution, whereas the carbon removal rate is significantly reduced, due to the fact that carbon can be lost only by oxidation, but there is not enough water to oxidize carbon as in solutions with plenty of water. Thus, a carbon-rich layer is created on the etched SiC surface. © 2016 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","anodic etching; carbide-derived carbons; ethylene glycol; HF; SiC",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991218357

It provides solutions for the future energy system by coupling smart thermal and electricity grids with underground thermal storage and by providing reliable and affordable heating and cooling supply to both urban and rural areas.

Therefore, the latent heat thermal energy storage technique is an interesting technology for industrial applications (e.g. batch processes) and power cycles. A key technology for such a storage device is the design of the heat exchanger tube, because the heat transfer rate by charging and discharging is the limiting factor based on the low thermal conductivity of the phase change material. The heat exchanger tube material used for such an application should have a high thermal conductivity and also a high mechanical resistance. Such a behavior can be found in a combination of different materials. The present paper deals with the design of such a heat exchanger tube composition consisting of a plain steel tube and an aluminum tube where fins can be attached. A novel bimetallic tube composition will be presented and compared with three common compositions. First, the mechanical stability of the bimetallic compositions was determined. Additionally a creep test of the used aluminum under operation conditions for a storage device using sodium nitrate as phase change material confirmed the utilizability for the operation in a latent heat thermal energy device. One of the main challenges for the compositions under investigation is based on the different thermal expansion coefficient for aluminum and steel, which results in different strain and creeping tendencies of the aluminum at operation temperature of the storage system, which is up to 340 °C. A good heat transfer from the heat transfer fluid through the steel tube to the storage material around the fins can only be guaranteed through a close and stable connection between the two tubes. Compared to former solutions the fin circumference and the fin design are independent from the connection to the steel tube and allows individual arrangements of tubes and high packing densities. The experimental investigations have shown that the novel bimetallic tube composition is able to compensate these different strains and is capable to guarantee a stable connection between the steel and the aluminum tube. This high pressure and high temperature resistant bimetallic heat exchanger tube is easy to assemble and may play a key role for the development of thermal energy storages and other heat exchanging processes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Aluminum-steel composition; Bimetallic finned tube; Creeping of aluminum; Heat transfer enhancement; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Mechanical stability","Aluminum; Batch data processing; Energy storage; Fins (heat exchange); Heat resistance; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Latent heat; Mechanical stability; Phase change materials; Storage (materials); Strain; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Thermal expansion; Tubes (components); Tubular steel structures; Aluminum steel; Experimental investigations; Finned tube; Heat Transfer enhancement; High pressure and high temperature; High thermal conductivity; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Thermal expansion coefficients; Heat exchangers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989835932

After the design and administration of a survey, data from 43 Norwegian swimming facilities were collected. A quality assurance process was applied to the collected data, which were than stored in a database, resulting in 176 datasets. A correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were carried out to identify (i) to what extent a number of independent variables characterising swimming facilities are singularly related to energy performance and (ii) to what extent the identified independent variables can together explain the variation in energy performance. Unlike in residential and commercial buildings, climate does not drive the total energy performance of swimming facilities. Instead, overall water usage of the facility was observed to be most strongly correlated with the energy usage, followed by the number of visitors attending in a year, the usable area of the facility and the water surface of the pool(s). It is difficult to obtain accurate values for any of these variables except for the water surface. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the number of visitors is the variable that explains most of the variation in the energy performance of swimming facilities. Therefore, the authors conclude that, for benchmarking purposes, the energy usage of swimming facilities, shall be preferably normalised with respect to the number of visitors. If no reliable visitor count is available, then water surface can be used. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Benchmarking; Buildings; Energy efficiency; Energy performance indicator; Energy use; Swimming facilities","Benchmarking; Buildings; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Linear regression; Office buildings; Quality assurance; Regression analysis; Waste disposal; Commercial building; Energy performance; Energy performance indicators; Energy use; Independent variables; Multiple linear regression analysis; Quality assurance process; Research questions; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982694122

The variable PV power and the abrupt power charging of PHEVs result in system power and voltage fluctuations. This paper presents the new application of the superconducting coil (SC), which is connected between the dc link of PV generators to solve this problem. Using the dc-to-dc converter as an interfaced circuit, the SC can share the inverters with the PV generators. In addition, the PV generators with the common SC are able to provide the smooth power output and regulate the system voltage. The PV inverters and the dc-to-dc converter are controlled by the proportional-integral (PI) controllers. The optimization of the PI parameters and SC inductance is performed, so that the power and voltage fluctuations are minimized. Simulation results indicate that the PV generators with the common SC, which has a lower SC inductance, provide the same smoothing effect on the PV power fluctuation as the superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) installed at the PV terminal. In addition, they give the superior voltage regulation effect to the SMES. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","Optimization; photovoltaic (PV) generator; plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV); power and voltage fluctuations; superconducting coil (SC)","DC-DC converters; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Electric inverters; Electric power distribution; Energy storage; Hybrid vehicles; Inductance; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Magnetic storage; Optimization; Superconducting electric machinery; Superconducting magnets; Two term control systems; Voltage regulators; Distribution systems; Photovoltaic; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Power distribution system; Proportional integral controllers; Super-conducting coils; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Voltage fluctuations; Plug-in hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982671703

It reveals how Norway's CCS policy represents an extraordinary effort to bridge seemingly contradictory agendas. The Norwegian CCS case highlights how a state may engage in innovative foreign political engineering to promote solutions to its international climate commitments on terms that fit national energy needs.

This study investigated the combined effects of two different biomass storage methods and physical pre-treatments on the anaerobic digestion for three different microalgae species. Acutodesmus obliquus, Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella emersonii were cultivated in 80 L sleevebag photobioreactors (batch mode), and then subjected to different storage (cooling and freezing) and pre-treatment methods prior to anaerobic digestion using the biochemical methane potential (BMP) test. A. obliquus was selected to evaluate pre-treatment methods for further experimentation. Significantly higher CH4 yields of cooled (4 °C) A. obliquus biomass were achieved through ultrasonication (+53% CH4) and wet-milling (+51% CH4). These methods were then applied in follow-up experiments to cooled (4 °C) biomass of C. emersonii and A. obliquus. Ultrasonication again led to significantly higher CH4 yields for A. obliquus biomass (323 dm3 kg−1 CH4 yield calculated at standard gas conditions of 273 K, and 101.5 kPa per unit volatile solids, +41% CH4), and C. emersonii biomass (308 dm3 kg−1; +35% CH4). In a third experiment series, frozen A. obliquus and C. vulgaris biomass were thawed prior to pre-treatment and BMP-testing. Among all BMP tests, the highest CH4 yields were achieved with untreated, freeze-thawed C. vulgaris biomass (406 dm3 kg−1); pre-treatment did not enhance CH4 yields for C. vulgaris, but for A. obliquus (ultrasonication +20%). Pre-treatment was more effective for cooled than freeze-thawed microalgal biomass and combined effects acted strain dependently. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Acutodesmus; Biochemical methane potential; Bioenergy; Chlorella; Photobioreactor; Scenedesmus","Algae; Biomass; Methane; Microorganisms; Photobioreactors; Thawing; Acutodesmus; Bio-energy; Biochemical methane potential; Chlorella; Photobiore-actor; Scenedesmus; Anaerobic digestion; anoxic conditions; bioenergy; biomass; bioreactor; digestibility; green alga; methane; microalga; Chlorella emersonii; Chlorella vulgaris; Scenedesmus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979498218

Based on two case studies (CS1/2) for Austria, potential benefits of material substitution in comparison to fuel substitution are analysed. GHG savings are calculated according to default IPCC approaches (Tier 2 method assuming first-order decay) and with more realistic approaches based on distribution functions. In CS1, high savings are achieved by using wood residues for the production of insulating boards instead of energy. The superiority of material substitution is due to the establishment of a long-term carbon storage, the high emission factor of wood in comparison to natural gas and higher efficiencies of gas-fired facilities. The biomass feedstock in CS2 is lignocellulosic ethanol being used for bio-ethylene production (material substitution) or replacing gasoline (fuel substitution). GHG savings are mainly due to lower production emissions of bio-ethylene in comparison to conventional ethylene and significantly lower than in CS1 (per unit of biomass consumed). While CS1 is highly robust to parameter variation, the long-term projections in CS2 are quite speculative. To create adequate incentives for including material substitution in national climate strategies, shortcomings of current default accounting methods must be addressed. Under current methods the GHG savings in both case studies would not (fully) materialize in the national GHG inventory. The main reason is that accounting of wood products is confined to the proportion derived from domestic harvest, whereas imported biomass used for energy is treated as carbon-neutral. Further inadequacies of IPCC default accounting methods include the assumption of exponential decay and the disregard of advanced bio-based products. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Carbon accounting; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy frameworks; Harvested wood products; Material substitution","alcohol; carbon; ethylene; gasoline; lignocellulose; natural gas; Article; Austria; biomass; biomass production; carbon accounting; carbon footprint; carbon storage; climate change; combustion; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; greenhouse gas; material substitution; plant residue; priority journal; wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978289415

In this paper, thermo-economic optimization of a hybrid air bottoming cycle (ABC) power plant is accomplished with the objective of minimizing the levelized cost of electricity. The aforementioned hybrid ABC optimization results are compared with a hybrid conventional combined cycle power plant to identify the most cost effective combined cycle configuration for a 50 MWe hybrid power plant.

In order to achieve these objectives and to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, research on various configurations or architectures of microgrid (µGrid) systems is gaining greater attention. This is occurring in step with increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) such as solar, wind and other micro-sources. Energy storage can also be a part of the µGrid architecture to ensure more stable and sustainable operation. The techno-economic viability of the µGrid system is also a point of concern. Again, the variable and uncontrollable behaviour of RES can also introduce power quality problems. To improve the systems reliability, efficiency and power quality, different µGrid architectures are introduced. Complex control of the µGrid controller is helping to overcome these conditions. In that case, integration of Custom Power Devices is also playing an important role. Therefore, µGrid policies should also deal with these issues in the light of future trends towards the Smart Grid. This paper presents a literature review, based on various existing and/or simulated µGrid architectures. In relation to the reliability, efficiency and power quality issues, different distribution systems have been introduced. The advantages and disadvantages of these configurations are discussed here.

They were fabricated by heat treatment (HT) of 37.5Li2O–25V2O5–37.5P2O5 mol% glass at 450 °C for different times in the air. XRD, SEM, and electrochemical methods were used to study the effect of HT time on the nanostructure and electrochemical performance for Li3V2(PO4)3 glass-ceramic nanocomposites electrodes. XRD patterns showed forming Li3V2(PO4)3 NASICON type with monoclinic structure. The crystalline sizes were found to be in the range of 32–56 nm. SEM morphologies exhibited non-uniform grains and changed with variation of HT time. The electrochemical performance of Li3V2(PO4)3 glass-ceramic nanocomposites was investigated by using galvanostatic charge/discharge methods, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The glass-ceramic nanocomposites annealed for 4 h, which had a lower crystalline size, exhibited the best electrochemical performance with a specific capacity of 116.4 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Small crystalline size supported the lithium ion mobility in the electrode by decreasing the ion diffusion pathway.

In order to implement this fuel, additional information regarding its safety and combustion behavior is needed. We report on an important safety parameter of UAN, namely the auto ignition temperature (AIT). The AIT was measured in an original experimental system based on an ASTM standard under applied pressure at different water contents. The water content impacts the crystallization temperature which allows utilization of the fuel at different weather conditions. Specifically, the role of water in stabilizing and inhibiting the ignition is demonstrated, where ignition occurs in a gaseous phase after nearly complete water evaporation. Additionally, the influence of initial pressure on the ignition process was investigated. The AIT increases with pressure due to the increased water vaporization temperature.

This paper proposes a dynamic economic emission dispatch (DEED) model incorporating high wind penetration considering its intermittency and uncertainty.

In the present study, molecular hydrogen physisorption energies (MHPEs) for finite saturated and unsaturated bumpy defected CNTs were calculated by density functional theory (DFT-D3) methods at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) theory level, with rigorous inclusion of van der Waals interactions. The calculated MHPEs for both regular and bumpy defected armchair, chiral and zigzag CNTs with similar diameters and lengths, with and without nitrogen doping, were compared in terms of Eph/H2, defined as the MHPE per hydrogen molecule adsorbed inside the nanotube. For all studied systems, Eph/H2 increased with the number of physisorbed hydrogen molecules. Nitrogen doping of regular and bumpy CNTs resulted in an increase in the Eph/H2 values, with the exception of bumpy chiral nanotubes. The results of this study demonstrate that bumpy defects are important nanotube structural features whose effects depend on nanotube chirality. For instance, bumpy defects were beneficial for undoped and doped zigzag nanotubes, resulting in a decrease in Eph/H2 values for regular structures from 0.5 and 0.74 to 0.26 and 0.42 eV, respectively. By contrast, for doped armchair regular structures with an Eph/H2 value of 0.38 eV, bumpy defects increased Eph/H2 to 0.45 eV.

This paper addresses three challenges to enable full scale application: (i) seasonality of casein whey production, (ii) slow start-up time and (iii) the large amount of manure used as a digestion aid. It is shown that casein whey, with manure as a digestion aid, can boost biogas production by 78% compared to digesting primary sludge alone. Seasonality of whey production can be overcome via ambient storage. While storage results in slightly lower specific biogas yield, it allows year round utilisation of casein whey. It was found that the digesters could be started at a primary sludge: whey: cow manure ratio of 100:50:10 for fresh whey and 100:70:10 for stored whey. These loadings of whey are much higher than previously reported for cheese whey which greatly reduces the time to reach full capacity. The volume of cow manure required to maintain a stable reactor was found to be as low as 1% of the amount of primary sludge which brings the cow manure requirements to a more viable level for full scale applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Anaerobic digestion; Casein whey; Co-digestion; Cow manure; Whey storage","Biogas; Casein; Cost effectiveness; Fertilizers; Manures; Sludge digestion; Ambient storage; Anaerobic co-digestion; Anaerobic sludge; Biogas production; Codigestion; Cow manure; Full-scale applications; High-energy waste; Anaerobic digestion; anoxic conditions; biogas; crop residue; digestion; equipment; manure; seasonality; sludge; storage; waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965156474

FAs that enter cardiomyocytes can be activated and directly oxidized within mitochondria (and peroxisomes) or they can be esterified and intracellularly deposited as triacylglycerol (TAG) often simply referred to as fat. An increase in cardiac TAG can be a signature of the diseased heart and may implicate a minor role of TAG synthesis and breakdown in normal cardiac energy metabolism. Often overlooked, the heart has an extremely high TAG turnover and the transient deposition of FAs within the cardiac TAG pool critically determines the availability of FAs as energy substrate and signaling molecules. We herein review the recent literature regarding the enzymes and co-regulators involved in cardiomyocyte TAG synthesis and catabolism and discuss the interconnection of these metabolic pathways in the normal and diseased heart.

The composites were prepared by melt blending. The EVA/EG composites showed ductile behavior, while brittle behavior was observed in the presence of wax. A finer dispersion of EG was observed in the matrix when wax was present. The storage modulus of the EVA/wax/EG composite was higher than that of the EVA/EG composite, which is ascribed to a better interaction between the EVA and the wax-covered EG that significantly reduced the EVA chain mobility. The composites showed a decrease in impact strength with increasing EG and wax contents. There was a significant difference in the elongation at break between the EVA/EG and EVA/wax/EG composites, and little change in Young's modulus of EVA in the presence of EG and with increasing EG content. However, Young's modulus of the EVA/wax blends increased in the presence of and with increasing EG content.

To implement this efficiently and effectively appropriate data collecting, processing and transmitting infrastructures are needed to be in place. Smart meters are used to measure the energy consumption details and patterns and transmit to meter data management system (MDMS) with the help of data aggregation units (DAU). The sheer amount of data need to be collected from the consumers are very huge and they fall under the category of big data. Currently, all the data collected from smart meters are stored in a centralized place for processing to forecast the energy demand. This approach is becoming a bottleneck for efficient data collection due to limited bandwidth capacities of Power Line Communication (PLC).

It has emerged as an attractive research problem due to possessing several desirable merits unlike other biometrics. However, most of the existing gait recognition methods that involve Gabor-based filters suffer from the curse of dimensionality, even with the use of a dimensionality reduction technique. This adds more computational and storage burdens and may cause difficulties to identify subjects with a high degree of confidence. In this paper a statistical gait recognition approach is proposed based on the analysis of overlapping Gabor-based regions. The Gait Energy Image (GEI) is first constructed from the gait sequence as a spatio-temporal summary. Then, the GEI image is convolved with a Gabor filter bank of 8 different orientations and 5 different scales. A statistical analysis is then applied to extract discriminative gait features from multi-overlapped Gabor-based regions. Consecutively, an SVM classifier is applied to measure the gait similarity and identify the subject. Comprehensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed approach and compare it to existing approaches. The results have shown that promising performance can be achieved with the proposed approach under a variety of scenarios. © 2015 IEEE.","Gabor filters; Gait recognition; GEI; Segmentation; Statistical analysis","Gabor filters; Gait analysis; Image segmentation; Statistical methods; Curse of dimensionality; Degree of confidence; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Gabor-based filter; Gait energy images; Gait recognition; Human identification; Research problems; Pattern recognition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994665934

The main idea in this work is to design a large PV system with almost zero cost of land needed for the installation, and without the need of batteries. The proposed PV system makes use of special areas of the Lebanese lands; the middle of high-ways which are usually left unoccupied without being exploited by any other business. This way, the traditional high cost of PV systems residing in the land and storage is eliminated. The fact that we do not need batteries in the proposed PV system results from the ability to connect the output power directly to the public utility grid. The design consists of 20,476 PV panels that cover the middle of the high-way extending from Tyre to Saida, with a distance of 27,300 meters and 2 meters wide. The resulting PV system has a capacity of 6.2 MW, and the total initial cost is ∼8.845 M$, however, after 25 years (which is the proposed lifetime of the PV system) the project would generate a total of ∼54.7 M$.

The constraints related to deployment, topology, and energy motivates much of the research activities related to the WSNs. In a network of thousands of sensor nodes, routing management and data exchange are expensive in terms of energy consumption and storage capacity. In fact, a sensor needs to store a lot of information to perform data routing. A lot of researchers have proposed clustering to minimize energy consumption by cutting the network into groups and routing captured information at different hierarchical levels. Clustering has been deeply investigated for energy savings in the WSNs. It has also the advantage of being an alternative to address scalability problems. However, building and maintaining a cluster structure requires an additional cost compared to flat networks. In this paper, we address the problem of maximizing the network lifetime by means of cluster formation and by assigning sensor nodes to cluster heads. We propose a multi-objective model for clustering that guarantees an optimal selection of cluster heads among sensor nodes with the highest residual energy while simultaneously minimizing the intra cluster distance. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model compared to existing ones. © 2016 IEEE.","Clustering; Energy saving; Linear program; Optimization; Wireless sensor networks","Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Information management; Linear programming; Mobile computing; Network routing; Optimization; Sensor nodes; Wireless telecommunication systems; Clustering; Linear programs; Multi-objective clustering; Multi-objective modeling; Research activities; Routing management; Scalability problems; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994078667

Some of these may become incorporated into the diet through the uptake of environmental contaminants by food plants and animals. Conversely, various nutrients and phytochemicals may be protective. Carotenoids, vitamin D, and selenium are among the best studied nutrients here. Various phytochemicals, including isothiocyanates such as sulforaphane or polyphenols such as genistein or curcumin, have differing mechanisms of promoting genomic stability.

The DC distribution reduces the number of power conversion steps by utilizing a DC voltage of 380V; it provides a significant reduction of cable dimensions and associated costs. Some server board vendors have recently begun to initialize a move from a supply voltage of 12Vdc to 48Vdc. In order to make use of the new preferred voltage used by these vendors, DC/DC converters are required. In regards to the high and increasing power consumption of data centres, it is essential that such power converters are highly efficient. This paper presents a new topology of a 3kW DC/DC converter (380Vdc-48Vdc) that boasts a conversion peak efficiency of 98.2%. The DC/DC converter is designed with a boost stage and an LLC DC/DC stage. As the converter is typically connected to a battery system consisting of 168 cells in a series, the converter can exploit the fact that the battery system provides 381Vdc in float operation. In normal float operation the DC input voltage is stable. This allows for the input voltage to be used directly as the DC link input to the LLC stage. That means that the BOOST-stage is not required in normal operation. However, during charge or discharge situations, the battery voltage may drop down to about 260Vdc, which would be too low as input voltage for an efficient LLC-stage. Therefore a BOOST stage is required to maintain a narrow band for voltage variations at the DC link from the BOOST-stage to the LLC-stage, in case of charge/discharge. The novelty of the proposed topology is therefore a built-in bypass switch, using a MOSFET, where the BOOST stage is bypassed in normal operation, but actively used in the case of a battery voltage lower than a certain threshold. © 2015 IEEE.","High Efficiency DC-DC converter; Topology combination; ZCS; ZVS","Electric inverters; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Secondary batteries; Static random access storage; Topology; Zero current switching; Associated costs; Battery voltages; Bypass switches; High-efficiency; Normal operations; Power conversion; Power distributions; Voltage variation; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990989623

This chapter concentrates on what, in opinion, appears to be the most feasible technology for large-scale integration in the next few years: the combination of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) with nonvolatile magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM). Importantly, the all-electrical magnetization manipulation in modern MRAM by spin transfer torque (STT) renders the wires for separate magnetic field generation superfluous and also significantly reduces the magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) switching energy. Promising spintronic solutions with respect to speed and power consumption have been able to compete with CMOS-only solutions. The resulting nonvolatile processing environment features a highly regular structure, is computationally complete, and reduces the information transport due to its shared buffers.

Axonopus compressus is a grass species that mostly found under shade condition of palm plantations and are easily adaptable with the ecosystem. As a part of the ecosystem, the grass would always carry on photosynthesis even under shade condition as encountered by Axonopus compressus. Thus, it might play an important role in storing carbon. Methodology: Therefore, in this study the capability of this grass in storing carbon were investigated including carbon storage dynamics, nitrogen content, C/N ratio and biomass production. In advanced, carbon and nitrogent content of soil were also studied. A completely randomized design was utilized as experimental design with different grass age of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days as the treatments. Results: Results indicated that grass age influenced significantly all parameters except carbon and nitrogen content as well as the C/N ratio of soil. Furthermore, it was also revealed that there is a dynamic of carbon storage in leaf, stemp and root of the grass. Conclusion: The capacity of the grass in storing carbon increased with increasing plant age. © 2016 I.

A regional integration of Europe, Eurasia and MENA energy systems will facilitate access to lower cost energy sources in neighboring regions, provide additional flexibility in the system and decrease the need in energy storage and increase the system stability because of more distributed generation. Additional demand from synthetic gas generation will additionally decrease the energy storage demand, additional flexibility enables the system to use lower cost energy sources and the primary energy generation cost decreases. Finally, such an integration can provide a sustainable and economically feasible energy system with total LCOE of about 50 €/MWh for the year 2030 cost assumptions. Even for a much higher energy demand in the system the total LCOE will be around 42 €/MWh - lower than coal-CCS or new nuclear options. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Carbon; Costs; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Sustainable development; System stability; Additional flexibilities; Carbon neutralities; Energy systems; Existing energies; Primary energies; Regional integration; Renewable energies; Transmission technologies; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991696904

This is mostly true for technologies and products required to meet the main societal needs, such as energy. In this case, gaps between supply and demand require strategies for energy conversion and storage, including thermal storage mostly based on phase change materials. Latent heat storage is also very versatile for thermal management and thermal control by allowing high storage density within narrow temperature ranges without strict dependence between stored thermal energy and temperature. Thus, this work addressed the main issues of latent heat storage from a materials selection perspective, based on expected requirements of applications in thermal energy storage or thermal regulation. Representative solutions for the kinetics of latent heat charge/discharge were used to derive optimization guidelines for high energy density, high power, response time (from fast response to thermal inertia), etc. The corresponding property relations were presented in graphical forms for a wide variety of prospective phase change materials, and for wide ranges of operating conditions, and accounting for changes in geometry and mechanisms. © 2016","PCM applications; PCM selection; Quality criteria; Thermal energy storage","Economics; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Heat storage; Latent heat; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Thermal variables control; Energy conversion and storages; High energy densities; High storage density; Materials selection; Narrow temperature ranges; Operating condition; Quality criteria; Stored thermal energy; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979609752

An efficient modelling strategy combines data-driven black-box identification and analytically derived white-box modelling for the purpose of predictive control. The validation of the resulting linear and hybrid energy supply models is done by an open loop simulation. Simulation results of the proposed control structure show excellent performance compared to the implemented conventional control strategy resulting in an increased usage of at least 50% of renewable energy sources, a cut in energy costs of about 50%, and an optimised operation of the active storage while accurately delivering the prescribed cooling power trajectory.

Two residential buildings with different levels of insulation and air-tightness have been modelled. This wide range of thermal properties covers the global performance of the residential building stock, and does not only focus on state-of-the-art buildings. Two strategies of modulation have been investigated: heat storage (i.e. increase of set-point) and heat conservation (i.e. decrease of set-point). Additionally, the effect of the time of activation and the type of emitter (radiator or underfloor heating) has been evaluated.A better understanding of the dynamic behaviour of buildings has been achieved in this paper. Contrary to other storage solutions (e.g. battery, hot water tank), the modulation potential of the thermal mass depends on several factors (level of insulation, type of emitter, etc) and varies over time (cold vs. transition season). The autonomy of a poorly-insulated building is relatively short, whereas passive houses have a long time constant. This characteristic implies differences in the control strategy to make use of the flexibility potential without violating comfort. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand-side management; Energy flexibility; Heat conservation; Heat storage; Radiator; Thermal mass; Underfloor heating","Demand side management; Electric utilities; Heat storage; Heating; Housing; Modulation; Radiators; Thermal insulation; Water tanks; Dynamic behaviours; Energy flexibility; Global performance; Heat conservation; Residential building; Residential building stocks; Thermal mass; Underfloor heating; Buildings; autonomy; building; demand-side management; heating; insulation; performance assessment; residential energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975459970

In such cases, there is much uncertainty regarding the effect of solar penetration on electricity prices to consumers and on the reduction of electricity demand from the grid. The penetration of solar in the residential sector - which in some cases accounts for about 40% of the country's total electricity demand - may have a tremendous impact on incumbent utilities and the industry as a whole. Much research has been devoted to assessing the effect of policy on the diffusion of renewables but not much work about the developing world is known, particularly in those nations where institutional arrangements do not favour these technologies. Using system dynamics, this paper examines these issues, considering the diffusion of rooftop solar both with a battery support system, and also without any type of storage system.

This behavior changed at longer illumination times, where the emission was dominated by the F8BT-rich phase; i.e., the topography and PL were correlated. Using macroscopic investigation of the mechanisms that govern the PL, we could explain the time dependence of the PL spatial distribution: while the degradation of F8BT was driven by photobleaching, both faster absorption degradation and photobleaching processes dominate the degradation of PFO.

However, several risks are associated with the use of this strong acid and therefore an alternative is required to protect the health of farmers and animals. The effects of five different additives at two target pH values, 5.5 and 3.5, on the composition of two different slurries (pig and dairy) were assessed. The evolution of pH and NH3 volatilization from acidified and non-Acidified slurries, kept in closed vessels at an ambient temperature of 15 °C, was followed during a storage period of 60 days. Acidification to pH 5.5 with all additives significantly reduced NH3 emissions, and the greatest decreases relative to raw slurry were obtained with H2SO4 (75% in pig and 81% in dairy slurry) and alum (69% in pig and 87% in dairy slurry). Acidification to pH 3.5 reduced NH3 emissions in both slurries to values considered negligible during the whole storage period. However, longer storage periods should be studied to evaluate NH3 evolution and slurry composition in the longer-Term. Sulfuric acid and alum were the additives which could be used in the lowest amounts to decrease the pH to 5.5 and were the most efficient in reducing NH3 emissions. Acidification promoted P solubilization, except when alum was used. Nevertheless, this initial solubilization of P when the pH was decreased to 5.5 had been reversed after two weeks of storage. In conclusion, alum can be considered as a good alternative to H2SO4 when the pH is lowered to 5.5, as the amount of this additive used was similar to that of H2SO4 and it was as efficient as H2SO4 with respect to reducing NH3 volatilization during storage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Acidification; Ammonia; Slurry treatment; Storage","Acidification; Additives; Energy storage; Health risks; Mammals; Solubility; Sulfuric acid; Ammonia emissions; Closed vessels; Concentrated sulfuric acids; Dairy slurry; P solubilization; Slurry treatment; Storage periods; Strong acids; Ammonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973617003

Herein, we present a new strategy of integrating a redox species-based electrolyte in batteries to boost their performance. Taking the olivine LiFePO4-based battery as an example, the incorporation of redox species (i.e., polysulfide of Li2S8) in the electrolyte results in much lower polarization and superior stability, where the dissociated Li+/Sx 2- can significantly speed up the lithium diffusion. More importantly, the presence of the S8 2-/S2- redox reaction further contributes extra capacity, making a completely new LiFePO4/Li2Sx hybrid battery with a high energy density of 1124 Wh kgcathode -1 and a capacity of 442 mAh gcathode -1.

An evacuated solar collector with hot water storage tank would be installed after the compressor to increase coefficient of performance (COP) of the system at full load. Solar energy and waste energy are fully utilized so less power would be required to run compressor, this is turn allows for smaller compressor to be installed that offer even better savings on power consumption. The proposed system delivers higher system efficiency owing to the higher refrigeration effect in the direct expansion evaporator. According to calculation results, the refrigeration effect of proposed method is increased than that of conventional method. The decreased in mass flow rate is due to increased refrigeration effect and a decrease in compressor work (increased COP). Thus, the novel development is expecting for improvement of energy efficiency, enhancement of the system performance while fulfilling the cooling demand. Consequently, this system can be saved around 40% of electrical energy. © 2016 IEEE.","Air conditioning system; C.O.P; Savings on power consumption; Smaller compressor; Solar thermal energy","Air conditioning; Compressors; Electric power utilization; Energy conservation; Refrigeration; Solar energy; Solar heating; Thermal energy; C.O.P; Coefficient of Performance; Direct expansion evaporators; Energy efficiency improvements; Hot water storage tanks; Performance enhancements; Solar thermal energy; Theoretical investigations; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988892011

The Data Center Networking (DCN) holds a pivotal role, and it needs to be scalable and efficient to connect the growing number of servers so as to handle the intensive demands in cloud computing. Recently there has been a rapidly growing literature on DCNs which focuses on studying how to model and evaluate the resource provisioning and allocation algorithms for more effective and efficient resource management of cloud systems. Unfortunately there is not much work to reveal how the underlying network topological connectivity can affect the overlay DCNs performance in aspects such as energy consumption and service resilience. There is a saying that, it is not what you know i.e., the algorithm itself but who you know i.e., connectivity, which argues that people get ahead in life based on their connections, not on their skills or knowledge, and every day offers evidence of this aphorism. This case also applies to DCNs. DCNs performance is not merely a function of resource provisioning and allocation, but also it is a network-wide activity. The structure and ties that links a data center to other data centers are also critical factors. In this paper, we are paving a new developing line of research on revealing the roles of network topological characteristics to foster more sustainable DCNs in terms of resource efficiency and service resilience.

The energy supply of BEMS consists of combined heat and power (CHP), an auxiliary boiler, an absorption chiller, and power grids. Previous research related to CHP for BEMS provides optimal operation to minimize total operating cost (TOC) and total CO2 emission (TCOE), but their operation releases waste heat. In this paper, we propose to add a thermal energy storage (TES) which aims to utilize the waste heat. TES constraint is taken into account of dispatch strategy. Then, we design economic and environmental optimal operation with the objective functions defined as TOC and TCOE, respectively. We evaluate the optimal dispatch with a case study of large shopping mall to demonstrate energy efficiency improvement. The numerical results manifest that the proposed dispatch of cogeneration with TES can reduce 4.15% and 1.85% of TOC and 5.25% and 6.25% of TCOE under economic and environmental optimal operation compared to the previous dispatch of cogeneration without TES. © 2016 IEEE.","building energy management system; Combined heat and power generation; energy efficiciency; thermal energy storgae","Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Electric load dispatching; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy storage; Heat storage; Thermal energy; Waste heat; Absorption chillers; Auxiliary boilers; Building energy management systems; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power generation; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy-efficiciency; Objective functions; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988810075

The high-rate contact stabilization (HiCS) has been proposed as a promising primary treatment technology with which to maximize redirection of organics to sludge for subsequent energy recovery. It utilizes a feast-famine cycle to select for bioflocculation, intracellular storage, or both. We optimized the HiCS process for organics recovery and characterized different biological pathways of organics removal and recovery. A total of eight HiCS reactors were operated at 15 °C at short solids retention times (SRT; 0.24-2.8 days), hydraulic contact times (tc; 8 and 15 min), and stabilization times (ts; 15 and 40 min). At an optimal SRT between 0.5 and 1.3 days and tc of 15 min and ts of 40 min, the HiCS system oxidized only 10% of influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) and recovered up to 55% of incoming organic matter into sludge. Storage played a minor role in the overall COD removal, which was likely dominated by aerobic biomass growth, bioflocculation onto extracellular polymeric substances, and settling. The HiCS process recovers enough organics to potentially produce 28 kWh of electricity per population equivalent per year by anaerobic digestion and electricity generation.

This simulation entails the modeling of four main components: an electrochemical hydrogen production cell with a thermal model, electrochemical compression and storage, and optimal car fueling. In the electrochemical cell model, an equivalent circuit for the PEM electrolyzer is built to compute the total electric energy needed for a certain demand of hydrogen. Moreover, the effect of temperature on the efficiency of the electrolyzer is modeled and accounts for the energy exchange process and temperature increase or decrease during electrolysis. Furthermore, a cooling system was developed in order to maintain the cell at optimum operating conditions, and thus operate at maximum efficiency. The hydrogen produced needs to be compressed because of its low volumetric density before it can be used for fuel cell cars. The compression is carried out using an electrochemical compressor. The advantages of this compressor are highlighted and its operation is compared to that of a mechanical compressor regarding efficiency and stability. Furthermore, the issue of back hydrogen diffusion in the compressor is analyzed and its effect on the efficiency of the system assessed; this effect was modeled for different types of membranes of different thicknesses.

Pressure reduction and thermal stimulation have been dominating the research into production methods over the latest decades. More recently, a novel approach has emerged based on conversion of in situ methane hydrate to carbon dioxide-dominated hydrate through injection of carbon dioxide. This work applied the free energy analysis to determine whether addition of nitrogen into the injection mixture would result in a win-win situation of simultaneous methane production and safe long term storage of CO2. Our evaluation of data from two permafrost and two offshore fields indicates that injection of carbon dioxide at concentrations exceeding 50 mol % and pressures ranging between 9 and 25 MPa will result in formation of new carbon dioxide-dominated hydrate for all of these fields. While only reservoir simulations implementing reliable thermodynamic models can verify whether given injection will result in substantial storage of carbon dioxide in the form of hydrate, thermodynamic models developed in this work have their own significance. Pressure and temperature dependencies of hydrate stability have frequently been reported in studies of hydrates in sediments as the only criteria. Extending these criteria to include the concentration dependency will make it possible to implement an efficient free energy minimization scheme able to probe local phase distributions. Since one of four hydrate reservoirs used in our thermodynamic analysis is located in Alaska, we have also investigated the upper limit of water that can be tolerated during transport under extreme conditions prevailing the winter seasons in this region. It was found that hydrate formation triggered by water adsorbing on rusty surfaces will dominate the tolerance limit, which will correspond to practically zero water concentration. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide hydrate; Carbon dioxide storage; Methane hydrates; Methane production; Nitrogen","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Free energy; Hydration; Methane; Natural gas deposits; Natural gasoline plants; Nitrogen; Offshore oil well production; Permafrost; Stability criteria; Thermoanalysis; Carbon dioxide hydrates; Carbon dioxide storage; Free energy analysis; Free energy minimization; Methane hydrates; Methane production; Pressure and temperature; Thermo dynamic analysis; Gas hydrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027918958

The incorporation of this technique has helped to reduce the root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to 0.51 kWh/m2/day, hence obtaininga reduction of 0.11 kWh/m2/day of the RMSE (-16%) compared to the MLP model without preprocessing of the stationarity developed in advance. This optimization has significantly improved the prediction of the daily solar irradiation. It has set the present MLP model among the best predictors studied in the many recent researches in the literature. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Energy supply management; Multilayer perceptron model; Prediction; Renewable energy; Smart grid; Solar energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999026022

The dosemeters are read in a Harshaw 6600 TLD reader. In the process of accreditation for the ISO 17025 standard(1), different influence factors are investigated and the uncertainty has been determined. The Individual Monitoring Service Laboratory-LAEC reads the dosemeters once it receives them from the customer, and new cards are immediately given for the next wearing period. The wearing period is 2 months. The dosemeter results are reported to the customers without background subtraction. Both Hp(10) and Hp(0.07) are reported. For this paper, only the uncertainty on Hp(10) will be focussed. The following factors are taken into account for the uncertainty: calibration factor, dosemeter homogeneity and repeatability, energy and angular dependence, non-linearity, temperature dependence, etc. Also the detection limit was determined. One of the important factors is the correction for fading. This fading correction depends on the procedure used such as storage temperatures, the time-temperature profile of the read-out, pre-heat and annealing conditions. Pre- and post-irradiation fading curves were measured for a storage period up to 182 d at room temperature (15-25°C). The resulting final combined standard uncertainty on the reported doses is of the order of 24 % for doses of ~1 mSv. © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

The ability to compute, process, and retain information in parallel, without referencing other circuit elements, offers enhanced speed, storage density, energy efficiency, and functionality benefits. A novel crossbar microwire-based device consisting of Nb/NbO/Pt structure that exhibits neural synapse-like adaptive conductivity (i.e., synaptic plasticity) is presented. The neuromorphic memristive junction, formed at the interface between the Pt metal wire and the thermally annealed core-shell Nb-NbO wire, demonstrates 1000 times conductivity change with an effective continuum of resistance levels. The device can also be fully activated to display standard resistance switching between two states. In the subthreshold regime, the voltage flux applied through the ∼400 nm thick NbO junction is shown to have a linear relationship to the charge produced within the device. The conductance value G is a function of the total flux history applied. The linear flux-charge relationship is exploited to demonstrate the voltage-pulse invariance. This suggests that only the integrated flux produced during a voltage-pulse application determines the charge generated within the junction, regardless of the operational parameters like voltage amplitude and time interval. Variation in current onset voltage as a function of flux is discussed with reference to carrier extraction at the intrinsically doped metal-semiconductor interface. The observed flux invariance has implications in emerging neuromorphic semiconductor hardware. Enabling pulse stimuli to be designed to have equal flux through the device from nonvoltage sources such as light may increase functionality in bioinspired computing and applications. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Digital devices; Display devices; Electric potential; Energy efficiency; Niobium; Niobium oxide; Platinum; Reconfigurable hardware; Semiconducting silicon; Semiconductor devices; Bio-inspired computing; Conductivity changes; Linear relationships; Metal semiconductor interface; Operational parameters; Resistance switching; Silicon-based technology; Synaptic plasticity; Semiconductor junctions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984870957

The pump was powered by air-steam which was produced from a flat-plate solar collector (SC) coupled with a supplementary heat source. The HBWP system with 9 L capacity comprised an SC, an overhead tank (OT), a storage tank (ST), a heat source tank (HST), a liquid piston tank (LT), and a one-way valve. A one-meter discharge head and 1-3 m suction heads were tested. The LT was initially filled with 10% air and 90% water. The pump could run automatically. It was found that for suction heads of 1 and 3 m, the total pump efficiency was around 0.012-0.027%, and the thermal efficiency was around 32.5-36.3%. The pump could suck around 7-8 L/cycle. The average temperature of pumped water was around 42.9-46.7°C, which is sufficiently high for residential use. It was concluded that the suction heads affected the pump efficiency. Increasing air amount in the system could reduce some energy consumption. Moreover, a heat source thermal water pump (HSWP) was tested. The pump capacity was expanded to 240 L. The energy input was taken from only one heat source. System operation was controlled by hand. Suction heads of 1, 3, and 5 m were tested. It was found that the pump could suck around 192.2-218.8 L/cycle and had more pump efficiency than the smaller pump with hybrid energy. However, the HSWP is more essential for agriculture in the rural area. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Flat plate collector; Hot water; Hybrid energy; Low grade heat; Thermal water pump","Energy utilization; Solar collectors; Tanks (containers); Water; Flat-plate collector; Hot water; Hybrid energy; Low grade heat; Thermal waters; Pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983035702

The formulation of the least-cost design problem started by deterministic modeling and later by more sophisticated stochastic models that incorporate uncertainties related to the problem's parameters. Recently, a new nonprobabilistic modeling, titled the robust counterpart (RC) approach, has been developed for the least-cost design problem to incorporate the uncertainty without the need for full stochastic information. These nonprobabilistic methods, developed in the field of robust optimization, were shown to be advantageous over classical stochastic methods in the following aspects: tractability and computation time, nonnecessity of full probabilistic information, and the ability to integrate correlation of uncertain parameters aspects without adding complexity. Former studies have considered the RC approach for a special case of the least-cost problem with a single load demand uncertainty, and single gravitational source to simplify the problem formulation and facilitate the use of the method. This special case does not handle the joint temporal and spatial correlations between the problem uncertainties and does not include components such as pumping stations and storage facilities. These new components require trading off capital and operation (i.e., energy) costs in the objective function, as the design cost is explicitly influenced by the demand uncertainty, unlike the situation where only capital cost is considered. In this study, the RC approach is expanded to cover the general least-cost design problem, including (1) multiload patterns, (2) pumping stations, and (3) storage facilities. The unknowns are the pipe diameters, pump and tank capacities, and the heads added by the pumping stations. The problem is solved using the cross-entropy method for several possible protection levels, which are defined by the size of the uncertainty set. The results are demonstrated on two examples to show the trade-off between cost and reliability and test the network's ability to cope with unexpected scenarios. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Optimal design; Robust optimization; Uncertainty; Water distribution systems","Costs; Economic and social effects; Optimization; Pumping plants; Pumps; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Deterministic modeling; Non-probabilistic methods; Optimal design; Probabilistic information; Robust design optimization; Robust optimization; Temporal and spatial correlation; Uncertainty; Water distribution systems; design; distribution system; loading; numerical model; optimization; uncertainty analysis; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982299935

A finite element model is developed to simulate a VCM with different beams applying a harmonic analysis. The VCM is extracted from a recycled hard disk drive (HDD) and a parametric modal analysis is performed to identify the material parameters of the HDD and the beam. These parameters are obtained comparing the real vibration modes and natural frequencies (VCM-beam) with those determined from the finite element model. A numerical-experimental case study is carried out to demonstrate that if a beam is designed for a specific low frequency vibration between 0 and 10Hz, the displacements are maximized in the VCM. For this purpose, real acceleration measurements taken from three individuals are used to provide the vibration signals in the numerical model. A beam is designed for one of the individuals using the natural frequency values determined from the measured signals. Results show that the displacements are maximized in the model which coincides with the natural frequency of the chosen individual. The main purpose of this research is to establish a design tool for energy harvesting purposes with VCM based on low frequency vibration sources as for example gait motions. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","energy harvesting; finite element analysis; Hard disk drive; HDD; modal analysis; VCM; voice coil motor; Wiimote","Energy harvesting; Hard disk storage; Modal analysis; Natural frequencies; Position control; Vibration analysis; Hard Disk Drive; Inductive transducers; Low-frequency vibration; Material parameter; Numerical approaches; Numerical experimental; Voice coil motors; Wiimote; Finite element method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979713827

Wastewater treatment works (WWTWs) are major stressors in urban environments and are associated with high levels of pollutants that bioaccumulate and elicit stress responses in animals such as bats. Stress responses are linked with increased metabolic rate and may result in energy store depletion. In this study we measured the effects of WWTWs on energy stores and leptin levels in the insectivorous bat, Neoromicia nana. Energy stores including glucose, glycogen, lipids and proteins were measured in the storage tissues (liver and pectoral muscles) and blood of bats. Further, lactic acid was measured in the pectoral muscles to provide an indirect measure of anaerobic respiration and stress. Leptin, the hormone associated with satiation, and hypoxia inducible factor 1α (Hif-1α) were measured in the interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBrAT). Bats caught at WWTWs exhibited significantly higher pectoral glucose and lactic acid concentrations than bats at reference sites, indicating a stress induced increase in glucose demand and increased reliance on gluconeogenesis to fuel this response. However, glycogen, lipid and protein stores were not depleted in WWTW bats. This may be due to their fat-rich diet at WWTW sites. Moreover, this high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) diet may be responsible for the unexpectedly high leptin levels in WWTW bats. Lactic acid concentrations were elevated in the pectoral muscles of bats at WWTW sites, indicating some degree of oxidative stress although there was no increase in iBrAT Hif-1α levels. These results show that in the face of environmental stresses, N. nana is able to maintain energy stores. © 2016 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde","Chiroptera; Energy stores; Leptin; Neoromicia nana; Pollutants; Wastewater treatment works","anoxic conditions; anthropogenic effect; bat; bioaccumulation; blood; cells and cell components; energy budget; environmental stress; fatty acid; glucose; hormone; metabolism; muscle; organic compound; protein; respiration; sugar; wastewater; water treatment; Animalia; Chiroptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979645654

Contrary to great proportion of the literature, efficacy of the controller is demonstrated by real machine implementation equipped with online fuel consumption measurement system. The main control objective of the devised controller is to minimise consumed fuel per travelled distance. Control commands are determined utilizing steady-state equations of the system, which facilitates real-time implementation. Dynamic situations are addressed with auxiliary functions running at higher frequency than the fuel economy part of the controller. The machine is a 5-ton wheel loader with pure HSD and no energy storage devices installed. In addition, all the components are commercially available. Thus, structure of the HSD and presented improvements in fuel economy are comparable to commercial machines and retrofitting existing drive-by-wire machinery with proposed controller will require little cost. The optimal controller is compared to a rule-based alternative that is based on a control method utilized in commercial wheel loaders. In autonomously driven drive cycles, measured total fuel consumption reduced up to 16.6% with the devised controller.

In this study, either a hydrogen vehicle (HV) or an electric vehicle (EV) is integrated into a renewable-supported building system with appropriate control strategies. The focused variables in this study are renewable energy capacities, vehicle system options, extents to utilize vehicle storages for domestic purposes, and the Excess REe-HW recharging strategies. The analysing aspects include the energy and environmental impact as well as the energy matching and the grid interactions. The results show that the annual net-zero energy/emission balance can be met by a 16, 12, and 12 kW rated wind turbine, or by a 195.8, 160.2, and 142.4 m2 PV, for the building with the HV, the EV and no vehicle (NV), respectively. The building with the HV will be more demanding in meeting the balance due to the less efficient HV system than that with the EV. Moreover, better matching for the zero-energy system can be achieved by relieving the condition to discharge the vehicle storages for domestic usages and by using the Excess REe-HW recharging strategy. However, their negative effect will be a slight increase in the annual net-energy consumption, due to an increased loss from both the HV/EV integrated system and the thermal storage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Electric vehicle; Grid interactions; Hydrogen vehicle; Matching analysis; Zero energy building; Zero energy system","Buildings; Crashworthiness; Electric discharges; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Heat storage; Vehicles; Wind turbines; Grid interaction; Hydrogen vehicles; Matching analysis; Zero energies; Zero energy building (ZEB); Electric machine control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975295534

On discharge, atmospheric oxygen is reduced at the positive electrode which, in the ideal case, forms the discharge products in a reversible cell reaction. In Na-O2 batteries upon discharge either sodium peroxide (Na2O2) or sodium superoxide (NaO2) is reported to be formed. So far, the charge carrier transport remains relatively unexplored but is expected to crucially determine the efficiency of such energy storage systems. Na2O2 is predicted to be an electrical insulator wherein the transport presumably is determined by very slow hopping processes. Understanding the basic fundamental properties of the overall charge carrier transport, including also nanostructured forms of Na2O2, is key to developing high-energy metal oxygen batteries. The present study answers the question how overall, i.e., total, conductivity changes when going from microcrystalline to nanocrystalline, defect-rich Na2O2. Nanocrystalline Na2O2 was prepared via a top-down approach, viz by high-energy ball milling. Milling does not only shrink the average crystallite diameter but also introduces a large amount of defects which are anticipated to influence total conductivity. It turned out that even after vigorous mechanical treatment the conductivity of the sample is only increased by ca. one order of magnitude. The activation energy remains almost untouched. Thus, the increase seen might be attributed to an enhanced number of charge carriers. Low-temperature data reveals nearly constant loss relaxation behavior which has frequently explained in terms of strictly localized electrical relaxation processes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nowadays, one of the most efficient energy carrier is the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). Following this trend, Argentina began to import LNG to be regasified and injected into the existing gas network. The conversion from liquid to gas can be done using onshore facilities or regasification ships moored at specially designed docks for this purpose. In this case, Floating Storage and Regasification Units (FSRU) were chosen to satisfy quickly the increasing demand. At this moment, Argentina has two injection sites, one located at Ing. White port (Bahía Blanca) and one at Escobar port (Escobar), both in Buenos Aires province. However, to satisfy the long term demand, new projects of onshore plants are being considered in Bahía Blanca. This paper considers different aspects included in the risk based land use planning. In order to determine the most appropriate place for the construction of LNG terminals, Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) techniques are used to complement social and environmental studies. Two alternative operation sites in the Bahía Blanca estuary are analyzed. The first one is located at Cuatreros port, near General Cerri city and the second at Rosales port, near Punta Alta city. Advantages and disadvantages such as the presence of other industrial facilities, distance to populated areas, evacuation routes, social and environmental factors and distance to be traveled by the regasified LNG in the ducts are discussed. As for the onshore accident risks, it can be concluded that both locations are possible if appropriate preventive measures should be taken in each location. However, other environmental considerations like the route of the ship into the estuary and the need for dredging identify Rosales port as the most suitable location. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental considerations; LNG; Plant siting; QRA","Decision making; Land use; Liquefied natural gas; Location; Natural gas; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Ship conversion; Ships; Decision making tool; Environmental considerations; Floating storage and regasification units; Industrial facilities; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Plant siting; Quantitative risk analysis; Social and environmental; Floating liquefied natural gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971421799

By implementing a non-equilibrium thermodynamic module into RCB, we added another route for hydrate-phase transitions towards CO2 in the aqueous phase as well as in the water phase. We also considered hydrate instability due to the undersaturation of CO2 in the contacting water phase. As a kinetic model, we used classical nucleation theory, where the phase transitions were treated as non-equilibrium processes under the local constraint of mass and heat fluxes. We verified CO2-hydrate formation and dissociation by observing supersaturation and undersaturation with respect to the thermodynamics variables, CO2 mole-fraction, pressure, and temperature. We determined competing hydrate phase transitions by investigating the Gibbs free-energy differences between hydrate and parent phases (origin of hydrate formers), and we calculated the energy differences from variations in the chemical potentials, which were estimated using non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

However, the implementation of renewable energy has many complex problems not easily solved with conventional methods. Recently, Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithms, have been widely used to deal with these problems in the field of Renewable Energy. Nevertheless, issues with a degree of uncertainty need Bayesian Networks since this is one of the most effective theories to face them. This technique can contribute to the Renewable Energy harnessing and other open issues on this field. In this work we show the state of the art of the applications of Bayesian Networks in Renewable Energy, such as solar thermal, photovoltaic, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric energies and biomass. Additionally, we include related topics such as energy storage, smart grids and energy assessment. We classify the literature by areas considering three main subjects: resource evaluation, operation, and applications, and in each section we describe the possible directions to be taken in the research of the field. We find that the main applications are done for forecasting, fault diagnosis, maintenance, operation, planning, sizing and risk management. We conclude that Bayesian Networks are a promising tool for the field of Renewable Energy with potential applications due to their versatility. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and has become the most common chronic liver disease in large parts of the world. The adipose tissue expansion and hepatic fat accumulation characteristics of these disorders compromise local oxygen homeostasis. The resultant tissue hypoxia induces adaptive responses to restore oxygenation and tissue metabolism and cell survival. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) function as master regulators of this hypoxia adaptive response, and are in turn hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). PHDs are the main cellular oxygen sensors and regulate HIF proteasomal degradation in an oxygen-dependent manner. HIFs and PHDs are implicated in numerous physiological and pathological conditions. Extensive research using genetic models has revealed that hypoxia signaling is also a key mechanism in adipose tissue dysfunction, leading to adipose tissue fibrosis, inflammation and insulin resistance. Moreover, hypoxia affects liver lipid metabolism and deranges hepatic lipid accumulation. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms through which the hypoxia adaptive response affects adipocyte and hepatic metabolism, and the therapeutic possibilities of modulating HIFs and PHDs in obesity and fatty liver disease. © 2016, Springer International Publishing.","Angiogenesis; Hypoxia; Hypoxia inducible factor; Lipid metabolism; Obesity; Oxygen homeostasis","adenine nucleotide translocase; cre recombinase; glucose transporter 4; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; hypoxia inducible factor 1beta; hypoxia inducible factor 2alpha; lipid binding protein; procollagen proline 2 oxoglutarate 4 dioxygenase; vasculotropin; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; oxygen; procollagen proline 2 oxoglutarate 4 dioxygenase; adipocyte; angiogenesis; brown adipose tissue; cell survival; energy yield; human; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative phosphorylation; oxygen tension; pandemic; pathogenesis; protein degradation; protein expression; Review; signal transduction; upregulation; white adipose tissue; adipose tissue; chemistry; hypoxia; metabolism; nonalcoholic fatty liver; obesity; pathology; physiology; Adipose Tissue; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Humans; Hypoxia; Lipid Metabolism; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Obesity; Oxygen; Prolyl Hydroxylases; Signal Transduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964334448

Solar stills are capable of producing fresh water during day hours and the production becomes zero after sunset. In this study detailed modeling of water desalination involving PCM that stores energy during day time and emits it during night time is theoretically investigated. The effect of various parameters such as the PCM type through its melting point, PCM quantity, feed-water flow rate, and solar irradiation on the productivity of the unit expressed as the amount of fresh water produced per day is theoretically investigated. The results showed that the presence of PCM with 40 °C melting point maintains higher water temperatures after sunset but negatively affects the productivity. Decreasing the feed flow rate from 10 L/hr to 1 L/hr improved the fresh water productivity by 49%. When the maximum solar intensity increased from 400 to 1000 W/m2, the fresh water productivity increased from 0.75 L/day to 2.1 L/day.

However, these new technologies are in many cases dependent on various metals. This analysis evaluates the need for special metals and compares it with known resources in order to find possible bottlenecks in the market. The time perspective of the analysis reaches to the year 2050.Following technologies have been selected for evaluation: solar electricity, wind power, fuel cells, batteries, electrolysis, hydrogen storages, electric cars and energy efficient lighting. The metals investigated belong either to the semiconductors, platinum group metals, rare earth metals or are other critical metals like silver and cobalt. The global transition of the energy sector is modelled with TIMES. According to the results the most critical market situation will be found in silver.

Besides CO2 capture in large emission point sources, the capture of this pollutant from atmosphere may be required due to significant contribution of diffuse sources. The technologies that remove CO2 from atmosphere (creating a negative balance of CO2) are called negative emission technologies. Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage may play an important role for CO2 mitigation. It represents the combination of bioenergy production and carbon capture and storage, keeping carbon dioxide in geological reservoirs. Algae have a high potential as the source of biomass, as they present high photosynthetic efficiencies and high biomass yields. Their biomass has a wide range of applications, which can improve the economic viability of the process. Thus, this paper aims to assess the atmospheric CO2 capture by algal cultures. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Atmospheric CO2 capture; Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage; Microalgae; Negative emission technologies; Ocean Macroalgal Afforestation","Algae; Biomass; Carbon capture; Climate change; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Reforestation; Atmospheric CO; Bio-energy; Emission technology; Micro-algae; Ocean Macroalgal Afforestation; Carbon dioxide; biofuel; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; afforestation; atmospheric pollution; bioenergy; biomass; carbon dioxide; climate change; concentration (composition); global warming; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; microalga; afforestation; alga; anaerobic digestion; Article; atmosphere; bioenergy; biomass; carbon footprint; carbon sink; climate change; fish; greenhouse gas; harvesting; macroalga; microalga; nonhuman; photosynthesis; priority journal; recycling; sea; seaweed; animal; bioreactor; carbon sequestration; chemistry; climate change; geology; human; metabolism; microbiology; plant; algae; Animals; Atmosphere; Biofuels; Biomass; Bioreactors; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Geology; Humans; Plants; Seaweed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961221414

Six months is the recommended time for hygienization and use of urine as fertilizer. Compounds were spiked in urine as concentrations calculated to appear in urine. Assays were performed with separate compounds and as therapeutic groups of antivirals, antibiotics and anti-tuberculotics. In addition, urine was amended either with faeces or urease inhibitor. The pharmaceutical concentrations were monitored from filtered samples with solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography. The concentration reductions of the studied compounds as such or with amendments ranged from less than 1% to more than 99% after six-month storage. The reductions without amendments were 41.9–99% for anti-tuberculotics; <52% for antivirals (except with 3TC 75.6%) and <50% for antibiotics. In assays with amendments, the reductions were all <50%. Faeces amendment resulted in similar or lower reduction than without it even though bacterial activity should have increased. The urease inhibitor prevented ureolysis and pH rise but did not affect pharmaceutical removal.

The emergence of Small-to-medium-sized (SMEs) industry sectors is seen as an opportunity for socioeconomic growth. Hence, it requires mainstreaming sustainability and energy efficiency at its core. Several policy instruments have been implemented to support industrial energy efficiency in Zimbabwe, including awareness, regulations, and voluntary standards such as International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) energy management systems standard ISO 50001 and economic instruments. Several challenges exist that affect widespread adoption of energy efficient technologies including implementation of policy framework for energy efficiency, ageing equipment, inadequate funding mechanisms, limited information, few economic incentives for SMEs to invest in energy efficiency, low technical capability of SMEs to implement energy efficiency, limited institutional sustainability of agencies involved in promotion of energy efficiency, and low uptake of energy management standards. This study focuses on the challenges and opportunities for resource efficiency and presents strategies for improvement. In order to enhance green industry and increase adoption in SMEs, there is need to strengthen institutions involved in resource efficiency, improve funding mechanisms, strengthen industrial clusters, promote energy service companies (ESCOs) and energy efficiency networking forums, create funding schemes for SMEs, provide training and capacity building, increase demonstration projects, strengthen the role of independent energy service providers, and improve national collaboration of stakeholders. In conclusion, Zimbabwe has greater potential to contribute towards a green economy through implementing energy efficiency in SMEs. WIREs Energy Environ 2016, 5:510–518. doi: 10.1002/wene.203.

The stacks were deposited by reactive radiofrequency magnetron sputtering on Si substrates with thermal SiO2 with a thickness ranging from 2 to 5 nm. Both types of stacks show negative initial oxide charge and its density is higher for HfO2-based structures. Memory window up to 6V at sweeping voltage range of ± 16V was obtained for HfO2-based stacks. The hysteresis in these structures is mainly due to a trapping of electrons injected from the Si substrate. The charge-trapping properties of ZrO2-based samples are compromised by the high leakage currents and the dielectric breakdown. The conduction through the capacitors at low applied voltages results from hopping of thermally excited electrons from one isolated state to another. The energy depth of the traps participating in the hopping conduction was determined as ~ 0.7 eV for the HfO2-based layers and ~ 0.6 eV for ZrO2-based ones, originating from negatively charged oxygen vacancies. At high electric fields, the current voltage characteristics were interpreted in terms of space charge limited currents, Fowler–Nordheim tunneling, Schottky emission, and Poole–Frenkel mechanism.

Low supply temperatures enables the use of heat from renewable and alternative sources, currently been neglected due to the usually high supply temperatures used in conventional district heating systems. Further on, low network temperatures are supporting the reduction of operational and investment costs. The paper describes the development of economically and ecologically optimized concepts for low temperature district heating networks using four representative case studies in Austria: Aktivpark Güssing, Seestadt Aspern, Winklweg Siedlung and Hummel Kaserne. The four case studies offered the possibility to investigate different supply and demand connection schemes and consequently deriving optimized scenarios taking into account local framework conditions, such as consumption and production settings and the related control strategies. The scenarios analysis is performed considering both economic and ecological issues.

LBW individuals exhibit disproportionately reduced peripheral insulin action and increased fat oxidation after a 5-day high-fat overfeeding (HFO) challenge. Furthermore, LBW men exhibit increased nocturnal fat oxidation during energy balance and low energy expenditure (EE) during fasting. We hypothesized that short-term HFO could further unmask key defects of whole-body energy metabolism in LBW men. Methods: Eighteen LBW (2717 ± 268 g) and 26 normal birth weight (NBW) (3893 ± 207 g) healthy young men were included in a 5-day HFO (60 E % fat, +50 % calories) study. The 24-h EE, respiratory quotient and substrate oxidation rates were assessed by indirect calorimetry using respiratory chambers. Results: After adjusting for body composition, the LBW subjects displayed increased nighttime EE (P = 0.02) compared with NBW controls during HFO. Nighttime glucose oxidation rate was decreased (P = 0.06, adjusted P = 0.05), while both adjusted 24-h (P = 0.07) and nighttime (P = 0.02) fat oxidation rate was elevated in LBW subjects. The relative contribution of fat oxidation to EE was increased in LBW compared with NBW men during the entire 24-h period (P = 0.06) and during nighttime (P = 0.03). Conclusions: We suggest that disproportionally enhanced fat oxidation in LBW individuals during short-term HFO represents a compensatory response to reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue expandability and storage capacity. The extent to which this mechanism may lead to, or be replaced by insulin resistance, ectopic fat accumulation and/or glucose intolerance during long-term HFO in LBW needs further studies. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Fat overfeeding; Low birth weight; Whole-body energy metabolism","glucose; fat intake; glucose blood level; insulin; Article; basal metabolic rate; body composition; caloric intake; clinical article; controlled study; energy balance; energy expenditure; glucose intolerance; glucose oxidation; high fat overfeeding; human; indirect calorimetry; insulin resistance; lipid diet; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; low birth weight; male; measurement; respiratory quotient; subcutaneous fat; thermogenesis; administration and dosage; adverse effects; blood; energy metabolism; fat intake; glucose blood level; growth, development and aging; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; low birth weight; metabolism; newborn; oxidation reduction reaction; randomized controlled trial; young adult; Blood Glucose; Body Composition; Calorimetry, Indirect; Diet, High-Fat; Dietary Fats; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Glucose Intolerance; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Oxidation-Reduction; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939817403

The resonances caused by the small DC link capacitor and grid side inductance can be easier analyzed. A feed forward compensation method is proposed based on the simplified model of the system in order to minimize the effects of the DC link voltage ripple on the load voltage and current.

A method to balance the SOC of the battery packs in a system using cascaded H-Bridge is proposed in this paper. The method uses nearest level control followed by sorting and selection based on the SOC of the battery packs.

A supercapacitor (SC) is ideal for this purpose therefore a charge/discharge regulation is needed for the energy management system. This paper presents a novel nonlinear droop control strategy used for this purpose. Usually, droop control is implemented as a load sharing scheme, but in this case it will be used to do the opposite and it will command the charge/discharge of the SC only when it is required by the grid. Also, the converter-supercapacitor unit (CSU) will have the advantage of being independently controlled therefore the autonomous characteristic of the microgrid is preserved.

In many countries, it is not widely used because of implementation complexity. One of the solutions for applying demand side response is industrial process scheduling according to the energy market needs. From the energy system point of view, process scheduling implies load scheduling. The aim of this paper is to provide a solution for load scheduling by implementing value stream mapping, which is a straightforward enough for production management. Decision makers in the industry should have a clear understanding about positive effect from load scheduling and its effect to production outcome and process availability. Value stream mapping is a well-known process optimization tool from lean production philosophy. The aim of value stream mapping is to shorten the lead time of industrial processes and to reduce the intermediate stock amounts. By complementing value stream map with process energy intensity and energy stored in intermediate stocks, we can promote load scheduling possibilities. Our methodology provides a tool that is understandable and traceable for industry-minded decision makers. Finally, we present a real life test example for the new methodology, which is based on the production process of a district heating plant. © 2016 IEEE.","demand response; energy storage; load management; load scheduling; value stream mapping","Decision making; District heating; Economic analysis; Electric load management; Energy storage; Mapping; Optimization; Space heating; Demand response; District-heating plants; Implementation complexity; Industrial consumers; Load scheduling; Process energy intensity; Production management; Value stream mapping; Scheduling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988366405

The first way is the development of a Si/graphite anode. This anode consists of n-Si/graphite composite particles, a special cellulose based binder and a 3D-collector (POLYMET®). With this anode a specific capacity of ∼1,200 mAh/g is obtained. More than 500 cycles with this anode and prelithiation is reachable. As a second way, for higher specific energy, Mg-ion systems are addressed. The main problem of Mg-ion cells is the anode. Mg and also graphite are forming together with the electrolyte (except Grignard type electrolytes) surface layers, which have no Mg2+ conductivity. By changing the electrolyte, however, an intercalation/deintercalation into graphite can be shown for the first time. Based on this innovation Mg-ion cells with MgxV2O5 as cathode are possible having a cell voltage of ∼3.7 V. © 2016 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006094930

In accordance to earlier laboratory measurements, the molecular sieve Köstrolith 4AK was selected as sorption material and thermo-physical measurements using thermogravimetry with simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry were presented to extract the necessary interpolation functions for modelling the kinetic behaviour. Using discrete particle models in a Navier Stokes CFD Solver and particle simulations based on LIGGGHTS, the mixing characteristics of the rotating drum setup were accessed. Adsorption based on the thermophysical measurements was implemented into the discrete particle model. Finally, a parametric study with different temperatures and water content in the inflow air was performed using a transient porous volume approach based on the adsorption implementation and different mixing algorithms. Whereas in a simple adsorption kinetic implementation, the volume averaged temperature of the reactor was already significantly reduced after 1.5 h, more realistic implementations showed a prolonged reaction time with a temperature peak at around 15 min. The temperature gap between the temperature of the particles and the usable temperature level for the energy extraction was reduced by introducing a mixing algorithm. In the simulations, zeolite temperature yields could be reached between 15 K and 28 K, corresponding to air temperatures above the material between 21 K and 33 K, which compared well to the experimental observations, where temperature shifts of the process air of up to 36 K were reported. The presented simulation methodology is able to identify partly unused areas in reactors.

This mechanism requires cooperation between nodes. However, because of limited resources such as storage and energy, most of the nodes act in a non-cooperative way. In this paper, an incentive mechanism is proposed to encourage messages caching in DTNs. The source offers a reward to the relays to incite them to participate in delivering the message to the destination. We model the interaction between the source and the relays as a Stackelberg game in which the source takes the role of the leader and the relays respond based on the leader's move. Also, two different learning algorithms are presented: one for the leader, the other for the followers, to allow them to take the best decision and finally, to converge to the Stackelberg Equilibrium. © 2016 IEEE.","Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs); Stackelberg equilibrium; Stochastic learning algorithms","Learning algorithms; Mobile telecommunication systems; Stochastic systems; Wireless networks; Best decision; Carry and forward; Delaytolerant networks (DTNs); Incentive mechanism; Non-cooperative; Stackelberg equilibrium; Stackelberg Games; Stochastic learning; Delay tolerant networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985997672

Conflicting optimization goals naturally arise in buildings, where the maximization of user comfort versus the minimization of energy consumption poses the main trade-off to be balanced. Model predictive control (MPC) is the ideal control strategy to deal with such problems. Especially the knowledge and use of future disturbances in the optimization makes MPC such a powerful and valuable control tool in the area of building automation. MPC compromises a class of control algorithms that utilizes an online process model to optimize the future response of a plant. The main benefits of MPC are the explicit consideration of building dynamics, available predictions of future disturbances, constraints, and conflicting optimization goals to provide the optimal control input. MPC technology has been applied to process control for several decades and it is an upcoming field in building automation. This is a consequence of the large potential for saving energy in buildings and also allows to maximize the use of renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the added flexibility enables to integrate such buildings in future smart grids.

Hybrid heaters combine different heating appliances in one device and can switch between those appliances during operation. Different configurations are possible: B-R (gas boiler-resistance), HP-B (heat pump-gas boiler), and HP-R (heat pump-resistance) heaters. A linear programming investment model is formulated and applied to an Irish test system with 40% wind energy generation to determine the optimal capacities and dispatch for the power and residential heat systems, including thermal storage. No technology is a silver bullet, but this paper finds that the widespread deployment of hybrid HP-B systems delivers a wide range of cost and strategic benefits: This hybrid technology minimises total system cost, reduces gas consumption and CO2 emissions compared to B-only, and, compared to HP-only, reduces power generation capacity requirements and heater capital cost. Other hybrid heaters are effective in addressing a specific challenge, although with drawbacks: Hybrid B-Rs considerably reduce wind curtailment, but increase the use of carbon-intensive coal generation; HP-Rs mainly only benefit consumers by reducing heater capital cost compared to HPs and require more generation capacity additions and thermal storage tanks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand side management; Energy systems integration; Flexible electricity demand; Multi-energy devices; Power system planning; Residential heat technologies","Boilers; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal storage; Cost reduction; Costs; Demand side management; Electric utilities; Gas emissions; Gases; Heat pump systems; Heat resistance; Heat storage; Heating; Housing; Investments; Linear programming; Wind power; Electricity demands; Energy systems; Heat technology; Multi energy; Power system planning; Electric power system planning; assessment method; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; demand analysis; demand-side management; electricity generation; energy planning; gas; investment; linear programing; operations technology; residential energy; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973561108

The simulations were done with an in-house code based on the Finite Volume Method. It was found that thermal energy losses through the semitransparent wall are about 60% of the solar radiation incident on the system (Gsol). Despite of the thermal losses, the system gets enough energy to keep the air inside the room with a temperature above 35 °C.

Moderation of interior climate achieved in this way can contribute to a reduction of energy demands for building conditioning and overall operation cost using a straightforward material solution. In this paper, lime-cement plasters modified by two types of PCM based admixtures are designed specifically for the moderation of relative humidity and temperature fluctuations of the interior environment. The plasters are subjected to a detailed characterization procedure including the assessment of a complex set of basic physical, hygric, thermal and mechanical properties. Experimental results show that the application of small encapsulated PCM particles leads to an up to 10% increase of open porosity, as compared with the reference plaster. Contrary to this fact, the water vapor transport is slightly decelerated, what is attributed to the encapsulating polymer shell which creates impermeable barrier for water vapor transmission. Two contradictory factors affect the liquid water transport, namely the higher porosity of PCM modified plasters and increasing content of not-wettable polymer shells. The moisture storage capacity increases with the increasing amount of PCM in the mix. The moisture buffer value is improved due to the utilization of both PCM admixtures, the developed plasters can be classified as good moisture buffering materials. The thermal conductivity of modified plasters is greatly improved, as well as the heat storage capacity, the additional phase change enthalpy being up to 13 J/g.

In such setup, individual loads take control decisions based on local information. Local control laws are designed to synchronize individual efforts. Large loads groups may thereby contribute to system stability in a predictable way. In this paper, Energy Constrained Loads (e.g., battery charging, night storage heater) participates in primary control in a communication-free setup. Three different controllers and associated actions are considered: (1) delay at start, (2) regular on/off switching, or (3) proportional power modulation. Control laws are respectively based on discrete thresholds, probabilistic algorithms and proportional control. Two linear aggregate models are introduced to render large-scale simulations tractable. They accurately reproduce the group's frequency response in the three proposed control strategies. Long-term system simulations are then run to assess the group's response performance. © 2016 Power Systems Computation Conference.","Decentralized control; Demand Response; Energy Constrained Loads; Linear Aggregate Models; Primary Frequency Control","Aggregates; Control theory; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Frequency response; System stability; Decentralized decision making; Demand response; Energy-constrained; Large scale simulations; Linear aggregates; Power system operations; Primary frequency control; Probabilistic algorithm; Decentralized control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986564746

It also promotes waste heat use and storage possibilities as a form of district heating. However, quality elements associated with detached houses, such as tranquillity and self-expression possibilities, may be lost. Better building quality and alternatives to private car use can enable these elements in smaller spaces, which is assessed here. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – A technology set for an imaginary high-quality (HQ) apartment house is discussed by assessing increased embedded energy of the building structure, due to the HQ measures. HQ solutions include visual barriers, increased sound insulation, roof terraces, large windows, apartment adaptability, bike sheds, electrical cargo bikes and advanced energy solutions. Findings – The increased construction and heating energy use in HQ buildings can be offset if car use is reduced by 10-15 per cent. There is a greater possibility of achieving this reduction if HQ housing can make urban densification more readily acceptable by demonstrating, that good quality housing can exist both in smaller building lots as well as in smaller apartments. Originality/value – The quality issue brings a novel perspective to estimating the environmental impacts of built environment solutions. The approach here is quite simple, but the issue can be discussed more. That is, how much total resource input can be decreased, if the target is not to produce square metres but rather the necessary elements to have a good quality of life. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Apartment adaptability; Apartment buildings; Building planning; Embedded energy; Energy efficiency; Urban structure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978910582

The results confirmed that the degradation factors affecting on the painted, gilded cartonnage was attributed to the direct effects of microbial phenomena, which have led to many deterioration forms (macro- and micro cracks, flaking, coloration, scaling and defoliation microbiological spots). Three Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis and Staphylococcus aureus), two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and four fungal species (Aspergillus flavus, Botrytes cinerea, Fusarium moniliforme, and Verticillium albo-atrum) were isolated from archeological gilded painted cartonnage.

In spite of the anomalous mechanistic nature of guest-diffusivity in clathrate hydrates, characterizing the precise mechanisms of intercage diffusive migration therein remains an elusive challenge. Also, nuclear quantum effects are particularly important for small guests such as H2, and cannot realistically be neglected in the host lattice in any rigorous dynamical treatment of H2 intercage diffusivity. Here we compute free-energy profiles and barriers, showing that quantal delocalization increases these barriers dramatically vis-à-vis classical dynamics for intercage H2 diffusion, by combining umbrella sampling with path-integral molecular dynamics in the extended solid. Results are compared to earlier DFT ab initio molecular dynamics calculations of Trinh et al, who found that the free-energy barriers decrease with increasing temperature. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Calculations; Diffusion barriers; Hydrates; Hydration; Hydrogen storage; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Quantum electronics; Quantum theory; Ab initio molecular dynamics; Classical dynamics; Free-energy calculations; Inclusion compounds; Increasing temperatures; Non-stoichiometric; Nuclear quantum effects; Path-integral molecular dynamics; Free energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982822995

According with a semiquantitatively evaluation, some of these cell's structural compartments change during the breeding cycle. Structural modifications were disclosed in the relative occurrence of lipid, glycogen, and RER content during breeding cycle. The relative amount of lipid deposits in the hepatocytes was much greater in previtellogenesis, and decreased postspawning. So, while the seasonal changes in RER were positively related with the ovary maturation status, those of the lipid droplets followed an opposite trend. The hepatocytic glycogen occurred rarely, mainly in late-vitellogenesis and spawning, suggesting that in this species such kind of energy storage is comparatively unimportant. Lipid accumulation and later usage is, probably, the relevant biochemical pathway for Ohrid trout in the wild. While glycogen and RER contents were positively correlated with the gonadosomatic index, lipids were negatively correlated. Additionally, glycogen inclusions were positively correlated with the plasma estradiol levels. When comparing seasonal patterns from wild Ohrid trout with those from well-studied rainbow and brown trout (specimens studied were from aquaculture), there are contradicting results as to lipid and glycogen reserves, and also as to RER loads. The differences among the mentioned trout can result from intrinsic interspecies differences or may be associated with natural feeding conditions versus feeding with commercially prepared diets, or other factors. This study offers new data useful as standard to access liver pathology in wild and aquacultured Ohrid trout. Microsc. Res.

In-bag hemolysis and numerous properties of the RBC units that may affect transfusion efficacy have proved to be strongly donor-specific. Donor-variation effect may lead to the production of highly unequal blood labile products even when similar storage strategy and duration are applied. Genetic, undiagnosed/subclinical medical conditions and lifestyle factors that affect RBC characteristics at baseline, including RBC lifespan, energy metabolism, and sensitivity to oxidative stress, are all likely to influence the storage capacity of individual donors’ cells, although not evident by the donor's health or hematological status at blood donation. Consequently, baseline characteristics of the donors, such as membrane peroxiredoxin-2 and serum uric acid concentration, have been proposed as candidate biomarkers of storage quality. This review article focuses on specific factors that might contribute to the donor-variation effect and emphasizes the emerging need for using omics-based technologies in association with in vitro and in vivo transfusion models and clinical trials to discover biomarkers of storage quality and posttransfusion recovery in donor blood. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

For this reason, this paper studies a dynamic behavior of the power flow in a stand-alone AC-coupled photovoltaic (PV) system to optimize the size of the system components based on the weather conditions of the selected site and the load power demands. This system consists of a PV generator, a battery storage system (BSS), a PV inverter, a battery inverter/charger, and an AC load power. The PV generator is intermittent source of energy, so this system has to be combined with a BSS to organize the energy between the PV generator and the load. The power management uses the fuzzy power management controller to optimize the system performance by distributing the power inside the system and by managing the charge and discharge of power flow for the BSS. Real-time meteorological data of the site under study and practical load profile of a small household are used as inputs for the proposed management system. The results of the proposed system showed a good performance under various operating conditions, and maintained the state of charge of BSS at a reasonable level. In addition, the results gave a clear visualization of the behavior of the switched-mode power supply to regulate the power flow between the sources and the load on one side and to match between all components of the system on the other side. The main contributions of this work are the ability to give a mathematical model of the all components of the system and the control management which determine an optimal design of the system at any site. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Battery storage system; Fuzzy power management controller; Photovoltaic generator; Switched-mode power supply","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric inverters; Electric load flow; Electric power systems; Energy management; Meteorology; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Power control; Power management; Secondary batteries; Standby power systems; Switched mode power supplies; Battery storage system; Charge and discharge; Control management; Fuzzy power; Meteorological data; Operating condition; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic systems; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983372700

The aim of this paper is to examine determinants of household heating system choices and to use this information for policy planning purposes. This paper investigates residential homeowner attitudes regarding innovative hybrid home heating systems (HHHS) with choice experiment. Heating system scenarios are designed to represent the most relevant primary and supplementary heating alternatives currently available in Finland. The choice sets include six main heating alternatives (district heat, solid wood, wood pellet, electric storage heating, ground heat pump and exhaust air heat pump) that are described by five attributes (supplementary heating systems, investment costs, operating costs, comfort of use and environmental friendliness). The results imply that HHHSs generally appear to be accepted among households; however, several factors affect perceptions of these technologies. The results reveal differing household attitudes toward the main heating alternatives and show that such views are affected by socio-demographic characteristics (age, living environment, education, etc.). The results suggest that households view supplementary heating systems (especially solar-based) favorably. The other attributes studied also play a significant role in decision making. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Choice experiment; Discrete choice; Heating; Hybrid home heating system","Decision making; Energy conservation; Heat pump systems; Heating equipment; Housing; Investments; Operating costs; Renewable energy resources; Choice experiments; Discrete choice; Electricity-consumption; Energy savings potential; Environmental friendliness; Home heating; Renewable energy source; Socio-demographic characteristics; Heating; decision making; discrete choice analysis; electricity generation; heating; household energy; perception; planning method; renewable resource; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977616205

The models from experimentally determined works were taken from various published sources in order to develop a detailed, validated and generalised model for the proposed integrated system that is hitherto lacking. Thus, the hybrid energy storage system is implemented using ideal electronic switches that ensure solar-PV power is directly utilised for battery charging, and any excess generated PV power can be converted into hydrogen fuel for domestic applications including fuel cell power generation systems. The results indicate that conversion efficiency of the solar-PV module is about 34% at this location, and battery power can satisfy low power loads for relatively longer operating period compared to fuel cell power that can satisfy higher power loads but for a shorter operating time. Apparently, the fuel cell dynamic response was limited due to reactants flow conditions near the electrodes which increase internal resistances. The inverter output waveform however, can be maintained at the standard magnitude and frequency that is required by the load. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery; Fuel cell; Hybrid energy storage; Inverter; Power electronics; Solar-photovoltaic","Electric switches; Fuel cells; Hydrogen storage; Photovoltaic cells; Power electronics; Secondary batteries; Battery; Fuel cell power generation system; Hybrid energy storage; Hybrid energy storage systems; Hydrogen energy storages; Inverter; Modelling and simulations; Solar photovoltaics; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974851655

But, the economics of such operation are not adequately attractive and in most of the MSWL, worldwide, the LFG is flared to the atmosphere unused, contributing to the global warming. In this study, a Linear Programming (LP) Model was developed and used to evaluate the economic return of LFG power generation from a landfill - HAGAL MSWL, aiming to improve the economic viability and the ways to maximize the economic benefits resulting from the conversion of LFG to electricity. The analysis indicated that as compared to a continuous power generation, the adoption of an intermittent power generation regime, in which the LFG is stored to limit the operation of the energy center to the hours of the day when the power demand reach its peak, the economic return is significantly higher by 20%. Due to a price incentive offered to electricity producers through a form of Time Load Tariff (TLT), in which the sale price of power fluctuates during the day of the week and season, it was demonstrated that the return on investment (ROI) justified the additional cost incurred for the storage of the LFG.

Against this background, this paper presents a numerically examined energy feasibility study of a solar driven heat pump system for a low energy residence in a moderate climate, where a covered flat plate solar collector served as the sole low temperature heat source. A parametric study on the ambient-to-solarfluid heat transfer coefficient was conducted to determine the required solar collector heat transfer characteristics in this system setup. Moreover, solar collector area and storage tank volume were varied to investigate their impact on the system performance. A new performance indicator 'availability' was defined to assess the contribution of the solar collector as low temperature energy source of the heat pump. Results showed that the use of a solar collector as low temperature heat source was feasible if its heat transfer rate (UA-value) was 200 W/K or higher. Achieving this value with a realistic solar collector area (A-value) required an increase of the overall ambient-to-solarfluid heat transfer coefficient (U-value) with a factor 6-8 compared to the base case with heat exchange between covered solar collector and ambient. © 2016 by ASME.","heat pump; low temperature heat source; solar thermal collector","Heat pump systems; Heat transfer coefficients; Pumps; Solar collectors; Solar heating; Temperature; Flat-plate solar collectors; Heat pumps; Heat transfer characteristics; Low temperature energy; Low temperature heat sources; Performance indicators; Residential heat pumps; Solar thermal collector; Heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971612764

Freshly packed cherry tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicus var. cerasiforme) were irradiated at several gamma radiation doses (0.8 kGy up to 5.7 kGy) in a 60Co chamber. Microbiological parameters, antioxidant activity and quality properties such as texture, color, pH, total soluble solids content, titratable acidity, and sensory parameters, were assessed before and after irradiation and during storage time up to 14 days at 4 °C. Inactivation studies of natural cherry tomatoes microbiota and inoculated potential foodborne pathogens (Salmonella enterica; Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) were performed. A two log reduction on the microbial load of cherry tomatoes was verified after irradiation at 3.2 kGy, and 14 days of storage at 4 °C. Moreover, a maximum reduction of 11 log on the viability of potential foodborne bacteria was obtained after irradiation at 3.2 kGy on spiked fruits. Regarding fruits quality properties, irradiation caused a decrease in firmness compared with non-irradiated fruit, although it was verified a similar acceptability among fruits non-irradiated and irradiated at 3.2 kGy. Therefore, these results suggest that the irradiation treatment could be advantageous in improving microbial safety of cherry tomatoes and shelf-life extension without affecting significantly its quality attributes. Industrial relevance There is an ever-increasing global demand from consumers for high-quality foods with major emphasis placed on quality and safety attributes. One of the main demands that consumers display is for minimally processed, high-nutrition/low-energy natural foods with no or minimal chemical preservatives. Extending the shelf-life, while improving the food safety, will have a positive impact on both the industry and consumers (and potential target groups such as immunocompromised patients).

The structures considered included in-house extruded monoliths (pure cobalt oxide and cobalt oxide/alumina composites) and commercial cordierite substrates coated with Co3O4. The samples were subjected to multi-cyclic redox operation under air flow, in the temperature range of 700-1000 °C. Reduction occurred during heating up to 1000 °C, while oxidation took place during cooling. Redox performance was evaluated on the basis of on-line oxygen release/consumption measurements, while continuous monitoring of imposed air flow reactor inlet/outlet temperatures facilitated the preliminary estimation of heat dissipation in the duration and after completion of the exothermic reaction (oxidation). For all samples, redox performance remained stable in the course of multi-cyclic exposure. In terms of heat transfer, there is strong indication that both composition and the geometry of the honeycomb are important. The pure Co3O4 extruded honeycomb exhibited the highest heat dissipation efficiency but suffered from severe deformation upon multi-cyclic operation. The addition of a small amount of alumina in the aforementioned composition (10% on the basis of total initial mass of oxides), particularly when combined with an increase of the honeycomb wall thickness, substantially improved macro-structural stability upon thermal/redox cycling. The Co3O4-coated cordierite monoliths showed essentially the same normalised redox performance with the pure Co3O4 extruded honeycomb, however the overall heat dissipation achieved was lower. Regarding the effect of redox cycling on the structural stability of studied formulations, pure Co3O4 samples exhibited notable swelling. In the case of the extruded body, this resulted to structural collapse while for the coated cordierite honeycomb, expansion of the coating layer led to partial channels blocking. Based on relevant morphological and structural post-analysis, it was concluded that formation of cobalt aluminate largely reduced swelling intensity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Cobalt oxide; Honeycomb reactor; Redox; Thermochemical storage","Air; Alumina; Cobalt; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Honeycomb structures; Oxidation; Silicate minerals; Solar energy; Stability; Cobalt oxides; Concentrated solar power; Continuous monitoring; Honeycomb reactors; Redox; Structural stabilities; Thermo-chemical heat storages; Thermochemical storage; Heating; aluminum oxide; coating; cobalt; energy dissipation; heat transfer; installation; instrumentation; oxide; power plant; redox conditions; solar power; storage; thermochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964483234

By virtue of these reasons, modified clay was therefore prepared from many synthetic routes for significant enhancement on specific surface area and porosity. The application of modified clay was versatile in many areas of industrial commercialization. It was related to catalyst support, separation technology, electronic device as well as food packaging. To use modified clay with higher efficiency, it was consequently designed as composite based materials. Small amount of modified clay from chemical synthetic route was therefore integrated into polymer matrix. To be challenge on the use of modified clay based composite, it was investigated for being as energy storage materials.

The cost of operating different configurations is investigated for three countries: Tunisia, Jordan and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA); where diesel prices are heavily subsidized. Different countries are chosen to clarify the driver to use renewable energy for power generation in these countries. The drives could be for saving operating costs, for saving the environment, or for saving both. It is found that the best solution for power generation in KSA is DE. However, the hybrid PV/DE/battery bank solution is the best solution in Tunisia and Jordan. The hybrid system requires about 9 years for balancing the total cost of operation compared to the DE solution only. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Solar energy can be converted directly to electric energy, which can operate electrically driven desalting systems such as reverse osmosis (RO), electrodialysis (ED), and mechanical vapor compression systems. Solar energy can also be converted to the thermal energy that can operate the mainly used thermally operated desalination system such as multistage flash (MSF), conventional multieffect (ME), and multieffect thermal vapor compression (ME-TVC), and emerging membrane distillation and humidification–dehumidification desalination systems. The thermal energy converted from solar energy can also be used to produce high-pressure steam running power plant producing electric power to operate mechanically driven desalting systems, and/or extracted steam at relatively low pressure to operate thermally driven desalting system. The main obstacle that hinders the use of solar desalination is the initial investment cost. This paper discusses the use of the solar desalination and calculates the investment cost to install solar desalination plants. These include photovoltaic (PV)-driven RO system, and thermally driven MSF and ME plants by steam directly generated by solar collectors, or by steam extracted from solar steam power plants operated by the concentrated solar collectors. The results revealed that PV-RO desalting system has the highest specific capital cost, among the considered systems, because the expensive storage of the electric energy in batteries, and the fact solar energy supply lasts about one third of the day. It showed also that using the thermally generated energy from concentrated solar collectors operating power plant is much cheaper than using this thermal energy when directly operating the desalination system. © 2015 Balaban Desalination Publications.

Increasingly, alternative water sources such as graywater-untreated wastewater that does not include water from the toilet but generally includes water from bathroom sinks, showers, bathtubs, clothes washers, and laundry sinks- and stormwater-water from rainfall or snow that can be measured downstream in a pipe, culvert, or stream shortly after the precipitation event-are being viewed as resources to supplement scarce water supplies rather than as waste to be discharged as rapidly as possible. Graywater and stormwater can serve a range of non-potable uses, including irrigation, toilet flushing, washing, and cooling, although treatment may be needed. Stormwater may also be used to recharge groundwater, which may ultimately be tapped for potable use. In addition to providing additional sources of local water supply, harvesting stormwater has many potential benefits, including energy savings, pollution prevention, and reducing the impacts of urban development on urban streams. Similarly, the reuse of graywater can enhance water supply reliability and extend the capacity of existing wastewater systems in growing cities. Despite the benefits of using local alternative water sources to address water demands, many questions remain that have limited the broader application of graywater and stormwater capture and use. In particular, limited information is available on the costs, benefits, and risks of these projects, and beyond the simplest applications many state and local public health agencies have not developed regulatory frameworks for full use of these local water resources. To address these issues, Using Graywater and Stormwater to Enhance Local Water Supplies analyzes the risks, costs, and benefits on various uses of graywater and stormwater. This report examines technical, economic, regulatory, and social issues associated with graywater and stormwater capture for a range of uses, including non-potable urban uses, irrigation, and groundwater recharge. Using Graywater and Stormwater to Enhance Local Water Supplies considers the quality and suitability of water for reuse, treatment and storage technologies, and human health and environmental risks of water reuse. The findings and recommendations of this report will be valuable for water managers, citizens of states under a current drought, and local and state health and environmental agencies. © 2016 by the National Academy of Sciences.

In this paper, two digital techniques, wait state and time slot, were used to solve the timing failures in the operation of the digital processing block of a power line sensor node. In this sensor node design, timing failures occur because of two reasons: 1) the power-on reset (POR) circuits are switching early and 2) the storage capacitor of the energy harvesting block cannot fully support the required energy during transmit operations. Using wait states, timing failures were prevented by providing timing margin between the POR switching and the activation of the digital blocks. The counters to implement the wait states only contributed 2% additional area and 5% addition al power consumption to the digital processor. The time slot technique, on the other hand, prevented timing failures by providing a schedule for the transmit operation to execute only at a time when Pin is higher than Ptransmit. Using this technique, the size of the storage capacitor of the energy harvesting block was reduced 50 times compared when the technique is not used. The power line sensor node was successfully fabricated in 65nm CMOS process with an area of 4.84mm2 and was designed to work at a noisy voltage supply of 500mV with a voltage ripple of 15mV peak to peak and a wide temperature range of 0°C to 120°C. © 2016 IEEE.","digital processor; digital technique; energy harvester; integrated circuit; PVT; sensor node; time slot; wait state","Electric power utilization; Energy harvesting; Integrated circuits; Reconfigurable hardware; Sensor nodes; Digital processors; Digital techniques; Energy Harvester; Time slots; wait state; Timing circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983426339

Central Processing Unit, Random Access Memory and computer Hard Disk Drive are involved in that process. In 2008 / 2009 the massive commercial use of hard drives based on Solid State technology began, which are now rapidly replacing mechanical hard drives, made up of mechanical and electronic components (actuator, actuator arm, the motor that allows the rotation speed from 5400 rpm to 15000 rpm, controller, cache, etc.). Solid State Disk technology uses the same electronic interface as hard disk drives to communicate with the rest of the computer, which facilitates Solid State Disk installation and replacement of mechanical drives. Hard drives constructed in Solid State technology have the memory controller and flash memory on which the device performance primarily depends. Speed of writing and reading of data from the hard drive is extremely affecting the operation of the entire computer system, especially database search, the playback / recording of audio-video and daily data read / copy. The research described in this paper will compare the speed of writing / reading of the mechanical hard drive with the speed of writing / reading of the hard drive in SSD technology. The comparison will be conducted through synthetic tests with ATTO Disk Benchmark tool. Solid State Disk technology can also be viewed according to the ""Green computing"" concept, meaning reduced expenses (less energy consumption, less cooling costs for data centers, servers, PCs) and higher performance). Comparison results between these two technologies will provide a cost-effective argumentation in favor of switching to SSD technology. © 2016 Croatian Society MIPRO.",,"Actuators; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Disks (machine components); Drives; Energy utilization; Flash memory; Interface states; Mechanical actuators; Mechanical drives; Microelectronics; Program processors; Random access storage; Search engines; Solid state device structures; Device performance; Effectiveness analysis; Electronic component; Electronic interface; Memory controller; Random access memory; Solid state disks; Solid state technology; Hard disk storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983598042

In such a system, natural balancing is achieved when the converter is operated in open loop with 50% duty cycle, eliminating the need for measuring the voltage of each storage device. Nevertheless, excessive currents arise even for slight voltage misbalance because of the highly underdamped nature of the system. In order to remedy this drawback, bidirectional pulse-by-pulse inductor current limitation is introduced, which is equivalent to adding a peak-current-mode-like control loop to the system. Since the duty cycle never exceeds 50%, compensation ramp is not required to maintain stability. On the other hand, while the uncontrolled system dynamics is linear, introducing the current limit mechanism turns the closed loop dynamics into a nonlinear one, burdening the analysis task and thus calling for suitable average model to perform fast simulations for system analysis. Dynamical equations of the system are developed in order to derive the switching-cycle-averaged model. Simulations support the presented findings. © 2016 IEEE.","active balancing; buck-boost converter; current limitation; dynamic model; supercapacitor bank","Dynamic models; Electric current regulators; Electric energy storage; Power converters; Virtual storage; Active balancing; Bi-directional pulse; Bidirectional buck-boost converter; Buck boost converter; Closed loop dynamic; Current limitation; Super capacitor; Uncontrolled systems; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983354433

The market value of energy storage in different power market designs should be quantified to justify business models and/or policy supports. This paper analyzes the economic potential of EES in the Nordic power market (Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland) both in energy and ancillary services markets under current market conditions (2012-15). We propose a model for profit maximization of EES in different market levels, i.e., the day-ahead, intraday and regulation markets. The results introduce Finland as the most profitable area for price arbitrage in the day-ahead (Elspot) and regulation markets. According to the results, recent cross-border market couplings have diminished the price volatility in the intraday market (Elbas), yet the Danish bidding areas are the most lucrative places for flexibility solutions in this market. The actual benefits in the balancing market show higher uncertainties compared with inter-hour energy markets, but this market promises greater revenues. The aggregation of benefits from price arbitrage does not realize any storage profitable. The inclusion of ancillary services, however, suggests return on investment for low-cost, long lifetime batteries. © 2016 IEEE.","Ancillary services market; Battery energy storage; Electricity market; Electricity storage; Value of flexibility","Commerce; Costs; Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Power markets; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Ancillary services markets; Battery energy storage; Economic potentials; Electrical energy storages; Electricity storages; Nordic power markets; Value of flexibility; Variable renewable energies; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983353593

On the one hand the short-term variability and limited predictability challenges system security, resulting in an increased need for operational flexibility. On the other hand the limited number of full load hours challenges system adequacy, resulting in an increased need for back-up generation capacity. In highly renewable power systems this back-up generation capacity can come from e.g. biomass technologies or power-to-gas storage. An alternative is the use of the flexibility provided by long-term demand response. Such demand response can shift demand over longer periods of time, and as such is able to structurally reduce demand during moments of low energy availability. This work quantifies the impact of such demand response on the investment planning of a conceptual power system following the integration of large shares of renewable generation. Simulations show that a limited amount of long-term demand response flexibility can have an important impact on the total system cost and the investments in generation and storage capacity. They also show the importance of the way in which the use of this flexibility is constrained in terms of the number of activations, the maximum activated power and the maximum duration of an activation. © 2016 IEEE.","Demand response; Power system modeling; Power system planning; Power system reliability; Renewable energy","Chemical activation; Commerce; Electric power system planning; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Demand response; Power system model; Power system planning; Power system reliability; Renewable energies; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983348039

The outcome of such international power markets may intersect with national renewable energy policies. To analyze this case, we introduce a market-based multi-region energy systems model to investigate the mutual impacts of energy transitions in a group of interconnected countries. The proposed model is a combination (hard-linking) of a multi-region power market model and hourly energy systems modeling of each constituent region. The case of Nordic power market with highly coupled areas, a high share of hydropower, and interlinked heating and power sectors (e.g., by combined heat and power plants (CHP) and district heating) is examined. According to the results, predicted targets for integration of variable renewable energy (VRE) in one country (Finland) can be counterbalanced by changes in the energy policy of interlinked countries (e.g. by nuclear power phase-out in Sweden). Comparing cross-border transmission lines versus local electricity storage suggests that domestic flexibility is 5 times more efficient in reducing wind curtailment in this case. The cost of such energy storage is, however, 90% higher than electricity sales from respective VRE integration. This calls for international, coordinated joint efforts in energy planning to guarantee an optimal utilization of energy resources and maintaining required flexibility for integration of renewable energy in such coupled regions at minimum cost. © 2016 IEEE.","Energy system model; European energy markets; Flexibility; Power market coupling; Renewable energy policy","Cogeneration plants; Commerce; Electric energy storage; Energy resources; Integration; Power markets; Energy markets; Energy system model; Flexibility; Market coupling; Renewable energy policy; Energy policy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983335279

Moreover, rising reliability demands and network costs will increase pressure to raise the prices of distribution tariffs. These changes pose challenges for electricity distribution business.

Our results indicate that large investments in electric infrastructure is needed to accommodate the renewable commitment, and that 16 branch investments can be the preferable investment strategy for Morocco, with an annual cost reduction of 279 M€, and a spillage reduction of 92 %.

Framed in this context, the coordination of RES integration with distributed energy storage systems (DESS), along with the network's switching capability and/or network reinforcement, is expected to significantly improve system flexibility, thereby increasing chances of accommodating large-scale RES power. This paper presents an innovative method to quantify the impacts of network switching and/or reinforcement as well as installing DESSs on the level of renewable power integrated in the system. To carry out this analysis, a dynamic and multi-objective stochastic mixed integer linear programming (S-MILP) model is developed, which jointly takes into account the optimal RES-based DGs and DESS integration in coordination with distribution network reinforcement and/or switching. A standard distribution network system is used as a case study. Numerical results show the capability of DESSs integration in dramatically increasing the level of renewable DGs integrated in the system. Although case-dependent, the impact of network switching on RES power integration is not significant. © 2016 IEEE.","Distributed energy storage systems; distributed generation; network reinforcement; network switching; RESs","Carbon; Carbon footprint; Commerce; Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy storage; Integer programming; Integration; Multiprocessing systems; Power markets; Reinforcement; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Switching; Distributed energy storage systems; Distributed storage system; Mixed integer linear programming; Network reinforcements; Renewable energy source; RESs; Standard distributions; Switching capability; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983239129

The heat pump system uses R410A as refrigerant and has a heating capacity of 4.9 kW (@ A-12W35). The main focus of the investigation lies on the analysis of five different control strategies and types of integration of the DES into the system. For the investigations a validated TRNSYS heat pump model is implemented into a system simulation model, which comprises a buffer storage, a thermal solar collector and the heat distribution and heat dissipation system. The results show energy saving potentials by applying a DES compared to the reference system without DES. This is mainly due to the lower amount of heat provided for ""direct"" domestic hot water (DHW) preparation by the heat pump. The results for the investigated control strategies show a maximum increase of the seasonal performance factor (SPF) and electrical energy savings of 5.3% and 5.0%, respectively, for an extra hydraulic loop of the DES with its own circulation pump.

The iron and steel industry is one of the largest industrial sources of CO2 (about 6% of total CO2 emissions). Two post-combustion CO2 capture methods based on reactive gas-liquid and gas-solid systems are evaluated to be used in an integrated steel mill in conjunction with the plant sub-systems with the highest CO2 emissions e.g., captive power plant, hot stoves, coke ovens, lime kilns, etc. The gas-liquid absorption using chemical solvents (e.g., alkanolamines) and Calcium Looping (CaL) are assessed. The carbon capture rate is set to be at least 90%. The paper evaluates a conventional size of integrated steel mill emphasizing the energy integration aspects and the influence of various carbon capture options on the overall steel mill performances. The evaluated designs (captive power plants and carbon capture units) were modelled and simulated, the results being used to assess the overall indicators. For comparison reason, various captive power plant configurations of integrated steel mill without carbon capture were also considered. The assessments show that CaL system has significant advantages compared not only to benchmark cases without capture but also to the gas-liquid absorption cases. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

By exploring the full compositional range, it was found that the Sb→Bi substitution leads to a decrease of crystallization enthalpy and activation energy of the main crystallization phase-change process. These trends were explained in terms of the changing structural ordering within the recently proposed new phase-change atomic switching mechanism. All of the compositions exhibited very similar transformation kinetics, confirming the uniformity of the phase-change mechanisms involved. It was further shown that rapid energy delivery achieved during heating, in the case of all investigated materials, leads to a transition from the classical nucleation/growth-based formation of 3D crystallites towards an autocatalytic phase-change process with an enormously increased speed of crystallization. Rapidity of the crystallization process was quantified for all of the studied compositions based on a novel Index of Crystallization Rapidity criterion - the results provided by this criterion showed that the highest crystallization speed was produced by the Ge8Sb0.8Bi1.2Te11 composition, which therefore from this point of view appears to be a suitable candidate for the new generation of phase-change memory recording devices. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The efficient use of such applications require an accurate information about the battery's state of charge. Unfortunately, the battery's open circuit voltage shows a nonlinear and in wide areas flat dependence on the state of charge and is significantly influenced by hysteresis phenomena. As a result, the unique determination of the state of charge using the open circuit voltage is hampered. This work deals with a dual estimation approach utilizing a sequential Monte-Carlo method in connection with a marginalization technique to provide an accurate estimation of the battery's state of charge.

Optimal control is applied to optimise the performance of the electric car design with minimum use of energy and maximum average speed. Optimal control and linear quadratic regulator in electric cars have significant impact on reducing operational costs of electric vehicles and increasing electric vehicle range and speed. The simulation model of this control strategy is constructed by using MATLAB Simulink and Stateflow. The model takes into account the role of combined wind/drag, slope, and rolling loads to minimise the battery charge consumption under various driving conditions. Vehicle modelling and simulation are very important in order to design and develop electric vehicles. The multi domain complexity interacts between various mechanical and electrical components, electrical machinery, control systems, and vehicle mechanics with a high level of complexity and number of parameters subsystems that are discussed in depth. This complexity, combined with the large number of subsystem parameters, makes electric vehicle design a formidable engineering problem. Model-based design has several advantages as a practical approach to solving problems, including the use of a single environment for managing multi domain complexity, iterative modelling, and design elaboration. Two simulation comparisons were conducted on the electric vehicle MATLAB Simulink model. In a nutshell optimal control and linear quadratic regulator manages to minimise electric vehicle energy consumption and solves maximum average speed of an electric car issue with limited control input. The results are that electric vehicle energy efficiency is improved up to 16.67% and electric car with optimal control on average travels up to 14.67 kph or 0.175 m/s faster during the simulation. © 2015 IEEE.","brushless DC motor; electric vehicle; linear quadratic regulator; MATLAB Simulink; Optimal control","Brushless DC motors; Control systems; Crashworthiness; Design; Digital storage; Electric automobiles; Electric drives; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Human computer interaction; Machinery; MATLAB; Optimal control systems; Systems analysis; Vehicles; Linear quadratic regulator; Matlab Simulink models; MATLAB/ SIMULINK; Mechanical and electrical; Optimal controls; Simulation comparison; Vehicle energy consumption; Vehicle modelling and simulations; Electric machine control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983407982

A detailed review is presented of studies in which the contribution of stratification to the performance SSTES is assessed on the basis of energy and exergy analyses, and lately, entropy generation analysis. To obtain clear and useful distinctions between stratified and non-stratified stores, and for stores at different states of stratification, analyses that incorporate second law considerations (i.e. exergy/entropy generation) are required. Also, based on outcomes of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of SSTES, we present results of energy efficiency, ηe, normalized exergy efficiency, ηx, and entropy generation number, Ns, assessments of SSTES, corresponding to three possible approaches. Energy efficiencies, are shown to be limited in their ability to quantifying these improvements, while ηx is introduced as an improved exergy-based performance measure. Comparing ηx with Ns it is found that ηx is effective for assessing store performances prior to the exit of the thermocline from the store, while Ns offers useful assessments for the full duration of store operation. The parametric dependence of ηx and Ns on some significant dimensionless variables (Peclet number, PeD, Richardson number, Ri, and aspect ratio, AR) is such that as PeD, Ri and AR increase ηx increases. Ns decreases with increasing PeD and AR but the effect of Ri on it depends on the value of Ri. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The melting/solidification temperatures, latent heat of fusion and heat capacities of the phase change materials have been investigated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Thermogravimetric analysis and Temperature History Method. Thermal cycles up to 300 are performed to investigate melting and solidification reversibility as well as degradation over time. It is shown that the selected paraffin waxes have reversible phase change with no degradation of thermophysical properties over time.

Their intermittent nature challenges the short-term ability of the power system to maintain the system balance, and its long-term ability to meet the peak demand. This results in an increased need for operational flexibility. Simultaneously, the availability of conventional dispatchable generation to provide such flexibility becomes less evident. Energy storage systems present an alternative source of flexibility. This paper focuses on the role of long-term storage, such as power-to-gas, which is able to also deal with seasonal variations in the output of renewables. It studies the impact of long-term storage on the investment planning of a conceptual power system following the integration of large shares of variable renewable generation. Simulations show that long-term storage reduces the need for installed renewable generation capacity to meet renewable objectives, and that it has a pivotal role in realising a fully renewable supply at a realistic cost. Results further show that the deployment of long-term storage depends greatly on the availability of biomass. If biomass is available, long-term storage investment only occurs at extremely high renewable penetrations. © 2016 IEEE.","Electricity Storage; Power system modeling; Power system planning; Power system reliability; Renewable energy","Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Electricity storages; Power system model; Power system planning; Power system reliability; Renewable energies; Electric power system planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982845645

After having removed these trends we build an ARMA-GARCH model with fat-tail feature to explain the remaining autocorrelation. The overall model can be used to generate scenarios of 15-minute time-step frequency deviations and we explain how these scenarios can be used along with stochastic programming to dispatch and compute the revenues of a storage providing frequency containment reserves.

Using of ESS is not advantageous in all cases. Additional losses always occur during the ESS operation. If saved energy is relatively low in comparison with these losses, the return of investment will not be reached. This paper is focused on energy storage on-board tram vehicle. Return on investment determination is not trivial for multi-source/load systems like a tram. The main emphasis of proposed research is given to the energy savings in dependency on recuperation ratio in tram line. One of main energy savings influencing factors is power management (PM) strategy of ESS. Therefore five PM strategies were taken in to account for energy savings calculation. Four of PM strategies are basic and one is more sophisticated. This sophisticated strategy is based on the Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy controller (T-S Fuzzy). T-S Fuzzy strategy uses knowledge of the tram line and tram position by GPS. All these strategies were simulated at the same tram line via stochastic tram line model. © 2016 IEEE.","Energy storage; Fuzzy control; Global Positioning System; Power system modelling","Electric traction; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Fuzzy control; Global positioning system; Railroad rolling stock; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Electric traction system; Energy storage systems; Multi-Sources; Power system modelling; Re-turn-on; Return of investments; Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controllers; Tram lines; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981306483

This work is based on the modeling, simulation, optimization and sensitivity analysis considering the net present cost, levelized cost of electricity, operating cost and performance of a renewable energy system having load of 20.6 kW under rural electricity supply.

The performance of the transmission depends on the channel conditions which vary randomly due to mobility and environmental changes. In this paper, we consider the problem of power allocation taking into account the energy arrivals over time and the degree of channel state information (CSI) available at the transmitter, in order to maximize the throughput. Differently from previous work, the CSI at the transmitter is not perfect and may include estimation errors. We solve this problem with respect to the causality and energy storage constraints. We determine the optimal offline policy in the case where the channel is assumed to be perfectly known at the receiver. Also, we obtain the power policy when the transmitter has no CSI. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic average throughput in a system where the average recharge rate goes asymptotically to zero. © 2016 IEEE.","Asymptotic average throughput; channel estimation; channel state information; energy harvesting; offline power allocation; throughput maximization","Channel estimation; Energy harvesting; Throughput; Transmitters; Average throughput; Channel conditions; Environmental change; Imperfect channel state information; Performance limits; Power allocations; Storage constraints; Throughput maximization; Channel state information",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981303177

In these areas, available water from swamps or ground water wells is brackish water, and it must be purified or distillated. In this paper, we introduce a simple distillation system accompanied with a concentrating unit. This system was assembled and installed with very low costs. Also, paraffin wax was used in this study as phase change materials to absorb heat from the heated water. The concentrating system, which consists of a dish accompanied by a drum as a storage device and pipes assembly fixed at dish focal, was used to heat brackish water. The conical distiller was fabricated to contain PCM under its base to increase the stored energy. Tests were conducted at Baghdad, Iraqi wintertime 2013–2014. The study declares that this system is suitable to desert weathers with acceptable productivity compared with other existing systems. Adding PCM to the concentrating distillation system increased system working hours, increased concentrating efficiency with about 50.47%, increased system heating efficiency with about 157.8%, and increased system productivity with about 783%.

However it is effective for other applications that are suitable for high-speed table which is used for lookup. Reduction of power consumption is one of the biggest-challenges in TCAM design when it is expected not to decrease the speed or memory density. During match detection, switching of highly capacitive Match lines (ML) and Search lines (SL) cause huge power consumption. Energy efficient match detection or ML sensing schemes tries to reduce this power consumption. In this paper, different ML sensing schemes are compared in order to find out the better scheme in terms of better power and speed performance. In conventional scheme large amount of energy is wasted as number of mismatched word is higher. Several further modified schemes are discussed and compared later on.

Energy storage can mitigate these issues but they present a large upfront cost and require relatively frequent replacement. To reduce or eliminate these costs, microgrids can be implemented without energy storage but then ramp down power quality issues arise. This paper presents a method using a reduced amount of storage to provide ramping support to the conventional generators in a microgrid. The EMS in a hierarchical control structure provides this support by sensing RES ramp down and directing the energy storage controller to compensate immediately using the stored energy. The level of compensation is then reduced as a much lower ramp rate than the original RES ramp down rate. Simulation results show how different compensation ramp down rates affect microgrid power quality and demonstrate that a much lower ramp down rate can reduce power quality fluctuations. © 2016 IEEE.","control system; microgrid; microgrid simulation; power quality; ramping support","Control systems; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Power quality; Renewable energy resources; Conventional generators; Frequency regulations; Hierarchical control structure; Islanded microgrid; Large penetrations; Micro grid; Quality fluctuations; Renewable energy source; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980034368

So, the SC is proposed to minimize power fluctuations in the HPS and to generate a necessary power. In this paper, we propose also an Energy Management Unit (EMU) according to some constraints (e.g. Load demand, state of charge (SOC) of the SC, and energy balance of the system). The considered EMU offers several scenarios based on many power flow possibilities. Each operating mode scenario contains, in its turn, several scenarios to cover all the circumstances.

In this context, energy storage systems are a key factor in the integration of renewable generation, because through them, the flexibility of the power system can be increased. Lead-acid batteries have been extensively used to provide electricity in isolated and rural locations, and could be integrated to the smart grid in order to improve its performance. However, this is a complex element due to its working principle, specifically during charging periods. In this paper, a general purpose model is formulated from a probabilistic point-of-view in order to determine the range of possible values of state-of-charge due to the uncertainty and to estimate the battery efficiency. A case study is analyzed and the results are compared with Monte Carlo Simulation approach in order to evaluate the proposed model. © 2016 IEEE.","Battery efficiency; Battery energy storage systems; Lead-acid batteries; Smart grid","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Smart power grids; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Battery efficiencies; Battery energy storage systems; Charging periods; Energy storage systems; Renewable energies; Renewable generation; Rural locations; Smart grid; Lead acid batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047776691

Associated with the increase in the capacity of equipment's in terms of speed and interfaces there is an increase in power consumption. However, not forgetting this, there is a strong focus by the hardware manufacturers to reduce consumption of microprocessors, with several examples in the market with very low power consumption. This advance allows a window of opportunity for many applications that were inaccessible. With the reduction of consumption and a careful selectivity in equipment's peripherals, etc., one can use renewable energy sources with very low production for use in emerging applications. This article illustrates an example of an electric energy production and shows an example in terms of very low power energy production techniques, presenting an application for the electric sector. The main focus will be on an example about piezoelectric energy production used as an education topic. The idea is to capture the energy of the people when walking, using sensors in shoes. Tests were conducted with different types of shoes, to determine the importance of the shoe sole materials. Then, to the same shoe, tests were conducted to study the person riding behavior and various experiences were lead to determine the best position of the sensors in the shoe. Finally, for the same set of sensors in the shoe, different motion profiles were performed to characterize the power production profile. The electronics which could be used, given the energy production values for performing tasks of biomedical instrumentation was then studied. Many examples of using the piezoelectric effect for energy production can be found, for football stadiums, clubs, public buildings, hypermarkets, with examples relating production of 8.400 watts per second. Many new techniques are also been explored like how to harness the body's own energy to power medical devices among others. Installing self-powered sensors in people working in the power electric sector, can be important to detect how they behave. For students in classrooms this is an important technique also, for teachers or for themselves, to detect their emotional state, for example, when dealing with electric machines lab topics or high voltage systems laboratories - the importance is also in a self-powered instrumentation system using micro generation energy [11]-[12]. © 2016 IEEE.","educational small energy teaching; piezoelectric energy; small energy production","Electric power generation; Electric power utilization; Piezoelectricity; Renewable energy resources; Stadiums; Students; Biomedical instrumentation; Emerging applications; Hardware manufacturers; Instrumentation systems; Low-power consumption; Piezoelectric energy; Renewable energy source; Small energy; Shoe manufacture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047721155

Fine-tuning can be understood as 'to find the set of parameters performing well on a wide set of instances'. Help us to decide on critical design trade-offs between different constraints, quality, performance and cost aspects. The ultimate design relies on a calibrated simulation model that provides the expected accuracy throughout subsequent development stages. Heuristics algorithms, and their higher forms meta-heuristics, have been widely used to find reasonable good solutions of energetic problems. The performance of those heuristics is based on the optimum set-up of a set of parameters. The problem of fine-tuning those parameters is also a hard problem.

Its high albedo, low thermal conductivity, and properties of surface water storage impact regional to global climate. The various properties characterizing snow are highly variable and thus have to be determined as dynamically active components of climate. However, on large spatial scales, the properties of snow are not easily quantified either from numerical modeling or observations. Thus, it is vital to estimate the model performance in comparison with consistent datasets of assimilated data. Snow water equivalent data simulated with four different model configurations of the RegCM climate model over Central Europe for a time window of 10 consecutive winters are compared with the objective analysis data from the high-resolution CARPATCLIM database on monthly and seasonal basis. The CARPATCLIM snow water equivalent data are also modeled, but based on the gridded daily observation of the temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity. The results reveal good commensurability over the bigger, mostly flat part of the domain, however, they show significant discrepancies, mainly overestimation, over the Carpathian Region. © 2016, Hungarian Meteorological Service.

The discussion presented herein is based on the plastic flow equations, outlining the most important aspects of the current additive theory, which is illustrated with two practical examples, one radial, and the other in 3D. Geomechanics is coupled to thermal disequilibrium processes, through poroelastic deformations due to a temperature change. The variation of the fluid contained in the pores in this process is generally very small. Yet the fluid pressure is considerably increased by thermal stresses, when the temperature of the fluid changes abruptly. This variation in pressure occurs, for example, when cold water is injected into a high temperature reservoir, producing local thermal non-equilibrium. This phenomenon is coupled to the thermo-poroelastoplastic deformation of the rock, which can result in fractures. In this work the conservation of geothermal energy is used in local thermal non-equilibrium conditions. The heat transfer from the matrix to the fluid at different temperatures is modelled for various velocities and different amounts of global heat flow. Numerical experiments allow estimate the unknown heat transfer coefficients. Special attention is given to the process of cold water at 50&#176;C, injected into a reservoir at 350&#176;C. When the fluid moves at constant speed from the injection point to the area of production, the fluid temperature profile can be estimated. Two additional objectives are achieved in this work: estimation of the volumetric coefficients of heat transfer and the exploration of the validity of the thermal equilibrium hypothesis during reinjection of cold water into a high temperature reservoir in local thermal non-equilibrium. © 2016, Gerencia de Proyectos Geotermoelectricos.

The purpose is to identify the different integration frameworks and types of storage capacities according to energy demand, geographic area, and other parameters. Finally, an overview of Mexico in relation to hybrid systems is presented as an attempt to motivate researchers, industry, and government to implement and develop these systems. © 2016 Author(s).",,"Energy resources; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Hybrid systems; Solar energy; Energy demands; General aspects; Geographic areas; Hybrid energy system; Integration frameworks; Non conventional sources; Photovoltaic solar energy; Storage capacity; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982854147

A good behavior of this kind of systems depends on the renewable sources availability that includes the solar irradiance and the wind speed, as well as the profile variations over the energy demand. Their main objective is to satisfy the load demand while minimizing the use of conventional sources, reducing pollutant emissions and storing the energy excess for deficit conditions. This paper presents modeling, neural forecasting and optimal sizing for hybrid energy systems, which are proposed to minimize both the overall annual cost and the use of conventional sources, which in turn represents reduction of pollutant emissions. In this paper, the use of renewable sources along with load demand variations are predicted by a High Order Neural Network trained with an Extended Kalman Filter, whereas the optimal sizing is calculated by using both a Clonal Selection Algorithm and a Genetic Algorithm. The efficiency of using neural forecasting data is illustrated through a simulation with the results showing the effectiveness of both optimization algorithms for calculating an optimal sizing of the hybrid system, which ultimately represents an optimal cost-effective system. © 2016 Author(s).",,"Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Hybrid systems; Kalman filters; Neural networks; Pollution; Wind; Clonal selection algorithms; High-order neural network; Hybrid energy system; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Optimization algorithms; Pollutant emission; Renewable sources; Solar irradiances; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982182407

The aim of this study was to investigate an alternative preservation method using a natural essential oil to inhibit the fungal growth, increase storability, and keep nutritive value of JA tubers under storage conditions. In vitro antifungal activity was assessed using two essential oils; caraway and spearmint at concentrations of 2, 3, 4 and 5 %. Among the tested treatments, caraway oil at 2 % resulted in complete inhibition of the fungal growth. In the storage experiment, two preservation methods were applied using caraway oil. In the first method, JA tubers were treated with caraway oil at 2 %, kept in perforated polyethylene bags and stored at 4 °C and 90 % relative humidity (RH). In the second method, JA tubers were treated with caraway oil at 2 %, kept between peat moss layers and stored at room temperature (25/10 °C, day /night) and 70 % RH. Comparing with the infected-untreated control, tubers infected with S. rolfsii and treated with caraway oil which kept in peat moss exhibited lower severity of Sclerotium tuber rot, sprouting percentage and weight loss. On the other hand, this treatment led to the highest dry matter and contents of carbohydrates, protein, inulin and total phenols as well as the activity of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase enzymes. Based on the obtained results we recommend the use of caraway oil and peat moss when storing JA tubers at room temperature due to its eco-safety and saving of the cooling energy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Caraway; Carvone; Limonene; Peat moss; Spearmint",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982113690

Shell thickness and the degree of disorder appear to play an important role in such behavior at the graphene interface/oxide. We performed molecular dynamics and DFT calculations to understand the nature of bonding at the nanohybrid interface and the degree of disorder caused by the bonding of the oxide on the graphene surface. Growing of shell thickness with increasing number of TiO2 nanoparticles was simulated using a reactive force field, and an optimum configuration was found. Shell size plays a dominant role in the rising of enhanced electronic states around the Fermi level, increasing chemical capacity. Interestingly, at the optimum shell thickness, stability of the MWCNT is not compromised and the value of the density of states at the Fermi level is the largest. This provides the structural features to improve the design of core@shell materials for Li-ion batteries. It may be of particular relevance to synthesize composites based on MWCNT to improve performance of several materials for Li-ion storage, since the same trend can be expected to other systems. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Core-shell; Electrostatic-type interactions; Energy storage; Li-ion batteries; Molecular dynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978066170

Bulk electricity storage technologies—that is, pumped hydro energy storage—are considered a key component while facing these future challenges. The conducted analysis is based on the modeling results of the Blue storyline of the SUSPLAN project that is characterized by a high growth of RES-Electricity deployment. The RES-Electricity deployment results on a country level for the years 2030 and 2050, the age structure of the existing thermal power plant portfolio, and hourly values of electricity demand and RES-Electricity generation are taken as input for a linear optimization algorithm, which is implemented to analyse the importance of bulk electricity storage technologies for integrating large amounts of variable RES-Electricity in European regions. Two regions are analysed in detail: Central Western Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. The results show that due to the age-related phase out of thermal power plants in the future, additional new power plant capacities will be needed in many European regions by the year 2030. Only some European regions also have sufficient flexible generation capacity available to cover the residual load in the long term. Furthermore, RES-Electricity feed-in will exceed electricity demand for some time during the year 2050 in several regions. The Iberian Peninsula shows especially high RES-Electricity feed-in exceeding electricity demand about half the time during the year 2050. This surplus RES-Electricity generation can be used for bulk electricity storage and/or for exports to neighboring European regions. WIREs Energy Environ 2016, 5:451–469. doi: 10.1002/wene.195.

A comprehensive finite-horizon scheduling optimization problem is formulated to optimally control a SNRB using model predictive control (MPC) method, which integrates both forecasts and newly updated information. The cooperation is reached through a bidirectional communication infrastructure in the SNRB, where the master controller (MC) is available at the network level and in charge of coordinating and managing power in the SNRB. A MPC-based algorithm is used for the future scheduling of power exchanges, charge/discharge state of each energy storage device (ESD), the state of each micro-CHP and the charging state of each plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) available in the network.

For economic and commercial reasons relating to agricultural activities in southern Tunisia, two seasonal food products, dates and poultry, are selected for storage at different temperatures. Performance optimization of the refrigeration systems is investigated under various operating conditions in order to choose the most efficient for a given situation. The three-stage vapor compression refrigeration systems have the same main components, but they differ in the arrangement of the flash separator. For the first considered system, the flash separator is installed before the first evaporator. In the second system, the flash separator is introduced before the second evaporator. For the third refrigeration system, the flash separator is placed before the two evaporators. An analytic study is performed in order to analyze the influence of the condensing temperature, the inter-stage pressure, the subcooling, and the superheat on the system performances. For the same operating conditions, each cycle is optimized with regard to energy performance, refrigeration efficiency, total compressor power consumption, and specific cooling capacity.

Radioactive sources declared ""disused"" by users are required to be transferred to the Centralized Waste Processing and Storage facility of the National Radioactive Waste Management Center (NRWMC) located on the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC) site in Kwabenya, a suburb of Accra. The NRWMC is the only national center mandated by regulation to receive and manage all radioactive waste in Ghana. A considerable number of radioactive sources received at the facility since its operation were without the necessary source information such as radionuclide, activity and reference date, identification number, supplier/manufacturer, etc. Sources received with information and those received without the proper information are both required to be properly characterized for the purpose of nuclear material accounting, segregation, pretreatment, conditioning and selection of appropriate management options and strategies. The risk associated with the management of disused sealed radioactive sources (DSRS) reduces considerably if the sources are conditioned. Characterization of DSRS immensely facilitates their conditioning. Radioisotopes and shield contents of DSRS stored in the Centralized Waste Processing and Storage facility of the NRWMC have been characterized.

Proteomics was applied to study variations in proteome composition of Butea. superba tubers during winter, summer and rainy season throughout the year using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis coupled with a nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 191 protein spots were identified and also classified into 12 functional groups. The majority of these were mainly involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism (30.37 %) and defense and stress (18.32 %). The results exhibited the highest numbers of identified proteins in winter-harvested samples. Forty-five differential proteins were found in different seasons, involving important metabolic pathways. Further analysis indicated that changes in the protein levels were due mainly to temperature stress during summer and to water stress during winter, which affected cellular structure, photosynthesis, signal transduction and homeostasis, amino-acid biosynthesis, protein destination and storage, protein biosynthesis and stimulated defense and stress mechanisms involving glycolytic enzymes and relative oxygen species catabolizing enzymes. The proteins with differential relative abundances might induce an altered physiological status within plant tubers for survival. The work provided new insights into the better understanding of the molecular basis of plant proteomes and stress tolerance mechanisms, especially during seasonal changes. The finding suggested proteins that might potentially be used as protein markers in differing seasons in other plants and aid in selecting B.superba tubers with the most suitable medicinal properties in the future. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Butea superba; Mass spectrometry; Proteomics; Temperature stress; Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis; Water stress","glycolytic enzyme; proteome; rain; reactive oxygen metabolite; plant protein; proteome; amino acid synthesis; Article; Butea; Butea superba; carbohydrate metabolism; cell structure; electrospray; energy metabolism; functional proteomics; homeostasis; liquid chromatography; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant defense; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein synthesis; protein transport; quadrupole mass spectrometry; seasonal variation; signal transduction; summer; temperature stress; time of flight mass spectrometry; two dimensional electrophoresis; water stress; winter; Butea; comparative study; gene expression regulation; metabolism; molecular genetics; plant tuber; proteomics; season; Butea; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Photosynthesis; Plant Proteins; Plant Tubers; Proteome; Proteomics; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969771503

Cod filets contain less than 2 g fat per kg, whereof approximately 50% is EPA and DHA. However, a large fraction of these n-3 PUFAs is present in the phospholipid (PL) fraction and may have high bioavailability and capacity to change the endocannabinoid profile. Here we investigated whether exchanging meat from a lean terrestrial animal with cod in a background Western diet would alter the endocannabinoid tone in mice and thereby attenuate obesity development and hepatic lipid accumulation. Accordingly, we prepared iso-caloric diets with 15.1 energy (e) % protein, 39.1 e% fat and 45.8 e% carbohydrates using freeze-dried meat from cod filets or pork sirloins, and using a combination of soybean oil, corn oil, margarine, milk fat, and lard as the fat source. Compared with mice receiving diets containing pork, mice fed cod gained less adipose tissue mass and had a lower content of hepatic lipids. This was accompanied by a lower n-6 to n-3 ratio in liver PLs and in red blood cells (RBCs) in the mice. Furthermore, mice receiving the cod-containing diet had lower circulating levels of the two major endocannabinoids, N-arachidonoylethanolamine and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Together, our data demonstrate that despite the relatively low content of n-3 PUFAs in cod fillets, the cod-containing diet could exert beneficial metabolic effects. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Diet; Dietary lipids; Endocannabinoids; Fish oil; Liver; Obesity; Phospholipids","2 arachidonoylglycerol; anandamide; corn oil; endocannabinoid; lard; lipid; margarine; milk fat; phospholipid; soybean oil; acylglycerol; arachidonic acid derivative; endocannabinoid; fatty acid; glyceryl 2-arachidonate; N-arachidonoylethanolamine; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; phospholipid; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; Atlantic cod; body composition; controlled study; lipid composition; lipid liver level; lipid storage; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; pork; Western diet; algorithm; animal; Atlantic cod; blood; C57BL mouse; erythrocyte; functional food; lipid metabolism; liver; male; meat; metabolism; nonalcoholic fatty liver; obesity; pathology; sea food; Western diet; Algorithms; Animals; Arachidonic Acids; Diet, Western; Endocannabinoids; Erythrocytes; Fatty Acids; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Fatty Acids, Omega-6; Functional Food; Gadus morhua; Glycerides; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Meat; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Obesity; Phospholipids; Seafood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964969775

Phys. Commun. 185 (2014) 2903–2912. The original version used an iterative method preconditioned by the incomplete LU factorization (ILU), which–though very stable and predictable–requires a large amount of working memory. In the new version we implemented a “separated electrons” (or “Kronecker product approximation”, KPA) preconditioner as suggested by Bar-On et al., Appl. Num. Math. 33 (2000) 95–104. This preconditioner has much lower memory requirements, though in return it requires more iterations to reach converged results. By careful choice between ILU and KPA preconditioners one is able to extend the computational feasibility to larger calculations. Secondly, we added the option to run the KPA preconditioner on an OpenCL device (e.g. GPU). GPUs have generally better memory access times, which speeds up particularly the sparse matrix multiplication.

Computer: Any recent CPU, preferably 64-bit. Computationally intensive parts can be run on GPU (tested on AMD Tahiti and NVidia TitanX models). Operating system: Tested on Windows 10 and various Linux distributions. RAM: Depends on the problem solved and particular setup; KPA test run uses apx. 300 MiB. Classification: 2.4.

Comm. 185 (2014) 2903 External routines: GSL [1], UMFPACK [2], BLAS and LAPACK (ideally threaded OpenBLAS [3]). Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Solution of the two-particle Schrödinger equation in central field. Solution method: The two-electron states are expanded into angular momentum eigenstates, which gives rise to the coupled bi-radial equations. The bi-radially dependent solution is then represented in a B-spline product basis, which transforms the set of equations into a large matrix equation in this basis. The boundary condition is of Dirichlet type, thanks to the use of the exterior complex scaling method, which extends the coordinates into the complex plane. The matrix equation is then solved by preconditioned conjugated orthogonal conjugate gradient method (PCOCG) [4]. Reasons for new version: The original program has been updated to achieve better performance. Also, some external dependencies have been removed (HDF5, FFTW3), which simplifies deployment. Summary of revisions: We implemented a new preconditioner introduced in [5], both for general CPU and also for an arbitrary OpenCL device (e.g. GPU) conforming to the OpenCL 2.0 specification. Furthermore, many other minor improvements have been made, particularly with the intention of reducing the memory requirements. With appropriate switches the program now does not precompute the used matrices and only calculates their elements on the fly. This is aided also by the vectorized B-spline evaluation function, which can now make use of AVX instructions when a single B-spline is being evaluated at several points. The accompanying tools hex-db and hex-dwba [6] have been also updated to use the shared code base.

This study is twofold; the first part proposes an energy management system that combines demand side management strategies with a view of minimizing the consumer's cost and reducing the power consumption from the grid. Appliance scheduling with a dedicated photovoltaic and storage system under time-of-use tariff shows that customers can realize cost savings and the power demanded from the grid is reduced by optimal scheduling of power sources. In the second part of this study, a model is developed to investigate the joint influence of price and CO2 emissions. It is found that CO2 emissions could give customers an environmental motivation to shift loads during peak hours, as it would enable co-optimization of electricity consumption costs and carbon emissions reductions. It is also demonstrated that the consumer's preferences on the cost sub-functions of energy, inconvenience and carbon emissions affects the consumption pattern. These results are important for both the consumer and the electricity suppliers, as they illustrate the optimal decisions considered in the presence of trade-offs between multiple objectives. A further study crucial to the consumer on economic analysis of PV and battery system showed that the consumer could recoup their initial investment within 5 years of their investment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Medium-term (30 days) physiological responses of two groups of juvenile oysters were measured every 10 days. Five replicates were exposed to diets containing A. catenella and other five replicates were fed with a diet containing the non-toxic algae Isochrysis galbana. Diets were continuously supplied at a concentration of 2 mg L−1, in which the feeding and metabolic activity was measured, and the scope for growth calculated. Lipids storage, actual growth and mortality were also measured every 10 days. The results showed that the toxic diet has dramatic negative effects on feeding and metabolism of the juvenile individuals of O. chilensis, with high reduction of the lipid storage and growth. Mortality was also increased in individuals fed with the contaminated diet.

We model this distributed network problem as non-cooperative game, we focus on the source-relay interaction to investigate how far data transmission could be sustained. For instance, due to a limited capacity storage and battery lifetime the relay could abstain from cooperation. Thus implementing such a mechanism is crucial, the source offers the relay some positive reward in order for this latter to accept caching and forwarding the content to the final destination. However, the relay may either accept or reject this offer, depending on the reward value and the expected energy consumption due to this operation. Next, we exhibit some sufficient conditions ensuring existence of Nash equilibria for this game. Further, we discuss their efficiency using the concept of price of anarchy. Moreover, we propose two fully distributed algorithms to reach the equilibria (both for pure and mixed equilibria). We validate our proposal using extensive numerical examples and numerous simulation runs, and draw some conclusions and insightful remarks. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Energy utilization; Game theory; Routers; Wireless networks; Battery lifetime; Content caching; Distributed networks; Expected energy; Incentive mechanism; Limited capacity; Noncooperative game; Price of anarchy; Delay tolerant networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979736933

These structures are being used for diverse applications, including energy storage, biosensing, light emission, drug delivery, artificial photosynthesis, and chemical propulsion. To increase the structural diversity of this dipeptide building block, three previously unreported analogues in which the aliphatic chain between the peptide backbone and the phenyl ring was gradually lengthened were synthesized. Each dipeptide self-assembled into unique microstructures, differing in morphology, which ranged from flat plates to long microrods to flattened microplanks. The structures were also found to possess distinctive optical properties. Furthermore, X-ray crystallography of each of the three diphenylalanine analogues presented distinctive molecular arrangements. The remarkable differences between each dipeptide in the intermolecular interactions they formed provide insight into the physicochemical mechanisms of self-assembly and, in addition, indicate the biological significance of the single methylene bridge of phenylalanine. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Amino acids; Crystallography; Microstructure; Optical properties; Peptides; Self assembly; Supramolecular chemistry; Artificial photosynthesis; Biological significance; Diverse applications; Intermolecular interactions; Molecular arrangements; Molecular engineering; Physico-chemical mechanisms; Semiconductive properties; X ray crystallography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976545515

Large efforts have been made on bio-sludge conditioning prior to mechanical dewatering. Research about drying is more recent but becomes more and more important in order to produce pellets that can safely be used in agriculture or that can be incinerated to recover energy. The consequences of the dewatering step especially, the nature and dosage of the polymer used for conditioning, on further drying still need to be investigated. However, such studies require making a large number of experiments at the laboratory scale, which needs to use a liquid bio-sludge with constant properties in order to get relevant results. Within this context, this article emphasizes the difficulty of making experiments with an organic material, by showing dewatering and drying results obtained during two series of tests. The experiments were conducted with bio-sludge collected after thickening in a local wastewater treatment plant. During the first test series “W,” experiments, i.e. conditioning, dewatering and drying, were performed on three samples with one week apart, using the same initial bio-sludge. For the second series “D,” trials were done each day during a working week. The Zetag 7587 conditioner was used to evaluate bio-sludge flocculation behaviors. The dewatering was made using a normalized filtration-expression cell. Drying experiments were carried out in a convective micro-dryer. The results indicate that an increase in storage duration leads to changes in bio-sludge dewatering and drying behaviors, leading to poor repeatability of experiments. Consequently, any experimental design must be completed in a limited time span to obtain relevant results. About shrinkage response which develops during drying, a two-zone linear model was developed. It was observed that the first part of the curve was almost similar for all experiments, whereas the second part reached progressively to lower volumes with increasing storage duration. In future works, the impact of other polyelectrolytes' type and dosage at the laboratory scale on the dewatering and drying processes will be investigated more deeply. © 2015 Balaban Desalination Publications.

Based on system- And user-specific variables and constraints, e.g., power or temperature bounds, such models specify dependencies between system inputs, states, and energy amounts consumed/ produced at discrete time intervals. Traditional approaches, using exact or simple approximate models, do not scale well, introduce errors, or unacceptably reduce the flexibility (solution space) when total energy needs to be optimized for many time intervals while respecting a large number of model constraints. To mitigate these problems, we propose the so-called dependency-based flexoffer (DFO) - A low-complexity generalized model that allows efficiently approximating various exact models of both individual and aggregated loads while retaining most of the flexibility. We propose algorithms for generating DFOs as inner and outer approximations of the exact models. Additionally, we provide efficient algorithms for aggregating DFO instances and disaggregating energy series while respecting all DFO constraints and ensuring energy balance. An extensive experimental evaluation with thermostatic (heat-pump) and storage-like (battery) loads shows that DFOs offer a good trade-off between performance and flexibility when a large number of flexible loads need to be aggregated and/or optimized. © 2016 ACM.","Aggregation; Approximate models; Energy flexibility; Smart grid","Agglomeration; Aggregates; Algorithms; Approximation algorithms; Economic and social effects; Electric power transmission networks; Heat pump systems; State space methods; Approximate model; Discrete time intervals; Energy flexibility; Experimental evaluation; Outer approximation; Smart grid; State - space models; Traditional approaches; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979530050

For example, many industries such as footwear, toys, plastic household goods and industrial products, among others, require assemblage products in small assembly lines, in small and customized lots according to customer requirements. In general, in this stage of the process, it is not available an efficient logistics system and an adequate level of automation in the transport of supplies, either for collecting materials or for distributing them. Transporting materials and semi-finished products into a plant using a fleet of drones, involves to take over the tasks associated to the size of the fleet of drones, routing decisions, and drone selection to perform a particular task. The aim of this paper is to propose a fleet managing model for VTOL-UAV drones (Vertical TakeOff and Landing - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that perform the delivery or pickup of supplies and materials in a production plant, also incorporating alternation in drone operations for an efficient use of energy in their batteries. When calculating the size of a fleet, the model determines that, in order to bear the peak demand of final products, it will be required a drone fleet of a certain amount of units (drones) depending on the load capacity, cycle time of the transport operation, and the demand of units to be manufactured. This amount of drones is able to meet the demand of products covering all the deviations in the parameters. Furthermore, it is incorporated the use of coefficients which involve deviations in the estimated demand, cycle time, load capacity and availability of the drone fleet. In this context, a computational tool has been developed in order to determine the amount of drones that comprise a fleet to perform certain logistical operations under diverse operating conditions, some of which can include the product demand for turn; volume, weight and shape of the products, power and speed of the drones, covered distance and finally warehouse and plant layout. A manufacturer of plastic is used as a reference model. In this situation, the final product, storage boxes for home of various sizes, are assembled by performing pickup of parts in warehouses and performing delivery to the assembly lines at the plant. This work is aimed to simulate and evaluate a model which represents the operation of a fleet of drones in the process of transporting materials. The model also includes the manufacture of semi-finished materials and parts in their respective workstations and final assembly of the products in their respective lines, incorporating the activity of replacing flat batteries for charged batteries.

In the literature there exist works with formulas to design shelves in two and three dimensions buy they do not adequately consider the problem of movement in the Z-axis, thereby giving inefficient results with very high shelves and ignoring energy consumption and costs. This occurs because the known approaches consider the movement only on the X-Y plane as expensive as in height movement, which in general does not hold in actual facilities. The problem is exacerbated for heavy materials due to greater energy waste. In this paper the above problem is solved by a model with an extra component for the cost of movement in height. With the model and derived formulas, lower shelves with less energy consumption are generated. The formulas developed are optimal with respect to travel distances and they are obtained from solving a nonlinear optimization problem with linear constraints through a Lagrange transformation. The paper contribution is to optimize warehouse design for reduced energy consumption and pollution both relevant aspects in sustainable engineering systems. A practical application in a distributor of MRO items is presented along with measured energy cost impacts. © 2016 IEEE.","Energy optimization; green supply chains; integrated facility design","Automatic guided vehicles; Automation; Costs; Crashworthiness; Design; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Supply chains; Transportation; Warehouses; Automated guided vehicles; Distribution centers; Energy consumption and cost; Energy optimization; Facility designs; Green supply chain; Non-linear optimization problems; Sustainable engineering; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979984761

Design and analysis of satellite different subsystems such as power generation, distribution and management, power storage, modules protection, bus voltage regulation and battery charging for micro-satellite have been discussed in detail. To perform all these duties whole EPS is divided into three units i.e. Solar Power Unit, Power Conditioning Unit and Power Distribution Unit. Each unit is an isolated system, has a local controller and standard inputs/outputs, connected with the Satellite main computer through standard buses (CAN buses) and can be attached/detached from the Satellite as separate unit. All the subsystems are based on Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) Components which were selected on the bases of small dimensions, low power consumption and lesser weight. Different techniques have been utilized for overall system size miniaturization and efficiency improvement i.e.The design solar panel converter is MPPT based. The main design criteria is modularity, redundancy, power efficient and scalability, simple as possible, avoid single component failure and maximum utilization of the existing heritage. © 2016 IEEE.","converter; EPS; MPPT; satellite; solar cell","DNA sequences; Maximum power point trackers; Satellites; Solar cells; Solar energy; Voltage regulators; Commercial off-the-shelf components; converter; Design and analysis; Efficiency improvement; Electric power supply; Low-power consumption; Power conditioning unit; Power distribution units; Electric power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979643013

Hence, real time scheduling using optimization methods is not feasible in general. So, an energy management system based on artificial neural network looking one step ahead is presented to minimize the cost of hydrogen and battery degradation. The optimum results of dynamic programming are used to provide a data set used to train an artificial neural network offline which would help solve the problem of real-time implementation. The inputs of the artificial neural network are fuel cell power, the battery state of charge, and the demand forecast; whereas, the output is the fuel cell power. The results obtained by the artificial neural network are compared to those obtained by dynamic programming and found to be very close. The artificial neural network is trained using the standard Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, and is able to provide charge sustaining and charge depletion operations. It is also tested on ten percent faster and ten percent slower variations of the same cycle, as well as on the Highway Fuel Economy Test Cycle and New European Driving cycle.

We measured Miscanthus-derived C in rhizomes, roots, and 0-100 cm soil beneath three 16-yr-old stands established on sandy soils at two experimental sites in Denmark. Miscanthus C in soil was estimated from changes in the natural abundance of 13C. In the 0-20 cm depth, soil C derived from Miscanthus made up to 15-18% of the soil total C. In the 20-50 cm and 50-100 cm depth, Miscanthus C accounted for less than 7% and 5% of the soil total C, respectively. After 16 yr, the total quantity of Miscanthus C in 0-20 cm ranged from 11.9 to 18.2 Mg C ha-1, of which 23-34% was in rhizomes and roots, substantiating their crucial contribution to soil C storage.

The assessment has been carried out in terms of physisorption, gravimetric capacity, projected densities of states, statistical thermodynamic stability and reaction kinetics. The Ti atom binds at the hollow site of the hexagonal ring. The average adsorption energies (-0.54 eV) per hydrogen molecule meet the DOE target for physisorption (-0.20 to-0.60 eV). The curvature attributed to the bending angle has no effect on the average adsorption energies per H2 molecule. With no metal clustering, the system gravimetric capacities are expected to be as large as 9.0 wt%. The reactions of the deformed (bent) carbon nanotube have higher probabilities of occurring than those of the un-deformed carbon nanotube. The Gibbs free energies, enthalpies and entropies meet the ultimate targets of the DOE for all temperatures and pressures. The closest reactions to zero free energy occur at (378.15 K/2.961 atm.) and reverse at (340 and 360 K/1 atm.). The translational component is found to exact a dominant effect on the total entropy change with temperature. Favourable kinetics of the reactions at the temperatures targeted by DOE are reported regardless of the applied pressure. The more preferable thermodynamic properties assigned to the bending nanotube imply that hydrogen storage can be improved compared to the nonbending nanotube. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","DFT calculations; Hydrogen storage; mechanical bending; thermodynamic properties","Carbon nanotubes; Density functional theory; Entropy; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Hydrogen; Molecules; Nanotubes; Physisorption; Reaction kinetics; Temperature; Thermodynamic properties; Thermodynamics; Yarn; Adsorption energies; Deformed carbon nanotubes; DFT calculation; Gravimetric capacity; Mechanical bending; Theoretical study; Translational component; US Department of Energy; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945206917

The presented paper is focused on the evaluation of the effect of PCM incorporation on thermal performance of cement-lime plasters. For basic characterization of the developed materials, matrix density, bulk density, and total open porosity are measured. Thermal conductivity is accessed by transient impulse method. DSC analysis is used for the identification of phase change temperature during the heating and cooling process. Using DSC data, the temperature dependent specific heat capacity is calculated.

Hence, a Metal-Hydride (MH) bed integrating a Phase Change Material (PCM) as latent heat storage system is appropriately selected and investigated in this study. Heat and mass transfer analysis is made to understand the influence of the bed geometry on the relationship between hydrogen absorption (or desorption) efficiency and heat storage processes. A mathematical model is developed and is used to simulate a few 3D novel configurations of MH-PCM system (with spherical shells, hexagonal tubes and cylindrical tubes as phase change heat exchangers). For each of these cases, Mg2Ni alloy is used as a hydride bed and the sodium nitrate (NaNO3) is selected as the heat storage medium (PCM). Also, the effect of aluminum foam for enhancing the heat transfer is analyzed. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is made on various operating parameters and material properties. Besides showing a thermal coupling between the MH bed and the PCM medium, the computational results indicate a considerable improvement of the thermal efficiency of metal hydride hydrogen storage tank, especially with cylindrical phase change heat exchanger which indicated 58% improvement in filling time over the basic configuration. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The advantage of TES tank is that it enables shifting of energy usage from off-peak demand for on-peak demand requirement. To increase energy utilization in a stratified TES tank, it is required to build a simulation model which capable to simulate the charging phenomenon in the stratified TES tank precisely. This paper is aimed to develop a novel model in addressing the aforementioned problem. The model incorporated chiller into the charging of stratified TES tank system in a closed system. The model was developed in one-dimensional type involve with heat transfer aspect. The model covers the main factors affect to degradation of temperature distribution namely conduction through the tank wall, conduction between cool and warm water, mixing effect on the initial flow of the charging as well as heat loss to surrounding. The simulation model is developed based on finite difference method utilizing buffer concept theory and solved in explicit method. Validation of the simulation model is carried out using observed data obtained from operating stratified TES tank in cogeneration plant. The temperature distribution of the model capable of representing S-curve pattern as well as simulating decreased charging temperature after reaching full condition. The coefficient of determination values between the observed data and model obtained higher than 0.88. Meaning that the model has capability in simulating the charging phenomenon in the stratified TES tank. The model is not only capable of generating temperature distribution but also can be enhanced for representing transient condition during the charging of stratified TES tank. This successful model can be addressed for solving the limitation temperature occurs in charging of the stratified TES tank with the absorption chiller. Further, the stratified TES tank can be charged with the cooling energy of absorption chiller that utilizes from waste heat from gas turbine of the cogeneration plant. © 2016 Author(s).","finite difference.; simulation model; stratified thermal energy storage tank",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984541491

Aluminum meshes are incorporated to enhance heat conduction in the working fluid, water. A rotation of the thermal battery along the solar concentrator centerline is introduced in the analysis to realize almost uniform heating at the outer surface of the thermal battery. Governing equations of heat transfer and fluid flow, due to density variation and centrifugal force, are solved numerically. The predictions of numerical code are validated through the previous experimental data. The findings revealed that temperature predictions agree well with the experimental data reported earlier. The use of metallic meshes in the working fluid increases heat transfer and reduces the time needed to reach the desired temperature in the working fluid. The rotation of the thermal battery resulted in almost uniform temperature rise in the working fluid and reduced the difference between maximum and minimum temperatures in the thermal energy-storage medium. This behavior is more pronounced for the case when the rotational speed of the thermal battery increases. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Digital storage; Electric batteries; Energy storage; Flow of fluids; Fluids; Forecasting; Heat conduction; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Thermal energy; Centrifugal Forces; Density variations; Governing equations; Heat transfer and fluid flow; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Performance analysis; Temperature prediction; Uniform temperature; Primary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965006990

Hence, the objective of the present study is to achieve the optimal configuration of a Micro-Grid System (MGS) supplying a predefined load of 76 kW peak. Both technical and economic performances are investigated taking environmental impacts into consideration. The intended load is the estimated power required for two small factories and the MGS is investigated performing as on-grid or standalone. The MGS components are: a number of Photovoltaic (PV) panels, smallscale Wind Turbines (WT), Battery storage units (B) and a back-up Generator (D.G). The economic appraisal criteria adopted for optimization are 4Cost of Energy (COE) and Net Present Cost (NPC). As for technical performance assessment, a specific power shortage percent is used as a constraint to insure load sustainability. Applying HOMER simulation package, it was found that (WT/PV) on-grid system is more economic than (WT/PV/DG/B) off-grid system as COE is 0.266 $/kWh and 0.316 $/kWh, respectively. To assess the external benefits of MGS, the cost of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions; for off-grid system, is evaluated and the modified COE has reached 0.256 $/kWh, compared to 0.266 $/kWh for on-grid case.

As it is well known, the quality of a composite resides in the nature and quality of the interphase matrix-immersed phase or matrix-immersed phases. In the case of nano-sized agents, the most important aspect is related to the high value of specific area which determines the transport phenomena and the loading transfer between matrix and modifying agents. On the other hand, the small dimensions of particles are very important regarding the mechanical response of material. If the fact that each particle acts as a structural defect, the larger dimension of the particles implies larger damage on the mechanical properties, despite the particles effects on other important properties - electric, thermal or chemical properties. As complex oxides are showing special properties - for instance they are semiconductors - Their use in polymer matrix should be focused on obtaining energy producing or energy storage materials which should be cheaper than the traditional ones. The present study is about obtaining and characterizing nanosized ceramic powders for further use as modifying agents into polymers. The method used is the citratedgels method but tests were also performed using oxalic acid instead of citric acid, being known that both acids can lead to gel mixtures. The obtained results - especially regarding the particles dimensions - Are encouraging the development of studies with other precursors for further designed applications with epoxy resins.","Nano-sized ceramics; Raman analysis; SEM analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981357276

We introduce a complex approach to the risks posed by induced bedrock instabilities in deep geological underground storage sites. Bedrock instability owing to underground openings has been studied and discussed for many years. The Bohemian Massif in the Czech Republic (Central Europe) is geologically and tectonically complex. However, this setting is ideal for learning about the instability state of rock masses. Longterm geological and mining studies, natural and induced seismicity, radon emanations, and granite properties as potential storage sites for disposal of radioactive waste in the Czech Republic have provided useful information. In addition, the Czech Republic, with an average concentration radon of 140 Bq m−3, has the highest average radon concentrations in the world. Bedrock instabilities might emerge from microscale features, such as grain size and mineral orientation, and microfracturing. Any underground storage facility construction has to consider the stored substance and the geological settings. In the Czech Republic, granites and granitoids are the best underground storage sites. Microcrack networks and migration properties are rock specific and vary considerably. Moreover, the matrix porosity also affects the mechanical properties of the rocks. Any underground storage site has to be selected carefully. The authors suggest to study the complex set of parameters from micro to macroscale for a particular place and type of rock to ensure that the storage remains safe and stable during construction, operation, and after closure. © 2016, Editorial Office of Applied Geophysics and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bohemian Massif; instability; seismicity; Underground storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978187232

However, storage, transportation and soil application of biochar are challenging because biochar is brittle, and has wide particle size distribution and low density. Its loss could be as high as 30% by wind-blown during handling, transport to the field and soil application.Composting biochar with animal manure and other feed stocks helps in specific soil fertility management However compost itself has high moisture content and to facilitate handling and transportpelletization is required. The objective of this study is design and develop biochar based indigenious fertilizer pelletizing machine and bone pyrolysis kiln to help the small holder farmers in developing countries through organic fertilizer supply, improving the poor soil fertility, and subsequently reduce agricultural carbon emissionand sequastrate atmospheric carbon. Biochar produced from bone pyrolysis combines the advantages of biochar along with phosphorous addition. An experimental investigation has been carried out in this regard for biochar production from bone pyrolysis and subsequent pelletization of the biochar based indigenous fertilizer. A sensitivity testing has been done on the machine to ascertain the effects ofthe moisture content,particle size, binder, operating speed and the drying process on the qulaity and durability of the pellets produced for standardization.The pellets are produced using different moisture content of the compost and 5% water solution activated starch and 15-29% of molasses diluted with 15% of water are used as binder. The results show that the moisture content and lubricant oil addition are critical parameters for pelleting process. The optimum moisture content of the compost for quality pellet production with the builted machine is 20 to 25%.

In this work, O/W nanoemulsions were obtained by microfluidization using HOPO (1-20% w/w) in the oily phase along with whey (1-20% w/w), Tween 20 (1:1 w/w ratio) and water in the aqueous phase following a surface response design methodology. The response variables were the average drop size (ADS), the polydispersity index (PDI), the zeta potential (ζ), CIELAB color parameters and viscosities of the fresh nanoemulsions (0 days) and nanoemulsions stored at two temperatures (5 and 19 °C) for 4 days. The ADS, PDI and ζ values varied between 163 and 2268 nm, 0.2 and 1, and - 29.7 and - 47.2 mV, respectively. The viscosity was affected by the storage temperature; after 4 days at 19 °C, it increased almost 6-fold compared to the viscosity of the fresh sample. With regards to the color parameters, significant changes were observed based on the concentrations of HOPO and whey. In addition, the prediction equations only presented errors below 7% for the evaluated variables, with R2 values above 0.85. Finally, the influence of whey protein denaturation at 60 °C on the stabilities of the two most stable nanoemulsions, according to the optimization process, was observed. Industrial relevance Among its many benefits, nanoencapsulation is characterized by increasing the bioavailability of the encapsulated active compound and by the protection that it grants against environmental and processing effects, as micronutrients (for example vitamins) can be susceptible to chemical, enzymatic and/physical instability prior, during and after the processing of food products that contain. One of the techniques studied in recent decades for obtaining nanoemulsions is microfluidization. Microfluidization is a high-energy method that uses high pressure to force the fluid through microchannels that have a specific configuration, emulsifying the fluid by the combined effects of cavitation, shear and impact, thus showing an excellent emulsifying efficiency. However, in food industries the use of microfluidization is not popular and other kind of high shear homogenization are used. In this work, the development of stable emulsions using microfluidization, calls for the use of other types of materials that can provide emulsifying characteristics, such as whey, a compound that is currently one of the main effluents of dairy processes, depending on the type of product. Obtaining nanoemulsions for encapsulation purposes has been studied in many functional products, but to the best of our knowledge, it has not been reported with high-oleic palm oil. This oil contains approximately 50% saturated, 10% di-unsaturated and 40% monounsaturated fatty acids, with oleic acid in sn-2 position in triacylglycerols. This composition makes palm oil as soluble as olive oil. In addition, high-oleic palm oil (HOPO), in particular, has a high stability because it is an oleic acid-rich oil, which has been introduced to replace trans fats and has presented a healthy alternative to such fats in food formulations and the fried food industry. It is also important to highlight that oleic acid has a range of health benefits, such as a decrease in the total cholesterol, an increase in HDL (high-density lipoprotein) and a decrease in LDL (low-density lipoprotein). Oleic acid also retards the development of heart diseases, promotes the formation of antioxidants in the body and reinforces the integrity of the cell wall. In addition, red palm oil (crude) contributes significant nutritional value because it is rich in β-carotenes, α-tocopherol and tocotorienols, supplying vitamins and provitamins that are important for but not produced by the human body. Finally, this work demonstrates that emulsion drop size does not affect the stability of the nanoemulsion if it formulation is designed. Therefore, the goal of this work was to evaluate the most favorable conditions for the microfluidization, formulation and storage of HOPO nanoemulsions using whey powder to produce stable nanoemulsions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Growing pressure on these resources has raised concerns about their long-term management and highlights the need to develop integrated solutions. A method for joint optimization of water and electric power systems was developed in order to identify methodologies to assess the broader interactions between water and energy systems. The proposed method is to include water users and power producers into an economic optimization problem that minimizes the cost of power production and maximizes the benefits of water allocation, subject to constraints from the power and hydrological systems. The method was tested on the Iberian Peninsula using simplified models of the seven major river basins and the power market. The optimization problem was successfully solved using stochastic dual dynamic programming. The results showed that current water allocation to hydropower producers in basins with high irrigation productivity, and to irrigation users in basins with high hydropower productivity was sub-optimal. Optimal allocation was achieved by managing reservoirs in very distinct ways, according to the local inflow, storage capacity, hydropower productivity, and irrigation demand and productivity. This highlights the importance of appropriately representing the water users' spatial distribution and marginal benefits and costs when allocating water resources optimally. The method can handle further spatial disaggregation and can be extended to include other aspects of the water-energy nexus. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Hydropower; Irrigation; Stochastic dual dynamic programming; Water-energy models; Water-energy nexus","Dynamic programming; Electric power systems; Hydroelectric power; Irrigation; Optimization; Productivity; Reservoirs (water); Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Economic optimization; Hydropower; Long-term management; Optimization problems; Spatial disaggregation; Stochastic dual dynamic programming; Water energy; Water resources systems; Water resources; hydroelectric power; irrigation; optimization; river basin; spatial distribution; stochasticity; water management; water resource; water use; Iberian Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963815074

Previous studies suggest additional roles for AK in cellular processes. Since AK is found only in invertebrates and it is homologous to creatine kinase from vertebrates, the objective of this work was to demonstrate nucleoside diphosphate kinase-like activity for shrimp AK. For this, AK from marine shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (LvAK) was purified and its activity was assayed for phosphorylation of TDP using ATP as phosphate donor. Moreover, by using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) the phosphate transfer reaction was followed. Also, LvAK tryptophan fluorescence emission changes were detected by dTDP titration, suggesting that the hydrophobic environment of Trp 221, which is located in the top of the active site, is perturbed upon dTDP binding. The kinetic constants for both substrates Arg and dTDP were calculated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Besides, docking calculations suggested that dTDP could bind LvAK in the same cavity where ATP bind, and LvAK basic residues (Arg124, 126 and 309) stabilize the dTDP phosphate groups and the pyrimidine base interact with His284 and Ser122. These results suggest that LvAK bind and phosphorylate dTDP being ATP the phosphate donor, thus describing a novel alternate nucleoside diphosphate kinase-like activity for this enzyme. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Arginine kinase; Docking; dTDP; ITC; Litopenaeus vannamei; Nucleoside diphosphate kinase; Tryptophan quenching","adenosine triphosphate; arginine; arginine kinase; deoxyadenosine diphosphate; nucleoside diphosphate kinase; nucleotide; pyrimidine; thymidine diphosphate; tryptophan; adenosine triphosphate; arginine kinase; nucleoside diphosphate kinase; pyrimidine nucleotide; thymidine 3',5'-diphosphate; animal experiment; aquatic environment; Article; binding affinity; calculation; clinical evaluation; controlled study; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; fluorescence analysis; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrophobicity; isothermal titration calorimetry; Litopenaeus vannamei; marine biology; molecular docking; nonhuman; nucleotide binding site; phosphate transport; physiological process; protein analysis; protein function; protein phosphorylation; reaction analysis; titrimetry; animal; enzymology; metabolism; Penaeidae; phosphorylation; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Arginine Kinase; Molecular Docking Simulation; Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase; Penaeidae; Phosphorylation; Thymine Nucleotides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963665639

In aquaculture, the use of plant oils in novel aquafeeds can increase PAH levels while simultaneously lowering natural VA background levels, causing the need to supplement plant oil-based feeds with synthetic VA. To study dietary VA-PAH interactions, Atlantic salmon (initial weight 195 ± 0.15 g) were fed four identical plant-based diets that were supplemented with PAHs (100 and 10 mg kg-1 benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and phenanthrene (Phe), respectively) or VA (retinyl acetate 8721 IU kg-1) separately or combined for 2.5 months in a 2 × 2 factorial design, with triplicate net-pens per diet. Dietary PAH significantly reduced hepatic VA storage, and VA-enriched diets restored hepatic VA. There was a significant PAH-VA interaction effect on hepatic BaP, but not Phe, accumulation, with reduced hepatic BaP concentrations in fish fed VA+PAH compared to fish fed PAH alone. Concurrently, PAH and VA significantly interacted in their effects on CYP1A phase I biotransformation as observed from increased ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, increased CYP1A protein concentration, and elevated transcription (cyp1a1 gene expression) in fish fed PAH+VA compared to PAH alone. Dietary VA supplementation alone had no significant effect on CYP1A phase I biotransformation. Metabolomic assessment showed that dietary VA caused a restoration of metabolic intermediates involved in energy metabolism that were affected by dietary PAH.

The chemical composition and energy value of wheat can vary considerably between different wheat cultivars or due to different growing and post-harvest storage conditions. The current study assessed the chemical composition in 153 batches of wheat used for poultry feeds from 15 European countries over 5 years of harvest. The non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)-composition, the concentration of starch and protein and the extract viscosity were analysed. The concentration of starch and protein ranged between 558 and 680 g/kg dry matter (DM) and 92 and 173 g/kg DM respectively. The concentration of water-extractable (WE) and water-unextractable (WU) NSP ranged between 8.7 and 18.3 and 58.1 and 99.6 g/kg DM respectively. The variation was the largest in the WE fraction of the NSP (CV 14.3%). The concentration of WE-NSP was positively correlated with extract viscosity (r = 0.46; P < 0.001) and this was caused by the WE-arabinoxylan fraction (r = 0.59; P < 0.001) in particular. In conclusion, the present results confirm the variable composition of European wheat batches, especially for the WE-fraction of the NSP and highlight the need for considering the concentration of NSP in the practice of feed formulation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical composition; Correlation analysis; Non-starch polysaccharides; Variability; Wheat",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961836145

This prototype of a solar power tower system was constructed and installed at King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia where solar intensity is excessive. Heliostats were implemented to capture the solar rays during daylight. These mirrors are used to direct the solar energy to a solar receiver that is made of alloy steel so that thermal energy is conveyed to a thermal fluid inside the receiver. Based on a detailed selection procedure presented in this article, a final number of ten heliostats were chosen to direct the solar energy to the solar receiver. In addition; two motors were used to control the heliostat rotational and elevation movements. The thermal fluid is a molten salt mixture (which consists of 60% NaNO3 and 40% KNO3). Cold and hot storage tanks were manufactured from steel and they were insulated with calcium silicate from all sides. A one-meter high and one and a half-meter cylindrical vessel was adopted for each of the cold and hot tanks. In this article, a detailed design analysis of each component is presented. The thermal power transferred to the water in the heat exchanger as it is heated by the molten salt was measured and found to be 11.26 kW. The thermal power given by the molten salt in the heat exchanger was also measured and found to be 12.31 kW. The design thermal power was 13 kW.

O/w emulsions prepared via spontaneous emulsification were Tween-80 (SA, 1 and 1.5% w/w) stabilised. Ionotropic gelation of the o/w emulsions' continuous phase via in situ Ca2+ release, in the presence (sheared o/g emulsions) or absence (quiescent o/g emulsions) of mechanical stirring (1000 rpm, 6 h) was conducted. β-Carotene chemical stability in both o/w and o/g emulsions following 65 day storage periods at 4, 20 and 37 °C, as well as its bioaccessibility under in vitro oro-gastro-intestinal digestion conditions were evaluated. Oxidative degradation rates of β-carotene ranged from 0.22 to 2.77%/day. Although Ca2+-mediated gelation of o/w emulsions' aqueous phase enhanced β-carotene chemical stability, oxidative degradation rates between quiescent o/g (0.07-1.42%/day) and sheared o/g (0.19-1.50%/day) emulsions were comparable. Based on the activation energies of β-carotene degradation calculated by the Arrhenius kinetic model, sheared o/g emulsions exerted the lowest storage temperature dependency, followed by the quiescent o/g and SA containing o/w emulsions. Moderate (ca. 27%) to high (ca. 48%) bioaccessibility of β-carotene was achieved in quiescent and sheared o/g emulsions respectively, showing no dependency on SA content. Contrarily, β-carotene bioaccessibility was reduced from ca. 29-16% for 1 and 1.5% SA containing o/w emulsions. Digesta micellar fractions of o/g emulsions exerted smaller lipid droplet size and lower surface tension values compared to the SA containing o/w emulsions. Therefore, it was postulated that enhanced β-carotene bioaccessibility in o/g emulsions was associated with their higher colloidal stability throughout gastrointestinal passage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioavailability; Carotenoids; Degradation; In vitro digestion; Ionotropic gelation; Storage stability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958232317

The Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable simulation software was used to simulate and optimize the technical-economic feasibility of the system. There were several system configurations with and without battery storage elements which will be studied and analyzed. The simulations will be focused on the net present costs, levelized cost of energy, produced excess electricity and the reduction of CO2 emission for the given hybrid configurations.

This paper proposes methods for determining the optimal operation and sizing of energy storage systems. The main purpose of the operation strategy is to maximize the revenues of the renewable farm. The sizing model, on the other hand, has a purpose to minimize the cost of the hybrid system while meeting the service requirement. Both methods were formulated as non-linear programming optimization models. To verify the effectiveness of these methods; case studies have been presented.

Changes in mitochondrial redox potential are intimately associated with oxidative stress which could lead to plant senescence. This study aimed to demonstrate the involvement of an alteration of the redox status in energy production and fruit senescence of longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour. cv. Daw) during storage and to investigate the effects of gaseous chlorine dioxide (ClO2) both on the redox and the energy status and on delaying senescence. Fresh longan fruit were fumigated with 5, 10 and 25 mg/L ClO2 for 10min and then stored in a cardboard box at 25°C with 82% relative humidity for 7 days. ATP content and energy charge (EC), and activities of respiratory enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) were found to be steadily decreased in the untreated group during storage. These reductions coincided with a decrease in the redox status as determined by pyridine nucleotide (NAD/NADH) and ubiquinone (Q/QH2) ratios and with fruit senescence including browning and the onset of disease symptoms. However, in the ClO2 fumigated fruit, ATP content, EC, SDH and CCO activities as well as NAD/NADH ratio were immediately and markedly increased after treatment. The effects can be seen through the fourth day of storage. The Q/QH2 ratio remained unchanged before rising after Day 4. Higher concentrations of ClO2 (10 and 25 mg/L) were more effective than the lower one (5 mg/L) in altering the redox balance and increasing energy production. The altered redox state and increased energy by ClO2 were found to be closely associated with a delay in fruit senescence during storage. These findings support the notion that energy production and redox balance involve directly in longan senescence and demonstrated that ClO2 could restore ATP and the redox balance, leading to reduction and delay in fruit senescence. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Dimocarpus longan; Energy status; Fruit senescence; Redox status; Respiratory enzymes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953807379

SWOP emulsions are known as metastable o/w emulsions, which invert into w/o emulsions on application of mechanical energy, while rubbing it onto the skin and due to their properties SWOP emulsion are especially suitable as a cosmetic vehicle in, for example, sun-protection products. Methods Sensory testing, which included the evaluation of twenty attributes of the investigated emulsion bases, was performed by a panel of 20 healthy assessors experienced in the evaluation of cosmetic products. Rheological characterization of the investigated emulsion bases included continuous flow testing and oscillatory measurements under various testing conditions. Additionally, conductivity measurements were combined with rheological characterization to monitor stability changes of investigated emulsions. The instrumental and sensory results were analysed statistically and compared. Results The obtained results indicated that the investigated emulsions behaved differently in the presence of ions (originating from artificial sweat solution) and at different temperatures (under storage and application conditions). Namely, the SWOP emulsion showed similar behaviour to the reference o/w emulsion under storage conditions, but in the presence of ions and at skin temperature, the SWOP emulsion was followed by re-establishment of a stable w/o system, whereas reference o/w emulsion was irreversibly destroyed. The statistical analysis of chosen sensorial attributes indicated that the reference w/o emulsion was significantly different in comparison with the reference o/w and SWOP emulsions, mainly, standing in good agreement with the results of rheological characterization. Conclusion The study showed that rheological measurements potentially could be related to certain sensory attributes and used for faster development of SWOP emulsions in the future. Finally, SWOP emulsions should be considered for further investigation as suitable vehicles in cosmetic products due to their favourable physicochemical and sensory characteristics which could be partially predicted with instrumental characterization. © 2015 Society of Cosmetic Scientists.","cosmetic application; fast inverted emulsion; formulation/stability; rheology; sensory evaluation; statistics","cosmetic; water oil cream; emulsion; oil; water; Article; chemical analysis; chemical parameters; conductance; controlled study; flow kinetics; measurement; oscillation; physical chemistry; skin temperature; statistical analysis; storage; sweat; temperature; adult; emulsion; flow kinetics; human; middle aged; young adult; Adult; Cosmetics; Emulsions; Humans; Middle Aged; Oils; Rheology; Water; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949024050

The thermal performance of Sunflower Oil is evaluated during charging, 24 h heat retention and discharging cycles. Results of charging reveal that high temperature charging is the most viable option. This is because it results in higher energy, higher exergy, higher exergy factor and higher stratification number values. The charging efficiency is found to only represent the rate of heat transfer and it indicates nothing about the quality of the stored energy. The optimal charging time proposes that charging be continued until a point when the stratification number drops to 80% of its peak value. Heat retention results during 24 h show that high temperatures result in more heat losses during the cool-down heat retention processes. An optimal heat retention temperature is also suggested by the results. An optimal discharging flow-rate is also suggested by the discharging results. This is a compromise between obtaining a high rate of heat transfer and using the stored energy more effectively. The stratification number profiles show initial rises during the discharging cycles since the top temperatures drop at slower rates as compared to the bottom temperatures which results in larger thermal gradients as compared to the initial thermal gradients. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cooking; Domestic; Experimental; Sensible heat TES; Stratification; Sunflower Oil","Cooking; Drops; Exergy; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Thermal gradients; Thermal stratification; Bottom temperature; Charging efficiency; Domestic; Experimental; Rate of heat transfer; Sensible heat; Sensible heat storages; Thermal Performance; Sunflower oil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947793666

Many health care service providers need to provide their services for long terms, in real time and interactively. Many of these applications are based on the emerging Wireless Body Area networks (WBANs) technology. WBANs have developed as an effective solution for a wide range of healthcare, military, sports, general health and social applications. On the other hand, handling data in a large scale (currently known as Big Data) requires an efficient collection and processing model with scalable computing and storage capacity. Therefore, a new computing paradigm is needed such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper we present a novel cloud supported model for efficient community health awareness in the presence of a large scale WBANs data generation. The objective is to process this big data in order to detect the abnormal data using MapReduce infrastructure and user defined functions with minimum processing delay. The goal is to have a large monitored data of WBANs to be available to the end user or to the decision maker in reliable manner. While reducing data packet processing energy, the proposed work is minimizing the data processing delay by choosing cloudlet or local cloud model and MapReduce infrastructure. So, the overall delay is minimized, thus leading to detect the abnormal data in the cloud in real time mode. In this paper we present a multi-layer computing model composed of Local Cloud (LC) layer and Enterprise Cloud (EP) layer that aim to process the collected data from Monitored Subjects (MSs) in a large scale to generate useful facts, observations or to find abnormal phenomena within the monitored data. Performance results show that integrating the MapReduce capabilities with cloud computing model will reduce the processing delay. The proposed MapReduce infrastructure has also been applied in lower layer, such as LC in order to reduce the amount of communications and processing delay. Performance results show that applying MapReduce infrastructure in lower tire will significantly decrease the overall processing delay. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To ensure all safety aspects, a static test method for a controlled initiation of a burst event for composite flywheel rotors is presented with nearly the same stress distribution as in the dynamic case, rotating with maximum speed. In addition to failure prediction using different maximum stress criteria and a safety factor, a set of tensile and compressive tests is carried out to identify the parameters of the used carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) material. The static finite element (FE) simulation results of the flywheel static burst test (FSBT) compare well to the quasistatic FE-simulation results of the flywheel rotor using inertia loads. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the presented method is a very good controllable and observable possibility to test a high speed flywheel energy storage system (FESS) rotor in a static way.

Cobalt oxides have been so far studied by several authors and works while copper oxides suitability has been recently proved. However, in both cases, operation parameters need to be optimized.

Energy forecasting plays a crucial role for any building when it undergoes the retrofitting works in order to maximize the benefits and utilities. This paper provides accurate and efficient energy forecasting tool based on Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR). Results and discussions from real-world case studies of commercial buildings of Colombo, Sri Lanka are presented. In the case study, four commercial buildings are randomly selected and the models are developed and tested using monthly landlord utility bills. Careful analysis of available data reveals the most influential parameters to the model and these are as follows: mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature (T), solar radiation (SR) and relative humidity (RH). Selection of the kernel with radial basis function (RBF) is based on stepwise searching method to investigate the performance of SVM with respect to the three parameters such as C, γ and ϵ.

A compromise solution must be made between energy supply quality and the selected optimization criteria. This paper proposes a methodology to study the load profile impact on SAPV system reliability and storage component. The main objective is to introduce some changes on the load profile shape such as load shifting and amplitude modulation. The system operation was simulated for two days with different load profiles to raise consumers demand impact on battery bank State Of Charge (SOC), load satisfaction and the excess energy. The term used to evaluate system reliability is Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP), which is related to load satisfaction. Simulation results showed the efficiency of introducing some changes on the load profile.

Application code optimization, especially in terms of data storage and transfer behavior, is still an important issue and heavily affects implementations' quality in terms of performance, power consumption etc. Efficient approaches for the optimization of high level application code are required to derive high quality implementations while still reducing development time and cost. This paper presents MemAssist, a software tool supporting application developers in detecting parts of the application code in MATLAB that do not exploit efficiently the targeted processor architecture and especially the memory hierarchy. Furthermore, the proposed tool guides application developers in applying code transformations in MATLAB for the optimization of the algorithm's temporal data locality. An image processing algorithm has been optimized using MemAssist as a practical usage scenario. Experimental results prove that the use of MemAssist can heavily reduce cache misses (up to 40%) and improve execution time (up to 30% speedup) on two different processor architectures. Thus, MemAssist can be used for optimized application code development that can lead to efficient implementations while still reducing development time and cost. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Data locality optimization; MATLABto-C; Reuse distance analysis; Source-to-source optimization","Algorithms; Application programs; Codes (symbols); Computer architecture; Cosine transforms; Cost reduction; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Image processing; MATLAB; Memory architecture; Program compilers; Data locality optimization; Efficient implementation; High level applications; High-quality implementation; Image processing algorithm; Reuse distance; Scientists and engineers; Source-to-source optimizations; Optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974559553

This explosion of interest is primarily related to the increasing mastery in the design of supramolecular constructs using simple wet chemical approaches. Concomitantly, this continuous research activity paved the way to the rapid development of nanocomposites or ""nanoblends"" readily integrable into energy storage and sensing devices. In this sense, the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly technique has allowed us to access three-dimensional (3D) multicomponent carbon-based network nanoarchitectures displaying addressable electrical, electrochemical and transport properties in which conducting polymers, such as polyaniline, and carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes or nanographene, play unique roles without disrupting their inherent functions-complementary entities coexisting in harmony. Over the last few years the level of functional sophistication reached by LbL-Assembled carbon-based 3D network nanoarchitectures, and the level of knowledge related to how to design, fabricate and optimize the properties of these 3D nanoconstructs have advanced enormously. This feature article presents and discusses not only the recent advances but also the emerging challenges in complex hybrid nanoarchitectures that result from the layer-by-layer assembly of polyaniline, a quintessential conducting polymer, and diverse carbon nanomaterials. This is a rapidly developing research area, and this work attempts to provide an overview of the diverse 3D network nanoarchitectures prepared up to now.

This HESS plays an important role in increasing the efficiency and the performance of EV due to the use of the advantages of each technology; the high density energy of the battery as well as the high power of the ultracapacitor. Moreover, batteries subjected to pulsed transient power generate dc voltages with dips that can exceed the voltage regulation band. So, it is revealed that this HESS can assist in maintaining the bus voltage within the regulatory limits, resulting in reduced system losses and prolonged power system life. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of a HESS which consists of an ultracapacitor placed in parallel with a battery, following the injection of constant power pulses. A comparison study between two hybrid configurations is achieved: (i) a battery-RC ultracapacitor circuit and (ii) a battery-multibranch ultracapacitor circuit. © 2016 IEEE.","battery; constant power pulses; high power density; hybrid energy storage systems; multibranch ultracapacitor circuit; RC ultracapacitor circuit; Ultracapacitor","Capacitors; Ecology; Electric batteries; Electric connectors; Electric network analysis; Energy storage; Land vehicle propulsion; Reconfigurable hardware; Secondary batteries; Vehicles; Voltage regulators; battery; Constant power; High power density; Hybrid energy storage systems; Ultracapacitors; Capacitor storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974652946

The spread of Cloud Computing technologies allowed dealing with complex applications such as Scientific Workflows, which consists of a set of intensive computational and data manipulation operations. Cloud Computing helps such Workflows to dynamically provision compute and storage resources necessary for the execution of its tasks thanks to the elasticity asset of these resources. However, the dynamic nature of the Cloud incurs new challenges, as some allocated resources may be overloaded or out of access during the execution of the Workflow. Moreover, for data intensive tasks, the allocation strategy should consider the data placement constraints since data transmission time can increase notably in this case which implicates the increase of the overall completion time and cost of the Workflow. Likewise, for intensive computational tasks, the allocation strategy should consider the type of the allocated virtual machines, more specifically its CPU, memory and network capacities. Yet, a critical challenge is how to efficiently schedule the Workflow tasks on Cloud resources to optimize its overall quality of service. In this paper, we propose a QoSaware algorithm for Scientific Workflows scheduling that aims toimprove the overall quality of service (QoS) by considering the metrics of execution time, data transmission time, cost, resources availability and data placement constraints. We extended the Parallel Cat Swarm Optimization (PCSO) algorithm to implement our proposed approach. We tested our algorithm within two sample Workflows of different scales and we compared the results to those given by the standard PSO, the CSO and the PCSO algorithms. The results show that our proposed algorithm improves the overall quality of service of the tested Workflows. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; IaaS; Parallel Cat Swarm Optimization; Quality of service; Scheduling algorithm; Storage; Virtual machine; Workflow","Cloud computing; Complex networks; Costs; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Energy storage; Java programming language; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Telecommunication services; Cloud computing environments; Cloud computing technologies; Data transmission time; IaaS; Swarm optimization; Virtual machines; Virtualized resources; Workflow; Quality of service",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988920764

Predictability of individual turbine behaviour is key in such a strategy. In order to minimize the influence on the balance of the electricity grid it is necessary to have stable electricity production by each of the turbines. Hence all turbines should be available for operation when needed, which puts significant constraints on owner operators. Failure of turbine subcomponents should be avoided. This requires planning in advance of all necessary maintenance actions such that they can be performed during low wind and low electricity demand periods. Therefore, it is necessary to anticipate upcoming component failures, such that spare parts can be ordered and are available for maintenance personnel during the optimal weather and market windows. In order to obtain the insights to predict component failure, it is necessary to have an integrated clean dataset spanning all turbines of the wind farm for a sufficiently long period of time. This paper describes the requirements and challenges related to such a dataset based on experience acquired during years of monitoring offshore wind farms. Furthermore, it suggests a big data based approach for an integrated no-sql data-storage and data-analytics platform to tackle these challenges. In addition a failure prognosis approach using the integrated dataset is proposed to detect failure initiation in the bearings of gearboxes and generators, which are vital parts of wind turbines. © 2016 IEEE.","failure; Offshore wind; prognostics; vibrations; wind energy; wind turbine","Big data; Computer system recovery; Digital storage; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Outages; Wind power; Wind turbines; Electricity demands; Electricity production; Failure initiation; Long term monitoring; Maintenance personnel; Offshore winds; prognostics; vibrations; Offshore wind farms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973652779

Besides direct simulation, the use of pre-calculated phase space files (phsp source models) and parameterized phsp source models has been proposed for Monte Carlo (MC) to promote efficiency and ease of implementation in obtaining photon energy, position and direction. In this work, a phsp file for a generic 192Ir source design (Ballester et al 2015) is obtained from MC simulation. This is used to configure a parameterized phsp source model comprising appropriate probability density functions (PDFs) and a sampling procedure. According to phsp data analysis 15.6% of the generated photons are absorbed within the source, and 90.4% of the emergent photons are primary. The PDFs for sampling photon energy and direction relative to the source long axis, depend on the position of photon emergence. Photons emerge mainly from the cylindrical source surface with a constant probability over ±0.1 cm from the center of the 0.35 cm long source core, and only 1.7% and 0.2% emerge from the source tip and drive wire, respectively. Based on these findings, an analytical parameterized source model is prepared for the calculation of the PDFs from data of source geometry and materials, without the need for a phsp file. The PDFs from the analytical parameterized source model are in close agreement with those employed in the parameterized phsp source model. This agreement prompted the proposal of a purely analytical source model based on isotropic emission of photons generated homogeneously within the source core with energy sampled from the 192Ir spectrum, and the assignment of a weight according to attenuation within the source. Comparison of single source dosimetry data obtained from detailed MC simulation and the proposed analytical source model show agreement better than 2% except for points lying close to the source longitudinal axis. © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","brachytherapy; MBDCA; Monte Carlo; source model","Digital storage; Dosimetry; Monte Carlo methods; Oncology; Parameterization; Phase space methods; Photons; Probability density function; Radiotherapy; Brachytherapy; Cylindrical sources; Direct simulation; MBDCA; Model-based algorithms; Probability density functions (PDFs); Sampling procedures; Source modeling; Analytical models; iridium; algorithm; brachytherapy; dosimeter; human; photon; procedures; radiation dose; radiotherapy dosage; Algorithms; Brachytherapy; Humans; Iridium Radioisotopes; Photons; Radiation Dosage; Radiation Dosimeters; Radiotherapy Dosage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971529518

In one experiment, seeds were subjected to drying, storage, soaking, warm and chilling treatments after harvesting in mid- and late August. In another experiment, fully imbibed (FI) seeds were given warm treatment for six weeks and then various durations of chilling (4 ± 1°C) for up to 24 weeks. Thereafter, the seeds were adjusted to target moisture content of 35% and 30% or remained in the FI state and were then subjected to either subsequent chilling or freezing (−3°C) for up to 32 weeks. The treated seeds were allowed to germinate at a constant 15°C with 8 hours of lighting per day. Treatment effects were generally consistent for each harvest date. Seeds did not germinate unless they were chilled and germination rates were low unless the seeds were soaked. Warm treatment applied before chilling appeared to induce dormancy. The effect of storage varied with harvest date and storage treatment, with germination being highest for seeds harvested in late August. Mild freezing of ≥16 weeks duration following 16–24 weeks initial chilling resulted in >80% germination, more than could be achieved using chilling alone. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","drying; freezing; Harvest date; soaking; storage","Cultivation; Drying; Energy storage; Freezing; Harvesting; Chilling treatments; Germination rates; Pre-Treatment; Short term storage; soaking; Sorbus aucuparia; Treatment effects; Seed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941248416

Integration of timber and energy supply chains helps overcome the challenge of seasonal fluctuations in energy demand, by offering greater and more consistent use of machine capacity. Quality management of harvested biomass has become a very important issue in recent years. As supply volumes have increased, the economic losses associated with poor storage management have become obvious. Energy yields per unit of delivered biomass can be maximised through careful establishment and location of storage, prediction and measurement of changing moisture content, as well as the ability to match supply with demand. Research shows that the use of biomass quality and location data to schedule wood chipping and transportation can markedly reduce the fleet size required to transport wood chips during periods of peak demand and the use of transport capacity through the year. Quality management becomes even more important when value-added products are made from biomass. Producers of higher-value end products are willing to pay a premium price for good quality feedstock and their needs should be considered when handling forest biomass, in order to gain and maintain a competitive advantage. Biomass projects should target areas where market-driven competitiveness is best and where economic sustainability can be achieved with modest incentives. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Most of the installations are however focused on the energy savings potential of the heating equipment rather than the efficient control of the water heating systems. Two high rise apartment buildings with heat pump water heaters as the primary installed heating equipment, have been evaluated to determine the actual hot water consumption of the respective buildings. The consumption profiles are used as input for the hot water scheduler, presented in this paper, which optimizes the control of a predefined water heating system. The scheduler can be utilized to effectively determine the required size of water heating equipment along with an optimum control solution for the heat pump units. By scheduling the operational hours of the heat pump units in combination with the available hot water storage capacity and the time-of-use tariff structure of the South African electrical utility, Eskom, additional energy savings can be achieved. Potential simulated energy savings of up to 55% are possible by utilizing the hot water scheduler based on the actual measured hot water consumption of the two high rise apartment buildings. © 2016 Cape Peninsula University of Technology.","commercial high rise; consumption profiles; heat pumps; optimized scheduling; sanitary hot water; water heating system","Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Equipment; Heat pump systems; Heating; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Pumps; Scheduling; Tall buildings; Water; Water heaters; Water supply; consumption profiles; Heat pumps; High rise; Hot water; Optimized scheduling; Water heating systems; Apartment houses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979582251

Known issues regarding high μG penetration are voltage rise and reverse power flow. The concept of self-consumption and storage is emerging as a way to improve network power supply quality and to facilitate the integration of small renewable energy sources in low voltage networks. This paper intends to give a further contribution by assessing the improvements provided by allowing domestic clients to consume and store the energy they produce. The tool at hand to study the situation is the unbalanced three-phase load flow algorithm, based on the power summation technique, improved with the capability of explicitly compute the neutral voltages. The behaviour of a test radial distribution grid is assessed in different operating conditions, namely winter/summer, μG penetration level and μG operating mode. Voltage profile, active power flow in the service transformer and losses are monitored. The results suggest that self-consumption with storage operating mode is a promising solution. Voltage excursions above normal grid voltage operating limits were not observed, the situation of reverse active power flow does not occur and the power losses are reduced. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Renewable energy resources; Voltage distribution measurement; Different operating conditions; Integration of renewable energies; Low voltage distribution network; Low voltage network; Radial distributions; Renewable energy source; Reverse Power flows; Three phase load flow; Electric load flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969565354

That heat pipe pulls heat away from the handset's Exynos adaptation of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 processor, a 2.15GHz + 1.6GHz 2x-quad-core design in an ARM Big.Little configuration. The slower processors handle simpler tasks, consuming less energy to perform them and extending battery life. Given better standard software, although there have been complaints that Samsung could reduce the in-house bloatware further in its implementation of Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and a chunkier battery, the S7 can do a lot both more efficiently and for much longer than its predecessor, and about as well as rivals such as the latest iPhone and Nexus models. Some of the most significant hardware improvements, however, concern the main rear-mounted camera.

Some of the most common are block copolymers composed of PEO [poly (ethylene oxide)] and PPO [poly(propylene oxide)], like the triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 (PEO106PPO70PEO106). DSC analysis of Pluronic F127 shows endothermic and exothermic peaks (at 54 and 30 °C) due to the melting and crystallization of the PEO blocks. This indicates that this commercially available block copolymer could be used as a phase change material (PCM).Nanostructured polymer blends like the phenolic resin/PEO-PPO block copolymer composite materials prepared using some soft-template synthesis procedures of OMC could be useful as a solid-solid PCMs if the crystallization of the PEO blocks of the block copolymer is possible within the material. DSC analysis of particles of a phenolic resin/F127 composite material (material P9) prepared using one soft-template synthesis procedure of OMC in solution in basic media (thermal treatment of an alkaline (pH around 9) aqueous solution of F127 and a phenol-formaldehyde resin, followed by centrifugation) shows no evidence of an endothermic or exothermic process. A reduction of the pH of the phenol-formaldehyde resin aqueous solution (from about 9 to 8.5) before the thermal treatment has an effect in the phase separation, that in this case leads to the formation of two layers; a polymer rich phase in the bottom of the reactor and above a layer composed mainly by water. Thermal treatment of the polymer rich phase at 100 °C for 24 h yields a solid composite material (material P8.5). DSC analysis shows an endothermic peak (35 °C) in every cycle, attributable to the fusion of PEO crystalline domains. This indicates that the crystallization of the PEO blocks is possible in this material; but there is not an obvious exothermic peak. The material P8.5 has a higher F127 content (around 60%; estimated by TGA) than the material P9 (around 40%); this indicates that in these composite materials the final block copolymer content has an effect on the crystallization of the PEO blocks. Other synthesis procedures of OMC like EISA (evaporation induced self-assembly) provide a better control of some characteristics, like the block copolymer content. Materials with a high F127 content (60% m/m) were prepared by EISA (controlled evaporation of the solvent of an ethanolic solution of F127 and a phenol-formaldehyde resin, followed by a thermopolymerization process at 100 °C for 24 h). The DSC analysis shows an endothermic peak (38 °C) and an exothermic peak at a low temperature (-20 °C). These results indicate that the synthesis procedures of OMC using a phenolic resin and a PEO block copolymer could be a suitable alternative for the production of solid-solid PCMs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Block copolymers; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Ordered mesoporous carbon; Phase change materials; Phenolic resins","Alkalinity; Block copolymers; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Composite materials; Ethylene; Evaporation; Formaldehyde; Heat storage; Heat treatment; Latent heat; Mesoporous materials; Phase separation; Phenolic resins; Phenols; Polyethylene oxides; Polymer blends; Self assembly; Solutions; Synthetic resins; Temperature; Thermal energy; Controlled evaporation; Evaporation induced self assemblies; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Melting and crystallization; Nanostructured polymer blends; Ordered mesoporous carbon; Phenol formaldehyde resins; Soft-template synthesis; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964389155

But the increasing demands and alternative renewable energy sources on the power grid are causing instability and price volatility. Smart grid technology and programs are emerging to address these problems. In this paper we study demand-supply management under operational constraints and outage scheduling. We consider a model of an electricity market in which finite number of suppliers offer electricity. Each supplier has several power plants with different maximum capacity of production and different cost depending on the operational constraints. The response of the market to these offers is the quantities bought from the suppliers. The objective of the market is to satisfy the electricity demand at minimal cost. We develop a theoretical framework for cooperative production strategies between electricity producers. We formulate the problem as an optimal control problem under constraints. Using maximum principle techniques, we provide closed-form expressions of the joint production efforts between the electricity producers. Applying inf-convolution technique to the Hamiltonian we transform the multiple variable optimization problem into a single-variable optimization problem, reducing significantly the curse of dimensionality. In order to capture the random nature of most of the renewable energy sources, we introduce stochastic demand and stochastic production variabilities. We derive closed-form expressions using mean-field-type optimization techniques. The framework is shown to be flexible enough to include both risk-neutral and risk-sensitive behavior of a decision-maker when facing uncertainties. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Mean-field; Optimal control; Production planning; Risk-sensitive","Commerce; Convolution; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision making; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Natural resources; Optimal control systems; Optimization; Production control; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Mean field; Operational constraints; Optimal control problem; Optimal controls; Optimization techniques; Production Planning; Renewable energy source; Smart Grid technologies; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964267958

The varieties were: CT115 (CT), African Cane (AC), Taiwan (TAI), King Grass (KG), Vruckwona (VRU), Roxo (RX), OM22 (OM) and Cameroon (CAM). Local weather is warm and sub-humid, historical data for monthly average temperature and annual rainfall were 25.8 °C and 1142 mm, respectively. Height, diameter and light interception were measured monthly from day 65-185. At day 185, biomass yield and tiller density were measured. Number of lying tillers was counted to estimate lodging resistance. Cellulose and hemicellulose content were estimated in leaf and stem. No differences were found for dry matter yield or stem yield at day 185 in the first year. Regarding the next two years, TAI yielded above CT, OM or ROX. Average dry matter yield was higher in the second year than in the establishment cycle (38.6 vs 21.1 Mg ha-1), but decreased in the third year (32.2 Mg ha-1). In both stem and whole plant, AC and KG showed higher hemicellulose content than RX, OM or CT; while AC and VRU had higher cellulose than RX in stem, or than CT in the whole plant. Furthermore, varieties AC, KG, VRU and TAI were resistant to lodging and had a higher fiber content, so they are recommended as energetic crops. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass; Cellulose; Cutting frequency; Lignin; Napier grass; Pennisetum purpureum","Agriculture; Associative storage; Biomass; Cellulose; Ecology; Lignin; Annual rainfall; Cellulose and hemicellulose; Cutting frequency; Dry matter yield; Light interception; Lodging resistance; Napier grass; Pennisetum purpureum; Crops; agrometeorology; biochemical composition; cellulose; crop yield; cultivar; energy crop; grass; growth response; lignin; relative humidity; tillering; Biomass; Cellulose; Cutting; Lignins; Mexico [North America]; Veracruz; Cenchrus; Pennisetum purpureum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961783275

Water Pumped Storage Systems (WPSS) are a way to overcome this issue, by storing the surplus energy not needed in the valley periods, to use it later in peak periods. This situation is dealt with in this paper, through the proposal of an energy balance technical model, taking into account the constraints and operational limits of the thermal power plant, together with an economic model based on NPV and IRR. This model is applied to assess the Terceira Island case-study. Despite the fact that this is a simplified model, not using any optimization techniques, it was possible to conclude that WPSS provide both thermal based electricity and wind curtailment reduction, therefore facilitating the integration of renewable energy in the power system and enhancing the environmental aspects of electricity production. Moreover, it was found that there are turbine/pump sizing combinations that can turn the project into an economically viable one. Also, it was demonstrated that further economic feasibility could be achieved if SR requirements could be lowered. This aspect should be considered by Terceira system operator. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Economical assessment; Integration of renewables; Spinning Reserve; Water Pumped Storage Systems (WPSS); Wind curtailment; Wind energy","Thermoelectric power plants; Wind power; Economical assessments; Integration of renewable energies; Integration of renewables; Operational constraints; Optimization techniques; Preliminary assessment; Pumped Storage; Spinning reserves; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960390099

The system operates with the silica-gel/water pair and is capable of storing the thermal energy received from the surrounding water (e.g., excess heat input from a hot water storage tank), in order to give it back later to the water as adsorption heat. The model was developed following a lumped parameter approach implemented in MATLAB® code. The performance of the absorber unit was assessed by a set of parametric tests under different geometric configurations and temperature conditions. The mass of adsorbent was found to have a higher impact on the thermal energy exchange than the surface contact area between metal and adsorbent. An improved finned adsorber, with 27 internal longitudinal fins and 120 external annular fins, resulted in a heat output to the water 2.3 times higher than with a similar finless adsorber. Moreover, the evaporation temperature effect was found to be much higher than the condensation temperature effect.

The study is performed for two configurations based on two different supercritical cycles: the regeneration and recompression sCO2 Brayton cycles. A two-tank molten salt storage is utilized to ensure a uniform operation throughout the day. From the entropy analysis, it was shown that the solar tower is the largest contributor to entropy generation in both configurations, reaching almost 80% from the total entropy generation, followed by the MEE-TVC desalination system, and the sCO2 power cycle. The entropy generation in the two-tank thermal storage is negligible, around 0.3% from the total generation. In the MEE-TVC system the highest contributing component is the steam jet ejector, which is varying between 50% and 60% for different number of effects. The specific entropy generation in the MEE-TVC decreases as the fraction of the input heat to the desalination system decreases; while the specific entropy generation of the sCO2 cycle remains constant. The cost analysis performed for different regions in Saudi Arabia and the findings reveal that the regions characterized by the highest average solar irradiation throughout the year have the lowest LCOE and LCOW values.

The advantage of adding multiwalled carbon nanotubes to the array of xerogel-nafion was studied through different electrochemical methods. It was validated that the greater carbon nanotube mesoporosity allows less compaction of the electrode, thus effectively increasing the specific area and therefore capacitance.

For the solid model, nickel are placed at the edge of carbon surfaces and varied from 0 to 6 %. In addition the simulation results together with the measured isotherm data for nitrogen at 77 K are used to derive the pore size distribution (PSD) of activated carbons based catalyst, which are in reasonable agreement with PSDs obtained from density functional theory method. The simulation of hydrogen adsorptions are carried out at 298 and 323 K, while those of methane are at 298, 303 and 308 K. The simulation results obtained for various pore sizes represent the commensurate and incommensurate packing which results in crossing of isotherms for pores of different sizes. An early onset in adsorption of methane on AC based catalyst is then observed and the maximum adsorption capacity in the case of catalyst is also greater than that of homogeneous carbon due to the stronger interaction between fluid and metal. The concentration of Ni on carbon surfaces is also investigated and it is found that the adsorption isotherm increases with an increase of Ni concentration which differs from the experimental data of N2. While the temperature effect is found that the adsorption increases when the temperature decrease which is typically observed for physical adsorption. The similar adsorption behavior are also observed in the case of hydrogen, justifying that nickel on AC surfaces can be used to enhance the adsorption of methane and hydrogen which may be developed for energy storage. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Catalyst; Monte Carlo simulation; Nickel","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Catalysts; Density functional theory; Digital storage; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent systems; Methane; Monte Carlo methods; Nickel; Nitrogen; Pore size; Adsorption behavior; Adsorption capacities; Carbon based catalysts; Density functional theory methods; Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation; Hydrogen adsorption; Physical adsorption; Temperature decrease; Gas adsorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954414790

Scenarios of EU and global climate action to 2050 are quantified using the GEME3-RD model, a global multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium model with endogenous technology progress and detailed representation of the clean energy technologies. The model includes two-factor learning curves (stock and research and development funding) for clean energy technologies, such as electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage, and renewable and efficient appliances. Funding of research and development is endogenously derived as a production factor enabling productivity improvement. The scenarios compare stylised climate strategies, which are asymmetric by world region and have different emission reduction profiles over time. Assuming that strong climate mitigation action will be undertaken only after 2030, the scenarios compare two main strategies for the EU: pursuing strong emission reduction unilaterally until 2030 versus deferring action for the period after 2030. Asymmetric climate action by region enables asymmetric innovation and manufacturing of clean energy technologies. The macroeconomic assessment of the climate action strategies does not only depend on costs of clean technologies but also on induced technology progress implying asymmetric effects on manufacturing and trade by region, taking into account spillovers. The model-based projections show clear advantages for the EU as a first mover in climate change mitigation compared with a delaying of climate action until 2030. Delayed climate action until 2030 implies higher gross domestic product losses for the EU compared with unilateral action until 2030. The model finds benefits of early action by the EU driven by activity and progress related to clean energy technologies as the EU can achieve competitive advantages over other world regions pursuing climate action later. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Climate change mitigation; Computable general equilibrium modelling; Economic growth induced by technology progress; Macroeconomic assessment of clean energy technologies","Carbon capture; Climate models; Competition; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Engineering education; Manufacture; Productivity; Clean energy technology; Climate change mitigation; Computable general equilibrium; Computable general equilibrium model; Gross domestic products; Productivity improvements; Research and development; Technology progress; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954305792

However, the usage of the RES technologies and daily/weekly storage of energy and their connection to smart grids is not enough for the expected third industrial revolution. The start of this revolution would require technologies that have a great potential for further development and ability to supply, at any time, the necessary energy and power to a settlement/city, as well as drinking water, meeting the peak load requirements, continuously throughout the year, and independently of external sources of energy and drinking water. This would be provided from intermittent RES energy (solar, wind, etc.) and sea or other unclean source of water as natural resources. In that context, this paper presents a radically new technological solution: Key Engine which uses only natural resources: the sun, sea and gravity, in order to continuously and simultaneously supply a consumer with energy, power and drinking water. This solution has all the essential features required to start a third industrial revolution. The basic unit of Key Engine consists of the solar thermal (ST) generator with parabolic trough collectors through which sea water flows directly, absorbing thermal energy of solar radiation. After the separation of steam from seawater, the steam drives turbines and generators and produces electricity that is delivered to Pump Storage Hydroelectric (PSH) facility with seawater, which balances the daily and seasonal surpluses and shortages of energy, thus ensuring a continuous supply of electric power and energy to a consumer. At the same time, the water that comes out of the turbine, passes through the water treatment unit and is stored in drinking water reservoir, enabling continuous supply of the same consumer with drinking water. The paper presents theoretical aspects of Key Engine, model for optimal sizing and practical formulas for the calculation of characteristic values of the system, which could be the basis for further scientific research, development and innovative solutions that would help engineers in practice for numerous and diverse applications of Key Engine. In order to verify the derived mathematical relationships and models for optimizing the Key Engine in real conditions, the case study of the island of Vis in the Adriatic Sea, Croatia, has been considered, along with total annual irradiance of 1575 kW h/m2 a, total annual electric energy consumption of 20 GW h and drinking water consumption of 453,382 m3. The obtained results: power of ST generator of 52 MW, working volume of the upper reservoir of 7 hm3, total annual electric energy production of 62 GW h/a, and drinking water production of 480,754 m3/a, clearly show that the new technology can fully meet the needs of the considered consumer for energy and drinking water. As the basic idea of Key Engine relies on the use of natural resources, i.e. RES energy and sea, the paper presents only the starting solution, whereby, apart from the sun, RES can be wind, or other renewable sources, that can perform separation of vapor from seawater and thus produce drinking water, as well as energy simultanously. Also, energy storage may not be performed solely by the PSH technology, but also by any other technology that can provide seasonal balancing of energy. All this suggests that the Key Engine can be understood as an open-source for RES technology development and thus bring changes in all three aspects of sustainable development: economy, society and environment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These features are of major importance when considering the saline deposits that are concentrated in this area. There are several factors that make CSP technology an ideal resource for a successful development in northern Chile, highlighting the excellent solar resource and their combination with storage could supply energy to mining industry, which requires energy 24 h per day. The focus of this paper is to develop an economic analysis for computing a projection of LCOE between 2014 and 2050 from a 50 MW CSP plant with five different composition of salts for it TES. Two different scenarios are considered for this study: IEA BLUE Map Scenario and Roadmap Scenario. Additionally, a comparison between the LCOE in the north of Chile and the most influential countries in solar energy (Spain and USA) is made. The research basis lay on contribution of recent Chilean plans together with international researches in order to support the great potential of the implementation of CSP plant in the north of Chile. The results show that new proposed molten salts reduce considerably the storage cost. Thus, it can contribute to a promising future of the growth of CSP in the Plataforma Solar del Desierto de Atacama (PSDA) at north of Chile. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, the effect of pomegranate juice on the extension of the shelf life of the product was investigated. Samples (10 g) of chicken breast fillets were immersed in marinades containing pomegranate juice for 3 h at 4 °C following storage under aerobic conditions at 4, 10, and 15 °C for 10 days. Total Viable Counts (TVC), Pseudomonas spp and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were enumerated, in parallel with sensory assessment (odor and overall appearance) of marinated and non-marinated samples. The Baranyi model was fitted to the growth data of TVC to calculate the maximum specific growth rate (μ max ) that was further modeled as a function of temperature using a square root-type model. The validation of the model was conducted under dynamic temperature conditions based on two fluctuating temperature scenarios with periodic changes from 6 to 13 °C. The shelf life was determined both mathematically and with sensory assessment and its temperature dependence was modeled by an Arrhenius type equation. Results showed that the μ max of TVC of marinated samples was significantly lower compared to control samples regardless temperature, while under dynamic temperature conditions the model satisfactorily predicted the growth of TVC in both control and marinated samples. The shelf-life of marinated samples was significantly extended compared to the control (5 days extension at 4 °C). The calculated activation energies (E a ), 82 and 52 kJ/mol for control and marinated samples, respectively, indicated higher temperature dependence of the shelf life of control samples compared to marinated ones. The present results indicated that pomegranate juice could be used as an alternative ingredient in marinades to prolong the shelf life of chicken. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Dynamic temperature conditions; Isothermal; Marination; Poultry; Predictive modeling; Quality; Safety","analysis; animal; bacterial count; bacterium; biological model; chemistry; chicken; devices; evaluation study; female; food preservation; growth, development and aging; human; isolation and purification; kinetics; Lythraceae; male; meat; metabolism; microbiology; procedures; taste; temperature; Animals; Bacteria; Chickens; Colony Count, Microbial; Female; Food Preservation; Humans; Kinetics; Male; Meat; Models, Biological; Punicaceae; Taste; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951998884

While there is a growing commercial interest to incorporate fruit pieces in juices and soft drinks, such implementation for mango pieces is impaired by the sensitivity of the pieces texture during beverage processing (i.e., thermal treatment) and shelf life. In this work, we have evaluated the evolution of texture, color and composition of mango pieces from two non-fully ripe ripening stages in a mango juice drink after pasteurization (77 °C for 15 min) and shelf life (8 weeks at 21 °C). Our results indicated that the firmness of the pieces from the earlier ripening stage was significantly improved by pasteurization and preserved during storage. On the other hand, no improvement in texture was observed for the riper pieces most likely due to a more degraded cell wall structure at the later ripening stage preventing the beneficial firmness increase occurring due to starch gelatinization. Those results, combined with the observed migration of sugars and acids between the pieces and the juice, suggest that the utilization of non-fully ripe mango pieces could present a promising opportunity for the addition of mango bits to fruit beverages. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Mango pieces; Pasteurization; Storage; Texture","Beverages; Energy storage; Fruits; Gelation; Pasteurization; Textures; Cell wall structure; Fruit beverages; Mango juices; Mango pieces; Quality characteristic; Ripening stages; Starch gelatinization; Tropical fruits; Thermal processing (foods)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946887378

Since its discovery by Geim et al. in 2004, graphene has received enormous attention due to its excellent electrical conductivity, mainly originating from the delocalized p bonds above and below the basal plane, its large surface area, and low production costs. Owing to these excellent physical and chemical properties, graphene has become an interesting alternative for the development of electrical devices, sensors, and biosensors, synthesizing nanocomposites, drug delivery, catalytic and solid-phase microextraction, energy storage materials, and transparent conducting electrodes. Because of its ultrahigh specific surface area and strong p-p electrostatic stacking property, graphene is expected to be a promising stationaryphase material for open-tubular capillary electrochromatography. Graphene-based electrochemical sensors present a better performance compared to glassy carbon, graphite, and even carbon nanotube-based sensors, mainly due to sp2- like planes and edge defects that are more exposed on the graphene nanosheets than on other carbon materials. It is believed that nanoparticles can be controllably synthesized and well dispersed on the graphene surface. Additionally, the graphene nanosheets may effectively buffer the strain from the volume change of particles during cycles and also preserve a high electrical conductivity of the electrode if highly insulating metal oxides were used as anodes (e.g., Mn3O4). Recently, graphene-supported metal nanocomposites as a new class of hybrid materials combining the advantages of both graphene substrate and active metal nanoparticle components have shown extensive applications in many advanced fields such as memory electronic and optoelectronic transistors.lattice [1,2]. It is characterized as ""the thinnest material in our universe"" [3,4]. Since its discovery by Geim and Novoselov in 2004 [5], graphene has gained a lot of attention in scientific and technological fields because of its unique physical/chemical properties such as large specific surface area (2630 m2 g-1), excellent electrical conductivity (103-104 S m-1), mechanical strength, and potential bulk quantity production along with low cost [5-7]. The application of graphene in many fields such as energy storage materials [8,9], memory electronic, optoelectronic transistors [10,11], electrocatalysts [10,12], drug delivery [13], Li ion batteries [14,15], solid-phase microextraction [16], and biosensors [17,18] are well studied. Graphene-based electrochemical sensors present a better performance compared to glassy carbon, graphite, and even carbon nanotubesbased sensors, mainly due to sp2-like planes and edge defects that are more exposed on the graphene nanosheets than on other carbon materials [2,19]. © 2016 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Biosensors; Carbon nanotubes; Controlled drug delivery; Costs; Electric conductivity; Electrocatalysts; Electrochemical sensors; Energy storage; Extraction; Glass; Glassy carbon; Graphene transistors; Graphite; Hybrid materials; Lithium-ion batteries; Manganese oxide; Metal nanoparticles; Metals; Nanocomposites; Nanosheets; Specific surface area; Substrates; Synthesis (chemical); Targeted drug delivery; Transparent electrodes; Yarn; Electrical conductivity; High electrical conductivity; Large specific surface areas; Nanotube-based sensors; Open tubular capillary electrochromatography; Physical and chemical properties; Solid-phase microextraction; Transparent conducting electrodes; Graphene",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052465748

This chapter focuses on the use of graphene in photoelectrochemical systems, in particular for photocatalysis, hydrogen generation, and in dye-sensitized solar cells. Currently, titanium dioxide (TiO2)-anatase is the most used photocatalyst for environmental applications. Very recently, the TiO2/graphene composite proved to be an interesting material for photocatalytic purposes, exhibiting enhanced energy-harvesting properties and consequently improved photocatalytic activity. When graphene is bounded to semiconductors such as TiO2, the semiconductor band gap becomes smaller and makes the rate of hole/electron recombination after light excitation decrease, acting as an efficient electron acceptor. Hydrogen production via photoelectrochemical water splitting is a thriving alternative that combines photovoltaic cells with an electrolysis system. The major advantage is that solar harvesting, conversion, and storage are combined in a single integrated system. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are among the leading third-generation photovoltaic devices, beginning to position themselves as a reliable low-cost alternative to traditional silicon devices. Graphene is the ideal candidate for incorporation in DSCs due to its tunable surface properties and high electrical conductivity. Its versatile nature enables it to be used in different parts of the cell, namely as a counterelectrode or incorporated in the photoelectrode to increase the electronic conductivity. © 2016 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Dye-sensitized solar cells; Electric conductivity; Electrochemistry; Energy gap; Energy harvesting; Hydrogen production; Magnetic semiconductors; Nanostructured materials; Photocatalysis; Photovoltaic cells; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Titanium dioxide; Electronic conductivity; Environmental applications; High electrical conductivity; Photocatalytic activities; Photoelectrochemical system; Photoelectrochemical water splitting; Semiconductor band gap; Titanium dioxides (TiO2); Graphene",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052440508

This integration has led to the development and promotion of energy storage systems with new long-term storage options such as power-to-gas. Power-to-gas refers to the chemical storage of electrical energy in the form of gaseous substances such as methane or hydrogen. In the chapter the term ""power-to-gas"" is defined as the utilization of (surplus) electrical energy from renewable power sources for the production of hydrogen in an electrolyzer and the optional synthesis of methane or other hydrocarbons from hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Power-to-gas technology makes long-term storage of electrical energy possible and makes for a more resource-efficient and flexible energy system. Other long-term energy storage technologies are currently nonexistent in national grids. Power-to-gas enables accelerated integration and continued realization of low- or zero-emission technologies such as wind power and photovoltaics, thereby promoting the achievement of both climate and energy policy objectives. Furthermore, power-to-gas allows new options in energy transport by shifting load from the power grid to the gas grid. This also reduces socioeconomic challenges such as social opposition to power grid expansions. The chapter describes the power-to-gas system, in general, and deals with multifunctional applications of the technology, in particular.

Acylation stimulating protein (ASP) is an adipokine that has been shown to be produced by adipocytes in a differentiation-dependent manner. All the proteins required for the production of ASP are also expressed and produced by adipocytes. ASP directly regulates glucose uptake and TG storage by increasing glucose transporters (GLUT) on the membrane and via up-regulating diacylglyceride transferase (DGAT) activity, the rate-limiting step of TG synthesis. In addition, dietary fat (CHYLO) has been shown to stimulate ASP production. The identification of C5L2 as the ASP receptor further supported the function of ASP as a hormone in lipid metabolism. Several fat-loaded meal studies in rodents have demonstrated that a loss in ASP or the ASP receptor function results in a reduction in TG clearance from circulation. The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of ASP production and function in lipid metabolism in association with obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052884459

Two configurations with or without thermal storage were compared. Moreover, an optimization study has been made for the collector area, the inclination of the solar collectors, storage tank, pipes material and pumps flow rates. Dynamic simulation of the Hammam coupled with the floor heating system was conducted using TRNSYS software. The Hammam was monitored via air temperature and humidity measurements during four days of the 2015 winter season. Simulations and monitoring results are compared using in-situ measured weather data, while the parametric study was performed along a typical meteorological data (TMY). Comparison between simulation and experimental results showed good accordance with a maximum deviation of 1.5 °C and a maximum relative difference less than 4%. Simulation results show that the system without thermal storage allows the Hammam operative temperature to reach the desired one, since it ranges between 36 °C and 39 °C for a sunny day in winter; while the system with thermal storage leads to at least 10 °C operative temperature lower compared to system without thermal storage. In addition, the former allows having quasi-constant floor temperature that depends on the storage volume, so it avoids day/night temperature large fluctuations thanks to thermal storage inertia. Nevertheless, the configuration of the floor heating system with a storage tank does not achieve the desired temperature for the floor of the Hammam. Furthermore, results of simulations show that the use of serpentine of PEX tubes, 4 m2 water solar collectors with 80 kg.h-1 flow rate works properly for the configuration without thermal storage, since the Hammam air temperature has to be maintained at around 37 °C. © 2015 IEEE.","Energy efficiency; Floor heating; Monitoring; Simulation; Solar energy","Atmospheric temperature; Computer software; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Floors; Heat storage; Heating; Heating equipment; Meteorology; Monitoring; Serpentine; Silicate minerals; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar heating; Storage (materials); Tanks (containers); Comparison between simulation and experimental results; Floor heating; Floor heating systems; Meteorological data; Monitoring results; Operative temperature; Optimization studies; Simulation; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968690727

Initially, the PCM (paraffin n-Octadecane) is in the liquid state at a temperature above the melting point. The solidification process occurs when the finned wall is abruptly cooled at a temperature below the melting point. To resolve the 2D transient problem heat transfer, the mass, momentum and energy conservation equations were integrated using the finite volume method. The enthalpy method was adopted to formulate the energy equation. To investigate the effect of fins on the thermal performance of the system during the discharging operational mode, a comparative study of finned and unfinned enclosures containing the same mass of PCM has been conducted. A parametric study was performed to evaluate how the storage performance is affected by the fins position. Numerical results show that the addition of fins in the PCM is an effective way to improve the heat transfer in the latent heat storage systems (LHSS). © 2015 IEEE.","fins; rectangular enclosure; solidification; solidification time","Enclosures; Energy conservation; Finite volume method; Fins (heat exchange); Heat storage; Melting point; Phase change materials; Solidification; Storage (materials); Energy conservation equations; fins; Heat Transfer enhancement; Latent heat storage system; Rectangular enclosures; Solidification process; Solidification time; Thermal Performance; Heat transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968615980

In contrast to widely used centralized approaches for energy management a distributed multi-agent scheme for optimization of energy flow within a microgrid consisting of local energy resources and storage capacities is presented which is based on the auction algorithm for assignment problems originally introduced by Bertsekas in 1979 [1]. It is shown that the topology of a microgrid can be represented as a bipartite graph and mathematically be described as a classical transportation problem. This allows applying an auction algorithm scheme in a distributed way where each energy supply system node is either a source or a sink and is represented by an individual acting agent. The single-objective approach is extended towards bi-objectivity to build a framework which gives each agent freedom and authority to intelligently influence the global decision making (optimization) with respect to its own individual objectives and therefore a distributed bi-objective optimization for the energy flow in the microgrid with individual agent objectives is achieved. In the introduced framework computational intelligent agents enhance the intelligence of the global decision making based on their individual agents intelligence. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Combinatorial optimization; Decision making; Energy conservation; Energy resources; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; Optimization; Topology; Assignment problems; Auction algorithms; Bi-objective optimization; Bipartite graphs; Centralized approaches; Energy supply system; Individual agent; Transportation problem; Software agents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968548407

As a consequence of this there is an increasing attention for alternative renewable energy resources. In future, renewable energy sources will be integrated with energy storage and it will require a proper converter for integrating with the grid. In order to achieve this, various power electronics topologies have to be incorporated between the grid and the renewable source(s). This paper presents the simulation and experimental implementation of DC power source integration in micro-grid using single phase 'Voltage Source Inverter' (VSI) with 'Phase Locked Loop' (PLL) topology. Firstly the appropriateness of the PLL technique for the micro-grid synchronization is analyzed under the normal condition, harmonic condition and the non-harmonic (e.g. impulse) condition of a power system using Matlab Simulink®. Then the design and experimental implementation steps of the grid-tied VSI are discussed in details. In this work, a VSI with PLL technique is presented with simulation and experimental results for integrating with 230V/50Hz low voltage grid. © 2015 IEEE.","grid synchronization; phase locked loop; voltage source inverter","Electric inverters; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Energy resources; Locks (fasteners); MATLAB; Phase locked loops; Renewable energy resources; Topology; Grid synchronizations; Implementation steps; Low-voltage grid; MATLAB/ SIMULINK; Normal condition; Renewable energy source; Renewable sources; Voltage source inverter; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966615417

Bending stiffness was found to be 14.80 kN/m. Results demonstrate the manufactured composite rotors process to manufacture wind turbine blades with structural integrity. Dynamic testing was performed to verify the structural integrity of wind turbine at 400 r.p.m. In dynamic mechanical testing, the storage modulus decreases with increase in temperature. The glass transition temperature of glass fiber/vinyl ester composite was obtained at 73.4 °C based on loss modulus behavior. FT-IR analysis of cured vinyl ester (Hetron 922) showed presence of acrylol double bound confirming proper curing of vinyl ester. FT-IR analysis at temperature 25, 50 and 100 °C does not show significant change in resin chemical structure.

The proposed cascade control system arrangement is based on the superimposed proportional-integral voltage controller designed according to Damping Optimum criterion and a zero-pole canceling feed-forward load compensator aimed at voltage excursion suppression under variable load conditions. The superimposed controller commands the inner battery and ultracapacitor current control loops through a dynamic current reference distribution scheme, wherein the ultracapacitor takes on the highly-dynamic (transient) current demands, and the battery covers for steady-state loads. In order to avoid deep discharges of the ultracapacitor module, it is equipped with an auxiliary state-of-charge controller. Finally, for those applications where load is not measured, an adaptive Kalman filter-based load compensator is proposed and tested. The presented control strategy has been implemented on the low-cost industrial controller unit, and its effectiveness has been verified by means of simulations and experiments for the cases of abrupt load changes and quasi-stochastic load profiles using a downscaled battery/ultracapacitor hardware-in-the-loop experimental setup. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper emphasizes in finding the benefits arising from hydrothermal coordination compared to the non-regulated integration of the hydroelectric units, as well as the benefits from the integration of wind power and CSP. Design/methodology/approach – Artificial Neural Networks were used to estimate wind power output. As for the CSP system, a three-tier architecture which includes a solar field, a transmission-storage system and a production unit was used. Each one of those separate sections is analyzed and the process is modeled. As for the hydroelectric plant, the knowledge of the water’s flow rated has helped estimating the power output, taking into account the technical restrictions and losses during transmission. Also, the economic dispatch problem was solved by using artificial intelligence methods. Findings – Hydrothermal coordination leads to greater thermal participation reduction and cost reduction than a non-regulated integration of the hydrothermal unit. The latter is independent from the degree of integration of the other renewable sources (wind power, CSP). Originality/value – Hydrothermal coordination in a power system which includes thermal units and CSP for cost and emissions reduction. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Artificial Neural Networks; Combined solar power; Economic dispatch; Hydroelectric plant; Renewable energy sources; Wind generators",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961933305

During the outages, industries, commercial establishments and residential consumers tend to use diesel generators, which not only expensive, but also leads to pollution. One of the main tasks for The Egyptian government is to generate electricity from renewable energy sources to overcome this increase in the energy consumption and at the same time reduce environmental impact of power generation New technologies allow the electricity to be generated in small sized plants. Large scale integration of distributed generators at either LV or MV is at the present the trend followed in power systems to cover the supply of some loads. These generators are of considerable smaller size than the traditional generators. So importance of Installation of renewable energy such as roof top solar photovoltaic will be increase. Roof top solar projects are a known phenomenon nowadays. These PV systems offer a great opportunity for institutions, industries, and all other buildings already using UPS, inverters, batteries and diesel generators to reduce energy costs and to ensure power continuity in the event of grid unavailability Integration of roof-top solar PV is suitable for use at the low voltage (LV) level in Egypt where integration can meet residential consumers' needs. So, governments must encourage households to build a sustainable climate-friendly society for the future and give incentives to the individual owners. These small scale rooftop PV (RTPV) systems have some very obvious advantages, such that, No additional land that could be used for other purposes is required for rooftop PV systems, Huge savings in the Transmission and Distribution losses (TDL), In the other side the uncontrolled and intermittent characteristic of solar PV which causes voltage fluctuation within the network and this is significant in the single phase PV system connection. Also, phase unbalance, loading on the distribution transformer, power factor, reactive power compensation, and harmonics is expected to have greater impacts on distribution network. And are the key influences at the point of PV connection that affects the power quality of the distribution network.

Research efforts are guided by the very high values of modulus of elasticity, mechanical strength, and electrical conductivity, exhibited by the nanocarbon filler. Embedding carbonaceous nanofiller within a polymer matrix has been proved to be beneficial to the mechanical and physical properties of carbon-polymer nanocomposites, even at a low loading level. An overview of the fabrication procedures is pre sented, since the state of the achieved dispersion of nanoinclusions and the interfacial effects between matrix and reinforcing phase are crucial for the overall performance of the nanocom posites. The morphology, mechanical properties, thermal stability and conductivity, and electri cal behavior of carbon nanocomposites are also presented and discussed. Graphitic nanofillers, such as CNTs, graphene, and graphite nanoplatelets, when suitably dispersed in a polymer matrix, provide a strong impetus for both thermomechanical and electrical performance. However, the effect on the electrical properties appears to be more pronounced. Electrical properties include the transition from the insulating to the conductive behavior at a low critical concentration of the conductive phase, the dielectric response, and the energy storage efficiency of the nanocomposites.

Three tips are considered: (i) distributed power network architecture, (ii) peak energy shaving with the integration of prosumers' contribution, (iii) Electric vehicles self-charging by means of prosumers' production. The proposed distributed power network architecture reduces significantly the transmission costs and can reduce significantly the global energy cost up to 42 percent. Different types of prosumer who use self-charging photovoltaic systems, are able to intelligently buy energy from, or sell it, to the power grid. Therein, prosumers interact in a distributed environment during the purchase or sale of electric power using a double auction with negotiation mechanism. Using a two-step combined learning and optimization scheme, each prosumer can learn its optimal bidding strategy and forecast its energy production, consumption and storage.

These developments can extend battery life in portable devices, and open new markets such as electric vehicles and large-scale grid energy storage. It is well known that surface reactions largely determine the performance and stability of electrochemical energy storage devices. Despite showing impressive capacities and high energy and power densities, many of the new nanostructured electrode materials suffer from limited lifetime due to severe electrode interaction with electrolytes or due to large volume changes. Hence control of the surface of the electrode material is essential for both increasing capacity and improving cyclic stability of the energy storage devices. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) which has become a pervasive synthesis method in the microelectronics industry, has recently emerged as a promising process for electrochemical energy storage. ALD boasts excellent conformality, atomic scale thickness control, and uniformity over large areas. Since ALD is based on self-limiting surface reactions, complex shapes and nanostructures can be coated with excellent uniformity, and most processes can be done below 200 °C.

In this article, a new supervisory control system for the optimal management and robust operation of a wind turbine generator and a battery energy storage system is presented. The proposed coordinated controller can mitigate both active and reactive power disturbances due to the intermittency of wind speed and load change. Moreover, the control strategy ensures the maximum power extraction capability of direct-drive wind turbine. This supervisory controller is made up of three subsystems. The first one is used to track the maximum power point for variable wind speeds; the control algorithm employs a fuzzy logic controller and a second-order sliding mode controller to effectively meet this target. The task of the second one is to maintain the required DC-link voltage level. This is achieved by controlling the bidirectional power flow in the storage batteries using DC-DC converter. Whereas in the last, a second-order sliding mode controller is investigated to achieve smooth regulation of grid active and reactive power quantities, which provides better results in terms of attenuation of the harmonics present in the grid courant compared with the conventional first-order sliding mode controller.

These two ETPs include hitherto missing 'key players' who can enhance commercial legitimacy on both the input and output sides of the system. This constitutes an important, though narrow, type of legitimacy in regard to specific technology developments, and questions remain about the performance of the ETPs in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises and social representation. This paper provides a valuable first qualitative analysis of this phenomenon which is emerging as a new policy instrument. © The Author 2015.","European technology platforms; Industry; Innovation policy; Innovation system; Legitimacy; Technology policy","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; European Union; industrial policy; innovation; policy approach; technology policy; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964705649

It results in the development of intermediate moisture products having lower water activity, which is imparted by solute gain and water loss. During the process, chemical, physical and biological activities, which deteriorate the foods, are lowered considerably; hence extends the shelf life of food products. In this process moisture is withdrawn from the product at ambient temperature by diffusion, so phase change has been avoided. Besides, it helps to improve the nutritional and sensory attributes of food products and is less energy intensive process as compared to other drying techniques. Osmotic dehydration is influenced by various factors such as osmotic agent, time and temperature, solute concentration, solution to sample ratio, agitation and geometry of the materials. Recently, osmotic dehydration has been combined with several other methods namely, pulsed high electric field, high hydrostatic pressure, ultrasound, centrifugal force, vacuum and gamma irradiation. These techniques have been employed during or after osmotic treatment to enhance osmotic dehydration performance by increasing the cell membrane permeability and mass transfer rate. These combined operations reduce the drying time, minimizing further energy costs. In this study, various segments of osmotic dehydration techniques and its application in food processing as well as recent advances in osmotic dehydration have been reviewed. Industrial relevance The osmotic dehydration technique is gaining popularity as a mean of obtaining minimally processed food. This review paper deals with the kinetics and mechanisms of osmotic dehydration technique for the preservation of fruits and vegetables. The various factors effecting osmotic mass transfer rate in food have been reviewed.

(Formula presented.) polyanions (PMo12) are examples of this kind of nanostructures that, grafted on amorphous carbon, have the capability to enhance the capacitive properties of these electrochemical ensembles. However, there is yet a poor understanding of the fundamental mechanisms for bond formation between them and carbon structures. It has been found experimentally that the presence of functional groups such as φ-NH2 and φ-OH assists on the chemical absorption of PMo12, but there is not enough information on the actual mechanism of the process. In order to gather further knowledge on these issues, we have performed quantum mechanical calculations, based on the density functional theory of atomic arrangements using graphene as carbon structure model, different functional groups, and PMo12. Our aim was to look for the nature of bonding among them, and to dig into the charge properties to relate them with the experimental observation. From the computations performed with PMo12 polyanion near to a graphene sheet, with and without the presence of functional groups, we conclude that there is a non-covalent/electrostatic bonding, made of weak (Formula presented.) – (Formula presented.) stacking interactions between PMo12 and graphene. Calculations show that φ-NH2 and φ-OH functional groups are able to form covalent bonds with PMo12 in top and side fashion arrangements, being the latter the most stable. This is a powerful argument to explain the empirical observation on these groups, enhancing the PMo12 adsorption over carbon structures. We also found that the presence of the functional groups together with PMo12 creates electronic states that may act as alternative pathways that ions can track within electrochemical cells. Our results offer first-principle information relevant to the understanding of these composite materials, and the methodology could be directly applied to other Keggin structures or different functional groups, attached to graphene, to find potential advantages for energy storage devices. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Carbon; Density functional theory; Energy storage; Nanocomposites; Nanohybrid systems; Polyoxometalates",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962524995

Main advantage of the proposed approach is that concentrations down to 0.05 μg L-1 (Irganox 1010 and Irganox 1076) – 0.1 μg L-1 (Irgafos 168 and Irgafos 168ox) can be determined without any additional pre-concentration step. This is achieved via direct injection of 1000 μl of simulant onto the HPLC column. Due to the reduced number of working steps of the proposed protocol, this approach also helps to minimize the risk of contamination via contact with plastic material employed during analysis such as pipette tips or plastic SPE-cartridges. Large volume injection with either UV or MS2 detection allowed the sensitive determination of the selected stabilizers in food contact materials, whereby MS2 (employing electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode, nitrogen as collision gas and collision energies between 22 and 80V) provided slightly better LOD values.

By differential scanning calorimetry, a series of reproducible heat flow fluctuations was determined on heating a hot-rolled martensitic Cu-Al-Ni SMA, which was associated with the precipitation of α-phase. Two heat treatments were given to the SMA so as to “freeze” its states before and after the thermal range for precipitation, respectively. The corresponding microstructures of the two heat-treated states were observed by optical and scanning electron microscopy and were compared with the initial martensitic state. Energy dispersive spectroscopy experiments were carried out to determine the chemical compositions of the different phases formed in heat-treated specimens. The initial as well as the heat-treated specimens with a lamellar shape were further comparatively investigated by dynamic mechanical analysis and two-way shape memory effect (TWSME) tests comprising heating-cooling cycles under a bending load. Temperature scans were applied to the three types of specimens (initial and heat-treated states), so as to bring out the effects of heat treatment. The storage modulus increased, corresponding to the reversion of thermoelastic martensite and disappeared with the formation of precipitates. These features are finally discussed in association with TWSME under bending. © 2016, ASM International.","martensite; optical and electron scanning microscopy; precipitation; shape memory alloys; thermal analysis","Aluminum; Bending tests; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Heat treatment; Martensite; Martensitic transformations; Nickel; Scanning electron microscopy; Shape memory effect; Thermoanalysis; Chemical compositions; Cu-Al-Ni shape memory; Effects of heat treatment; Electron scanning microscopies; Heat-treated specimens; Precipitation effects; Thermoelastic martensites; Two-way shape memory effect; Precipitation (chemical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959364920

To meet its CO2 emission obligations the IPP has to choose between purchasing emission unit allowances (EUA) through EU Emission Trading Scheme and installing a CO2 capture and storage system (CCS). Since there are significant differences and inconsistencies in the existing studies, our goal is to clearly identify the key drivers behind CCS costs and to analyze the technical and economic viability of coal fired IPPs. An important question tackled in this paper is: at what EUA price level does an IPP with CCS technology become competitive in the current market?In this paper, we expand the existing equations for calculating cost metrics by directly accounting for the chemical properties of the feedstock.

It applies the bounds testing approach to cointegration to time series data at individual country levels over the period from 1970 to 2011. The study finds that energy consumption is cointegrated with real GDP per capita, industrial output, imports, foreign direct investment, credit to private sector, urbanization and population. Furthermore, the sign and magnitude of long-run estimates vary significantly for a single country and across countries depending on the energy consumption variable used. Overall, the findings confirm the leading role of economic growth, industrial output, population and urbanization. Economic growth, industrial output and population have positive effects on energy consumption in the majority of countries. Given the urgent need to address climate change, African countries should adopt policies to improve energy efficiency and accelerate transition toward renewable energy.

The integrated solar air heater with paraffin wax as PCM was designed and tested under prevailing weather conditions of Tanta city (30° 43′N, 31°E), Egypt. The parameters affecting the thermal performance of the flat and v-corrugated plate solar air heater were presented with and without PCM. These parameters include solar radiation, the temperature difference of air across the heater, convective heat transfer coefficient between the absorber plate and the flowing air, instantaneous thermal efficiency, daily average efficiency and the PCM freezing time. The thermal performance parameters were studied when the mass flow rates were 0.062, 0.028 and 0.009 kg/s. The effect of changing the thickness of PCM below the absorber plate was also studied. From the experimental results, it was found that when using the PCM, the outlet temperature of the v-corrugated plate solar air heater was higher than ambient temperature by 1.5-7.2 °C during 3.5 h after sunset compared with 1-5.5 °C during 2.5 h after sunset for flat plate solar air heater when the mass flow rate was 0.062 kg/s. It was also concluded that the daily efficiency of the v-corrugated solar heater using PCM was 12% higher than the corresponding ones without using the PCM and it was also 15% and 21.3% higher than the corresponding values when the flat plate was used with and without PCM when the mass flow rate was 0.062 kg/s, respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The structure-property relationship was examined and optimized through changing the core-shell ratio, crosslinking of the core by using ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) crosslinker and modification of the soft shell by varying the concentration of a thiol based chain transfer agent (CTA). The prepared polymers were characterized by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Crosslinking of the core part enables high cohesive strength of the adhesive, whilst the relatively soft shell facilitates adhesion by enabling the proper wetting of the substrate. The optimal adhesive performance in terms of tack, peel strength and shear strength was achieved when the latex particles had a crosslinked core, a shell prepared without CTA and a core-shell ratio of 1:1.5.

The oxidation of CO within microcapsules was slower than in bulk, independently of the storage temperature. The kinetics parameters, rate constant and activation energy, decreased as aw increased. In the aw range between 0.614 and 0.654 both kinetic parameters presented the lowest values, which corresponded to the minimum integral entropy (ΔSint)T zone. The (ΔSint)T zone is considered as the zone of maximum stability as less water is available to participate in degradation reactions, acting as plasticizer in the polymeric matrix and hindering oxygen diffusion through the pores, retarding the oxidation process. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was done in the framework of the enerMENA project which aims to prepare the ground towards a sustainable realization of CSP power plants in the North Africa and Middle-East countries. Moreover, the electrical interconnection between Tunisia and Italy and the opportunity of the exploitation of renewable energy sources such as CSP plants in North Africa by European countries, were discussed. In addition, solar radiations data and weather parameters values delivered by a specific network of solar radiation and weather data installed in the Tataouine region at the south of Tunisia, were discussed from the angle of fitting with CSP technology. Besides, simulations of 50 MW parabolic trough solar power plant based on the solar radiation and climatic data delivered by the installed station were performed. The energetic and economic performances of the Tunisian simulated plant were compared with a reference CSP plant Andasol in Spain. The results prove that Tunisia has very important solar resources suitable for the CSP deployment such as the direct solar radiation DNI. Even, the total annual production of electricity generated from the simulated field of Tataouine exceeds that of the plant of Andasol in Spain by an amount of 1793 MWhe. However, the total investment cost is more important in the case of Tataouine station in Tunisia. A concentrated solar power project becomes economically competitive in Tunisia when the majority of the plant components such the collectors structure, the mirrors and the storage system should be manufactured locally in Tunisia to minimize the transport fees and by the way create jobs and enhances the local industry to investigate in this field. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Concentrating solar power plants (CSP); Solar energy resources; Tunisia; Weather parameters","Digital storage; Energy resources; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Solar radiation; Concentrated solar power; Concentrating solar power; Concentrating solar power plant; Direct solar radiation; Electrical interconnections; Renewable energy source; Tunisia; Weather parameters; Electric power system interconnection",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952333436

Low and high molecular weights chitosan (LMWC and HMWC) NP loaded with the phenolic acids, protocatechuic (PA) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acids (2,5-DHBA) were produced by ionic gelation. Antioxidant activities were determined by ORAC assay. Physical and thermal properties were evaluated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. Stability and release of phenolic acids during simulation of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) conditions were also assessed. Nanoparticles sizes ranged from 300 to 600 nm and maintained stable during storage at 4 °C during 30 d. Antioxidant activities of the phenolic acids decreased when loaded in the NP. High molecular weight chitosan NP adsorbed higher energy and melted at lower temperatures than LMWC NP. Nanoparticles produced with HMWC released higher phenolic acids % at GIT simulated conditions and with slight increases in their sizes. The most proper systems for delivery of PA and 2,5-DHBA were found to be LMWC and HMWC NP, respectively.

Internal explosions may occur as a result of an ammunition storage explosion, or a charge explosion within a room in a terrorist action or a warhead explosion following its penetration into a closed space. The paper deals with one of the basic aspects of internal blast - residual blast pressure (gas pressure, quasi-static pressure). The article presents different models for the prediction of the gas pressure. The sensitivity of the gas pressure to the heat capacity ratio and internal energy of explosion is studied. It is demonstrated that the heat capacity ratio has a much stronger effect on the gas pressure than the internal energy of explosion. It is shown that a thermodynamic model based on accounting for the afterburning energy release shows best agreement with experimental data. This method takes into account the variation of the total energy released and the heat capacity ratio depending on the ratio between the charge weight divided by the confined air volume. It is demonstrated that the proposed simplified approach based on using the developed gas pressure as well as on the Bernoulli equation for the quasi-stationary phase is well suited for simulation of partially confined explosions and properly describes the pressure relief and gas outflow from the vented room. The developed gas pressure can be successfully applied to simulation of confined blast response of flexible structures. An analytical solution of the SDOF blast response of a flexible structure is implemented. It is shown that the simplified approach based on the quasi-static gas pressure properly describes the elastic-plastic shell behaviour.

Optimal control operation is assumed. The objective is to maximize the net daily heat provided by the solar collectors. Meteorological data measured during year 2009 in Timisoara (Romania, Southeastern Europe) are used. Several days with more or less stable radiative regime are selected. Most results correspond to summer and spring days with daily relative sunshine larger than 0.4. The pumping energy increases by decreasing the daily relative sunshine. During more stable days the pump in the primary circuit operates a longer period of time than during less stable days. The opportunity to use the SDHW system for replacing a classical energy source depends on the stability of the radiative regime. The conclusion is that the dependence of SDHW systems' performance on the stability of the radiative regime is a complicate function of the specific performance indicator and the available amount of solar energy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Flat-plate solar collector; Optimal flow control; Solar domestic hot water; Stability of radiative regime; Water storage tank","Digital storage; Hot water distribution systems; Meteorology; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Stability; Tanks (containers); Water; Flat-plate solar collectors; Optimal flow control; Radiative regime; Solar domestic hot waters; Water storage tanks; System stability; energy efficiency; flow control; meteorology; optimization; photovoltaic system; pumping; radiative transfer; renewable resource; solar power; solar radiation; storage tank; water storage; Romania; Timis; Timisoara",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951014733

The model is validated with experimental data obtained for the same configuration. The cold storage unit was charged using water as the heat transfer medium, flowing inside a horizontal tube bundle, and the selected phase change material (PCM) was microencapsulated slurry in 45% w/w concentration. The mathematical model is based on the three-dimensional transient Navier-Stokes equations with nonlinear temperature dependent thermo-physical properties of the PCM during the phase change range. These properties were experimentally determined using analytical methods. The governing equations were solved using the ANSYS/FLUENT commercial software package. The mathematical model is validated with experimental data for three different flow rates of the heat transfer fluid during the charging process. Bulk temperature, heat transfer rate and amount of energy stored were used as performance indicators. It was found that the PCM bulk temperatures were predicted within 5% of the experimental data. The results have also shown that the total accumulated energy was within 10% of the observed value, and thus it can be concluded that the model predicts the heat transfer inside the storage system with good accuracy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CFD; Cold storage; Microencapsulated phase change materials; Model validation","Cold storage; Computational fluid dynamics; Data transfer rates; Digital storage; Heat storage; Heat transfer performance; Microencapsulation; Navier Stokes equations; Nonlinear equations; Tanks (containers); Two phase flow; Commercial software; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Microencapsulated phase change material; Model validation; Nonlinear temperature; Performance indicators; Simulation of heat transfer; Thermo-physical property; Phase change materials; computational fluid dynamics; heat transfer; model validation; Navier-Stokes equations; phase transition; slurry; storage; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950291359

Oxy-fuel combustion is a promising power generation technology for reducing both energy and cost penalties for CO2 capture. This paper presents a detailed techno-economic analysis for oxy-combustion power plant to generate about 350 MW net power with a carbon capture rate higher than 90%. Both fossil fuels (coal and lignite) and renewable energy sources (sawdust) were used to fuel a super-critical power plant (live steam parameters: 582 °C/29 MPa). The assessment is based on numerical analysis, the models of various power plant sub-systems being built in ChemCAD and Thermflow software. As benchmark option used to quantify the CO2 capture energy and cost penalties, the same super-critical power plant without CCS was considered. The investigated coal, lignite and sawdust oxy-combustion cases show an energy penalty of 9-12 net efficiency percentage points, 37-50% increase of total capital investment, the O&amp;M costs are increasing with 7-15% and the electricity cost with 54-95% (all compared to coal-fuelled non-CCS case).

We demonstrate a high tunnel magetoresistance (TMR) MgO-based magnetic tunnel junction stack with a hybrid free layer design made of a [Co/Ni] multilayer and CoFeB. The seed material on which the [Co/Ni] multilayer is deposited determines its switching characteristics. When deposited on a Pt seed layer, soft magnetic switching behavior with high squareness is obtained. When deposited on a NiCr seed, the perpendicular anisotropy remains high, but the squareness is low and coercivity exceeds 1000 Oe. Interdiffusion of the seed material with the [Co/Ni] multilayers is found to be responsible for the different switching characteristics. In optimized stacks, a TMR of 165% and low resistance-area (RA) product of 7.0 Ω μm2 are attained for free layers with an effective perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy of 1.25 erg/cm2, which suggests that the hybrid free layer materials may be a viable candidate for high density magnetic random access memory applications. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Anisotropy; Cobalt compounds; Hybrid materials; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic storage; Magnetism; Multilayers; Switching systems; Tunnel junctions; Critical dimension; High perpendicular anisotropy; Magnetic random access memory; Magnetic tunnel junction; Perpendicular anisotropy; Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; Spin transfer torque; Switching characteristics; Random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963547219

The purpose of this paper is to study the operational feasibility of transition the existing conventional combustion bus fleet to Electric bus fleet. The analysis is based on the data of the bus operation in Bangkok, Thailand. Traffic congestion as occurred in Bangkok is considered in the analysis. This research is focused on Fast charging technology of Electric vehicles. Instead of slow-charging overnight, Fast-charging is used during the regular layover time of the bus operation which is called Opportunity charging. The opportunity charging allows to extend the driving range of the electric buses which is a prominent problem of electric vehicles. The result stipulates the smallest number of batteries needed to meet the route requirement which come up with outstanding efficiency in energy consumption and more spacing of bus configuration.

In particular, binary descriptors are suitable for scenarios where computational, storage and energy resources are constrained and have been previously exploited to track an object along a video sequence. In this paper, binary descriptors are used to perform visual tracking in a stereo-based system, i.e. when two cameras with overlapping views are employed in a cooperative way. The proposed stereo-based visual tracker follows the tracking-by-detection approach where features extracted from different cameras are used to characterize the object appearance with a suitable model. Moreover visual tracking is performed at a central controller by just using the features transmitted from the two camera nodes. To achieve this target, efficient coding techniques are proposed to reduce the amount of feature data that is transmitted through the network. The performance of the proposed stereo-based visual tracker is evaluated in terms of rate-accuracy, i.e. using quantitative metrics to assess the accuracy of the visual tracker as a function of the coding bitrate. © 2015 IEEE.","binary descriptor coding; tracking-by-detection; visual tracking","Codes (symbols); Digital storage; Energy resources; Object recognition; Sensor networks; Binary descriptor; Coding techniques; Object appearance; Quantitative metrics; Rate accuracies; Tracking by detections; Visual sensor networks; Visual Tracking; Cameras",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969663970

The proposed system can harvest the energy from the coupling power between the signal through silicon vias (TSVs) in the 3D-SoC. The proposed system consists of three modules: energy source, energy harvesting which is based on TSV-based patch antenna, and power management module. The energy harvester module consists of three sub-modules: TSV-based patch antenna, 8-stage voltage multiplier and regulator, and energy storage. TSV technology is used to build an antenna on high resistivity substrate to be used as a transducer for the energy harvester system. The characteristic of this antenna is a function of TSV diameter, TSV length, and silicon resistivity. Compared to conventional on-chip antennas which suffers from low gain and low radiation efficiency, our novel antenna provides better performance parameters such as higher radiation pattern efficiency and higher gain as the antenna delivers a high gain of 5.8 dBi and the radiation efficiency is 86% over the prescribed range of frequencies. The proposed antenna is centered at 2.4 GHz with 200 MHz bandwidth. The overall area of the proposed antenna is 400μm×100μm. Building the antenna using TSV technology not only improves the performance, but also improves the isolation between the antenna and other active circuits. Simulations show that we are able to obtain dc voltage up to 2.5 V which is suitable for many low-power applications. © 2015 IEEE.","Antenna; Energy; Harvesting; Insertion Loss; Three-Dimensional ICs; Through Silicon Via; TSV","Antennas; Directional patterns (antenna); Electronics packaging; Energy harvesting; Harvesting; Insertion losses; Integrated circuit interconnects; Microelectronics; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Programmable logic controllers; Rectennas; Slot antennas; System-on-chip; Energy; High-resistivity substrate; Low power application; Performance parameters; Radiation efficiency; Three dimensional ICs; Through silicon vias; Through-Silicon-Via; Three dimensional integrated circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965072258

The estimation of the internal states of the batteries such as state-of-charge (SoC) is critical to provide consistent and efficient energy storage capabilities for the grids. In general, the electrochemical batteries are represented by non-linear mathematical models. Hence, the non-linear filters such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and particle filters are widely used for the battery state estimation. However, the non-linear filters are complex compared to the linear filters such as the Kalman filter. The non-linear battery model considered in this paper has an inherent linear sub structure. Hence, we propose a mixed Kalman cubature filter to exploit the inherent linearity to achieve better estimation results with a decreased complexity. The proposed filter uses the Kalman filter and the 3rd degree spherical radial cubature rule to calculate the first and second order moments of the linear and non-linear components, respectively, and subsequently, to estimate the SoC of the batteries. The experimental results show that the proposed filter performs better than the EKF and CKF. Further, the computational complexity of the proposed filter is less than the computational complexity of the CKF. Under the chosen conditions, the proposed filter achieves the average mean square error of approximately 1.1% where as the CKF and EKF achieves 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively with the maximum SoC. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Bandpass filters; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Computational complexity; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Estimation; Extended Kalman filters; Kalman filters; Mean square error; Nonlinear filtering; Secondary batteries; State estimation; Cubature kalman filters; Electrochemical batteries; Estimation results; Non-linear battery models; Particle filter; Second order moment; State of charge; Storage capability; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964967686

Therefore, the demand side management (DSM) is becoming unavoidable especially with the increasing use of renewable energy sources. One of the most known tactics of DSM is the use pricing strategies to threaten users to schedule their loads by controlling their own appliances. In this paper, a new model of electricity market operators is proposed based on three actors: The utility grid (G) with renewable energy (RE) generation, the electricity consumer (U) and a storage company (S). This approach aims to develop the adequate hourly prices which optimize the utility function of each operator. Then, in order to deal with this objective, two related games are defined. The first one is based on the satisfaction function of U and the G and aims to give the hourly prices of consumers' electricity bills. While the second one is based on the satisfaction function of G and S in order to optimize the hourly prices of G's electricity bills. Finally, a case study based on a given RE production and consumers load forecasts has been considered. Simulation results show that the obtained hourly prices allows the consumer load curve to follow the RE curve generation while achieving the main objective of the proposed approach. © 2015 IEEE.","game theory three players; optimization; outsourced storage; Renewable Energy based generation","Costs; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Game theory; Optimization; Population statistics; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Electricity consumers; Electricity demands; Model of electricity market; Population growth; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Satisfaction functions; Use of renewable energies; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964952127

Elucidation of the structure should help in the development of this material. Methods The AgAsS2 glass was prepared by the melt-quenched technique. Laser desorption ionisation (LDI) using quadrupole ion trap time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QIT-TOFMS) was used to follow the generation of AgmAsnSx clusters. The stoichiometry of the clusters generated was determined via collision-induced dissociation (CID) and modelling of isotopic patterns. The AgAsS2 glass was characterised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Results The LDI of AgAsS2 glass leads to the formation of unary (Ag+/- and As3+) species, 38 binary (AsnSx, AgmSx), and 98 ternary (AgmAsnSx) singly charged clusters. The formation of silver-rich nano-grains during AgAsS2 glass synthesis has been identified using TEM analysis and also verified by QIT-TOFMS. Conclusions TOFMS was shown to be a useful technique to study the generation of AgmAsnSx clusters. SEM, TEM and EDX analysis proved that the structure of AgAsS2 glass is 'grain-like' where grains are either: (1) Silver-rich 'islands' (Agm, m up to 39) connected by arsenic and/or sulfur or arsenic sulfide chains or (2) silver sulfide (Ag2S)m (m = 9-20) clusters also similarly inter-connected. This obtained structural information may be useful for the development of ultra-high-density phase-change storage and memory devices using this kind of glass as a base. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957069330

The model is comprised of five scenarios for 100% renewable energy power systems in North-East Asia with different high voltage direct current transmission grid development levels, including industrial gas demand and additional energy security. Renewables can supply enough energy to cover the estimated electricity and gas demands of the area in the year 2030 and deliver more than 2000 TW hth of heat on a cost competitive level of 84 €/MW hel for electricity. Further, this can be accomplished for a synthetic natural gas price at the 2013 Japanese liquefied natural gas import price level and at no additional generation costs for the available heat. The total area system cost could reach 69.4 €/MW hel, if only the electricity sector is taken into account. In this system about 20% of the energy is exchanged between the 13 regions, reflecting a rather decentralized character which is supplied 27% by stored energy. The major storage technologies are batteries for daily storage and power-to-gas for seasonal storage. Prosumers are likely to play a significant role due to favourable economics. A highly resilient energy system with very high energy security standards would increase the electricity cost by 23% to 85.6 €/MW hel.

They also allow discussing which arrangement/PCM is better for specific building applications considering the thermal regulation effect during charging, the influence of subcooling during discharging, and the influence of natural convection during both processes. During charging, the influence of the aspect ratio of the cavities on three parameters is investigated: control-temperature on the hot surface; thermal-regulation period; time required for melting the PCM in the mid-plane. During discharging, five parameters are evaluated: time for solidifying the PCM in the mid-plane; time for starting crystallization; subcooling period; phase-change temperature after subcooling; difference between the solidifying temperature and the cooled temperature due to subcooling. It was concluded that natural convection in the free-form PCM must be considered in any simulation to well describe the charging process. During discharging, subcooling must also be considered.

A novel technology for combined production of these resources and safe long terms storage of carbon dioxide is based on the injection of carbon dioxide injection into in situ methane hydrate filled sediments. This will lead to an exchange of the in situ methane hydrate over to carbon dioxide dominated hydrate and a simultaneous release of methane gas. Recent theoretical and experimental results indicate that the conversion from natural gas hydrate to carbon dioxide hydrate and mixed carbon dioxide/methane hydrate follows two primary mechanisms. Direct solid state transformation is possible but very slow. The dominating mechanism involves formation of a new hydrate from injected carbon dioxide and associated dissociation of the in situ natural gas hydrate by the released heat. Nitrogen is frequently added in order to increase gas permeability and to reduce blocking due to new hydrate formation. In this work we examine the thermodynamic limitations of adding nitrogen. On the basis of state of the art thermodynamic analysis it is concluded that substantial amounts of nitrogen in carbon dioxide will slow down the conversion dramatically. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Exploratory oil well drilling; Gas permeability; Gases; Hydration; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Nitrogen; Offshore gas wells; Sediments; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamics; Carbon dioxide hydrates; Carbon dioxide injection; Hydrate formation; Methane hydrates; Primary mechanism; Solid state transformations; State of the art; Thermo dynamic analysis; Gas hydrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961177255

The variation of wind speed causes the variations of Induction Generators (IGs) real and reactive power. These active and reactive power variations interact with the network and thus initiate voltage and frequency fluctuations. These irregularities in power output affect the power quality. It is seen that the power system frequency fluctuation is more severe for 10% capacity of wind power penetration. For continuous fed of more wind power it is necessary additional energy storage systems. Though energy storage device can solve the problem but more energy storage capacity may be needed. But the major problem in wind generator output power smoothing is the setting of the reference power. Constant output power reference is not a good choice because there can be some cases where wind speed is very low and then sufficient power cannot be obtained. This study investigates to generate a suitable reference power performed by Low Pass Filter (LPF), Simple Moving Average (SMA), and Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Finally, among the various methods it shows that the Low Pass Filter (LPF) seems to be more effective. © 2015 IEEE.","exponential moving average; Frequency fluctuations; low pass filter; simple moving average","Asynchronous generators; Bandpass filters; Energy storage; Reactive power; Signal filtering and prediction; Turbogenerators; Wind; Wind effects; Wind power; Wind turbines; Active and Reactive Power; Energy storage capacity; Exponential moving averages; Frequency fluctuation; Moving averages; Power system frequencies; Real and reactive power; Wind generator systems; Low pass filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966495644

For this model, the liquid fraction in the PCM was described by an analytic approximation of the Heaviside step function which, to the knowledge of the authors, is applied for the first time to study phase-change problems. The unstructured control volume finite element method was used to discretize the governing equations and a computer code was developed on Fortran 90 to solve the obtained algebraic equations. The numerical model has been validated by comparison with experimental data and exploited to predict the thermal coupling process between the hydride bed and the PCM domain.

Both chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and electricity generation using super capacitors by electricity storage were investigated under continuous flow mode. Three MFCs A1, B4 and C2 with 109.40 ± 34.25 mW/m3, 131.58 ± 27.75 mW/m3 and 124.01 ± 27.57 mW/m3, respectively, were chosen for testing.

The results of this study suggest that MFCs may be suitable for deployment in a septic tank. This research has demonstrated the great challenges in applying a stack of MFC in scale-up. Rint showed that anode resistances are higher than cathode; however, the configuration seems to be indicated for this kind of system depuration in developing countries.

Therefore, using resource-intensive applications has become a commodity in many contexts. However, the rapid evolution in hardware and software capabilities has not been paralleled by a similar advance in battery technology. A potential avenue to cope with the device energy resource limitation is to offload computational tasks to cloud infrastructure in the network. In order to offload tasks in an energy-aware manner, we present a detailed model of mobile device energy consumption, addressing the main power consuming subsystems, including CPU, display unit, wireless network interface and memory. Applying this model allows to estimate the power consumed by the application when executed locally, remotely or hybridly (i.e. partly on the device and partly in the cloud infrastructure). Offloading parts of the application can subsequently be decided at runtime based on these energy consumption estimates, also taking into account the power consumed by the device-to-cloud communication over the wireless network. The dynamic offloading has been validated with computational and communication intensive applications. Results show that 18-55% energy gains on the mobile device can be achieved, depending on different conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Concentrated solar heating of the steel tube is considered and the governing equations of heat transfer and the flow field, due to the natural convection, are solved numerically. Lithium nitrate is used as a phase change material due to its high latent heat of melting and aluminum is used as the metallic mesh material. The maximum and minimum temperature difference in the tube is predicted and the temperature parameter is introduced to assess the thermal storage performance of the mobile thermal battery. The numerical code is validated with the data reported in the early study and findings revealed that both results are in good agreement. It is found that temperature predictions agree well with the previous data. The use of metallic meshes inside the steel tube significantly improves the heat conduction in the phase change material. In this case, almost uniform temperature distribution is achieved inside the tube during the cycle of thermal energy storage. Sensible heating in the liquid phase of the phase change material results in the increase in the localized excessive temperature, which has an adverse effect on achieving a uniform temperature distribution inside the thermal battery. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Digital storage; Electric batteries; Heat conduction; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Phase change materials; Temperature distribution; Tubes (components); Tubular steel structures; Concentrated solar; Governing equations; Latent heat of melting; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Temperature parameters; Temperature prediction; Thermal characteristics; Thermal storage performance; Primary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961801410

With the increasing penetration of renewable energy technologies, there is a need to instantaneously match demand with supply. Energy storage has the potential to provide a back-up to intermittent renewable energy by storing electricity for use during more valuable periods. At this time, there are limited storage options, because several technologies are at very early stage of development. Pumped hydro energy storage is currently the most widely installed technology. This form of storage has some drawbacks which include the technology siting, as it cannot be implemented everywhere. This paper presents a concept that is similar to the existing pumped hydro storage technology. This concept is known as gravity storage, as it stores electricity in the form of gravitational potential energy. This storage option provides better operating characteristics and economically sounds solution over conventional pumped hydro storage, and can be placed almost anywhere electricity storage is needed. This paper proposes a methodology to optimally size the gravity storage technology and avoid system design failure. It also presents an economic analysis to investigate the value of this storage option. This work identifies the leveled cost of gravity storage and compares it to similar storage options. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Potential energy; Renewable energy resources; Design failures; Electricity storages; Gravitational potential energy; Operating characteristics; Pumped-hydro energy storages; Renewable energies; Renewable energy technologies; Storage technology; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960886061

A monitoring and control unit was designed and implemented to operate the system using a specially developed computer program based on LABVIEW software. The main task of the proposed scheme is to prevent the batteries from falling lower than a predefined state of charge (SOC). In this research a minimum SOC level of 35% is allowed. If the battery SOC fell to this level, the developed control scheme switches on the backup generator and switches the load from PVs and batteries to the backup generator. During sunshine periods the PV current was enough to supply the load (inverter current) and charge the batteries simultaneously, leading to frequent increase of batteries voltage. At the periods of clouds, the PV current was not enough to support the load resulting in withdrawing the shortage of current from the batteries leading to frequent decease of batteries voltage. © Research India Publications.","Battery state of charge; Control of PV systems; Hybrid energy systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959476733

Frozen storage incurs high-energy consumption for the preservation of food products, whereas cool storage involves the constant threat of bacterial decay. Contemporary cold-chain development in temperature control usually focuses on single logistic chain rather than serving multiple channels. In order to overcome the aforementioned deficiency, this study proposes a time-temperature indicator (TTI) based cold-chain system, which uses wireless sensors for collecting temperature data and implements the formulation of Critical Control Point (CCP) criteria throughout the entire delivery process. In particular, this approach is based on an Internet-of-Things (IoT) architecture as well as international food standards named ISO 22,000. More importantly, four new business models including (1) cold chain home-delivery service; (2) Convenience store (CVS) indirect delivery; (3) CVS direct delivery; (4) flight kitchen service, are successfully developed for conducting performance assessment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can increase annual sales of braised pork rice from 4.44 million bowls to over 6 million bowls, create more distribution channels to increase extra revenue of more than US$6.35 million, and reduce 10% energy consumption in central kitchens to enhance turnover of electricity from US$14.23 raised to US$18.64 per kilowatt hour. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cold chain; Control charts; Internet of Things; Time-temperature indicator; Wireless sensors","Chains; Control charts; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Food preservation; Food products; Internet; Internet of things; Quality control; Sales; Temperature measuring instruments; Wireless sensor networks; Cold chain; Conducting performance; Critical control points; High energy consumption; Internet of Things (IOT); Statistical quality control; Time-temperature indicators; Wireless sensor; Food storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959420139

In case of absence of hydraulic storage (water tank) or it is not enough dimensioned, the extra amount of pumped water is lost or is not reasonably used, when the system is operated on full daylight-hour. Beside that the extra amount of energy, which might be produced by the PV generator, is not exploited, when the system is operated only during a specified period-time needed to satisfy the demand.

The issued approach predicts the maximum delivery capacity of the system on monthly daily water volumes versus the monthly daily averages of solar irradiation, previously recorded. Its efficacy has been investigated and discussed according to the estimated and experimental values of its linearity coefficient, following the characterization tests of a designed system, carried out at our pumping test facility in Ghardaia (Algeria). The new theoretically and experimentally obtained flow-rates fit well, except insignificant deviations. The demand and supply energy curves are approximately approachable. Compared to the previous required water volumes, the new predicted averages show an annual excess rate between 41% and 54%. This rate is expected to be extracted by an annual surplus energy rate between 29% and 36% of the total annual provided energy rate. The proposed approach may be a tool to investigate the maximal delivery capacity and to determine the corresponding maximal PV energy production to be exploited of such system, so that to select the best management at any case. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A partial solution to these environmental problems could be the capture and the conversion of carbon dioxide. The main objective of the present work is to study the opportunities and prospects of recycling carbon dioxide to produce synthetic fuel, particularly methanol, which is a complementary technology to carbon capture and storage (CCS). This methanol will be produced by using several renewable energies, such as solar, wind and geothermal, for the purpose of using it in the transportation sector in Algeria. In 2013, Algeria's total amount of CO2 emissions (created by energy consumption) was 143 million tonnes. It is estimated that 44.4 million tonnes of CO2 can be captured from the exhaust of stationary units (factories and power stations) and converted to methanol every year. By adopting this process, approximately 32 million tonnes of methanol can be produced with an energy value of 580,000TJ. The methanol produced from CO2 can be used as an alternative transportation fuel. For this reason, the Geographical Information System (GIS) is used to present the spatial distribution of the methanol demand in short and long terms, based on market penetration rates, vehicle fleet and population data. An analysis of the energy balance, environment and economics of CO2 recycling process is presented. In terms of environmental performance, the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that come from the transport sector was remarkable in 2045. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Algeria; Carbon dioxide; Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC); Geographical Information System (GIS); Methanol; Renewable energy","Carbon capture; Digital storage; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC); Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Fleet operations; Fuel storage; Geographic information systems; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Information systems; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Population statistics; Recycling; Synthetic fuels; Algeria; Carbon dioxide emissions; Environmental performance; Environmental problems; Market penetration; Renewable energies; Transportation fuels; Transportation sector; Carbon dioxide; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; energy balance; fuel cell; GIS; methanol; recycling; renewable resource; Algeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954138173

However the variable character of solar and wind resources as well as the variable load demand prevent these generation systems from being totally reliable without suitable energy storage system. Several research works have been conducted on the use of photovoltaic and wind systems in rural electrification; however most of these works have not considered other ways of storing energy except for conventional battery storage systems. In this paper, an energy dispatch model that satisfies the load demand, taking into account the intermittent nature of the solar and wind energy sources and variations in demand, is presented for a hybrid system consisting of a photovoltaic unit, a wind unit, a pumped hydro storage system and a diesel generator. The main purpose of the developed model is to minimize the hybrid system's operation cost while optimizing the system's power flow considering the different component's operational constraints. The simulations have been performed using ""fmincon"" implemented in Matlab. The model have been applied to two test examples; the simulation results are analyzed and compared to the case where the diesel generator is used alone to supply the given load demand. The results show that using the developed control model for the proposed hybrid system, fuel saving can be achieved compared to the case where the diesel is used alone to supply the same load patters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these mechanisms have not been sufficiently confirmed by direct molecular evidence. This research aimed at gaining a detailed mechanistic insight into changes occurring in Canadian wonder bean pectic polysaccharides during storage, soaking and/or thermal treatment in different brine solutions in relation to the development and manifestation of the hard-to-cook (HTC) defect. Both fresh or easy-to-cook (ETC) and stored (HTC) bean samples were either soaked or soaked and thermally treated in demineralized water, solutions of Na2CO3 and CaCl2 salts followed by extraction of cell wall materials. Pectic polysaccharide properties examined included sugar composition, degree of methylesterification (DM), extractability and molar mass (MM). The DM of pectin from ETC and HTC beans was similar but low (&lt;50%). Upon (pre)treatment in a Na2CO3 solution, solubilization of pectic polysaccharides, especially the strongly bound chelator- (CEP) and Na2CO3- (NEP) extractable pectins was enhanced leading to increased amounts of water extractable pectin (WEP). Also, there was a decrease in high MM polymers paralleled by an increase in β-elimination degradation products. These observations are in line with the fast cooking behavior of beans (pre)treated in a Na2CO3 solution. In contrast, (pre)treatment in a CaCl2 solution hindered softening leading to the failure of the beans to cook. The beans (pre)treated in a CaCl2 solution showed increased high MM polymers and lack of cell wall separation. Therefore, it can be inferred that development of the hard-to-cook defect in Canadian wonder beans during storage and its manifestation during soaking and subsequent thermal treatment is largely reflected by the pectic polysaccharide properties in line with the pectin hypothesis. Our data suggest the release of Ca++ leading to pectin cross-linking and the increase or decrease of β-elimination depolymerization. However, the relatively high amounts of neutral sugars and strongly bound NEP in HTC seeds do not allow to rule out the possible existence of non-Ca++ based pectin cross-linking. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Beans; Hard-to-cook; Pectic polysaccharides; Soaking; Storage; Thermal treatment","Calcium; Defects; Degradation; Digital storage; Energy storage; Food storage; Heat treatment; Polymers; Polysaccharides; Storage (materials); Beans; Degradation products; Demineralized water; Different mechanisms; Methylesterification; Pectic polysaccharides; Soaking; Sugar composition; Water treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953261333

For that purpose, renewable resources and load forecasts ought to be taken in account for optimal demand response programs.The present study uses solar forecast coupled with domestic hot water needs to anticipate the electric demand of solar thermal systems. On the other hand, wind electricity supply will take advantage of thermal storage of solar systems, using a demand response strategy based on genetic algorithms, for load optimization, in order to minimize overall operating costs. The methodology is applied to the isolated microgrid of Corvo Island, in Azores.Results show a 3% increase in the dispatch costs due to the forecasts uncertainty, when in presence of 8% of daily flexible loads. However, this impact is dissipated when solar thermal backup needs decrease, which is explained by the relevance of the wind forecast on the planning of the dispatch of flexible loads. Wind forecast uncertainties can impact in 2% in absorption of wind energy, varying with the forecast horizon considered, while the solar forecast uncertainties have more impact when the thermal energy storage is below the daily thermal demand. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand response; Economic dispatch; Forecast uncertainties; Microgrids; Renewable energy systems; Thermal storage","Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric load management; Electric power distribution; Electric power plant loads; Energy policy; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Heat storage; Operating costs; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Solar heating; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Demand response; Economic Dispatch; Forecast uncertainty; Micro grid; Renewable energy systems; Thermal storage; Electric load dispatching; cost analysis; demand analysis; electricity supply; forecasting method; genetic algorithm; methodology; renewable resource; solar power; thermal structure; uncertainty analysis; wind power; Azores; Corvo; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941242719

Some of these challenges are leakage current for static random access memory (SRAM) and dynamic random access memory (DRAM), additional refresh operation for DRAM, and high programming voltage for Flash. In this paper, two emerging resistive random access memory (ReRAM) technologies are investigated, memristor and spin-transfer torque (STT)-RAM, as potential universal memory candidates to replace traditional ones. Both of these nonvolatile memories support zero leakage and lowvoltage operation during read access, which makes them ideal for devices with long sleep time. To date, high write energy for both memristor and STT-RAM is one of the major inhibitors for adopting the technologies. The primary contribution of this paper is centered on addressing the high write energy issue by trading off retention time with noise margin. In doing so, the memristor and STT-RAMpower has been compared with the traditional sixtransistor- SRAM-based memory power and potential application in wireless sensor nodes is explored. This paper uses 45-nm foundry process technology data for SRAM and physics-based mathematical models derived from real devices for memristor and STT-RAM. The simulations are conducted using MATLAB and the results show a potential power savings of 87% and 77% when using memristor and STT-RAM, respectively, at 1% duty cycle. © 2015 IEEE.","Duty cycle; Embedded memory; Low energy; Low power; Memristor; Spin-transfer torque (STT)-RAM; Wireless sensor node (WSN)","Dynamic random access storage; Flash memory; MATLAB; Memristors; Nonvolatile storage; Passive filters; Sensor nodes; Static random access storage; Dynamic random access memory; Low power application; Low voltage operation; Modeling and optimization; Primary contribution; Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM); Static random access memory; Wireless sensor node; Random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84932142896

The ultimate goal of the CVPP is the maximization of the DA profit in conjunction with the minimization of the anticipated real-Time production and the consumption of imbalance charges. A three-stage stochastic bi-level optimization model is formulated, where the uncertainty lies in the DA CVPP DER production and load consumption, as well as in the rivals' offer curves and real-Time balancing prices. Demand response schemes are also incorporated into the virtual power plant (VPP) portfolio. The proposed bi-level model consists of an upper level that represents the VPP profit maximization problem and a lower level that represents the independent system operator (ISO) DA market-clearing problem. This bi-level optimization problem is converted into a mixed-integer linear programing model using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions and the strong duality theory. Finally, the risk associated with the VPP profit variability is explicitly taken into account through the incorporation of the conditional value-At-risk metric.

Because of infrastructure and other reasons, developed countries can tap into nuclear energy but developing country like Bangladesh is not fortunate enough to have that option. Consequently, the only option that is left open to developing countries is renewable energy. Among renewable energy solar, wind, hydro, geo-thermal and wave energies are most reliable, which do not cause carbon emission. Solar energy can be used in many purposes like water heating, air heating etc. Among the various types of solar collector, evacuated tube solar collector is one of the most effective water heating device.

For solar PV applications, storage device is an integral part during post sun shine hours to supply power to the load. For Solar Home System (SHS), approximately 60% of the total cost is due to storage battery and the battery needs replacement in every five years or so. If the performance of the battery can be enhanced, not only the cost of energy will come down appreciably but the reliability of the system will improve. Battery is needed in PV system to store the excess energy from the sun and release the power to the system again when it is needed. In other words, to enhance a system performance we have to increase the battery performance. In this paper, the parameters which play important role for optimum performance has been studied. The major two parameters that affect the battery performance are load current and temperature. It has been found that, when the discharge current is high, battery capacity reduces and the vice-versa. Again in case of temperature, when temperature increases more than the rated standard value of 25°C, capacity increases but the life time of the battery decreases. On the other hand, when the ambient temperature goes down, capacity of battery decreases but lifetime of the battery is increased. To analyse the effect of temperature and load current on battery performance, the standard equivalent circuit of battery is considered first and then the equivalent circuit is simulated using Simulink under MATLAB environment. © 2016 UIU.","DOC; DOD; PV; SHS; Simscape; Simulink; SOC","Electric batteries; Electric network analysis; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Equivalent circuits; Lead acid batteries; Renewable energy resources; Solar buildings; System-on-chip; Temperature; Virtual storage; Battery performance; Effect of temperature; Optimum performance; Performance analysis; Renewable energy applications; Simscape; Simulink; Temperature increase; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971444979

One of the DC-DC converters is connected directly to the solar panel and the other is to the storage battery. To extract the maximum possible electric power from the solar panel MPPT controller is used. The converter steps up unregulated solar panel voltage to a regulated 125 V at the load end. The output voltage can be adjusted to any desired level from 20V to 200V DC depending on the application. The proposed controller can provide constant power at 125V and charge the battery when photovoltaic generated power is greater than the load requirements. In contrast, the controller takes additional power from the battery for driving load at constant power with efficiency of about 87% during insufficient solar radiation.

In this research work, firstly the parameters, challenges and performance metrics of QoS for WSN are discussed. A MAC layer protocol called stable topology based energy efficient protocol for distributed network (STEED) for HWSNs is proposed that is not only able to manage resources of nodes in heterogeneous environments but it is also able to maintain desired QoS. Simulation results reveal that STEED performs better in terms of stability and reliability than already proposed protocols. © 2015 IEEE.","DEEC; Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks; QoS parameters; Routing protocols; STEED","Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Topology; DEEC; Energy efficient protocols; Heterogeneous environments; Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks; QoS parameters; Qualityof-service requirement (QoS); Stability and reliabilities; STEED; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964659864

It has been the most studied model in recent years due to the huge amount of energy consumed in the cloud data centers. A great deal of studies focused on investigating the effect of virtualization management on improving energy efficiency of the cloud data centers. However, most studies only considered task resource requirements of processor, memory, and storage without considering bandwidth requirements and its effects on energy consumption. In this paper, two directions that tackle the bandwidth requirements are presented. In the first direction, an algorithm for reallocating the bandwidth for the virtual machines hosted on the same physical machine is proposed. This algorithm, called Fair Bandwidth Reallocation (FBR), reallocates the bandwidth amounts between two virtual machines based on requirements of the jobs executed on these VMs at a specific period of time. The core idea of FBR is to maximize the utilization of the bandwidth of the PM. One virtual machine (The Granter) provides a specific amount of its bandwidth to another virtual machine (The Grantee) when it is idle, and then regains this amount after a period of time. In the second direction, another algorithm is proposed to dynamically allocate bandwidth to the virtual machines that are hosted on the physical machine. This algorithm, called Required Bandwidth Allocation (RBA), treats bandwidth as a shared resource and allocates only the amount of bandwidth required to the VM at that specific time. The core idea here is to monitor the bandwidth of the virtual machines periodically. RBA reallocates the bandwidth among these virtual machines according to their actual required bandwidth. © 2015 IEEE.","Bandwidth allocation; Cloud computing; Energy efficiency; VM management","Algorithms; Cloud computing; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Frequency allocation; Java programming language; Bandwidth requirement; Cloud data centers; Power efficiency; Resource requirements; Shared resources; Two directions; Virtual machines; Virtualizations; Bandwidth",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964829229

In order to efficiently exploit the data level parallelism, image processors include SIMD instructions and other parallel computation resources. Generic processors that can be purchased off-the-shelf are adequate for most of the use scenarios of image processing. However, especially with embedded mobile devices, they might not be optimal for the algorithm, the environment, or the energy budget at hand. Such cases call for programmable customized architectures with just enough hardware resources to ensure the high priority applications reach their real time goals with minimal overheads. In order to maintain high engineer productivity, implementing image algorithms for customized processors should be as easy as with standard processors. This is emphasized at the processor co-design time; because the program is used to drive the processor design space exploration towards an optimized architecture, assembly programming is not feasible due to the required porting effort whenever the architecture is modified. In this paper we propose an image processor customization flow that exploits the domain-specific Halide language as an input to a processor co-design environment. In addition to efficiently exploiting standard resources in the customized processors, the flow provides an easy way to invoke special instructions from Halide programs. We validate the performance benefits of custom operations using example filters described with the Halide language. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Budget control; Computational linguistics; Digital storage; Information science; Integrated circuit design; Mobile devices; Parallel processing systems; Program processors; Assembly programming; Co-design environments; Data-level parallelism; Image processing applications; Optimized architectures; Parallel Computation; Performance benefits; Rapid customization; Image processing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964720797

The developed methodology considers that energy storage resources can contribute to their owners' inherent activities and to a more flexible and efficient distribution network operation. The optimisation tool based on mixed-integer linear programming is developed to maximise the technical and economic value of distributed storage taking into account their multifunctional potential and the presence of intermittent renewable sources. The methodological developments are validated in a case study of a real medium-voltage distribution network with two storage systems coupled with a wind park and an industrial 'prosumer' (i.e. energy consumers who are producing their own energy). Results make evident the robustness of the methodology and enable the assessment of the technical and economic impacts of the integration of distributed storage.

Utilizing wood ash in forest road construction and maintenance to improve mechanical stability has been suggested as a feasible recycling option. To investigate the environmental impact of wood ash application in forest road maintenance, a two-year field experiment was conducted at two Austrian forest sites (Kobernausserwald (KO) (soil pH 5.5) and Weyregg (WE) (pH 7.7)) differing in their soil chemical properties. Two different ashes, one produced by grate incineration (GA) and the other by fluidized bed incineration in a mixture with 15 vol% burnt lime (FBA), were incorporated in repeated road sections at a 15:85% (V/V) ash-to-soil rate. Leaching waters from the road body were collected and analyzed for 32 environmentally relevant parameters over two years. Upon termination of the experiment, sub-road soil samples were collected and analyzed for ash-related changes in soil chemistry. Even though a larger number of parameters was affected by the ash application at the alkaline site (WE), we observed the most pronounced initial increases of pH as well as Al, As, Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, Mo, and NO2 - concentrations in leachates beneath GA-treated road bodies at Kobernausserwald due to the lower soil buffer capacity at this site. Despite the observed effects our results indicate that, when specific requirements are met (i.e. appropriate ash quality, sufficient soil buffer capacity below the road body, and single time-point ash incorporation within several decades), wood ash application in forest road construction is generally environmentally acceptable. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Contamination; Forest road construction; Heavy metals; Lysimeter; Recycling; Wood ash","Alkalinity; Buffer storage; Chemical analysis; Contamination; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Fluidized beds; Heavy metals; Incineration; Lysimeters; Maintenance; Manganese; Mechanical stability; pH; Recycling; Road construction; Roads and streets; Soil pollution; Soil surveys; Soils; Transportation; Wood; Wooden construction; Environmentally acceptable; Environmentally safe; Forest road maintenance; Green energy production; Recycling options; Soil chemical property; Wood ash; Wood ash applications; Forestry; aluminum; arsenic; cobalt; copper; iron; manganese; molybdenum; nickel; nitric oxide; environmental impact assessment; heavy metal; lysimeter; maintenance; recycling; road construction; wood ash; Article; Austria; construction work; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; field study; fluidized bed; forest; forest road construction; incineration; leaching; priority journal; recycling; soil acidity; soil chemistry; wood ash; Construction; Heavy Metals; Pollution; Recycling; Roads; Austria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960465221

In fact, over half of utility executives say ""the most important emerging energy technology"" is energy storage. Advanced, low-cost battery designs are providing promising stationary storage solutions that can ensure reliable, high-quality power for customers, but research challenges and questions lefts. Have lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) reached their technical limit? The industry demands are including high costs, inadequate energy densities, long recharge times, short cycle-life times and safety must be continually addressed. Safety is still the main problem on developing the lithium ion battery.The safety issue must be considered from several aspects, since it would become serious problems, such as an explosion in a Japan Airlines 787 Dreamliner's cargo hold, due to the battery problem. The combustion is mainly due to the leakage or shortcut of the electrodes, caused by the liquid electrolyte and polymer separator. For this reason, the research on solid electrolyte for replacing the existing liquid electrolyte is very important. The materials used in existing lithium ion battery, such as a separator and liquid electrolyte must be replaced to new solid electrolytes, solid materials that exhibits high ionic conductivity. Due to these reasons, research on solid state ionics materials have been vastly growing worldwide, with the main aim not only to search new solid electrolyte to replace the liquid one, but also looking for low cost materials and environmentally friendly. A revolutionary paradigm is also required to design new stable anode and cathode materials that provide electrochemical cells with high energy, high power, long lifetime and adequate safety at competitive manufacturing costs. Lithium superionic conductors, which can be used as solid electrolytes, promise the potential to replace organic liquid electrolytes and thereby improve the safety of next-generation high-energy batteries. Li3PO4 has been proved to be a good candidate for solid electrolyte, due to its easy in preparation, low cost, high melting temperature and good compatibility with the electrode materials. In the present work, Li3PO4 has been prepared by wet chemical reaction, a simple method with the advantage of recycling a waste product H3PO4. The crystal structure has been characterized by both neutron and x-ray diffraction. The use of neutron scattering plays important role on observing the light atoms such as lithium ion. The x-ray diffraction results showed the crystal structure of orthorhombic phase P m n 21 (31), that belongs to the β-Li3PO4, with the lattice parameters are a = 6.123872, b = 5.250211, c = 4.876378. The conductivity of β-Li3PO4 was around 10-8 S/cm. Furthermore, the future application of the solid electrolyte layer in lithium ion battery will also be considered. It is concluded that the used of local resources on producing the solid electrolyte Li3PO4 for lithium ion battery will give more added values to the researches and national industry. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.","Li3PO4; lithium ion battery; Lithium phosphate; solid electrolyte",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984578306

For a decentralization of catalytic ammonia production, small-scale N2 reduction devices are required that are equipped with the most stable, selective, and active catalysts that operate at low temperature and ambient pressure. Here, we report the development of new and cost-efficient catalysts, transition metal nitrides, which enable electrochemical reduction of molecular nitrogen to ammonia in aqueous media at ambient conditions with only a low applied bias. The most promising catalysts are VN, ZrN, NbN, and CrN, which are identified among a range of transition metal nitride surfaces through a comprehensive density functional theory based analysis. All four nitrides are found to be more active toward nitrogen reduction than toward the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, in contrast to pure metal catalysts, which largely evolve hydrogen. Furthermore, their stability against poisoning and possible decomposition under operating conditions is also studied. Particular single-crystal surfaces are needed for ZrN, NbN, and CrN because polycrystalline surfaces may result in decomposition of the whole catalyst. Polycrystalline surfaces of VN may, however, be used since the rocksalt (100) facet is predicted to produce ammonia via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism with only a0.5 V overpotential, thereby avoiding decomposition. We suggest that this is a promising step toward the development of a method for synthesizing ammonia cheaply, to prepare high-value-added nitrogenous compounds directly from air, water, and electricity at ambient conditions. An additional benefit to the present analysis is that the method used in this work may be applicable to other aqueous phase catalytic reactions, where a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is operative and product selectivity and activity are key catalytic criteria. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","density functional theory calculations; electrocatalysis; electrochemical synthesis of ammonia; electroreduction of nitrogen to ammonia; transition metal nitride catalysts","Ammonia; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Electrocatalysis; Electrolytic reduction; Energy efficiency; Hydrogen storage; Low temperature production; Metals; Nitrides; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Reduction; Refractory metal compounds; Selective catalytic reduction; Single crystal surfaces; Temperature; Transition metals; Electro reduction; Electrochemical reductions; Electrochemical synthesis; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Hydrogen storage medium; Mars-van krevelen mechanisms; Polycrystalline surface; Transition metal nitrides; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957578747

In this context, there is a growing concern about the use of energy storage for overcoming the intermittency of renewable energy sources as well as in demand side management. In order to accomplish grid synchronization of energy storage, proper power conditioning devices are required. This paper analyses single phase grid synchronization of DC energy storage using MATLAB Simulink ® environment. The considered power conditioning device is a Voltage Source Inverter (VSI), which is controlled using two methods called (i) traditional Zero Crossing Detection (ZCD) technique and (ii) the phase detector based Phase Locked Loop (PLL) technique.

These architectures exacerbate on-chip data requirements, creating additional pressure on the memory subsystem. Consequently, efficient utilization of on-chip memory space becomes critical for data intensive applications. A promising means of addressing this challenge is to use an effective compression method to reduce the data transmitted along the memory hierarchy. In this paper we present V-PFORDelta, a real-Time vectorized integer differential compression method for memory bound applications. We evaluate the effectiveness of our SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data stream) based compression method on an industrial hydrological time series data processing kernel. We analyzed both Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) and Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2) versions of the compression method. Results show that the performance and energy efficiency can be improved up to a factor of 3.1 and 8.2, respectively.

The Model S and Tesla's newer Model X sport-utility vehicle are unquestionably engineering marvels. And in the vision of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, they are nothing less than agents of change. Rivaling the best-performing internal-combustion automobiles, these green supercars are designed to reconcile comfort, power, and convenience with environmental sustainability, an ethos encapsulated in the current marketing slogan for the Model S: Zero Emissions. Zero Compromises. Sales of the high-end models S and X--versions of which sell for well over US 100,000--are supposed to provide the revenue needed to produce the Model 3, an affordable electric supercar for the masses, slated to be unveiled in March and in production in 2017. Eventually, as they and other electric vehicles proliferate and get tied into rooftop photovoltaic and energy storage systems, they will disrupt Rust Belt car manufacturing as well as the fossil-fuel industry, accruing environmental benefits in the process. As Musk sees it, Tesla Motors is not simply an automaker. It is an energy innovation company, a critical element in its broader quest for zero emission power generation.",,"Automobiles; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Plug-in electric vehicles; Sustainable development; Traction motors; Vehicles; Car manufacturing; Critical elements; Energy storage systems; Environmental benefits; Environmental sustainability; Internal combustion; Sport utility vehicles; Stanford University; Electric automobiles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963726773

As cement manufacturing involves the use of large amounts of raw materials and energy, an issue that arises is the necessity to assess its environmental impact and analyze in which way the industry should proceed concerning best practices. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has frequently been used in case studies around the globe as an environmental impact assessing tool. The present literature review serves for: (i) describing the environmental impacts, (ii) clarifying the methodological approaches in LCA, and (iii) identifying the main alternatives to improve the environmental performance of cement production. Several available studies on the environmental performance of manufacture and use of cement products were reviewed. These studies identified improvement of energy efficiency, the use of alternative fuels, clinker substitution, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) as the main solutions for mitigating environmental impacts caused by cement production. The first three options have been thoroughly analyzed, applied, and have shown improvement through the years. CCS has a high improvement potential; however, it presents technical and economic barriers to its implementation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, finding efficient, safe and low cost storage methods is the basic impediment for the adoption of hydrogen as fuel. For this purpose, five biomass-based carbon samples have been successfully prepared through KOH activation procedure. The microstructure of the prepared materials was tuned by varying KOH/precursor weight ratio from 1:1 to 5:1, in order to optimize their hydrogen storage behavior and to clarify the storage mechanism. A careful textural and morphological characterization of the prepared samples (N2 and CO2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy observations) showed that by increasing the activation ratio the nature of the carbons changes from microporous to micro-mesoporous. Thus, an increase in the surface area was observed which enhanced H2 sorption capacity when high H2 pressures were adopted. At subatmospheric pressure, the role of active sites for H2 adsorption, located in the oriented graphene sheets, was clearly elaborated. Finally, the optimal carbon sample has shown a capacity of 6 wt% and 1.22 wt% at -196 °C and 25 °C respectively, and 200 bar.

The temperatures of PCM and HTF, solid fraction and thermal effectiveness are analyzed. The effects of inlet temperature of HTF, flow rate of HTF and the type of PCM used on the time for charging and discharging heat are discussed. The following conclusion can be drawn: (1) HTF flow rate does not have a great effect on the discharging phase compared to the charging phase. (2) Inlet temperature has a great effect on the exchanger performance. It can accelerate charging phase 54.5% and delay the discharging phase by 48.5%.

The electrolysis is considered as well as an electrical load connected to the photovoltaic system via a DC/DC buck converter, having a system control tracking of maximum power point MPPT P&O, which allows the maximization and control of the power transferred to the electrolysis. Furthermore, this study shows that the maximum hydrogen production is not related to the quantity of water to be electrolyzed, but the need to control the water flow which enters electrolysis according to variations of the power arising from weather changes.

Knowledge of factors that influence piglet PWM are important to improve animal welfare, to reduce production loss and to raise profits in commercial herds. The main objective of the present work was to review the most important non-infectious causes of piglet PWM and to present the main factors influencing them under commercial conditions. Piglet pre-weaning mortality is a multifactorial process, the small size of piglets at birth, together with their low body energy storage and their immature immune system, make them prone to chilling, starving, or being crushed by the sow. In general, factors causing piglet PWM are usually classified into three major groups: piglet (i.e., birth weight, vitality, and gender), sow (i.e., colostrum, parity, maternal stress, and sow nutrition), and environmental factors (i.e., season and temperature, housing, and management). Birth weight is the most determinant factor for piglet survival with direct impact on thermoregulatory capacity and growth; piglet vitality is also correlated with survival and growth and is strongly influenced by the degree of intra-partum hypoxia suffered by the piglet; additionally, piglet PWM appears to be sex-biased, with males showing greater susceptibility to causal mortality factors. Newborn piglets are highly dependent on colostrum to use it as energy substrate for thermoregulation and growth, and also to acquire passive immunity crucial for their future survival; however, sows' parity is a factor with contradictory effect on PWM which requires further research; a proper sows' comfort is also important for maternal stress around farrowing might have a negative impact on offsprings development and also increases the risk of crushing; sows' nutrition will influence foetal development and piglet birth weight, and is determinant to ensure a proper colostrum/milk production. Finally, ambient temperature has an important impact on piglet survival because piglets are very sensitive to cold stress. The housing system used in the farrowing room seems to influence the incidence of crushing. Promising results have been obtained using recent designs that combine initial confinement of the sow with the subsequent ability to move within the same pen. Different management strategies to deal with PWM are usually performed by producers around farrowing. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence on techniques, such as oral supplementation of piglets, cross-fostering, nurse sow systems, or artificial rearing of piglets, and further research should be of interest. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Birth weight; Colostrum; Crushing; Piglet; Season",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957548880

We investigated 3HB as a chemical chaperone capable of protecting model enzymes, namely lipase and lysozyme, from adverse effects of high temperature and oxidation. Heat-mediated denaturation of lipase in the presence or absence of 3HB was monitored by dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealing a significant protective effect of 3HB which increased as its concentration rose. Furthermore, when compared at the same molar concentration, 3HB showed a greater protective effect than the well-known chemical chaperones trehalose and hydroxyectoine. The higher protective effect of 3HB was also confirmed when employing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and lysozyme as a model enzyme. Furthermore, 3HB was capable of protecting lipase not only against thermal-mediated denaturation but also against oxidative damage by Cu2+ and H2O2; its protection was higher than that of trehalose and comparable to that of hydroxyectoine. Taking into account that the PHB-producing strain Cupriavidus necator H16 reveals a 16.5-fold higher intracellular concentration than the PHB non-producing mutant C. necator PHB−4, it might be expected that the functional PHB cycle might be responsible for maintaining a higher intracellular level of 3HB which, aside from other positive aspects of functional PHB metabolism, enhances stress resistance of bacterial strains capable of simultaneous PHB synthesis and mobilization. In addition, 3HB can be used in various applications and formulations as an efficient enzyme-stabilizing and enzyme-protecting additive. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","3-Hydroxybutyrate; Chemical chaperone; Compatible solutes; PHB; PHB cycle; Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)","Carbon; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dynamic light scattering; Light scattering; Metabolism; 3-Hydroxybutyrate; Chemical chaperone; Compatible solutes; PHB; PHB cycle; Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate; Enzymes; 3 hydroxybutyric acid; chaperone; lysozyme; poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid); triacylglycerol lipase; 3 hydroxybutyric acid; bacterial protein; hydroxybutyric acid; lysozyme; poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate; polyester; protective agent; bacterium; cells and cell components; enzyme; enzyme activity; heating; high temperature; organic compound; oxidation; protein; stress resistance; temperature effect; antioxidant activity; Article; bacterial strain; chemical structure; Cupriavidus necator; denaturation; enzyme activity; heating; high temperature; hydrophilicity; melting point; molecular size; oxidation; oxidative stress; particle size; photon correlation spectroscopy; protein tertiary structure; stress; thermal analysis; thermostability; chemistry; enzyme stability; enzymology; heat; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cupriavidus necator; 3-Hydroxybutyric Acid; Bacterial Proteins; Cupriavidus necator; Enzyme Stability; Hot Temperature; Hydroxybutyrates; Muramidase; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Polyesters; Protective Agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955212772

In this study outdoor experiments were carried out to compare performance study between clear day and semi-cloudy day in winter season. PVT solar collector with CPC that act as a solar collector, a PCM tank and CPC was integrated into one piece because of simplicity structure for PCM storage in same unit. No connection pipe i,e small area needed for installation and continuous tracking was not needed for better concentration ratio. Total heat loss, total useful energy, thermal efficiency and overall efficiency of the collector by varying different parameters were evaluated using modified equations derived for the energy storage system from the basic derivation of Hottel-Bliss-Whillier. The results show that thermal efficiency of solar collector varies from 40% to 50% for clear day and around 40% for semi-cloudy day. The overall efficiency of the PVT collector between 55% and 63% for clear-day and around 46-55% for semi-cloudy day whereas corresponding top loss value around 3 W/m2 K for clear day and around 2.5 W/m2 K for semi-cloudy day.

As yet there are no plans to deploy the carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology in this particular region but this presented an opportunity for pro-active engagement with local stakeholders, including the urban community, farmers and landowners, local iwi (Māori), local and regional councils and the oil/gas industry. As an alternative to a standard consultation technique, a small-scale dialogue-based method was used, based on the principles of deliberative engagement. In this context, the emphasis was on developing an informed understanding of different viewpoints and solution-focused decision-making. This method of engagement was found to be cost-effective, revealed some unexpected viewpoints and identified some important precursors to risk perception in New Zealand. The empowerment of participants, assisted by independent scientists and the opportunity for facilitated dialogue, were key success factors. Moreover, the approach was valued by the wider community and perceived as a means to open up dialogue around other regional energy issues.

The deterioration of onion during storage can lead to huge amount of post-harvest losses. Shelf life can be increased through drying, which also facilitates transportation, storage, and packaging due to reduced weight and volume. In the present study, a novel microwave-assisted drying technique called microwave hydro-diffusion gravity was investigated for process optimization and compared with conventional drying techniques. Results indicated that 400 W and 14 min of process were the best combination for drying that removed 80% moisture present in slices. The overall drying time of onion slices was significantly reduced (about six times) compared to hot air oven and freeze-drying methods. MHG dehydration prevented the burning of onions and maintained their sensorial attributes especially color and texture. Similarly, MHG in combination with hot air oven consumed only 0.5 MJ energy as compared to 3.24 and 3 MJ energy used by hot air oven and freeze drying, respectively. In short, results proved that MHG technique is much better than conventional techniques in terms of end product quality and process efficiency. Industrial relevance: Microwave hydro-diffusion technology is optimized for onion drying. This technology will help in reducing the use of energy and will avoid the loss of water soluble components. These bioactive components have great importance in the field of pharmaceutical. Thus, this technology simultaneously dries the product and extracts the valuable components.

The loss of carotenoids followed first order loss kinetics. An initial rapid followed by a second slower first order loss kinetics was observed in the non-humidified spray dried (NHSD) systems. Storage of systems above the Tg delayed carotenoids losses based on the rate constants. The loss of carotenoids in LBL systems was more heat sensitive as the activation energies were generally higher.

And while groundwater storage is vast, its replenishment is limited, and many aquifers are exhibiting signs of inadequately controlled pumping. However, efforts to understand the impacts of a society on the availability, equity, and sustainability of groundwater and its repercussions has received little attention till date. Therefore, using Guwahati city, India, as a case, the aim of this paper is to understand the socio-political factors and their intra and inter-relationships with groundwater which in turn influences the urban households' accessibility to water. Overall methodology used the DPSIR framework for which inputs were generated from questionnaire survey of 150 households and other official, literature records. It is revealed that high population density of 4445 persons/km2, rapid urbanization with haphazard construction, pertaining groundwater rights with land rights, and coverage of only 27% of the population by water supply services have acted as thrusts to exceed groundwater extraction over safe yield. This situation however has a feedback in the form of increasing number of households with reduced accessibility to water as many have stated about declined water levels, increasing issue of water affordability and subsequent emergence of water poor.

Integrated Collector Storage Solar Water Heaters (ICSSWHs) convert the solar radiation directly into heat at an appreciable conversion rate and in many cases that happen under concentrated form. These systems are compact, aesthetically attractive and reasonable in construction. They have the potential to reduce environmental impact up to 40% and also have high collection efficiency factor. Despite many advantages, ICS solar water heaters suffer from high thermal losses in the night/overcast sky conditions. Performance of ICSSWH systems is influenced by various parameters such as reflector and absorber types, energy collection and storage arrangements and design parameters of the systems. In this article, various concentrating and non-concentrating ICSSWHs, systems with PCM (Phase Change Material) and heat retention strategies are reviewed. Recent development in the ICSSWHs indicates the potential of reliability of these systems for domestic hot water application at lower cost. The concentrating type ICSSWHs show better collection efficiency at reduced cost, but suffer high night time thermal losses.

During harvest, soil adhering to the crop, loose soil, clods and stones are transported from the field to the market place or storage. Consequently, the depth of the top soil is reduced. Only few studies, however, tried to estimate SLCH values for cocoyam but there is no available information on the influence of cocoyam species on SLCH. This study was conducted on basement complex rock derived soil (Typic Kandiustalf) in Southwest Nigeria between 2011 and 2012 to compare the quantity of soil loss due to harvesting of white and red cocoyam. Traditional hand rubbing was compared with hand rubbing+washing. The energy dissipated and cost analysis for harvesting of both cocoyam species were compared. The soil sticking to the harvested tubers was hand rubbed thoroughly before washing to determine SLCH. Mean weight of the tubers after washing of white and red cocoyam was 2.0tha-1 and 1.3tha-1 respectively. Averagely, soil loss value per unit of crop mass (SLCHspec) of white and red cocoyam was 14.6kg-1ha-1harvest-1yr-1 and 15.1kg-1ha-1harvest-1yr-1 respectively. Soil loss ratio (hand rubbing/washing) was 3:1 for white cocoyam and ≈3:1 for red cocoyam in 2011. Corresponding ratio for 2012 was ≈6:1 for white and 5:1 for red cocoyam. The energy dissipated in harvesting white cocoyam (124.7Jmound-1) was higher than red cocoyam (121.5Jmound-1) due to higher white cocoyam root density. The cost analysis of cocoyam production using conventional (unwashed tubers) and the innovative approach (hand rubbing followed by washing of tubers) suggests that hand rubbing after harvest offers the cheapest alternative. Differences in SLCHspec could be due to skin roughness of red cocoyam leading to higher soil loss per unit yield. Morphology was another factor that explains the variation in the soil loss at cocoyam harvesting. The amount of soil loss due to cocoyam harvesting justifies the need to conduct further investigations on this process of soil erosion under mechanised agriculture. © 2015.","Cocoyam harvesting; Cost analysis; Hand rubbing; Soil loss; Washing","comparative study; cost analysis; energy dissipation; farming system; harvesting; monocotyledon; morphology; root vegetable; soil erosion; topsoil; Nigeria; Colocasia esculenta; Daucus carota; Dioscorea alata; Manihot esculenta; Solanum tuberosum; Xanthosoma sagittifolium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942531929

On the other hand, in recent years, a way to harness the solar energy is to cogenerate through Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology coupled to an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) with potential applications to industrial processes. In this work we present a study of a small CSP plant coupled to an ORC with a novel configuration since useful energy is directly used to feed the power block and to charge the thermal storage. In order to analyze this novel configuration we consider a case study with cogeneration applied to textile industrial process at medium temperature. It turns out that this configuration reduces the size of the thermal storage disposal. The performance of the solar power plant was simulated with TRNSYS to emulate real operating conditions. We show the design, study and simulation results, including the production and efficiency curves for our load profile.

Triglycerides-based biomass such as plant oils, animal fats, waste cooking and micro-algal oils should be upgraded by transesterification, cracking/hydrocracking and selective deoxygenation (SDO) to provide, respectively, biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters), the so-called organic liquid product (mixture of hydrocarbons in the range of gasoline, kerosene and diesel) and green diesel (hydrocarbons in the diesel range). Problems related to the production, storage and use of the already produced biodiesel shifts the research to the second and third upgrading route.

The proposed SoC is the first work in literature that integrates a feature extraction (FE) engine, patient specific hardware-efficient NLSVM classification engine, 96 KB SRAM for EEG data storage and low-noise, high dynamic range readout circuits. To achieve on-chip integration of the NLSVM classification engine with minimum area and energy consumption, the FE engine utilizes time division multiplexing (TDM)-BPF architecture. The implemented log-linear Gaussian basis function (LL-GBF) NLSVM classifier exploits the linearization to achieve energy consumption of 0.39 μ J/operation and reduces the area by 28.2% compared to conventional GBF implementation. The readout circuits incorporate a chopper-stabilized DC servo loop to minimize the noise level elevation and achieve noise RTI of 0.81 μ V rms for 0.5-100 Hz bandwidth with an NEF of 4.0. The 5 ×, 5 mm-2 SoC is implemented in a 0.18 μm 1P6M CMOS process consuming 1.83 μ J/classification for 8-channel operation.

In general, 3D meshes consist of two distinct components: vertex positions and vertex connectivity. Vertex position encoders are much more resource demanding than connectivity encoders, stressing the need for novel geometry compression schemes. The design of an accurate and energy efficient geometry compression system can be achieved by: i) reducing the amount of data that should be transmitted ii) minimizing the computational operations executed at the encoder. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian learning approach that allows processing large meshes in parts and reconstructing the Cartesian coordinates of each part from a small number of random linear combinations. The proposed compression/reconstruction approaches minimize the samples that are required for transmission yet assuring accurate reconstruction at the receiver, by exploiting specific local characteristics of the surface geometry in the graph Fourier domain.

Inspired by the efficacy of proton transport through proteins, we show in this work that self-assembling peptide nanostructures may be a promising alternative for such organic proton conducting materials. We demonstrate that aromatic amino acids, which participate in charge transport in nature, unprecedentedly promote proton conduction under both high and low relative humidity conditions for d,l α-cyclic peptide nanotubes. For dehydrated networks long-range order of the assemblies, induced by the aromatic side chains, is shown to be a dominating factor for promoting conductivity. However, for hydrated networks this order of effect is less significant and conductivity can be improved by the introduction of proton donating carboxylic acid peptide side chains in addition to the aromatic side chains despite the lower order of the assemblies. Based on these observations, a novel cyclic peptide that incorporates non-natural naphthyl side chains was designed. Self-assembled nanotubes of this peptide show greatly improved dehydrated conductivity, while maintaining high conductivity under hydrated conditions. We envision that the demonstrated modularity and versatility of these bio inspired nanostructures will make them extremely attractive building blocks for the fabrication of devices for energy conversion and storage applications, as well as other applications that involve proton transport, whether dry or wet conductivity is desired. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Chains; Conducting polymers; Energy conversion; Hydration; Nanostructures; Nanotubes; Yarn; Aromatic side chains; Cyclic peptide nanotubes; Energy conversion and storages; Low relative humidities; Proton conducting materials; Proton-conducting polymers; Self-assembled peptides; Self-assembling peptides; Peptides; peptide nanotube; proton; Nanotubes, Peptide; Protons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955505479

This may complicate their utilization in a frequency containment process if the power system does not have a proper strategy to coordinate and maintain the system frequency. In this paper, we examine the resources provided by refrigerators and BESS, and argue that with proper frequency coordination the contribution of these resources to frequency containment reserves (FCR) can be improved. Two distinctive cases are compared: one where the power system has an automatic process for frequency restoration and the other where such a process does not exist. In the latter case, the resources need to cope with the long lasting frequency deviations locally. The study is based on the simulation of different control strategies and the frequency measured in the Nordic power system. The results indicate that a proper frequency restoration strategy can enhance the potential of distributed resources as FCR. © 2015 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; Demand response; Frequency containment; Frequency restoration","Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Smart power grids; Battery energy storage systems; Control strategies; Coordination strategy; Demand response; Distributed resources; Frequency containment; Frequency deviation; Frequency restorations; Restoration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964938519

The objective of the control is to adjust the medium density to follow an optimal density profile set by an upper level control/optimisation system. The main focus of this study is therefore on the modelling of the coal washing process and design of a lower level controller that manipulates the actuators directly.

With high charge/discharge ratios one can increase the short term revenue stream from a renewable energy system whereas with a low charge/discharge ratios one can increase the long term benefits. Hence, when compared against nominal charge or discharge operation, the storage system life can be increased/reduced with a low/high charge or discharge ratios. In order to quantify this fact for different storage management strategies, this work analyze the effect on the life of a lead-acid battery system of three scheduling strategies: linear programming, crisp logic and fuzzy logic. The three cases will be compared against a reference strategy which consist on solving a linear optimization problem with perfect forecast of load, energy price and renewable availability. A photovoltaic system is taken as the renewable source and historic values for eight months are used to study the trend in the life of the storage system. it can be concluded that higher storage capacity leads to higher overall benefits, however, this cannot be said for the maximum storage system power, even when considering only the costs benefits, which suggest that a proper strategy and parameter selection can be better than high power ratio. © 2015 IEEE.","Energy storage management systems; fuzzy logic systems; linear programming; smart grids","Computer circuits; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Linear programming; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Reconfigurable hardware; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Smart power grids; Storage management; Fuzzy logic system; Linear optimization problems; Management strategies; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energy systems; Scheduling strategies; Smart grid; Storage management systems; Lead acid batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966472206

In this regard, the performance of power sharing between Energy Storage Units (ESUs) with different States of Charge (SoC) can be enhanced. In this paper, the SoC of each ESU is balanced using the proposed control method, which is decentralized and based on the adaptive droop control method. The droop coefficient should be adjusted in the system on the basis of the SoC of each ESU. With this control strategy, the storage unit with higher SoC provides more power to support the load, while the unit with lower SoC provides the less power. The method is validated using simulation results from PSCAD/EMTDC software. © 2015 IEEE.","Distributed control; Droop control; Energy Storage System; SoC balancing","Computer software; Energy storage; Control strategies; Distributed control; Distributed energy storage systems; Droop control; Droop control method; Energy storage systems; Energy storage unit; States of charges; Distributed parameter control systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965043251

This work introduces the integration of multiphase induction machine (IM) based flywheel energy storage systems (FESS) with VSC-HVDC systems for AC side fault ride through purposes employing modular multilevel converters (MMC). MMCs have become suitable candidates for medium/high power energy conversion systems due to the capability of simply extending the levels of the converter while retaining high levels of reliability. In order to enhance the storage system reliability, a dual three phase IM is used to drive the FESS due to its fault tolerance capability. In this paper, the performance of the FESS is investigated under the operation of a dual three phase IM being driven by two three-phase MMCs. To step-down the DC-link voltage of the HVDC system to a proper voltage level for IMs, the DC-link voltage is divided into two series connected capacitor, and each capacitor voltage is fed as an input DC voltage for each three- phase MMC. The control strategies of the MMCs and the IM are presented, in addition to the IM mathematical model. Simulation case studies are performed using MATLAB/Simulink to validate the proposed system. © 2015 IEEE.","dual three phase induction machine; fault ride through; HVDC; Modular multilevel converters","Asynchronous machinery; Capacitors; DC power transmission; Electric power transmission; Energy conversion; Fault tolerance; Flywheels; HVDC power transmission; MATLAB; Wheels; Dual three-phase induction machines; Fault ride-through; Fault-tolerance capability; Flywheel energy storage system; High voltage direct current; HVDC; Modular multilevel converters; Multi-phase induction machines; Power converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965025910

For hatcheries to consistently produce spat it is essential to develop broodstock conditioning techniques. Food and temperature are the main factors that regulate the timing and rate of energy storage and reproduction in bivalves. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of different diets and temperatures on reproductive output of R. decussatus and express the evolution of the different lipid classes during sexual maturation. Broodstock clams were conditioned at 20 ± 1 °C under four nutritional regimes: unfed, two mono-specific diets, Isochrysis galbana clone T-ISO and Chaetoceros calcitrans and, a mixture of these microalgae. Another group of clams was conditioned at 22 ± 1 °C and was fed the same mixture of microalgae. Gametogenesis, energy storage and spawning success were all influenced by the nutritional value of the diet received, as evidenced by the differences in reproductive effort among the single and combined supplemental diets. Temperature must be carefully managed to improve the reproductive conditioning of bivalves: high temperature throughout gametogenesis shortens the time to full ripeness but does not produce better reproductive output. The combination diet at 20 ± 1 °C is best for R. decussatus broodstock conditioning. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","biochemical composition; Bivalvia; broodstock conditioning; microalgal diet; Reproductive output; temperature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955127836

In response, SADC States have largely opted for large scale water storage and transfer infrastructure. However as climate and demographic changes, together with rapid economic growth, increase water stress and variability, larger scale infrastructure solutions will become increasingly expensive and environmentally unsustainable. As more basins face closure this will become a regional rather than national challenge, raising pressures around the reasonable and equitable use of water. A Virtual Water and nexus perspective may offer a different view for national planners, making better use of the total water footprint to support economic growth, as well as to meet social and environmental needs. This will require the allocation (or re-allocation) of water between sectors to formalise and regulate entitlements which optimise allocations across the full water footprint and which balance the water requirements of food and energy production. Similarly, inter-state allocations based on the reasonable and equitable use principles espoused in the SADC’s Revised Protocol on Shared Watercourses, may have to consider both the blue and green water contributions to the national economies of the riparian states. On a regional basis, while there has been some attention paid to importing of Virtual Water in agricultural products rather than to produce them locally, this concept has not gained much traction. It is therefore perhaps unrealistic to suggest that Virtual Water and Nexus based allocations per se would be a viable option to introducing the concepts to SADC. Nonetheless, the author argues that the introduction of the concepts into the national planning processes places other options on the table, promoting better trade-offs and an improved understanding of the contribution of water to the economy as a whole. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Allocation System; Blue Water; Virtual Water; Water Allocation; Water Footprint",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119120405

There are essentially three strategies for accomplishing this: changing production from fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) to non-fossil fuels such as renewable and nuclear energy, carbon capture and storage, and reduction in energy consumption. It is becoming increasingly apparent that renewable energies will not be phased in fast enough to make a dent in rising global carbon emissions. Nuclear energy provides a carbon-free alternative, but it is expensive and bears with it risks of severe accidents and problematic environmental side effects. Carbon capture is expensive, the technology is immature, and there is growing political resistance in Europe to carbon storage. Germany has recently decided to close the door on carbon storage. Added to these difficulties is a desperate need for energy among the 1.4 billion people globally who do not have access to electricity. For example, only 50 percent of India’s rural population and only 24 percent of sub-Saharan Africa’s population have access to electricity. These and other parts of the developing South and East will need energy use for basic services such as light, health care, and schooling, as well as for developing their economies. Energy will also be needed for “intermediate development” in India, China, and Brazil, as well as other Asian and South American countries with rapidly growing economies. These countries will need massive amounts of energy for industrial development and to accommodate the demands of growing middle classes for household energy appliances and automobiles. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112307812

Thermal accumulators are also used for increasing the efficiency of conventional fuel dependent systems by storing the waste heat in low consumption periods. Much of the efforts are directed towards creation of compact solutions to replace the presently used hot water tanks requiring very large space. This is especially important for small capacity thermal systems in buildings. There are a lot of suggestions in literature using the latent heat of phase change materials (PCM), but only a few close to commercial stage of implementation. A heat accumulator with paraffin as a PCM is a cost effective innovative solution for low grade heat storage. One of the design approaches is encapsulation of the phase change material in containers with a variety of shapes and materials. The aim of the present work is a 3D numerical simulation of the phase change process in a stainless-steel container filled with commercial E53 paraffin. This is a part of a study directed towards design optimization of a hybrid solar installation with thermal storage. The focus is on development and testing of a time effective method for numerical prediction of the thermal behaviour of the container with paraffin and assessment of the factors influencing the heat transfer process prior to the physical experiment. © 2016 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Union of Chemists in Bulgaria","CFD modelling; Latent thermal energy storage; Macro-encapsulation; Paraffin; Phase change material",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105032665

The major conclusion of our analysis is that with respect to all centralized long-term storage technologies the future perspectives are much less promising than currently indicated in several papers and discussions. It will also become very hard for PtG-technologies to compete in the electricity markets despite a high technological learning potential. Yet, for hydrogen and methane there are prospects for use in the transport sector. Fuel prices in transport in recent years have rather increased compared to stagnation or decreases in electricity spot market prices.

The geological information and the production history of the reservoir were applied in estimating the storage capacity at any given pressure. The plot of well flowing pressure (Pwf) against flow rate (Q), shows the deliverability of the reservoir at various pressures. The verification of inventory and assurance of deliverability were evaluated for the reservoir. The results of the estimated properties indicated that IZ-2 is a good candidate for conversion into storage reservoir and enhanced oil recovery. A reservoir engineering simulator (ECLIPSE) was used to forecast oil production from the reservoir without gas storage and with gas storage in the reservoir respectively. The results of the estimated parameters shows that the storage capacity is; 437Tscf and deliverability: 46.4MMscf/d. The production forecast indicated that the cumulative oil production was higher when the reservoir contain gas than when there is no gas. The novelty of this research work is the performance analysis for the determination of the suitability of the reservoir for gas storage and also the recommendation of gas storage in the reservoir based on the analyses conducted for simultaneous gas storage and enhanced oil recovery in Nigeria.

While gas flaring was the default solution, more stringent carbon constraints have rendered this solution unattractive, owing to its negative health, safety, environmental and socio-economic impacts. One potential solution entails injecting the otherwise stranded associated gas (AG) into underground geologic systems for temporary storage, but re-producing same when a viable gas market becomes available. Faced with the challenge of providing temporary AG solution for a new oil development in the shallow offshore area of the Niger Delta, this paper presents an overview of candidate solutions, which include (i) venting, (ii) flaring, (iii) injection for improved oil recovery, (iv) underground sequestration (AG injected but not re-produced), and (v) on-site conversion to natural-gas hydrates to facilitate evacuation to other outlets. Their relative strengths and weaknesses are examined relative to this case study. The paper details the key aspects of a reservoir-engineering assessment of temporary AG storage in a non-associated gas (NAG) reservoir for later monetisation of both the native NAG and alien (injected) AG resources. Rigorous numerical-simulation studies highlight the key factors that control both the injection and production phases of the subject reservoir. For a given set of abandonment conditions, effects of the gas volume injected prior to the production phase on the ultimate recovery factors of the native and alien gas resources are presented. Additionally, the relative advantages of matrix, pseudo-fractured, and fractured injection modes are explored. Compared against the above-mentioned alternative solutions in terms of (i) effective sales volume of hydrocarbon, (ii) infrastructural requirements, and (iii) net carbon savings, underground storage is the most attractive solution to address stranded AG in this example field, and possibly others.

The Arctic developments has been challenged during the last years due to relatively high risk and cost levels related to the remote locations, harsh environment and environmental risks. The price of energy has fallen significantly and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) prices has followed the oil market, therefor the development of LNG facilities in the Arctic has to offer substancial cost benefits over what was planned some few years back. Gas fields in the Arctic can be developed with LNG plants onshore, Floating LNG (FLNG) or by Gravity Based Structure (GBS) LNG solutions. Onshore developments has been the only alternative developed to date but logistical, foundation and lower productivity for construction, hook up and commissioning in arctic conditions has enabled another development concept to be evaluated. FLNG in shallow water and ice infested areas has not yet been considered a feasible development solution. The GBS LNG concept offers solutions to many of the challenges in developing a large scale LNG plant in the arctic. The self contained GBS LNG based on compact design with integrated topside, Product storage and offloading in one unit can improve the execution of: • Construction and integration in a yard instead of in an remote localization with harsh environment large parts of the year • Reduced logistical challenges and no ice breaking tansport vessels required • Locating the GBS LNG in permafrost free site • Concrete GBS can be constructed locally to ensure substantial local content • Securing the project schedule by working in a controlled environment with established infrastructure and work force • Significant reduction in bulk quantities due to compact design • Integrated ice barrier and potentially ice management systems in the GBS The GBS LNG concept has been developed to be a flexible solution where; • Train size and number of trains can be accommodated - up to 10 MTPA LNG capacity per GBS • Large flexibility in LNG and condensate storage capacity • Water depth ranging from 13-30m • Design one build many - easy hook up for multiple LNG GBSs • Cooling medium (Air or Water cooled) • Driver selection - GT or Electrical drive • Self contained with Living Quarter, Flare and utilities in produced on board • Flare can be installed on GB S This paper is based on several conceptual and pre-FEED studies for the arctic and sub arctic environment where the GBS LNG solution has been evaluated favourable over the onshore development alternative, especially in location with ice infested waters and were permafrost on land is present.

South African and European actors build a quite dense and centralized network within the dialogue. As in all the other energy dialogues, the non-European actors, that is the South African actors, are seen as more important than the European actors in South Africa. In addition state-owned companies play an important role, Eskom being the most important actor in the exchange network. However, there are controversies over market entry for European companies in the South African market. The EU actors address the South African actors more than vice versa and especially the European non-state actors are interested in all the other actors involved in the dialogue. It is the only dialogue in which, besides the EU Delegation, Directorate-General (DG) Trade instead of DG Energy plays the role of an important broker.

With the current global downward slide in oil prices most E & P firms are slashing costs to shore up profitability. Drilling operations are high capital-intensive projects that drive unit production cost northwards. This paper presents a comparative analysis of drilling costs in three geographical locations of the world petroleum provinces viz; North Sea, Gulf of Mexico and Niger Delta with sensitivities of the various elements that affect drilling cost with a view to assisting operators and rig owners on optimizing activities in a lean environment. Relying on panel data sourced from databases of a global energy consultant and industry operators, historical absolute average cost and footage trends were compared during the period of 10 years (2005-2014). A randomly selected well cost data was used to carry out the sensitivity analysis to deduce key determinants. It was found that although there are regional differences that reflect the local geology and some economic factors, drilling times and all costs rise sharply with increasing depth. Also drilling cost for the Niger delta province is highest compared to the other two regions. The sensitivity study showed that the highest contributor to high drilling cost is the intangible element in which the rig rate, hole problems and security issues should be the focus in drilling cost reduction and economics. Contract renegotiation strategy to drive down rig rates and establish new market equilibrium is recommended in this lean environment. Also tangible costs from tubulars can be reduced with favourable policy on reviving Nigerian steel industries to enable local sourcing of these tubulars, improve employment rate hence reduce insecurity in the Niger Delta area.

The objective of this work is, therefore, to analyse how increasing the number of connected (reference) households to an isolated micro-grid affects the optimal design of the stand-alone renewable combined heat and power system with hydrogen technologies. Eighty actual household’s electricity and heat consumptions have been (numerically) grouped to form different sized energy systems and have been analysed with respect to the optimal energy system design using HOMER energy systems’ analysis tool.

The analysis is performed on an annual basis in terms of self-consumption rate, shifted energy and payback period. It is shown that the battery size leading to the minimum payback period within the input range, is comprised between 2.6 kWh and 6.2 kWh. The lowest payback periods, (~5.6 years), are reached with a well-insulated building envelope, a high lightning and appliance consumption, a low feed-in tariff and a 5 kWh battery.

Energy and climate policies aim especially to increase the share of renewable energy in the future energy systems. Large shares of variable power generation will increase the volatility in electricity prices that in turn will impact CHP production as well as heat production with heat pumps. As a consequence thermal energy storages and heat pumps could have an increasingly important role in future district heating (DH) networks. The paper explores the optimal dimensioning of heat storages, heat pumps and solar collectors. In order to do this, we perform the optimal hourly scheduling of heat production and storage in the DH network of Järvenpää and Tuusula (78,000 inhabitants) in Southern Finland in 2050. These results are used to find the most cost effective combinations of the aforementioned district heating technologies. The studied DH network includes both CHP plant, fired mainly by biomass and heat only boilers. As future electricity prices are highly sensitive to the future shares of wind power and PV, we study three different scenarios with varying shares of wind power and PV (40% and 60%) in 2050. When the impacts of different system components were analyzed separately, it was found that a small heat storage is not a profitable investment but a larger heat storage (100,000 - 110,000 m3) is economical. In addition, the results indicate that the most economical size for a heat pump is around 20 – 25 MW. Yet, the most profitable solution was to include both a heat storage and a heat pump in the DH system. According to our results, solar collector was not a profitable investment in the studied DH system. © 2016 University of Ljubljana.","District Heat; Heat Pump; Renewable Energy; Thermal Energy Storage",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084245462

The first design condition of the system is based on the existing situation in Latvian DH where with fossil fuels produce 80% heat and only 20% are provided by biomass burning. Results obtained by system dynamics model shows that DH system in the future will also include the solar collectors with seasonal storage and heat pumps. Therefore, the second DH system design condition was included in the article, where alongside the fossil fuel combustion technologies DH system also includes renewable energy technologies: biomass combustion, solar collectors with storage and heat pumps. The main parameters which flexibility was tested and that characterize DH system were selected as follows: the price of fuels, heat losses in networks, technology costs and other parameters. The result shows that by transitioning to renewable energy sources, the emphasis is shifted from the fuel costs to the technology costs.

To enable the interaction between thermal and electric energy, an innovative concept that consists of a ground-source heat pump with possibility of reversing operation as an ORC power cycle combined with solar heating in a single-family building is introduced. The ORC mode enables the use of solar energy in periods of no heat energy demand and reverses the heat pump cycle to supply electrical power. This paper combines a dynamic model based on empirical data of the HP/ORC system with lessons learned from 140 heat pump installations operating in real-life conditions in a cold climate. These installations were monitored for a period up to 5 years. Based on the aforementioned model and real-life conditions knowledge, the paper considers two different sensible energy storage (TES) configurations for the reversible heat pump/organic Rankine cycle (HP/ORC) system: a buffer tank for both space heating and domestic hot water and a hot water storage tank used exclusively for domestic hot water. The results with the two different configurations are simulated in the Modelica language and compared in terms of energy shift potential in order to optimize RES integration, as well as the economic feasibility of the system in a cold climate. © 2016 University of Ljubljana.","Economic feasibility; Energy efficiency; Real-life operation; Reversible Heat Pump/Organic Rankine Cycle; Sensible thermal storage",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084245374

In Mexico, maize is the most important cereal for domestic consumption so that maize agroindustry plays a relevant role in social and economic terms. White maize is the dominant maize variety planted in Mexico mainly for direct human consumption. White maize agroindustry demands different types and amounts of energy sources to produce, transport, store, preserve and process the grain into a variety of derived products. The purpose of this paper is to estimate energy use and related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the key sectors of the Mexican white maize agroindustry based on information from the literature. Sectors examined include domestic white maize production, maize transportation, maize storage and preservation, maize processing and tortilla manufacturing. Estimated total energy use of the white maize agroindustry is in region of 123.3-217.3 PJ. Domestic white maize production (58.5-62.8 PJ) and mechanized tortilla manufacturing (31.4-92.9 PJ) are the major energy consumers. Commercial fossil-derived energy inputs such as diesel, synthetic fertilizers, LP gas and electricity are the main energy sources. However, non commercial energy forms (e.g. human and animal work) make a substantial contribution to total energy requirements especially in domestic maize production. Total GHG emissions range from 9.0 to 16.5 million tons CO2eq with mechanized tortilla production (2.3-6-9 million tons CO2eq) and domestic white maize production (3.7-4.5 million tons CO2eq) as the main GHG sources. In general, published information on energy use in the key sectors of the Mexican white maize agroindustry is scarce, out of date, and reports widely dispersed values. Further research is needed to perform more accurate calculations. In particular, domestic maize production, maize transportation and industrial processing should be investigated more in detail. © 2016 University of Ljubljana.","Maize human consumption; Maize processing; Maize production; Maize tortilla; Mexico","Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial economics; Accurate calculations; Human consumption; Industrial processing; Maize production; Maize tortilla; Me-xico; Synthetic fertilizers; Total energy requirement; Manufacture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084245230

The PCM can store energy in the form of latent heat which can later be used during the nighttime. Na2HPO4-12H2O is used as PCM. This type of PCM is applied for the temperature range it can operate, which is relatively low, and this also explains why solar collectors are selected to provide the required heat. A series of tank formations with one, two, three and five heat transfer tubes will be examined to determine how the charging time is affected by the tank’s dimensions and the number of heat transfer tubes.

For those living in the developed regions of the world, food insufficiency is not generally of relevance although societal problems concerning equitable food distribution are a current reality. However, issues around the safety and quality of the food supply are foremost in the minds of consumers and regulatory authorities in these countries. Food safety is of course paramount for the food industry and regulatory industries given the increased amount of dietary energy now consumed in the form of processed foods by the populations of developed countries and the increasing complexity and length of food distribution and supply chains.

One of the effective ways to decrease the amount energy consumption of these appliances from traditional grids, is the application of renewable energy sources, especially solar energy, as the main thermal energy provider. But, because of intermittent and unpredictable nature of solar energy, it is difficult to supply necessary thermal energy to aforementioned appliances without help of effective storage. Therefore, development of a storage that can store thermal energy harvested from renewable energy sources has high importance and one of the active research areas among scientists. Aim of the current work is to review different types of thermal energy storage systems, their technical characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and compare them with each other.

One such area of interest has been improving the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) panels. While PV panels use the most abundant and sustainable energy sources in the planet, they have quite a low efficiency in terms of energy conversion. Partly this low efficiency is due to the increase in surface temperature that occurs during the operation of PV panels. A small number of proven techniques have been developed to decrease the surface temperature. These techniques fall into two groups denoted by active cooling techniques and passive cooling techniques, respectively. Active cooling methods include forced ventilation or hydraulic cooling that requires maintenance and additional costs. On the other hand, the passive cooling methods include natural ventilation, and phase change (PCM) materials. This latter technique has shown promises in harnessing the nocturnal cooling effect with its inherent latent energy storage capacity. The aim of this project is to develop a rigorous numerical approach for the application of PCM to the passive cooling of PV panels. To this end, numerical models that simulate PV/PCM system are developed using the “ANSYS Fluent” software package. The validation of these models is done by comparison with experimental data obtained from the literature; consequently, optimum configurations that allow for largest decrease in PV surface temperature are evaluated. © 2016 Amer.

Such technology gives opportunity to store heat into the ground and/or groundwater in summer, and extract it during winter. To evaluate the BTES performance, the ground thermal properties must be known. One of the in situ methods for this purpose is the thermal response test (TRT).

In a given day, when the ambient temperature rises enough to reach the solid–liquid transition temperature, the PCM, incorporated in a construction element, changes from solid to liquid with endothermic behavior (latent heat) thus limiting the heat flow towards the interior of the building. On the other hand, upon an environmental temperature decrease, the PCM, that is now in the liquid state, may reach the liquid–solid transition temperature (melting temperature) again and shift to solid state, with energy liberation (exothermal process), thus delaying the cooling tendency inside the building. The permanence at a known melting temperature range will stabilize interior ambient temperatures thus influencing the thermal comfort sensation. In this study we propose the use of PCM for energy rehabilitation of buildings. Exploring different methods of PCM incorporation in building materials and studying its efficiency. This work consists on the study of the thermal behavior and energy consumption of a building when influenced by the incorporation of PCM. The case study is composed by the computer rooms located at the Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto – FEUP, with the reason of the need of an intervention in those spaces, whose temperature reaches high uncomfortable values during the summer. To accomplish this goal, the building will be numerically simulated through a calculation engine complemented with a user friendly graphical interface. The numerical simulation allows the recreation of various scenarios in the computer rooms with the purpose of understanding the reaction of PCM subjected to different environments. © 2016, University of Cantabria - Building Technology R&D Group.

The electrochemical characteristics for EDLCs (region of ideal polarizability, characteristic time constant, specific series and parallel capacitances) are significantly dependent on the CO2 activation extent of the SiC-CDC materials. The calculated coulombic efficiency values for CO2 activated systems vary within the range from 97 to 99.8% (calculated using integrated charge density values). The energy efficiencies from 82 to 86.5% show that the CO2 activated SiC-CDC powders are much more suitable for various power and energy storage applications compared to untreated SiC-CDC. From impedance spectroscopy the highest capacitance value of 170 F g−1 at 3.6 V has been established for SiC-CDC with the largest activation burn-off extent of carbon from SiC-CDC.

In situ determination of ground thermal conductivity, borehole thermal resistance and undisturbed soil temperature can be done by installing a vertical borehole heat exchanger (BHE) and performing the so-called Thermal Response Test (TRT). This paper describes the determination of ground thermal properties by a research group of the Technical University of Sofia, Plovdiv Branch. A mobile system for conducting Thermal Response Test has been created recently in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. The first Bulgarian TRT was carried out in January 2009 using a 41 m deep BHE, constructed in November 2008. Later tests are carried out on other two constructed BHEs in Plovdiv (single and double, 50 m depth and 32 mm diameters of the U-tubes). The tests were realized while the ambient temperature, the inlet and outlet fluid borehole temperatures and the temperatures of the BHEs at different depths were measured every minute. A large quantity of experimental data was gathered and analyzed by two parameters curve fitting based on the analytical formula of the Line Source Model for temperature distribution in the borehole (determining the ground thermal conductivity and the borehole thermal resistance). The detailed study of ground properties in different regions of Bulgaria is a good precondition for future application of the geothermal technology in the region. © 2016 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Union of Chemists in Bulgaria","Borehole heat exchangers; Ground thermal properties; Thermal response test",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052994985

The area is bound by geographic coordinates 38.16 and 38.24 East and 0.87and 1.475 South and is approximately 532.45 square kilometers. 400 million tonnes of coal were discovered by the Government of Kenya through its Ministry of Energy in Mui basin in 2010.The research was carried out in partial fulfillment for the award of Bachelor of Science in Geology. The main objective of the research project was to evaluate the natural gas (methane) resource in Mui basin coal and its potential recovery through enhanced coal bed methane recovery by carbon dioxide (CO2-ECBM). In relation to this the geological suitability of Mui basin for carbon storage and the risks associated with injection of CO2 were assessed. The estimated capital gains from applying this process versus conventional coal extraction were calculated and compared. The role of this research is to provide a framework of utilizing the fossil fuel resources in Mui basin with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. Electric resistivity data was used to delineate the sediment thickness in block A of Mui basin. The sedimentary sequence was found to be thin and therefore unsuitable for the application of CO2-ECBM recovery. Core log data was used to compile the stratigraphy of block C of Mui basin by drawing and interpreting cross-sections. 5 coal seams were identified in block C that are interbedded with mudstones, shales and sandstones between the depths of 80 and 330 meters. Coal seam 5 occurring between 300 and 330 meters with an average thickness of 3 meters was the only one identified as suitable for CO2- ECBM recovery. Geochemical data was used to calculate the gas content in coal seam 5 of block C using an adsorption isotherm equation. The calculated methane resources were found to be 6.938 Ã- 108 m3 and based on a 2 to 1 sorption selectivity of CO2 over CH4 by coals; the coal seam has a 13.8760 Ã- 108 m3 storage capacity for CO2. Cross-sectional analysis revealed seal pairs for the reservoir that are laterally extensive and continuous. Porosity and permeability analyses were used to define the gas flow mechanisms in coal. Faulting was identified as playing a major role in the distribution of the coal seams as seen in the central and southern part of block C where coal seams have been downthrown. Stratigraphic and structural traps, and well design mechanisms were identified as controls to risks associated with CO2- ECBM application by acting as seals preventing leakage from the reservoir and contamination of groundwater resources. The calculated revenue that can be acquired from conventional coal mining was found to outweigh revenue from CO2- ECBM recovery. Deeper coal seams probably lie at the central and southern parts of block C and in block B of Mui basin. Exploration and exploitation of these resources for CO2-ECBM recovery could prove to be more profitable than conventional coal mining in block C of Mui basin. At the current state the CH4 content in Mui basin coal will be a potent greenhouse gas and fire hazard during coal mining. Carbon dioxide should be co-injected with an inert gas like nitrogen to recover as much more methane as possible. The extracted methane could be marketed as liquefied petroleum gas to offset the cost of CO2 injections. Geophysical and geochemical methods are used to monitor the gas migration mechanisms in the coal seam.

The total mass percentage of PCMs in HPCMM can reach as high as 20%, while maintaining satisfactory performance in terms of mechanical properties/behavior of the mortar. The experimental program comprises two laboratory scale prototypes, materialized by two hollow boxes of outer dimensions 46×46×46cm3, internally coated with HPCMM or REFM (reference mortar without PCM) and externally subjected to realistic daily temperature profiles. The prototypes were internally equipped with a heater that was programmed to keep the inside of the box within the acceptable range of comfort temperature, in correspondence to the simulation of a winter scenario (heating season). By monitoring the energy consumption of the heater, it was possible to infer that the prototype rendered with HPCMM led to a reduction of energy consumption of nearly 20% as compared to the prototype rendered with REFM. © 2016 International Committee of the SCMT conferences.

Users can decide to install solar power, smart appliances, storage and electric vehicles. They now have the capability to output power into the grid and modify their consumption profiles if they wish to do so. Distributed generation is increasing leading toward a decentralization of the power system. At the same time, these variable renewable energy resources installed in the distribution grid cause hard to predict variations in the supply profile. Distribution grid operators are challenged to manage these changes. The effective management of the new decentralized grids requires close cooperation between distribution and transmission system operators. This paper examines cooperation models between DSOs and TSOs which could be best suited to enable the use flexibility resources located in the distribution system. Two conceptual models for flexibility contracting have been identified in literature. The first conceptual model is DSO-centered approach where the DSO contracts flexibility to be used for grid purposes directly from the flexibility service providers (FSPs). This flexibility can later be used for the DSO's own grid needs, re-sold to the TSO or to a third party that may need it. The second conceptual model is a TSOcentered approach where the TSO is the first one to have access to all flexibility resources, including those in the distribution grid. A case study for each model is presented, the FLECH market proposal in Denmark represents a DSO-centered approach to flexibility contracting; while the Bid-Ladder proposal in Belgium presents a TSO-centered approach to flexibility contracting. The expected costs and benefits of contracting flexibility are then outlined. It is expected that flexibility contracting can help to diminish losses, renewable energy curtailment, and investments in grid grid reinforcements. Flexibility also represents costs of reservation and activation of the flexible resources, risk of non-compliance and added transaction costs. Each of the presented models is qualitatively evaluated in terms of expected costs to determine trade-offs of each alternative. It is concluded that the main benefits of a DSO-centered model are: Avoiding double booking of resources, enabling visibility of flexibility to the DSO at all times, and promoting local grid management. The downside of this model is that it creates transaction costs for the DSO in case that he doesn't need to use the pre-contracted flexibility resources. Also, this model implies that a priority is given to the DSO in the use of flexibility, which might not always be necessary. In contrast it is argued that a TSOcentered model is a fair approach since the TSO holds the responsibility for balancing the system as a whole and has a more thorough vision of the overall grid conditions. The downside of this approach is that the distribution grid criteria is not taken into account as it implies that the TSO is contracting and then activating flexibility resources in the distribution network, without having visibility of that particular network. It is foreseen that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, but rather a combination depending on the conditions of a particular network, and relationship between the involved stakeholders. © 2016 CIGRE.

However, the renewable generation faces some problems for their complete integration in the system. In the short term, there is no availability of transmission capacity in the existing 220kV lines which are under severe congestions that produce curtailments and decoupling of marginal costs. A second problem, visualized as more problematic in the mid and long term, is related with the daily variability of the renewable generation and its effects in the generation dispatch during the hours without solar radiation. This phenomena is similar to the “duck-shape curve” problem [1] which obliges to the use of a mix of generation based on liquefied natural gas, hydroelectric plants with dams and diesel peakers, resulting in a more expensive system operation. Another concern for the future operation of the Great North Interconnected System (SING) and the Central Interconnected System (SIC) is the availability of resources for primary frequency control (CPF in Spanish) in the 3,300 km long combined system. Nowadays these resources are provided by thermal machines in SING and most of the times for hydroelectric power plants associated to dams in SIC which are located in the central and southern part of this system. This work summarizes the technical and economic evaluation of the use of Energy Storage to face the difficulties described above, making use of the available renewable resources in the north of Chile. © 2016 CIGRE.

The Intention of Government was that independent investors should build all future generation and that the role of Eskom should be that of purchaser, transmitter and distributor of electricity. However, due mainly to the low cost of electricity in South Africa, investors did not see the opportunity to invest as being a viable financial option. In 2004, some 6 years after the intended commencement of the generation build program, the Government realised that the private investors may not invest in the current environment. Eskom was required to undertake the building of large base load generation stations. In 2007 and 2008, low coal stockpiles, combined with heavy rain, resulted in the inability of many stations to generate. This contributed significantly to widespread load shedding (deliberately shedding load in certain geographic areas on rotation) which was rectified in a few months when the coal storage situation was stabilised. There was a growing increase in unplanned outages, and by 2014/15 at some stages exceeded 8000MW or around 20% of the installed capacity. The nature of the load profile, particularly in the summer season, is relatively flat with strong reliance on peaking plant to frequently run as mid merit capacity. The primary energy resources at the peaking plants are not sufficient for this mode of operation. To stabilize the situation a Demand Side Management program together with OCGT installation, base load capacity construction and an improved maintenance plan was implemented. The demand side management program which has removed 4125MW from the system to date was implemented. In addition OCGT’s were constructed for peaking power. After the 2007/8 load shedding, a National code of practice was developed which specified how load reduction should be implemented. This included load shedding (distributors and redistributors manually opening breakers according to a predefined schedule) and load curtailment (where eligible customers agreed to reduce a pre-defined portion of their own load for the duration of the emergency. In this manner, load reduction from about 5% to 20% of system load could be reduced in a controller and predictable manner.. There are 8800 MW (Medupi Units 5 to 1 and Kusile Units 1 to 6: nominal 800MW x 11) of coal generation and 1330 MW of pumped storage under construction. Focused and accelerated maintenance management of generation assets was implemented. This includes the hosting of a ""maintenance festival"" during the summer vacation of industry, the use of the Tetris Model to manage the dynamics of UCLF (unplanned capacity loss factor) and PCLF (planned capacity loss factor). On the “softer” side there was the compacting of management and employee for accountability and the re - empowerment of the power stations for their commercial procurement needs and requirements. At time of writing we have had over 7 months without load shedding. This represents continuity in power supply to all customers in South Africa including cross border exports to fellow members of the Southern African Power Pool. The forecast is sustained continuity of supply and speedy commissioning of the new plant under construction. Short term challenges include stability, voltage and demand responses as well as introduction of recovery mechanisms. © 2016 CIGRE.

The design, construction, and four decades of operation of the dam provides a useful illustration of the role of storage in general and dams in particular; the contribution of system management approaches to water security; the place of interbasin transfers in such systems management approaches; and how the water-energy nexus may function in practice. There have been substantial changes in the wider socioeconomic context over the past 50 years, particularly in relation to the national energy system, and the region experienced a severe drought in 2016. The operation of the Sterkfontein Dam provides some insights into how one component of a system can help to manage drought impacts, how this operation may have to be adapted to address the emerging challenges posed by changing contexts, and some limitations and risks that may arise. At a larger scale, the case also provides an unusual example of substantial innovation during implementation and raises questions about the supportive institutional context that enabled these innovations to be made.

Due to emission reduction targets the structure of production units is changed, with high penetration of renewables and dispersed generation. Production from renewables is dependent on weather, which poses new challenges for system stability and control. On the other hand, advanced information and communication technologies allow utilisation of resources on consumer side which are available in the system, but do not actively participate in power system control. Moreover, due to increasing costs for electricity bill, including commodity, net and all government taxes and levies, consumers are highly motivated in exploiting all options for lowering energy costs or producing additional revenue stream. Many of them foster for energy independence by installing on site electricity generation and storage. These trends are not seen only at industrial consumers, but extend through all consumer segments till households (e.g. different net-metering schemes). If consumers were in old times passive part of the power system resulting in electricity demand with almost no elasticity, nowadays consumers are transforming in prosumers and taking more and more active role in the power system and on the electricity market. It is of general opinion that demand response can help in balancing the power system and at least partially solve the new issues with balancing of a power system due to high penetration of renewable sources. However, in order to utilize and integrate demand response into the balancing market, the market regulation must change adequately. The paper examines two real cases where prosumers are actively participating in balancing market with the aggregator for tertiary control: case of Slovenian market and case of Austrian market. Both markets have their own approach how to organize balancing market for tertiary control. The paper will present regulation requirements and aspects for each case. Auction results and price trends will be analysed. At the end, obstacles in regulation for active participation of demand response in the balancing market will be highlighted, showing the need for adequate market regulation if exploitation of demand response is a desired target. Suggestions for market regulation which enables brother expansion of demand response for balancing market purposes are presented. © 2016 CIGRE.

Knowing many cases when the multicopter flies over the residential area, air traffic was temporary limited or closed due to multicopter approaching towards commercial planes. As a consequence, we should eliminate such collision situations in order to protect the significant places. One of the possible active option is the active jamming of remote control communication channel. The article introduces possibilities of preventing the multicopter motion in particular area. For the past few years there has been an increase of such mechanisms. By means of nanotechnology, the sensors designed for stabilization and flight control have been minimalized. Motion sensors (gyroscopes and accelerometers) made by the above mentioned technology are called MEMs (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems). By their activity they enable the control and stabilization of flight of multicopters in 3D space. Another important development factor of multicopters is the availability of energy effective electric drives, which along with Li-Pol and Li-ion accumulators are the basis of their drive. Upward pressure, which is essential for motion in 3D space is formed on spinning blade of propellers. Multicopters move in the space in a similar way than helicopters. Great advantage of these systems in comparison to aircraft is that they do not need much space to take off or land. It is possible to start and land with a vertical takeoff and landing. Altitude stabilization of all three axes is automatically done during the flight by autopilot based on MEMs sensors data [1]. Flight control is done by remote control; it is intuitive and easy to use. Autopilot circuit board can be used also for other functions, e.g. flight cruise control based on GPS coordinates stored in its memory. © Kaunas University of Technology 2016.","Defence; Jamming; Multicopter","Air navigation; Aircraft accidents; Airport security; Digital storage; Electric drives; Fighter aircraft; Health risks; Jamming; MEMS; Stabilization; Commercial planes; Control communications; Defence; GPS Coordinates; Micro electro mechanical system; Multicopter; Residential areas; Vertical take-off and landings; Remote control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045383420

This work focuses on the climate change analysis, transition of energy and transportation sector towards low carbon paradigm. As one of the most critical barriers to achieve 100 % renewable energy system is an intermittent nature of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, demand for energy storage becomes important. At this point hydrogen technology can be applied. Given the intermittence of the weather conditions at the short term-scales, energy peaks from wind and solar energy can be used for the hydrogen production and stored for later use, e.g. hydrogen utilization in transport sector. This also provides more flexibility in power system network to offset production peaks to energy that can be utilized later. Hydrogen technologies and their applications are investigated worldwide, from the aspect of sustainable development, cleaner technologies, energy efficiency and energy savings. Here the focus was positioned to the transport sector as the highest energy consumer and polluter. Three different future scenarios were analyzed—estimated cases of 10 %, 50 %, and 75 % shift to the hydrogen fuel cells powered vehicles in Croatia until 2030. It is important to note that hydrogen as the fuel is clean as much as energy and processes used for its production are clean. To satisfy this claim, the use of renewable energy sources for hydrogen production via water electrolysis is strongly suggested. In Croatia there are approximately 1.9 million registered vehicles, including approximately 1.5 million passenger cars. To accomplish clean and environmentally friendly hydrogen production, calculations were performed for the systems that include the use of solar and/or wind energy, i.e. photovoltaic cells and/or wind turbines. Given results represent directions in the system development based on installed power of wind and solar energy, taking into account demands for hydrogen amounts in the transport sector. In order to understand the scale of future importance of hydrogen and its connection to the renewable energy, an amount of installed solar and wind power plants were estimated in order to satisfy 75 % shift to the hydrogen fuel cells powered vehicles in Croatia until 2030. Results were discussed, especially in the context of hydrogen serving as an energy carrier. Paper conclusions can help in rethinking and shaping transportation, energy policies and energy strategies either in Croatia or in any country worldwide. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Combustion; Dioxide; Economic Crisis; Europe; Heat Content","Automobiles; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Climate change; Combustion; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Enthalpy; Fuel cells; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fuels; Natural resources; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Wind power; 100% renewable energy systems; Dioxide; Economic crisis; Energy and transportation; Energy efficiency and energy savings; Europe; Renewable energy source; Use of renewable energies; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044469725

The increasing rate of electricity cost leads our society to use different and more efficient ways for covering the heating loads. The utilization of solar energy is an efficient way to cover the heating needs with a green and low cost way. In this study a solar assisted floor heating system is modelled and analyzed with the commercial software TRNSYS. The solar flat plate collectors operate during the day capturing the solar energy which is stored in the storage tank by increasing the water temperature. The hot water flows inside the tubes under the floor of the house when the inside temperature is under the desired level. An auxiliary heater gives extra energy in order to keep the desired thermal comfort conditions inside the building. Also a controlled mix between the water building flows is made in order to have the desired temperature in the inlet of the building. The examined building has an area of 100 m2 and volume 300 m3 with 12 m2 double glasses. Infiltration and other internal gains (lights, people, and machines) are taken into consideration in the simulation. A parametric analysis is made in this study in order to optimize our system by the criterion of the lowest auxiliary energy consumption. The main parameters that influence on the system performance are the collecting area, the storage tank volume, the floor segmentation and the control strategy of the heating system. After the optimization, it is proved that a collecting area of 30 m2 with a storage tank of 2.5 m3 is able to cover the 90 % of the yearly heating load in the examined building. The desired inside temperature was selected at 22 °C and the auxiliary heater operates when the inside temperature is lower than 21 °C in order to decrease the auxiliary energy dramatically. Simultaneously, the case of the stand-alone solar system is analyzed and finally it is shown that a collecting area of 50 m2 is able to keep thermal comfort conditions in high levels. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Flat plate collectors; Floor heating; Solar heating; TRNSYS","Buildings; Costs; Dust collectors; Energy utilization; Floors; Heating equipment; Solar collectors; Solar heating; Tanks (containers); Thermal comfort; Building energy consumption; Commercial software; Flat-plate collector; Floor heating; Floor heating systems; Parametric -analysis; TRNSYS; Yearly heating load; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044446928

The anode and cathode current collectors were printed using commercial nano-silver conductive ink on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate and a polypropylene (PP) membrane, respectively. Air cathodes made of blended carbon black with inexpensive metal oxides including manganese oxide (MnO2) and cerium oxide (CeO2), were studied. The presence of the metal oxides in the air cathodes enhanced the oxygen reduction reaction which is the most important cathodic reaction in zinc-air batteries. The battery with 20 %wt CeO2 showed the highest performance and provided an open-circuit voltage of 1.6 V and 5 - 240 mA.cm-2 ohmic loss zone. The discharge potential of this battery at the current density of 5 mA.cm-2 was nearly 0.25 V higher than that of the battery without metal oxides. Finally, the battery was tested for its flexibility by bending it so that its length decreased from 2.5 to 1 cm. The results showed that the bending did not affect characteristics on potential voltage and discharging time of the batteries fabricated.

Long-term storage in warm season may lead to significant damages for high priced timber, income reduction for timber sellers and quality loss risk for timber buyers, therefore, roundwood is transported as soon as possible, because of the risk of blue stain, crooks and insect damages. Results of this study on Scots pine were obtained during summer-autumn season of year 2015. Scots pine timber quality changes in long-term storage were analyzed in 4 sample stacks - set up in summer (25 July) and stored for 100 days. In every sample plot there was a control pile, a pile with harvester spike damages, a pile with bark damages and a pile with harvester spike and bark damages. There were 32 timber assortments in every pile in order to determine also the emplacement effect in stack. In this study a high correlation was found between pine timber quality changes and meteorological conditions, side surface damages and storage length. By analyzing the proportion of blue stain in cross-section and its changes during storage between control assortments and assortments with bark and harvester damages, significant differences were observed, therefore it can be concluded that not only bark damages influence the proportion of blue stain, but also harvester spike rollers. Based on the results of this study, we can predict maximum storage duration during summer - autumn period in Latvia, and it is set from 9 - 16 days.","Blue stain; Roundwood; Scots pine; Storage","Digital storage; Energy storage; Forestry; Harvesters; Regional planning; Timber; Blue stain; Long-term storage; Meteorological condition; Pinus sylvestris; Quality change; Roundwoods; Scots pine; Surface damages; Piles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036669305

They are involved in many processes such as the storage of energy, in nutrition and are also of relevance for signal transduction processes, in apoptosis, cell differentiation and phagocytosis, etc. Macroalgae and microalgae are a promising and very diverse group of organisms. These living arganisms inhabit a vaste range of ecosystems from the Antarctic to the Deserts. They account for above half the primary productivity at the base of the food chain because of their multiple nutritional products including, for instance, lipids. Results: Recently, studies on the oleaginous algae encompass their uses for commercial exploitations with applications ranging from human health food, animal feed, aquaculture, nutraceutical, biofuels and others. In this article, updated knowledge of lipids and recent research studies for algae's valorization performed by several authors were reviewed.

The industries where emulsions are of considerable importance include petroleum, food, medical and pharmaceutical, cosmetics, agriculture, explosives, polishes, leather, textile, bitumen, paints, lubricants, polymer, and transport, among others. Particularly, food emulsions exhibit a great diversity of rheological characteristics, ranging from low-viscosity Newtonian liquids (e.g., milk, fruit beverages), to viscoelastic materials (e.g., salad dressings) and to plastic materials (e.g., butter). This diversity is the result of the different sorts of ingredients and processing conditions used to create each unique type of product. Polysaccharides are usually added to the aqueous phase of low-in-fat o/w food emulsions to improve their creaming stability. Their efficiency depends on polymer concentration in the aqueous phase as well as on the structural features of the aqueous polymer system. Xanthan gum is one of the hydrocolloids most used as emulsion stabilizer because of its unique rheological behavior. It forms highly viscous shear thinning solutions at very low concentrations and the viscosity is not influenced to any great extent by changes in pH, the presence of salts and temperature. The high viscosity at low shear enables the gum to prevent particle sedimentation and droplet creaming and the shear thinning characteristics ensure that the product readily flows from the bottle after shaking. The present chapter is oriented to interpret and model the rheological behavior of oil-in-water emulsions stabilized singly with xanthan gum or combined with different hydrocolloids, like guar gum or potato starch. The effect of hydrocolloids concentration was studied using oscillatory measurements within the linear viscoelastic range. Viscoelastic behavior of the systems was satisfactorily modeled using generalized Maxwell equation. This empirical model was used to predict the mechanical relaxation spectrum for both emulsions and continuous aqueous phases. Flow properties were determined through rotational experiments and changes during storage time were analyzed using parameters of the Cross model on the flow curves. Droplet size distribution was measured by image analysis. Microscopic observations revealed that emulsions containing xanthan gum did not significantly change the average droplet diameter during the first month of storage. Visual inspections of the formulated emulsions showed that they remained stable after six months even emulsions with low oil content (10%). © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Specifically developed agent classes, behaviours and protocols are proposed that allow to model and simulate the dynamics of local resource production, storage and consumption in order to pursue and evaluate self-sustainability of a settlement at hand. The framework can be used by a modeler either to design and simulate a new self-sustainable system, or to evaluate and analyze an existing system. The presented framework enables considerable improvements in the design of a settlement and its resource production, consumption and storage elements, in regard to the context of self-sustainability.","Agents; Framework; Modelling; renewable energy; Resource management; Self-sustainability; Simulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029503868

It has long been postulated in open published literature that solar and wind have complementary regimes, and that their reliability can be improved by hybridization. This paper reports on the findings of research examining the problem of optimally sizing a hybrid wind and solar renewable energy power generation system. In the research, a target site was first identified and meteorological data collected. Components of the system were then mathematically modelled from which an objective function was developed. A parallel multi-deme implementation of genetic algorithm was then used to optimize. Multiple scenarios were prepared and simulated to obtain an optimal configuration of the hybrid power system. The results obtained were validated against openly published results from real word projects. The key findings confirmed that on some locations wind and solar have complementary regimes and can thus be hybridized. To this end an optimal configuration of the system for off-grid deployment was developed with an attractive levelized cost of energy of 17 US cents per kWh. Another finding of the research decoupled resource optimal solutions from cost optimal solutions in that the least cost configuration didn't necessary maximize on the utilization of the abundant resource.","Energy storage; Genetic Algorithms; Hybrid power systems; Optimization methods; Renewable energy sources; Solar energy; Wind energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029484715

Insulation of the building envelope is one of the keys to reduce the heating energy loss. The mainly used thermal insulating materials are Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), Extruded Polystyrene (XPS) and mineral wool materials, moreover the nano-sized insulators (e.g.: aerogel, vacuum insulations etc.) are requiring spaces for themselves also. Aerogels are nanoporous lightweight materials that were discovered more than 70 years ago. Nowadays their applications are truly widespread. In this article measurement results and theoretical backgrounds are presented. Thermal parameters of building envelope, such as heat storage capacity, heat-loss coefficient, time constant, time lag, heat transfer coefficient etc. are very useful during the analysis of thermal behavior of buildings. This paper describes a methodology developed to calculate the time lag based on our previous measurement results. The thermal diffusion and time lag calculations are based on the Onsager-equations and atomic diffusion rules. © SGEM2016.","Aerogel; Building structures; Error function; Time lag","Aerogels; Energy dissipation; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Insulation; Mineral wool; Polystyrenes; Remote sensing; Solar buildings; Vacuum applications; Building structure; Error function; Expanded polystyrene; Extruded polystyrene(XPS); Heat loss coefficients; Heat storage capacity; Lightweight materials; Time lag; Thermal insulating materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026879241

These include a set of financial and technical programs known, variously, as cooperative threat reduction (CTR) programs, nonproliferation assistance, or, global security engagement. Congress has supported these programs over the years, but has raised a number of questions about their implementation and their future direction. Over the years, the CTR effort shifted from an emergency response to impending chaos in the Soviet Union to a broader program seeking to keep CBRN weapons away from rogue nations or terrorist groups. It has also grown from a DOD-centered effort to include projects funded by the Department of Defense (DOD), the State Department, the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Together, these agencies sought nearly $1.65 billion for these programs in FY2014. Although initially focused on the former Soviet Union, these programs now seek to engage partners around the world. The United States has used its funding and expertise to help secure or destroy dangerous weapons and materials in nations that experience civil strife or regime collapse, such as in Libya, and to prevent their spread outside a conflict’s borders, such as with Syria’s neighboring countries. U.S. cooperation with Russia is narrowing, with many of the CTR projects in Russia winding down after the June 2013 expiration of the Memorandum of Understanding that governed DOD’s cooperation with Russia. The two countries will continue to cooperate on some areas of nuclear security with a bilateral protocol under the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Program in the Russian Federation Agreement (MNEPR). In its oversight of these programs, Congress has addressed questions about the coordination of and priority given to these programs, about partner nations’ willingness to provide access to their weapons facilities, and about metrics used to measure progress. Congress has also reviewed efforts to engage nations around the world in cooperative threat reduction and security engagement activities. Some Members have actively encouraged the Obama Administration to expand these programs to the Middle East and North Africa. This goal is evident in the Next Generation Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2013 (S. 1021) and the Cooperative Threat Reduction Modernization Act (H.R. 2314). Similar provisions are part of both the House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act of FY2014 (H.R. 1960, §1304; S. 1197, §1326). This report summarizes cooperative activities conducted during the full 20 years of U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance. Many older programs have concluded their work, while more recent programs continue to expand their scope and their geographic reach. Several DOD and DOE programs have helped Russia and the other former Soviet states eliminate nuclear weapons delivery systems and secure nuclear warheads in storage. DOE has also helped Russia strengthen security and materials accounting at facilities that store nuclear materials. These agencies are seeking to expand this effort to other nations by sharing “best practices” with partner countries through Centers of Excellence. DOE is also working, through the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI), to secure, protect, and in some cases, remove vulnerable nuclear and radiological materials at civilian facilities worldwide. DOD has also helped Russia secure and eliminate chemical weapons by supporting the design and construction of a chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuch’ye. DOD and the State Department also provide assistance to address concerns about the proliferation of pathogens that might be used in biological weapons. DOD’s biological threat reduction program now accounts for nearly 60% in the FY2014 budget request. It also has grown from a program focused on dismantling the vast biological weapons complex in Russia into a tool used to promote “best practices” at biological laboratories with dangerous pathogens and to develop disease surveillance systems on several continents, particularly Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The United States also supports global programs that are designed to prevent the smuggling or illegal export of CBRN materials and technology. The State Department and DOE have also developed programs that are designed to reduce the risk that the weapons scientists would sell their knowledge to nations seeking their own CBRN weapons. These programs seek to prevent terrorists from exploiting scientists, other personnel, or materials to develop these weapons. The programs also train not only scientists, but other lab personnel about international security standards and improve personnel reliability programs to address the “insider threat."". © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Various criteria were considered in order to design these chromophores. First, diphenolic isomers were obtained: dipropargyl-oxy-benzoyl-{2-[4-(4- Nitrophenylaze)-N-ethyl-phenylamino]ethoxy}. To promote the formation of esters, several measures were taken to protect the carboxyl groups including the formation of methilic esters to avoid the formation of high quantities of water-soluble substances and avoid the formation of propargyl ester during the reaction of phenolic hydroxyl groups in all isomers of the dihydroxybenzoic acid, given that propargyl groups are not needed during basic hydrolysis. Because of this, the formation of esters on dihydroxybenzoic acid with the photon-emitting 2,5-dimethylphenacyl and the hydrazone of the benzophenone were evaluated. Next, dihydroxy-oxybenzoil-(9H-carbazole-9- ethoxy) was obtained through the direct reaction of the isomers in dihydroxybenzoic acid with 9H-carbazole-9-ethanol in presence of diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) and triphenylphosphine (TPP). © 2016, Advanced Engineering Solutions [AES.COM] Ottawa, Canada.

Up to 1/3 of the worldwide energy demand in 2050 can be saved by energy efficiency measures. In this chapter, several important aspects of energy efficiency are addressed. After an introduction and definition of energy efficiency, historic development and state-of-the-art and future trends of energy efficiency are presented in the light of life cycle assessment and total cost of ownership considerations. Energy efficiency in the sectors energy production, energy transmission and storage, transportation, industry, buildings, and appliances is reviewed. Concurrent measures such as recycling or novel materials are also discussed and touched upon. Energy conservation is covered in the final section of this chapter. References for deeper study are provided with an emphasis on guidelines on how to improve energy efficiency. Given the breadth of the subject, only exemplary coverage can be aimed for. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight the significance of energy efficiency and to provide cross-learnings from achievements in different sectors so that energy efficiency in the readers’ own facilities and installations can be assessed and improved with cost-effective means as a contribution to climate change mitigation, cost savings, and improved economic competitiveness. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 and Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","450 scenario (IEA);

To address this challenge and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has become the need of the hour. Research work is going on to limit CO2 emissions from large point sources such as power plants and industrial processes. Membrane technology has been actively investigated for CO2 separation as it offers several advantages over other techniques. It is considered to be environmental friendliness, requires lower capital investment, has lower energy consumption, has better space utility, and it has greater suitability for applications in remote and compact locations. The hybrid Facilitated Transport Membranes (FTM) has shown great potential to reach a separation performance beyond the Robeson upper bound region. FTM involves reversible reactions between the carriers incorporated in the membrane material with the targeted gas molecule (CO2). This interaction controls the gas transportation rate across the membrane. Several FTMs with high separation performance have been reported in recent years. Facilitated membranes can either be a mobile carrier or fixed site membrane. Most of the carriers reported in the literature can be classified as an amine, alkali salt, ionic liquid or enzyme which are either supported by a membrane as a liquid or attached to a polymeric chain of the membrane. Mixed matrix membranes with nanoparticles is a special type of facilitated transport membrane where organic/inorganic, functionalized/non-functionalized nanoparticles help improve membrane separation performance. Membrane contactor is a hybrid process which combines the high surface area of the membrane with high sorption capacity of absorbents to produce an efficient CO2 capture process. High performance facilitated transport membrane based CO2 capture processes are economically viable as compared other CO2 capture processes from the industrial point of view. Despite some drawbacks, facilitated transport membranes promise a solution to CO2 capture at all operating conditions. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Enzyme and biomimetic membranes; Facilitated transport; Ionic liquid membranes; Membrane contactor; Mixed matrix membrane",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024852805

Thus, the combination of using more efficient processes together with CO2 capture technologies must decrease CO2 emissions while renewable sources of energy are globally extended. Some emerging technologies in this field are carbonate-base systems, ammonia-based wet scrubbing, adsorption in porous materials, enzyme-based systems and the use of ionic liquids-based technologies, among others. Additionally, membrane technology is a promising separation method that overcomes the disadvantages of conventional gas absorption towers and the absorption process would offer a very high selectivity and high driving force in spite of the low partial pressure of CO2. Among the carbonate-based systems different alkaline and earth-alkaline ceramics have been proposed as possible CO2 captors in a wide temperature range. The most studied alkaline and earth alkaline ceramics, within this scope, are CaO, MgO, Li4SiO4, Li8SiO6, Li5AlO4, Li2CuO2, Li2ZrO3, Li6Zr2O7, Na2ZrO3 and Na2SiO3. Simultaneously, the separation and purification processes are often required in pre-combustion and post-combustion, CO oxidation and steam reforming (SR) processes, among others. For example, in steam reforming (SR), the H2/CO ratio can be varied by manipulating the relative concentrations of CO2 and O2 in the feed, which can be achieved via selectivity adsorbing the co-generated CO2 on a proper and affective sorbent and or by carbon monoxide oxidation. In this regard, some alternatives have been proposed using the same kind of ceramics, for example, (i) sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) and (ii) membrane-based technology (considered as a potential separation and purification technique in the syngas production). Also, various methods have been proposed for CO removal, such a selective diffusion, pressure swing adsorption, selective CO oxidation, and CO methanation. Catalytic oxidation of CO in H2-rich gas is considered a promising method and the most costeffective approach for eliminating CO from reformed fuels. In this context, some alkaline ceramics have been proposed as bifunctional materials, during the CO oxidation and subsequently as CO2 sorbents. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Alkaline ceramics; CO2 capture; CO2 separation; Reforming processes; Sorption enhanced steam reforming",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024849596

The first deals with the penetration of integrated or hybrid renewable energy sources in a micro grid system. The analysis of a hybrid power generation model suitable for serving an off grid micro power system consisting of diesel generation, biogas, solar PV, wind turbine, micro-hydro plants and dc generator of fuel cell type was presented. The concept of hybridizing renewable energy sources help in augmenting expensive constantly run diesel generator in providing power. This fold is based on the modeling, simulation, optimization and sensitivity analysis considering the net present cost, levelized cost of electricity, operating cost and performance of a renewable energy system having load of 20.6 kW under rural electricity supply. The hybrid optimization model for electric renewable software is used in the course of the study to design and optimize the proposed hybrid system. The reported load is used by the community, Al- Zahia-Musandam area of Oman. The second fold of this chapter concentrates on the solar PV-hydrogen system in the first fold in which an electrolyzer converts excess PV power into hydrogen gas. The closed operating condition output of hydrogen tank is fed to a fuel cell, which is used to power hydrogen cars. The hydrogen gas produced via electrolysis process in an intelligent adjustable solar panel configuration was compared to the volume of hydrogen gas obtained using the conventional fixed solar panel. Furthermore, the produced hydrogen gas in both cases was thereby used to power fuel cell cars employing either compressed or liquefied technologies. The performance of the hydrogen cars were thencompared to the performance of a direct connected electric car. The proposed arrangement leads to dual way of producing electricity at a lower cost and also provides opportunity for future energy storage which acts as fuel for the transportation sector. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Electric cars; Fuel cell; Hydrogen cars; Renewable energy; Solar panel","Automobiles; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Curricula; Electric energy storage; Energy policy; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hybrid systems; Hydroelectric generators; Hydrogen production; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Wind turbines; Electric cars; Hybrid renewable energies; Hydrogen car; Integrated renewable energy systems; Levelized cost of electricities; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; Solar panels; Fuel cell power plants",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021920413

The presence of this moisture increases the deterioration rate of the products during storage, handling, and processing periods; drying is one of the most suitable processes that can be applied to these by-products before using them as cattle feed or soil conditioner. This process is certainly one of the most energy consuming found in industry. The selection of an appropriate process control strategies can minimize production and maintenance cost, maximize product quality and reduce environmental pollution. Rotary dryers are normally employed to dry agricultural products because it can give high production rate and high drying uniformity. The aim of this research is to improve the performance of a feedback control strategy for a drying process, based on the implementation design of experiment; this approach allows finding specifics tuning parameters and potential operation conditions that will traduce in a more robust process. The selected criterion to evaluate the performance of the strategy is the integral absolute of the error (IAE) and the analysis is based on a dynamic model of a rotary dryer. The objective of the process improvement is to find an operation region, function of the controller gain, the integral time and derivative time, in which IAE parameter is minimized, this will lead to enhancement of equipment performance and reduction of the wear of the final control element. Once the controlled strategy is described, the methodology states an exploratory stage, for process characterization, establishment of a regression model, to describe the relation between experiment significant factors and response variable, maximum ascent route, exploration of a possible curvature, definition of a new regression model and finally determination of a new optimum operating point.

This paper presents a concept for optimal plant control for more flexible operation, using a two-stage optimization approach, combining a quadratic and a nonlinear optimization problem formulation. The optimization concept is demonstrated by means of a simple model plant. The input parameters are energy prices and production schedules respectively heat demands to be satisfied by the plant's energy supply system.

In the early days, the program was focused mainly on energy storage-especially to even out the variable power production from wind and solar technologies-but also to support large coal and nuclear power plants. The development of computer capacity and miniaturization has expanded the ability of grid operators to monitor and control electric power flows. The subsequent increase in networking of computerized devices for grid data collection and control advanced the ability of operators to anticipate, avoid, and otherwise mitigate potential power crises, such as blackouts. However, in more recent years, the computerization and networking have become vulnerable to unwanted computer-driven intrusions and disruptions, revealing a new cybersecurity challenge for electric power system technology. The nation’s energy infrastructure is diverse and complex. It includes distributed networks, varied system structures (electricity, oil, and natural gas), an array of operating models (public and private), and different systems in both the physical space and cyberspace. The energy sector consists of thousands of electricity, oil, and natural gas assets1 that are geographically dispersed and provide for all nationally important systems and networks. Thus, interdependency within the sector and across the nation’s critical infrastructure sectors is significant. Coordinating the security and resilience of energy assets is complicated by the borderless nature of energy and reliance on predominantly privately owned infrastructure. This book examines the federal oversight of electricity delivery and security. It also discusses activities and funding of electricity delivery and security.

In this context especially biomass and solar thermal energy are the main renewable sources to achieve these goals. In the past the combined use of biomass and solar for district heat production was considered as an economic competition. In the meanwhile it turned out that for medium and large scale applications the advantages of both can be integrated successfully into systems but creates technical and economic challenges to be solved. Within the European project “SUNSTORE 4” a large-scale district heating system based on hybrid solar in combination with a biomass CHP unit has been demonstrated in Marstal-Denmark and a 3 year monitoring period was performed. The new facility in Marstal consists of a 15,000 m2solar system, a biomass CHP plant based on a thermal boiler, an ORC with 3.2 MW heat and 750 kWelelectric output and a flue gas condensation with 1.1 MWth, a 75,000 m3pit heat storage and a 1.5 MWthheat pump with CO2as refrigerant.

The increase of solar and wind power has led to an increasing demand for control reserve. A requirement for the participation in this market is the flexibility of power generation. For biomass based combined heat and power generation (CHP) it is therefore necessary, to install an appropriate thermal energy storage in order to decouple heat generation in the boiler and power generation in the turbine. In the case study, the installation of a salt based high temperature thermal energy storage at a biomass CHP plant and the participation on the control reserve market were investigated. Results show that, under current market conditions, an economically feasible operation is unlikely to be established. Especially the uncertainty of call-off orders and the high price for wood chips lead to a negative economic results. A possibility for improving the model could be a combined participation on several electricity and power markets e.g. energy stock exchange, balancing energy and control reserve. © 2016 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.","Combined heat and power generation (CHP); Commercial plant; Feasibility studies; Financial aspects; Market",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019682524

Microorganisms metabolizing the main wood components cause a material loss of up to 5% monthly during storage. As a consequence of the microbial activity, heat is being produced inside the woodchip pile leading to a high risk of self-ignition. This work aims to describe the degradation process of spruce wood chips by respirometric tests. The microbial activity and dry matter loss has been determined under varying ambient conditions such as water content, temperature, particle size and pH value. It could be verified that the microbial activity and wood degradation rate is increasing with increasing temperature. The water content plays a major factor during the degradation process. Drying the woodchips reduces the microbial activity and dry matter loss significantly. Increasing the pH to a minimum value of 9 does inhibit fungal growth significantly offering a good alternative for conserving biomass. © 2016 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.","Biodegradability; Biomass; District heating; Losses; Storage; Wood chip",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019662955

The traditional interpretation of such external variations as disturbances and the practice of decoupling a plant from its environment are not suitable for today's transient and competitive global market. This means that such plants need to switch from largely steady-state operations to more intentionally dynamic ones in response to the time-varying environment [1]. Cryogenic air separation units (ASUs) based on distillation technology are an example of such manufacturing plants. Due to the high degree of heat and material integration of the process, ASUs typically have limited agility and low flexibility, which make process transitions challenging. Notwithstanding, the current market environment creates a significant incentive for dynamic operation of ASUs. Although the raw material, namely ambient air, is free and plentiful, ASUs consume large amounts of electricity, with industrial gas producers in the U.S. consuming in excess of $1 billion dollars of electricity per year [2]. Since electricity price deregulation, energy providers introduced dynamic electricity pricing strategies, such as use-of-time and real-time policies. These changes in the utility market may further amplify variations on the demand side, as now the ASU's customers may also practice demand response operations. Studies on the operations of ASUs have focused mainly on transition agility [3], short-term planning [4] and long-term scheduling [5]. It is demonstrated in several studies that when an ASU adjusts its production loads in response to the electricity price, improvements in the plant's economic performance can be achieved. However, most of the studies focused on electricity price induced operation changes. Except for the work done by Pattison and co-workers [6], most of the planning and scheduling studies do not include accurate representations of the process dynamics, despite its importance in determining the actual feasibility of required transitions. In these studies, one of the commonly practiced strategies is to use liquid inventory to buffer the effects of electricity price variations. In this paper, we conduct a more comprehensive analysis on optimal operation strategies for air separation systems through a multi-tiered dynamic optimization framework. Here, the response of the integrated plant is captured using collocation-based reduced order dynamic models that are shown to be highly accurate. The overall objective is to improve the plant's economic performance under electricity price or demand variation. One of the operational issues assessed is the economic incentive for practicing a storage and evaporation strategy in response to time-varying electricity price/demand. The trade-off between profitability and feasibility (i.e. due to process dynamics) and the resulting selection of collection methods (i.e. collecting liquid product or liquefying over-produced gas product) and utilization mechanisms (i.e. vaporizing to meet gas demand or introducing as additional reflux) are systematically explored. Another issue investigated is the benefit of having cooperative supply chain subsystems. With information on the upcoming demand change, the air separation plant could potentially take pre-emptive action so that the demand of the customer can be satisfied, while also maximizing the profitability of the plant. All these optimization problems are solved using the commercially available software package, gPROMS 4.1.0. Copyright © American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

An economic way to commercially produce hydrogen is to utilize steam methane reforming [1]. The process consists of a number of material and heat flows, resulting in an intricate network of material and energy. Natural gas (NG) and superheated steam are fed to a chemical reactor called reformer, which consists of catalyst tubes filled with nickel reforming catalyst. Here, majority of the hydrogen is produced. The gas out of the reformer is then processed through another reactor to further produce hydrogen. Finally, the hydrogen flow is purified in a pressure swing adsorber (PSA), where high purity hydrogen is produced. The reformer exit temperature is an important process variable for this process and is expected to be kept at a desired level by heating the reformer. This heat is provided by burning the off-gas from the PSA and NG fuel stream. A fan is used to supply air to the burners and another one draws the combustion products, termed as flue gas, out of the reformer box. This process presents various constraints and challenges during the start-up as well as nominal operation of the plant such as, the reformer exit temperature should be maintained at a desirable level. Further, the firebox pressure should not breach its lower and upper limits for safety. If the pressure is too low, the fire can be extinguished. If it is too high, it may impose safety hazards to facility and personnel [2]. A typical startup procedure consists of series of events that take place over a period of time based on a predefined recipe. Startup can broadly be categorized as cold startup and warm startup based on the initial state of the plant from which the plant is required to be driven to nominal operation. The focus of this work will be on cold startup where the plant is started from completely shutdown conditions. Typical steps involve ramping the natural gas fuel to reach a sufficient reformer exit temperature, circulation of natural gas feed and steam, regulation of nitrogen flow in the reactor tubes. The startup also involves making discrete decisions such as starting up the PSA, recirculating the tail gas from the PSA and ramping up to full capacity in several stages. Thus, the startup time is not fixed and varies based on the decisions taken at various stages. Existing startup recipes have been built heuristically from past successful startups, with the possibility of optimizing the startup procedure remaining unexplored. One key recognition that we make is that due to the nature of startup/shutdown phase, they can be treated as a batch like operation with variable lengths, where the objective is to drive the process from one state to the other. For modeling and control of batch processes, a variety of a data-driven modeling techniques exist. One of the most widely used approach is partial least squares (PLS), which models the process in a projected latent space [3]. These models are essentially time-varying linear models, linearized around mean past trajectories, and therefore require the batches to be of same length, or to recognize an appropriate alignment variable. To account for these limitations, a multi-model approach was proposed in [4]. These models were based on the 'current measurements' of the process instead of the 'time'. These developments were followed by contributions in the area of integration of these data-driven models with the advanced control formulations [4-5]. More recently a subspace identification based batch control approach was proposed in [6] where a LTI state-space model of the batch process is estimated, and does not require the training batches to be of equal length. The existing formulations have, however, not been applied to startup/shutdown operations in general, and for standard operating procedure (SOP) synthesis/optimization problem for the hydrogen plant in particular. Motivated by these considerations, in this work we address the problem of determining a data driven model for the startup of a hydrogen plant. To this end, first a high fidelity test bed model of the entire plant is developed in UniSim, capable of simulating the startup and shutdown phase, with appropriate adaptation of the plant SOP. Several simulated startups are performed to generate the training data. Then, an LTI data-driven model (higher order) of the process using subspace identification based method [6-7] is estimated. Simulation results are presented that illustrate the prediction capabilities of the identified model and its suitability for deployment in an optimization framework. Note that the development of a good model that can handle variable batch times paves the way for application of optimization algorithms that can improve not just the process economics along the startup/shutdown but also the operating time of the startup/shutdown procedure. From an optimization standpoint, the problem is quite different compared to existing application of data driven models for control of lumped parameter (such as in [6]) or distributed parameter process [7], where the objective was to reach a certain quality requirement in a given, predetermined batch length. The optimization problem for the present application is an optimal control problem where the objective is to reach the desired terminal state in minimum time, while adhering to various constraints, and also making discrete decisions along the way. The data driven model developed in the present work will subsequently be utilized within such an optimization framework to synthesize the startup SOP.

However, for ensuring energy security in Belgium, the Government decided in the same year to extend the life time of operation of the two units for 10 years, which raised the need to resume their continuous operation, in the opposite direction of the core contents and with a significant break in the usual sequence of cycle reloads. All this required adaptation of the tools and process for optimized reactor core design, in order to ensure the continuous and flexible operation of those units.

In vitro fungitoxicity was investigated using two natural essential oils; clove and sweet wormwood at concentrations of (2, 3, 4 and 5%). Clove oil at 2% inhibited completely the fungal growth of S. sclerotiorum. Chemical composition of clove essential oil was studied using GLC-MS analysis and resulted in identification of 12 compounds.

Along 120 day of storage, treatment of JA tubers with clove oil led to a significant decrease in the disease severity, sprouting percentage and weight loss. On the other hand, this treatment enhanced the dry matter and contents of carbohydrates, protein, inulin and total phenols as well as the activity of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase enzymes of JA tuber compared with the untreated-infected tubers.

The best known are the transportation of the product mixed with a diluent and the transport with heating of the product. In the 1st case the disadvantages are: a)Reduction of the efficiency of transport caused by the diluent product b)Harm the environment in the event of loss of the product. c)Increase in the cost of transport. In the 2nd case the major drawback lies in the selection and dimensioning of stations pumping and heating of the viscous oil The original idea of this paper is to propose a method of reduction in viscosity of oil by heating. The difference lies in the type of proposed heating. Indeed, it is to practice heating inside pumping stations. The distances and the type of pump with motor drive will be chosen on the basis of thermal and hydraulic calculations that will determine the optimal distance of reheating, i.e. the distances travelled by the product in turbulent regime. It is suggested to set heaters in storage tanks in pumping stations at the optimal distance of flow corresponding to the turbulent regime. The advantage of this process is to save heating energy and pumping. So the product will retain its initial properties. We propose a theory based on the thermal and hydraulic calculations of oil pipeline to determine reheating range, the temperature corresponding to the flow regime change for a given oil type (each type of product has its own temperature limit of heating), the generated load losses, the number of heating, pumping stations and the necessary thickness of insulation to maintain as far as possible the heat in the oil pipeline. © IEOM Society International. © IEOM Society International.","Economy of transport; Efficiency; Environment; Heating; Viscosity",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018402051

Deployment of the best available technologies is indispensable though not sufficient for cutting CO2emissions to an extent required by the climate change mitigation targets established by the International Energy Agency. Increased share of secondary steel produced via EAF method using gradually decarbonised electricity also is a prerequisite for substantial cutting of CO2emissions. Rapid and wide commercialisation of currently developed innovative ironmaking technologies after 2020 allows for reaching emission levels consistent with the targets up to 2030-2040, depending upon the market penetration. However, in the following years even in the most radical modernisation scenario, new impulse is needed to align CO2emissions with sustainability targets.

Therefore, obtaining a correct temperature storage of vaccines has been a challenge due to the lack of electricity to maintain the recommended storage temperatures. Currently, most of the vaccines have to be stored at temperatures between +2°C and +8°C at the service delivery points. For many years, photovoltaic power has been used for vaccine refrigerators with a lead-acid battery to store electric energy and to provide the start-up current that drives the compressor. The problem with this technology is that the lifetime of the battery is short due to deep discharging of the battery during periods with low sunshine/irradiance. The development of solar ""direct drive"" refrigerators started in 1999 at Danish Technological Institute (DTI). It was demonstrated that the energy capacity of ice produced by a compressor is at least of the same magnitude as the lead-acid battery. As of to date (February 2016), 24 direct-drive vaccine coolers from eight different manufacturers are listed on the WHO PQS website, with the technology being one of the fastest growing technologies in the vaccine cold chain. This paper endeavours to expound on the current status and discusses how the technology could be used for other purposes in the future. © 2016, International Institute of Refrigeration.

Yet the incurred losses resulting from fluid friction are significantly larger than those encountered in electrical power cables. This study investigates the possibility of compensating for such losses by exploiting cold deep-seawater (DSW) from below thermoclines. A numerical study simulating a single large-scale offshore wind turbine-driven pump supplying DSW to shore across a pipeline in the Central Mediterranean is presented. Seawater leaving the grid-connected hydroelectric power plant is allowed to flow through a centralised district air-conditioning unit operating on a vapour compression cycle. Any shortfall in DSW supply due to lack of wind is compensated for by sea surface water to maintain a constant flow rate. The analysis is repeated for seawater pipelines having different sizes. It is shown that the deep seawater supply from the offshore wind turbine, though being intermittent, reduces the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system considerably. The resulting savings are found to compensate for a significant proportion of the losses encountered in the hydraulic transmission pipeline. © 2016 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Air conditioning; Energy utilization; Hydraulic motors; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Natural gas transportation; Offshore wind turbines; Pipelines; Power transmission; Seawater; Surface waters; Wind power; Wind turbines; Air conditioning units; Central Mediterranean; Constant flow rates; Energy storage systems; Off-shore wind energy; Seawater pipelines; Seawater supplies; Vapour compression cycles; Offshore wind farms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017430514

Gait recognition is the process of identifying people through their style of walking. Gait can identify subjects from long distance and without inconvenient interruption. However, most of the existing Gabor-based gait recognition approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, even after utilizing dimensionality reduction techniques. Consequently, this adds more computational and storage burdens and may make the human identification process more difficult. This paper presents an effective gait recognition method based on the statistical analysis of Gabor patterns. This method adopts the Gait Energy Image (GEI) to capture the spatio-temporal characteristics of the human gait sequence during one motion cycle. Then, it applies Gabor filters and encodes the magnitude of the resulting Gabor responses from different-sized regions using set of statistical measures. Consecutively, classification is performed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Finally, intensive experiments are carried out on the two benchmark OU-ISIR A and CASIA B gait datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results have shown that our proposed statistical method can achieve promising performance in term of accuracy and efficiency. © 2016, UK Simulation Society.

Bone complications are an important cause of morbidity of GD and are thought to result from imbalance in bone remodeling. The objective of this case series was to analyze the long-term effect of enzyme replacement therapy on chemokines MIP-1a and MIP-1b, cytokines IL-3, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteocalcin (BGP), chitotriosidase, quantitative ultrasound sonography (QUS), bone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in patients with GD in Northern Greece. In addition, the study aimed in investigating possible relationship between the above mentioned parameters. Patients and Methods: Seven patients with GD type I (three males and four females) were included in the study. Mean age was 26.29 ± 15.34 years (range 7-47 years). Six patients were receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), with 40-60 IU/kg of imiglucerase weekly, for a mean period of 36 months prior to study initiation. One patient started ERT after his inclusion in the study. The levels of MIP-1a, MIP-1b, IL-3, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, OPG, BGP, chitotriosidase, bone imaging parameters assessed with two different techniques (QUS and DXA) and MRI data were estimated at baseline (T0) and after two years on ERT. Results: Chitotriosidase, MIP-1a, and IL-6 levels decreased in all patients after two years of ERT (p =0.05). In contrast, OPG and BGP levels increased (p =0.04 and p =0.02, respectively). Bone mineral density (BMD) demonstrated a progressive improvement with regards to the Z-score in all patients (p =0.05). The decrease in the plasma levels of MIP-1a strongly correlated with a decrease in the plasma levels of chitotriosidase. Additionally, decreased plasma levels of IL-6 were correlated with increased Z-score both at baseline (T0) as well as two years later, in all patients. There was no correlation between MRI findings and any inflammatory biomarker. Conclusions: Measurement of serum markers in patients with GD under ERT could be used as an auxiliary tool in the monitoring of bone involvement, in combination with MRI imaging and BMD. However, larger studies involving higher numbers of GD patients are needed to confirm these conclusions. © 2017, Lithografia Antoniadis I - Psarras Th G.P..

For a Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) with explicit control of the internally stored energy, this implies that the total energy sum must be controlled by acting on the dc-components of the circulating currents. However, the internal energy storage of an MMC acts as a buffer between the transient dynamics on the ac- and dc-sides. Thus, the dynamic response of the dc-voltage will depend on the closed loop dynamics of the internal energy control. Different system characteristics can be obtained if the reference signals from the dc-voltage control and the sum energy control are interchanged. As a result, the dc-voltage controller can provide the reference value for the dc-components of the circulating current, while the sum energy controller will provide the ac-side active current reference. In this paper, it will be demonstrated by time domain simulations and eigenvalue analysis that dc-voltage control by acting on the circulating current reference introduces a decoupling between the dynamics of the ac- and dc-side interfaces. This decoupling will also make the system dynamics less sensitive with respect to the operating conditions, which enables improved dynamic performances and less strict tuning requirements for the dc-voltage and sum energy controllers. © 2016 IEEE.","Energy Control; HVDC Transmission; Modular Multilevel Converter; Small-signal Dynamics; Stability","Buffer storage; Convergence of numerical methods; DC power transmission; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Energy conversion; HVDC power transmission; Power control; Power converters; Time domain analysis; Voltage control; Dynamic performance; HVDC transmission; Modular multilevel converters; Small signal dynamics; System characteristics; Time-domain simulations; Traditional approaches; Voltage-source converter-hvdc; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015416866

The BSs share excess renewable energy with others to reduce the dependency on the conventional electricity grid. Three cases are investigated where the renewable energy generation is unknown, perfectly known, and partially known ahead of time. For the partially known case where only the statistics of renewable energy generation are available, stochastic programming is used to achieve a conservative solution.

By acknowledging the potential of renewable energy technologies and associated energy storage, Bangladesh could possibly meet its unprecedented energy demand. Our goal is to design a project which involves the development of a solar-powered electric stove that would use sunlight as a source of power. The electricity and gas shortage in Bangladesh are strong motivators for a solar electric stove to replace the normal stoves. Our system consists of two burners which altogether require solar panels providing power of 1520W. The coils were designed according to the power rating.

The important initial capital cost, a barrier to the use of PHES systems, could be counterbalanced by using pre-existing installations (as mines or quarries). However, it is necessary to have an estimation of the costs and revenues breakdown of these installations in order to optimise the number and the type of components that will be installed. This paper presents the cost and revenue breakdown for a PHES installation to be installed in Belgium, more specifically in theWalloon region. It presents the division of the plant into sub-parts for which the investment costs are modelled (reservoirs, electrical lines, etc.). An optimisation of the revenue sources available to PHES plants in Belgium is then presented. This helps to optimise the utilisation of the plant. Operation and Maintenance costs are finally taken into account to build a financial analysis of the investment. These computations help to estimate the most promising installation for a dedicated site. This is then illustrated as a conclusion on a case study of a PHES site of 4MW and 20MWh installed in a quarry and a mine. Results showthat the installation in the mine seems more promising, but specific additional startup costs will have to be taken into account in futures works. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Costs; Economics; Energy storage; Engineering research; Hydroelectric power plants; Installation; Investments; Quarries; Capital costs; Cost and revenues; Economic feasibilities; Financial analysis; Hydroelectric energy; Investment costs; Operation and maintenance; Start-up costs; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015016748

To deal with these changes in distribution system design, distribution utilities are facing a challenge to efficiently monitor the system. Distribution system state estimation (DSSE) is recognized as fundamental application for network monitoring. Due to lack of real-time measurement distribution network quality of DSSE results highly depend on quality of pseudo-measurements of unmonitored buses, which are usually obtained from daily load(generation) profiles (DLP/DGP).

A microgrid is considered as a small-scale power grid that involves generation, distribution and energy storage systems operating independently from the main grid. Typically, a microgrid uses renewable energy to produce electricity as a main source. Due to the uncertain generation of power from renewable supply in a microgrid, the controlling of power balance between supply and demand of a microgrid is difficult in the islanded operation mode. When a microgrid is subjected to a large disturbance, the frequency of a microgrid may change rapidly due to the low inertia present in a microgrid. It is essential to maintain the frequency of a microgrid within acceptable ranges, particularly in islanded mode. Therefore, utilizing an ESS with UF relay gives benefits in maintaining and stabilizing the frequency effectively. In this paper, a system identification technique is applied to a microgrid to formulate a mathematical model systematically. Then, with the obtained identified model, the robust controller of an ESS can be designed by using H-infinity loop shaping procedure (HLSP). The application of such ESS with the appropriate load shedding by UF relay is also proposed. The proposed study system is implemented on DIgSILENT PowerFactory and MATLAB software. The obtained simulation results demonstrate that the stabilizing performance of frequency in a microgrid is more effective in terms of smaller frequency deviations, faster responses and minimum load shedding when collaborative ESS control and appropriate load shedding with UF relay are used. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Energy storage system; H-infinity loop shaping procedure; Load shedding; Microgrid; Robust control; Under frequency relay",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014087155

With 1% of energy-source for electricity generated in the US being petroleum does falling oil prices offer any opportunity to the integrated resource plan of power producers and the consumers? Aided by retirement of nuclear and coal, natural gas with its abundance, lower emission and deployment costs has taken over as the top US fuel for power. The crude and natural gas prices fell among stagnant oil but increased gas demand. The wholesale power prices fell but retail prices edged up. Public service commissions and power producers have interest to ensure safe and reliable electric service at a reasonable rate [1]. The pricing and production of oil are important as oil often was the reason for drilling the wells, half of which produce natural gas also. A lack of available finance and production in oil hurts natural gas. The energy industry and producer countries issue many bonds. Any doubt in the ability to fulfill the bond obligations worries the investors and raises the borrowing cost. US electric companies are investing in natural gas reserves, pipelines and wells to secure supplies as well as to participate in the gas distribution business that arguably has taken away from investments in renewables. Utilities must maintain dispatchable reliable generation capacity even as residential consumers avail themselves of cost protections and new methods of generating, conserving and selling power back to the grid [2]. Clean Power Plan is estimated to cost power producers $8 billion per EPA, which is $40 billion as per industry analysts.

As the most effective form of distributed generations, micro grid system has found wide applications in many areas. Micro grids are low voltage (LV) distribution networks comprising various distributed generators (DGs), storage devices, and controllable loads that can operate either interconnected or isolated from the main distribution grid as a controlled entity. This paper describes the operation of a central controller for micro grids. Different control methods of micro grid system and their advantages and shortcomings are carried out and analyzed. The controller aims to optimize the operation of the micro grid during interconnected operation, that is, maximize its value by optimizing the production of the local DGs and power exchanges with the main distribution grid. Two market policies are assumed including demand side bidding options for controllable loads. The developed optimization of a typical LV case study network operating under various market policies and assuming realistic spot market prices and DG bids reflecting realistic operational costs. A laboratory scale micro grid system is proposed as an example to verify the micro grid control strategy. The operation experimental results show that the laboratory scale micro grid system can operate in grid-connected or islanded mode, with a seamless transfer from one mode to the other, and hence increase the reliability of energy supplies.","Control strategy; Demand-side bidding (DSB); Distributed generation; Markets; Micro grids; Optimization; Renewable energy sources","Commerce; Controllers; Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Electric machine control; Electric power system interconnection; Marketing; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Virtual storage; Control strategies; Controllable loads; Demand side bidding; Distributed generator (DGs); Distributed generators; Low-voltage distributions; Micro grid; Renewable energy source; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013371993

In the presented system, a double jacket solar water storage tank was used to heat the saline water in a separate independent circuit. A natural circulation solar water cycle between the flat plate collector and the storage tank was introduced to prevent salt scales formation inside the internal boundary layers of the flat plate collector tubes and heating system network. The humid air in the atomization chamber was collected on the condenser surface that cooled by water using thermoelectric refrigeration technique. This refrigerator was powered by a DC electric source provided by a solar photovoltaic module to maximize the water yield. The simulation model was built using the local meteorological conditions of Cairo, Egypt (30° 2' N latitude, 31° 14' E longitude). Results showed that the daily production of condensed water depended on the flow rate and temperature of saline water in addition to air mass flow rate and its pressure. It is found that the maximum productivity of the system is achieved in summer season with a value of 64.3 L/day and it is found that each kWh/m2/day falling on the collector surface produced 7.9 L/day.

Moreover, this system could be replicated to produce more desalinated water for inhabitants demand. As Egypt enjoys long coastal area of about 2500 km in length as well as abundant solar energy most time of the year will encourage the Egyptian government to install several solar water desalination plants with several technologies. One of the most promising and simple technologies is the HDH Process. © 2016, NIDOC (Nat.Inform.Document.Centre).

On the basis of official power generation forecasts, a target of 1.4 GW was set to reach this target. Out of nine commercially available RE technologies assessed, five were found to be viable options, with three of them - wind power, concentrated solar power (CSP) and solar photovoltaic power - individually able to reach or surpass the 1.4 GW target. However, based on the complex techno-economic analysis undertaken in this study, in order to achieve the 1.4 GW RE target, the recommended mix of RE sources is 10% wind offshore, 30% wind onshore, 35% solar photovoltaic, 5% concentrated solar with storage and 20% waste to energy. Waste to energy addresses Abu Dhabi's goal diverting waste from landfills by 85% by 2030.

The spontaneous polarization can be switched between two bistable energy states if a field higher than the coercive one is applied to the system. The switching property of ferroelectrics has extensive applications in data storage, random access memories, ferroelectric tunneling barriers, and ferroelectric gate transistors. This chapter describes the role of local field inhomogeneity on the permittivity, tunability, and switching properties, with examples of a few peculiar microstructures. To describe in a rigorous way the field modifications, it uses the finite element method (FEM). For describing the P(E) dependence in inhomogeneous ferroelectrics, a combined approach based on a switching model was developed. In this case, the classical Preisach model (CPM) was chosen combined with finite element method (FEM) calculations to determine the local fields as a function of microstructures. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Classical Preisach model; Finite element method; Local field inhomogeneity; Nanostructured ferroelectric ceramics; Permittivity; Switching property; Tunability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012861005

Besides, it was found that the impurities influence the electrical and photoelectrical characteristics of the amorphous material, due to the changes in the density of localized states. Introduction of the elements of IV group of periodic table in selenide and sulphide glasses, such as Sn and Ge, conduct to the appearance of tetrahedral structural units in the base glass, which change the coordination number. These particularities lead on non-monotonous dependence of physical properties on the glass composition. Besides that, recently it was established, that in the disordered network of glassy system GexAsxSe1-2x exists three distinct phases, floppy, intermediate and stressed rigid, and the dependence of physical properties of the average coordination number Z. In the present paper the experimental results on steady-state photoconductivity of amorphous GexAsxSe1-2x and (As4S3Se3)1-xSnx thin films are presented and discusses. It was shown, that the spectral distribution of the stationary photoconductivity for both glass systems depends on the composition and polarity on the illuminated electrode.

Nano-SiO2 was extracted from local rice husk ash (RHA) using the co-precipitation method. Then, the MgH2 was catalyzed with a small amount of nano-SiO2 (1 wt%, 3 wt%, and 5 wt%) and prepared using a high-energy milling technique. The microstructure and hydrogen desorption performance were studied using x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results of the XRD test showed that the milling process over 5 h reduced the material to a nanometer scale. Then, SEM images showed that the powders were agglomerated after 5 h of milling. Furthermore, it was also found that nano-SiO2 reduced the hydrogen desorption temperature of MgH2 to 338°C in 14.75 min when the 5 wt% variation of the catalyst was applied. © IJTech 2016.","Catalyst; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium hydride; Milling; Rice husk ash; Silica",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010288082

This series was prepared by sol-gel method. XRD analysis reveals single phase samples up to y ≤ 0.04. At y ≥ 0.06, a secondary phase of iron praseodymium oxide (PrFeO3) appears along with the spinel phase. The incorporation of Pr3+ for Fe3+ ions results in a slight increase of lattice constant due to larger ionic radius of the substituted ions. It was inferred that the substitution of praseodymium limits the grain growth. The DC electrical resistivity and activation energy are higher for the substituted samples. The dielectric constant, dielectric loss (tan δ) and AC-conductivity decreased on account of substitution. The decrease in dielectric constant is imputed to the reduction in the internal viscosity of the substituted samples. Ferrites have high dielectric constant and low tan δ, they may be attractive for application in switching and memory storage devices. © 2016, Chemical Society of Pakistan.

One very prominent and promising technology for meeting this future electric energy storage demand is the concept of power-to-gas. Here, the excess electric energy is converted to hydrogen using alkaline or PEM electrolysis. Most concepts incorporate an immediate subsequent conversion to methane using a local carbon dioxide source and a process of thermo-catalytic or biological methanation. After a final gas upgrading mainly comprising the separation of H2, CO2 and H2O the produced SNG can be fed to the natural gas grid owning a huge potential for energy storage and distribution. The current work presents the joint research efforts undertaken by the authors in the field of power-to-gas processes. A process chain consisting of a coupled hydrogen dark fermentation and a biogas fermentation, a thermo-catalytic methanation step and product gas upgrading applying membrane-based gas-permeation is developed and demonstrated on laboratory scale. The described process chain has been demonstrated on a scale of roughly 0.5 m3(STP)/h and experimental results will be presented. Special emphasize is laid on the analysis of the methanation performance considering the changing content of the mixed raw biogas. It is shown that the combination of methanation with membrane-base gas separation technology provides significant advantages for process integration.

In chemical plant operations, the demand for utilities, as well as available process heat loads, are sometimes seasonal or multi-period in nature. Also, the availability of renewable energy such as solar, is time of day dependent as well as seasonal, i.e. time of year dependent. Therefore, in order to fully harness the economic and environmental benefits associated with the use of solar thermal energy, an approach which systematically integrates solar thermal radiation with process heat demand and other sources of utilities in chemical plants, while considering the multi-period profile of both the utility sources and the process streams need to be developed. The approach adopted in this paper, entails the use of the multi-period version of the stage-wise superstructure with an objective function involving a simultaneous minimisation of the annualised investment costs and annual operating cost of the network. The utility sources considered include solar and fossil fuel. The fossil fuel is included as a back-up depending on how much of the process heat demand is satisfied by solar energy. For the solar energy source, concentrated solar thermal collector is considered for both direct and indirect Heat Integration including thermal energy storage. In the example considered, a reasonable amount of cost savings was obtained when compared to the case without solar thermal integration.

The location of the factory is important for selecting renewable energy options and therefore three case studies from three different locations are reported. In New Zealand the best option is to use renewable electricity from wind, hydro and geothermal for the factory electrical needs, and high temperature geothermal energy when available for process heating up to 210 °C and low temperature geothermal energy with MVR technology upgrading for process heating up to 180 °C. When no geothermal energy is available the best option is renewable electricity driven heat pumps for heating up to 85 °C, and biomass (wood residue) for high temperature heating up to 210 °C. Biomass production, however, will require 35 % more land than the farms require for producing the milk. In California renewable energy is best met using biogas from anaerobic digestion of cow manure and solar thermal. Biogas converted into biomethane on farm fuels a combine cycle gas turbine with a heat recover steam generator (HRSG) to meet process heating needs above 80 °C and all factory and biogas compression electrical needs.

Such systems are often subject to requirements related to the processing delay, throughput, overall reliability, or quality attributes of specific outputs. Those characteristics are highly dynamic. Assessing them at design time requires some kind of execution of the model, typically using simulation. As the system is often nondeterministic, several simulations need to be run and combined in order to draw relevant conclusions. In this paper, we describe a tool, called SimQRi, that we developed to efficiently run a large number of simulations over process models, using Discrete Event Simulation combined with Monte-Carlo techniques. Their key point is that the properties to be assessed are formulated as queries over the model with a trace semantics. Queries are evaluated and aggregated through simulations, so there is no need to store traces and perform post-processing on them. Several operators are available on different process-related components (storage content, process activity, number of processes items, etc).

Continuous CO2 injection and water alternating gas (WAG) were modelled after primary recovery using CMG-GEM. The feasibility of these processes were determined using the overall cumulative production and CO2 storage capacities. Injection time for each EOR strategy was simulated for a ten-year period. The comparisons were done using various hydrocarbon pore volumes (HCPV), injection times, WAG cycles and WAG ratios to analyze the production curves and the amount of sequestered CO2. The results showed that reservoir had an 18.2% recovery factor (OOIP was 29,750 MSTB) from primary production. From the models developed, immiscible continuous CO2 injection was the most feasible EOR process coupled with sequestered. This model produced the highest incremental oil recovery of 26.3%, which corresponded to a cumulative oil production of 13,286 MSTB (44.66% recovery). A total of 284.11 MMSCF (14992.6 metric tons) of CO2 (16% storage) was also stored. Hence, an immiscible continuous injection process can be more economically feasible since it requires a smaller volume of CO2 and produces a greater volume of hydrocarbons for similar type fields. This is further supported by the feasibility analysis, which showed that the continuous CO2 immiscible injection process would produce a net present value (NPV) of US$ 355M, with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 83.9%.

A wide range in recovery has been documented in the literature and has been similarly observed in gas reservoirs in the Columbus Basin (Trinidad) by comparing reservoirs with similar initial and platform pressures. Consequently, understanding aquifer systems can influence development strategies and economics. An example of this is in facilities design where stronger aquifers should have pipelines sized for large volumes of water post water breakthrough while the more volumetric fields should cater for lower pressures via compressors or eductors. Uncertainties in aquifer support and gas-in-place estimates often introduce uncertainty in production forecasts. Dynamic data for some gas reservoirs reveal that aquifer pressure support strength varies between gas fields and also for individual reservoirs within some fields. This dynamic data includes the integration of surveillance data such as pressure transient derivative and saturation log time lapse data with material balance calculations. Typically the understanding of the geology of aquifers is limited to aquifer size, permeability, edge versus bottom water drive and high permeability streaks. This paper collates a new combined dynamic and static analysis on a number of BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC mature reservoirs in the Columbus Basin that have been categorized from volumetric to strong aquifer behavior. This integrated view improves the overall understanding of how geology contributes to aquifer impact and helps to create integrated subsurface scenarios that characterize each aquifer system and enable better predictive capability in future developments.

As a result, emphasis needs to be placed on ensuring optimum depletion of known hydrocarbon reserves and reduction of greenhouse gases. This paper presents the effects of various injection well placements on the efficiency of Enhanced Gas Recovery (EGR) and sequestration, using reservoir simulation, in an attempt to optimize EGR coupled with CO2 sequestration. The compositional simulator CMG-GEM was used to build a reservoir model with a simple 3D geometric shape (cuboid), which was populated with various layers with properties analogous to a real condensate field to improve the accuracy of the flow path modeling. WINPROP was used to create a detailed fluid model. Using the model as discussed above, the injector placement was varied whilst using a fixed injection pressure of 2000 psi at the end of primary recovery for all scenarios. These well placements included a single vertical injector, two vertical injectors and a single horizontal injector. At the end of each injection scenario, the simulation was run for an additional 1000 years to model the movement of the CO2 plume in the reservoir. From the simulations, over 60% of the injected CO2 remained in the reservoir. On average, approximately 20% of the injected CO2 was trapped by hysteresis. These relatively high storage values for this research can be attributed to relatively small volumes of CO2 being injected (on average 4 MtCO2 total over 5 years) into a relatively large reservoir (estimated hydrocarbon pore volume of 622.5 MMCF) at low injection pressures. The various injection scenarios resulted in as high as an additional 6.9% condensate recovery over primary production only. The results of this simple analytical model show that there is the potential to optimize gas and condensate recovery through the use of CO2 injection whilst mitigating a percentage of greenhouse gases. It also provides a base for future well planning models to build upon in order to effectively optimize CO2 EGR and sequestration in condensate fields.

The land based production has historically been the spine of the energy sector. Many changes in reservoir management philosophies, with respect to improved oil recovery techniques (IOR), in the past, can be pegged to economic ramifications, global market issues and technological practicality. What is for certain is that these issues will always have a cyclical presence, but should not be a deterrent in planning the role-out of IOR projects when the market conditions are right. During periods of low oil prices, when capital spending is usually at its lowest, is an opportune time to reassess how to treat with IOR projects. This paper provides an insight into the planning process which can be used as an instigating tool to create an IOR master plan for the land based acreage of Trinidad. Adding reserves is the ultimate objective but this can be only realized with fit-for-purpose planning and a multidisciplinary coordination of data. The first phase, which this paper addresses, will consider a local historical IOR review, candidate selection with reservoir and technology commentary. These activities would form the basis to drive the first phase action items and spur a second phase of study which would address costs, procurement, execution, KPI monitoring, safety and environment, logistics, risks, contracts, success definitions, approvals, fiscal allowances, technology providers and team building requirements. Conceptualizing the first phase of a master plan was conducted through data mining, report reviews, interviews and simulation modeling. This paper answers, in brief explanations, the experiences of the past and the methods of the future. Technology identification and application seems to be the principle guide that the reservoir management process needs to consider in developing an IOR master plan for Trinidad's onshore oil fields. An onshore IOR master plan would eventually serve as a manual that strives for an effective and structured manner of exploiting mature fields, regardless of changes in management or management philosophies. The guidance offered within should form the basis or foundation of an eventual master plan.

The power utilities generally face two major issues - firstly, power systems are expected to operate close to the maximum capacity, and secondly, there is a need for accurate monitoring and control of the power system network using the modern technological advances together with their associated configuration tools. These two issues are interconnected as better monitoring allows for better control of the power system. The development of the new standard-based power system technologies contribute to concept of building of a smarter grid. The challenge is that this process requires the development of new control and operation architectures and methods for data acquisition, data transfer, and control computation. These methods require data for the dynamic state of the entire power system in real-time, which allows for the introduction of synchrophasor-based monitoring and control of the power system. This paper describes the research work for integration of the newer existing power system technologies to build fully automated systems for the real-time solution of power system energy management problem, incorporating data measurement and acquisition, data transfer and distribution through a communication network, and data storage and retrieval in one complete system. The paper further details the developed methods, algorithms, procedures, software and hardware tools for implementation of a lab-scale prototype of the power system and the acquisition and transfer of the data to the control center in order to allow for the solution of the optimal power dispatch problem in real-time using real-time data. The developed prototype systems are tested for the fivebus power system model, and the system operation test results are presented. The model is developed within the RSCAD software environment and the output signals are fed to the software-based PMU. The data from the GTNET-PMU is transferred to the Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) using the Ethernet. The developed data acquisition, data transfer, data retrieval and data storage system algorithms and software programs can be expanded for use in the power grid energy management system for the economic dispatch solution in regional or national control centers, smart grid applications, educational courses and postgraduate research at universities.","Data Acquisition system; Economic Dispatch problem and Lagranges method; Phasor Data Concentrator; Power System monitoring and Control; Real Time Digital Simulator; Smart grid; Synchrophasor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007236064

Besides, security becomes extremely crucial factor when sensor networks are randomly deployed in a hostile environment. Routing in WSNs is the vital functionality that allows the flow of information generated by sensor nodes to the base station, while considering the severe energy constraint and the limitations of computational and storage resources. However, security of these routing protocols has fallen beyond the scope so far. As sensor nodes may be easily captured and compromised, the classical cryptographic solutions become insufficient to provide optimal routing security, especially, for hierarchical WSNs, where cluster heads can be still among the compromised nodes. In this work, we focus at secure hierarchical routing protocols in wireless sensor networks and represent selected approaches which focusing at this matter.

As result, muscles contract coordinately to produce forces that are transmitted by tendons to the skeletal system, causing its movement or keeping its pose. Often neglected in current muscle models, the elastic properties of tendons play a significant role in the dynamic interaction between the muscular and skeletal systems, influencing the force transmission, energy storage and transfer, and joint control. The aim of this work is to present in detail the necessary steps to incorporate a musculotendon model in the framework of a multibody systems dynamics formulation. A methodology to compute the musculotendon forces and activations is presented based on the use of a Hill-type muscle model assembled in series with a spring-like element defined according to the elastic properties of the tendon. The proposed methodology can be applied, without significant changes, to both inverse and forward dynamic analyses of biomechanical systems. Three daily activities with different levels of musculotendon recruitment are analyzed from an inverse dynamics perspective. The selected activities arewalking, running and jumping. Themovement data characterizing these activities were acquired experimentally in a movement laboratory. A 3D biomechanical model of the human body, described with natural coordinates and encompassing 43 musculotendon actuators per leg, is proposed to assess the performance of the presented musculotendon model and of its incorporation on the referred multibody dynamics framework. The influence of the introduction of a compliant tendon model on the produced muscle forces and activation patterns is analyzed in face of those same results produced by the same biomechanical model defined with infinitely stiff (or rigid) tendons. Results revealed that the introduction of the tendon model allows muscles to work, predominantly, on their optimal configuration as the dynamic equilibrium generated between muscle and tendon prevents the muscle from support all musculotendon deformation. This not only reduces the activations needed to perform the required contractile forces but it also considerably prevents the development of non-physiological passive forces. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Contraction dynamics; Hill-muscle model; Motion analysis; Multibody dynamics; Musculotendon model; Tendon model",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006741544

For the coming years, one of the main agricultural development agenda for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) should be to increase agricultural productivity and production to achieve food security through agricultural mechanization with Agricultural Engineering Technologies (AETs) as major inputs. However, there is paucity of information on the status of existing AETs and their contribution to mechanizing smallholder agriculture which is crucial to effective planning and strategy formulation. Therefore, the overarching objective of this paper is to review the past and present status, the constraints to adoption and future of AETs in Uganda in the context of mechanizing smallholder agriculture. Several proven AETs developed through research institutions and universities have been profiled in different areas of farm power and mechanization systems, agro-processing for value addition; renewable energy systems; and water harnessing and utilization. Availability and prudent use of these AETs along the value chain has the potential to enhance labor use and efficiency, provide greater precision and timeliness in farm operations, reduce postharvest loses, contributing to adding value to products and profitability of farming through proper handling, drying, cleaning, grading, processing, preservation, packaging and storage. The future of AETs in Uganda is hinged on addressing the aspects on appropriateness of the AETs in the smallholder agriculture context and standardizing of AET. Furthermore, human resource capacity development through enhancement of technical skills in AE, increased private sector engagement, economic incentives and innovation protection should be an integral part of the future strategies for development and increased adoption of AETs. © 2016, Int.

The proposed control scheme consists of two controllers, a local controller and a centralized controller. The local controller consists of inner control loops that are composed by a voltage and current proportional resonant controllers with selective harmonics compensation, and the power sharing controller that includes the droop control and the virtual output impedance loops in order to share properly the active and reactive power between the connected VSIs. In this system, the centralized controller is designed to restore the magnitude and the frequency deviations of the AC bus voltage produced by the power sharing controller. Simulation results for three parallel connected VSIs forming a low voltage AC MG that operates in islanded mode are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

The present study describes the installed PV water desalination system for driving water for a small green house hydroponic cultivation. For optimization purposes, the study presents a theoretical economic analysis of two hybrid systems; Photovoltaic/wind turbine (PV/WT) with and without backup diesel generator. In both cases the cost of wind turbine is considered actual and international cost (0.7 of PV cost). Both the photovoltaic and wind turbine each of 1 kW rated power with required electrical devices and storage batteries. HOMER software is used to simulate and analyze the system performance over 15 years lifetime based on the Net Present Cost (NPC) and the Cost of Energy (COE). Also, the capacity shortage is used as an evaluation criterion. The results showed that COE of PV/WT system is less than that of PV/WT/Diesel, while there is no capacity shortage in case of PV/WT/Diesel. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Desalination system; Hybrid PV/wind system; Hydroponic cultivation; Renewable energy; Water desalination",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006304228

We used small palladium clusters to act as the catalyst supported on the substrate (comprised of pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen doped graphene), in order to study hydrogen dissociation, migration and diffusion. Charge transfer and strong binding between the catalyst and the substrate lead to dissociated states of H2 and prevent clusters from detaching and coalescing. In dissociated cases of H2 on Pd clusters, energy barriers below 0.6 eV were found. Likewise, concerning hydrogen migration from the catalyst to the substrate, energy barrier values of 0.8 eV (pyridinic defect) and 0.5 eV (pyrrolic defect) were apparent in the case of the Pd4 cluster at full hydrogen saturation. This indicates that hydrogen dissociation and migration may occur spontaneously at room temperature. This result shows that the interaction between the defects and the small metal clusters may explain the role that defects play in hydrogen migration from the catalyst to the substrate. Subsequently, it was found that thermal desorption does not limit chemisorbed hydrogen diffusion on the substrate. This work may thus help to determine experimental strategies with the capacity to enhance hydrogen storage. © the Owner Societies 2016.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006038158

Brick-shaped specimens were formed by extrusion of clay/”scrap-soil” mixtures in various proportions up to 9%wt. industrial soil, and then fired at different peak temperatures (850-1100°C). Shrinkage and weight loss upon sintering as well as bulk density, porosity, mechanical strength and thermal conductivity of sintered ceramic microstructures were determined and studied as a function of the admixture percentage and firing temperature. The experimental results confirm that incorporation of “scrap-soil” into standard red ceramic bodies is feasible, as their shape, density, mechanical performance and thermal conductivity remain practically unaffected with increasing the admixture percentage. Moreover, the sintering temperature can be optimized either to obtain specific characteristics of the brick bodies or to attain energy savings. © 2016, Procema SA.

Technological pathways to a low carbon economy include improving resource application/energy intensity, or by cutting carbon intensity through promoting low carbon technologies such as renewable energy or carbon capture and storage (CCS). For these technologies to be a truly effective option to mitigate climate change, they must be sustainable and be protective of the environment and human health over the long-term. Whilst analysis of most initiatives focuses on direct GHG quantification, other benefits and potential impacts are often not considered, and indirect emissions are often overlooked. In this chapter, the benefits of adapting to a low carbon economy are assessed, and technological adaptation strategies discussed along with associated impacts to human health and the environment. In particular, CCS is focused upon and life cycle assessment (LCA) shown as a particularly useful tool to give a holistic view of the impacts relating to mitigation options.

With the use of the proposed models of charging device units of discharge pulse generator for plasma-erosion treatment of heterogeneous conductive media a transients in them were calculated. For the ideal charging LC-circuit the dependency of the of voltage regulation imprecision value in capacitive energy storage device from its characteristic impedance and correlation between the initial conditions on its parts was determined. The algorithms for adjusting the charging current threshold value were developed. Suggested algorithms provide highly accurate voltage regulation in capacitive energy storage devices while those devices are charged with a high speed. It is shown that the use of working mode of capacitive energy storage devices for which charge pulse repetition rate is much higher than discharge pulse repetition rate allows to reduce the voltage control imprecision value for such devices to ±(1÷3)% or less.

It also discloses some important information as well as some valuable experiences from the pilot plant operation. The renewable electric power generation system combines wind turbine, photovoltaic, hydrogen electrolysis and fuel cell. The basic design of this system is focused on energy storage in the form of hydrogen gas that can be converted back into electricity by using fuel cell units. The engineering development was done to address the issues on limited energy storage in the battery unit which has several drawbacks i.e. short battery lifetime, limited storage capacity and rigorous and continuous maintenance schedule. To enable remote control and monitoring, a web based monitoring system was developed. From the monitoring system the following information are obtained: the amount of electrical power produced by the wind turbine that was intermittent and depends on time that reached 3000 W; similar pattern is observed from the output power of solar PVs and a maximum point of the solar cell power generation was 640 Watt; the time of electricity production by the wind turbine and the solar cell is complementary to each other in every one day cycle. Two valuable experiences have been gained those are: the location near sea shore has a very corrosive air that damages the wind turbine component, and the use of fuel cell requires high investment cost. © 2016 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Fuel Cell; Hydrogen; Photovoltaic; Web Based Monitoring System; Wind Turbine","Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Investments; Monitoring; Pilot plants; Remote control; Seawater corrosion; Solar cells; Websites; Wind turbines; Architecture and engineering; Continuous maintenance; Control and monitoring; Electricity production; Engineering development; Photovoltaic; Pilot plant operations; Web-based monitoring; Cell engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998723961

The need for refrigerated storage grows with hot weather. The frozen food industry expanded many times in freezer storage in a few decades after World War II. Cold storage facilities are also significant energy consumers that call for attention to thermal behavior as it greatly influences the cost. Proper design to improve thermal behavior of a refrigerated space requires the knowledge of air distribution and thermal conditions within the space. The frozen food quality is sensitive to both storage temperature and fluctuation in temperature. The present work made use of a computational fluid dynamics technique to adequately predict the cold storage airflow pattern variations within the cold room under various evaporator's arrangements of sizes, numbers and positions. Design parameters included local temperatures and velocity distributions inside a large cold store using standard k-e model with mesh element 5,400,000 tetrahedral cells.

Solar and wind capture are most widely used to generate clean electricity. Their availability is generally shifted in time. Therefore, it is advantageous to consider both sources simultaneously while designing an electrical power supply module of the studied system. A specific challenge in this context is to find the optimal sizes of the power generation and storage facilities, which would minimise the overall system cost and will still satisfy the demand. In this work, a new design algorithm is presented minimising the system cost, based on the Electric System Cascade Analysis and the Power Pinch Analysis. The algorithm takes as inputs the wind speed, solar irradiation, as well as cost data for the generation and storage facilities. It has also been applied to minimise the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and to ensure the minimum of the used storage units without using outsourced electricity. The algorithm has been demonstrated on a case study with daily electrical energy demand of 18.7 kWh, resulting in a combination of PV Panels, wind turbine, and the batteries at minimal cost. For the conditions in Oujda city, the case study results indicate that it is possible to achieve 0.25 €/kWh Levelised Cost of Electricity for the generated power. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","ESCA; Hybrid system; Pinch analysis; Power pinch analysis and hybrid cascade table","Digital storage; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Hybrid systems; Photovoltaic cells; Wind; Cost of electricity; Electrical energy demand; Electrical power supply; ESCA; Hybrid energy system; Loss of power supply probability; Pinch analysis; Storage facilities; Cost benefit analysis; algorithm; cost analysis; demand analysis; electrical power; electricity generation; equipment; numerical method; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; solar power; statistical analysis; wind power; Morocco; Oriental; Oujda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997281824

The ISRC consists of a nanofluid-based Parabolic Trough Solar Collector (PTSC), and a Thermal Energy Storage System (TES) integrated with a Rankine Cycle. The effect of dispersing Copper (Cu) nanoparticles in a conventional heating fluid (Syltherm 800) on the output performance and cost of the ISRC is studied for different volume fractions, and for two modes of operation. The first mode assumes no storage, while the second assumes a storage system with a storage period of 7 hours. For the second mode of operation, the charging and discharging cycles are explained. The results show that the presence of the nanoparticles causes an increase in the overall energy produced by the ISRC for both modes of operation, and also causes a decrease in the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LEC), and an increase in the net savings of the ISRC. When comparing the two modes of operation it is established that the existence of a storage system leads to a higher power generation, and a lower LEC; however the efficiency of the cycle drops. It is seen that the maximum increase in the annual energy output of the ISRC caused by the addition of the nanoparticles is around 3.5%, while the maximum increase in the net savings is around 12.8%. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.","Integrated Solar Rankine Cycle; Nanofluids; Parabolic Trough Solar Collector; Syltherm 800; Thermal Energy Storage","Cell engineering; Electric energy storage; Electrochemical cells; Energy storage; Heat storage; Nanoparticles; Rankine cycle; Renewable energy resources; Solar collectors; Sustainable development; Thermal energy; Conventional heating; Levelized cost of electricities; Nanofluids; Output performance; Parabolic trough solar collectors; Performance analysis; Syltherm 800; Thermal energy storage systems; Nanofluidics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997190901

Plans by the government of South Africa in the mid-nineteen nineties to restructure the electricity industry in the country prevented Eskom from embarking on capacity expansion activities when it was necessary. Load growth, as a result of economic growth and a national electrification programme, caused an erosion of the electricity reserve margin, which was quite massive in the early nineties. The large reserve margin then caused Eskom to reduce operating capacity by mothballing some generating plants and putting them in reserve storage. The current situation is that the reserve margin has dropped to about 17,4 percent and a capacity expansion programme is underway. Though the apparent reserve margin is within the desired range, plant unavailability has diminished the reserve margin in real terms and this does not leave Eskom with much room for planned maintenance and a buffer to manage unplanned maintenance, the result being that plant incidents and technical problems cannot easily be absorbed within the power system to avoid interruption of supply. Also, the new environmental legislation does not help the situation, as it has the potential to shut down generating plants that do not meet the new emissions standard. In addition, there have been problems with the New Build Programme that caused a delay, of over three years, in the delivery of new power, and to compound the problem the Energy Regulator refused recently Eskom's application for additional tariff increase, which was requested to enable the company provide the finances to cover the shortfall in funding for operational expenses and the New Build Programme. As such, Eskom faces many challenges in meeting its obligation to South Africa, and interventions are in place to manage the situation. In the short term, the key to generation sustainability is improved plant health, brought about by ontime maintenance and correctly-scoped and no-slip outages. This paper presents an overview of the power situation in South Africa, explaining where the country has come from, the plan for long term security of supply, and the challenges faced by Eskom from the generation supply side in meeting the demand load in the short term.

These DAQ systems are designed to collect, store and communicate large amounts of performance and navigation information through complex data handling processes. It is suggested that this information should eventually be transferred to shore based data analysis centers for further processing and storage. However, the associated data transfer costs introduce additional challenges in this process and enforce to investigate cost effective data handling approaches in shipping. That mainly relates to the amount of data that are transferring through various communication networks (i.e. satellites & wireless networks) between vessels and shore based data centers. Hence, this study proposes to use a deep learning approach (i.e. autoencoder system architecture) to compress ship performance and navigation information, which can be transferred through the respective communication networks as a reduced data set. The compressed data set can be expanded in the respective data center requiring further analysis. Therefore, a data set of ship performance and navigation information is analyzed (i.e. compression and expansion) through an autoencoder system architecture in this study. The compressed data set represents a subset of ship performance and navigation information can also be used to evaluate energy efficiency type applications in shipping. Furthermore, the respective input and output data sets of the autoencoder are also compared as statistical distributions to evaluate the network performance.

The SEEMP enforces various emission control measures, where ship energy efficiency should be evaluated by collecting vessel performance and navigation data. That information is used to develop the proposed data analytics that are implemented on the engine-propeller combinator diagram (i.e. one propeller shaft with its own direct drive main engine). Three marine engine operating regions from the initial data analysis are noted under the combinator diagram and the proposed data analytics (i.e. data clustering methodology) to capture the shape of these regions are implemented. That consists of implementing the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to classify the most frequent operating regions of the marine engine. Furthermore, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to calculate the respective parameters of the GMMs. This approach can also be seen as a data clustering algorithm that facilitated by an iterative process for capturing each operating region of the marine engine (i.e. the combinatory diagram) with the respective mean and covariance values. Hence, these data analytics can be used in the SEEMP to monitor the performance of a vessel with respect to the marine operating regions. Furthermore, it is expected to develop advanced mathematical models of ship performance monitoring under these operational regions of the marine engine as the future work.

The objective of this study was to compare the effects of different antioxidant supplementation in extender on boar semen quality during storage for 10 days at 17°C. Semen samples (n=18) were divided into 10 aliquots and diluted with Reading extender supplemented with three different concentrations of water-soluble glutathione, L-carnitine, and vitamin E analogue Trolox (0.1, 1 and 5mM). All samples were stored in a refrigerator at 17°C for 10 days. Sperm motility was assessed at Days 1, 4, 7 and 10 of storage under a phase-contrast microscopy. Percentage of live sperm with normal apical ridge and high mitochondrial energy status was assessed at Days 1, 5 and 10 of storage by fluorescent multiple staining using propidium iodide (PI), fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin (FITC-PNA) and 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3' tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1), respectively, under fluorescent microscopy. The sperm motility was greater in 1 mM of glutathione supplementation than the others (p < 0.01). However, the percentage of live sperm with normal apical ridge and high mitochondrial energy status did not differ among the groups (p > 0.05). The supplementation of semen extender with 1 and 5 mM of vitamin E had detrimental effect on the quality of stored semen (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the addition of 1 mM dose of glutathione can be recommended as an alternative component of boar semen extender for long-term cool storage.","Glutathione; L-carnitine; Liquid semen; Vitamin E",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995753064

With growing farm sizes, increasing wind turbine sizes and the challenging conditions offshore the demand for remote health monitoring has never been higher. While condition monitoring of the drive train for individual turbines has become common practice and structural health monitoring of the blades is emerging, the offshore foundation is still considered as a black box, with little knowledge available on the current condition. Unfortunately, Non Destructive Testing (NDT) on all offshore turbines is too expensive and these founda-tions are designed for minimum inspection, consequently little structural data is available. By contrast there is a lot of operational information available from each turbines SCADA system (e.g. power output, rpm, wind speed). In the next years OWI-lab is developing an approach to use the available SCADA data and a limited number of instrumented turbines (so called fleet leaders) to assess the structural integrity of the entire farm. In particular the progression of fatigue life is a major concern to the wind-farm own-ers, as fatigue is the main design driver for most offshore wind turbine foundations. As such the fleet leaders are equipped with an array of (optical) strain gauges and accelerometers. In this contribution we will show some initial results of the project with a particular focus on the measurements obtained from 5 fleet-leader offshore wind turbines already instrumented by OWI-lab. It will show how fatigue can be related to the offshore conditions and the operational history of a turbine. We will also elaborate on how this knowledge can be used to improve O&M and end-of-life decisions.","Fatigue; Foundations; Offshore wind turbines","Condition monitoring; Digital storage; Fatigue of materials; Foundations; Monitoring; Nondestructive examination; Offshore wind farms; SCADA systems; Structural health monitoring; Turbomachine blades; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Design drivers; Non destructive testing; Off-shore wind energy; Offshore conditions; Offshore foundation; Remote health monitoring; Structural data; Turbine foundations; Offshore wind turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994747481

However, one has to move beyond the electricity-only focus and take a holistic energy system view to identify optimal solutions for integrating renewable energy. In this paper, an integrated cross-sector approach is used to argue the most efficient and least-cost storage options for the entire renewable energy system concluding that the best storage solutions cannot be found through analyses focusing on the individual sub-sectors. Electricity storage is not the optimum solution to integrate large inflows of fluctuating renewable energy, since more efficient and cheaper options can be found by integrating the electricity sector with other parts of the energy system and by this creating a Smart Energy System. Nevertheless, this does not imply that electricity storage should be disregarded but that it will be needed for other purposes in the future. © International Journal of Sustainable Energy Planning and Management.

A shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy could be beneficial both from environmental and economic perspectives, after the process itself has been optimised and efficiency measures have been implemented. Based on the case study of a dairy factory, where first a heat integration is performed to optimise the system, a model for solar thermal process integration is developed. The detailed model is based on annual hourly global direct and diffuse solar radiation, from which the radiation on a defined surface is calculated. Based on hourly process stream data from the dairy factory, the optimal streams for solar thermal process integration are found, with an optimal thermal storage tank volume. The last step consists of an economic optimisation of the problem to determine the optimal size of the collector field and tank. The results show that solar thermal heat can considerably reduce the operating costs of the dairy factory, even in the North European climate. For the analysed factory the optimal process streams to be partially fuelled by solar energy was found to be hot air to the spray, where the operating costs could be reduced by 9 % while having a payback time of 5.5 years. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Economic Optimisation; Milk Powder; Process Integration; Solar Thermal",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994323888

The main issues of CCUS technologies are the integration into the overall process as well as energy and cost penalties for CO2 capture. This paper evaluates using CAPE design and integration tools, the potential carbon capture approaches to be successfully introduced into various key industrial applications with high CO2 emissions (e.g. heat and power production, chemicals, iron &amp; steel, etc.). The various plant designs were modelled and simulated using process flow modelling software, the mass and energy balances being used to assess the overall performance indicators. For energy integration analysis, the pinch method was used to evaluate the best heat and power integration options of available heat generated in the process. As the results suggest, the innovative carbon capture options based on gas-solid adsorption systems (chemical / calcium looping) have significant techno-economic advantages compared to other more technologically and commercially mature carbon capture options (e.g. gas-liquid absorption) e.g. the higher energy efficiency and carbon capture rate, reduced costs, lower plant complexity and integration issues. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon capture technologies; CO2 emissions; Energy-intensive industrial applications; Process design and integration",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994246795

Though a decline in investment was observed between 2012 and 2013, yet investment in RE exceeded that of non-RE in the excess of $80 billion dollar. In 2014, investment increased by 16%. As developed countries get saturated with RE technologies, developing countries are now the focus for investment. Wistfully, path dependency problem, lack of adequate infrastructure and policy framework have been highlighted as the major barrier to RE deployment in developing countries. Also, lack of harmonised government agency for RE implementation, incentives and educational gap are the institutional and social barriers. Energy Storage (ES) is being promoted as the ""game changer"" with capability of smoothening the variability associated with two RE technologies, wind and solar, with the highest deployment rate. Recent developments are indicative of cost reduction for ES. This paper therefore presents a concise and holistic review of renewable energy (RE) technologies for electricity generation and assess the roles of ES in mitigating intermittency associated with their generation profile.","Energy storage; Environment; Renewable energy; Sustainability","Cost reduction; Developing countries; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy storage; Sustainable development; Wind power; Deployment rates; Developed countries; Electricity generation; Environment; Government agencies; Renewable energies; Renewable energy technologies; Solar and wind energies; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994246073

The mushy zone constant C is part of the Carman-Kozeny equation which is used to introduce a damping term in the momentum equation to model the fluid flow in the mushy zone as fluid flow through a porous medium. The analysis presented shows a comparison of the simulation results obtained by a variation of the mushy zone constant from C = 105 to C = 108. A comparison of the chronological sequence of the liquid fraction of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) for a variation in the mushy parameter shows that the overall time for complete melting and solidification of the PCM increases with higher mushy zone constant C. Moreover the mushy zone constant has also an essential influence on the morphology of the melting front as the inclination of the melting front approaches to the vertical direction with increasing mushy zone constant. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","latent energy storage; mushy zone constant; phase change material; sodium nitrate",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994235357

The lowest yield strength (0.88 × 107 N cm-2) was observed for ZrCr0.7NiMo0.3, which favors hydrogen embrittlement and the increase in the active area. Besides, yield strengths for ZrCr0.4NiMo0.6 are similar to those in the absence of molybdenum. On the other hand, ZrCr0.7NiMo0.3 exhibits similar hydrogen partial molar volumes as in the absence of molybdenum, ca. 33.7 and 34.4 cm3, respectively. The further rise in molybdenum molar proportions produces an increase in this magnitude, i.e. 48.1 cm3, due to the different packing density produced by the higher molybdenum atomic radius.

The results showed that the incorporation of TiO2 in the cover pulls an increase of the corrosion resistance and the improvement of the morphology of surface.","Composite; Corrosion; Electrodeposition; Titanium oxide","copper; nickel; phosphoric acid; phosphorus; titanium dioxide; Article; chemical phenomena; composite material; controlled study; corrosion; electrochemistry; electrodeposition; electron microscopy; material coating; spectroscopy; storage; surface property; X ray analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991813302

This study examined what impact agglomerated biomass (briquette) policy intervention would have on reducing emission from household energy consumption, the absorbed and stored carbon as well as its impact on reducing annual forest depletion rate in Nigeria. The methodology leaned on the human mental databases using system dynamics principles to design the structure and policies for household energy utilisation and forest management (the system) to better serve the people and its environment. Data used for the analysis were mostly those from human mental databases, complemented with secondary sources, to explain important inter-connections affecting household energy utilisation and forest management. The resulting simulation reveals behavioural implications of the system represented by the model. The study concluded that deliberate intervention policy would be needed to achieve a reduction in household carbon emissions as well increased forest stocks for achieving carbon sequestration and storage. It is recommended that further studies to ascertain reduction that could be achieved on the health-damaging indoor air pollution exposures of briquettes in comparison to open fires or traditional stoves be done amongst other strategies to make briquette usage attractive.

In DTNs, nodes use relay's store-carry and forward paradigm to transmit data till final destinations under intermittent connectivity. However, the relays are not always available to assist data transmission due to limited energy or low storage capacity. Our proposal is based on a reward mechanism to sustain cooperation among relays. We model this distributed network problem as a non-cooperative game. On one hand, the source offers to the relays a positive reward if they accept to cache and to forward a given file successfully to a target destination. On the other hand, the relays can either accept or reject the source offer, depending on the reward value and the expected energy consumption of the caching-forwarding operation. Next, a full characterization of the equilibria of this game is provided. Then, we propose two fully distributed algorithms to discover the game Nash equilibria, both for pure/mixed equilibria and discrete/continuous strategy sets. We validate our proposal using extensive numerical examples and numerous learning simulations, and draw some conclusions and insightful remarks. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Energy utilization; Game theory; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Carry and forward; Delaytolerant networks (DTNs); Discrete/continuous; Distributed networks; Incentive mechanism; Intermittent connectivity; Learning simulation; Noncooperative game; Delay tolerant networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989934850

Recently, Fe(HPNP)(CO)(H)(HBH3) (cp1) and Fe(HPNP)(CO)(H)(Br) (cp2), the iron(ii) complexes supported by bis(phosphino)amine pincer (Fe-PNP) (PNP = N(CH2CH2PiPr2)2), have been reported to be the starting complexes which can catalyze the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of N-heterocycles. The active species were proposed to be the trans-dihydride complexes, Fe(HPNP)(CO)(H)2 (cp4) and Fe(PNP)(CO)(H) (cp3), which can be interconverted. Here, our density functional study revealed that the N-heterocyclic substrate plays a role in the formation of cp4 from cp1, while the tert-butoxide base assists with the formation of cp3 from cp2. The mechanism for cp3 catalyzed dehydrogenation of a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) substrate to quinoline (Q) involves two main steps: (i) dehydrogenation of THQ to 3,4-dihydroquinoline (34DHQ) and (ii) dehydrogenation of 34DHQ to Q. In each dehydrogenation step, the proton is transferred from the substrate to the N of the PNP ligand of cp3. An ion-pair complex between Fe-PNP and the deprotonated substrate is then formed before the hydride at the adjacent C is transferred to Fe. Notably, the isomerization of 34DHQ to 14DHQ or 12DHQ is not necessary, as the bifunctionality of Fe-PNP in cp3 can stabilize the ion-pair complex and facilitate direct dehydrogenation of the C3-C4 bond in 34DHQ. On the other hand, the mechanism for hydrogenation of Q involves the initial formation of 14DHQ, which can easily isomerize to 34DHQ with the assistance of a tert-butoxide base. Finally, 34DHQ is dehydrogenated to THQ. As the overall energy barriers for cp3 catalyzed dehydrogenation of THQ (+27.6 kcal mol-1) and cp4 catalyzed hydrogenation of Q (+23.8 kcal mol-1) are only slightly different, reaction conditions can be conveniently adjusted to favor either the dehydrogenation or hydrogenation process. Insights into the role of metal-ligand cooperativity in Fe-PNP complexes in promoting the dehydrogenation and the hydrogenation of N-heterocycles should benefit the development of efficient catalysts for organic hydrogen storage. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Catalysis; Catalysts; Complexation; Dehydrogenation; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Ligands; Bis(phosphino)amine; Catalytic dehydrogenation; Density-functional study; Dihydride complexes; Efficient catalysts; Hydrogenation process; Ion-pair complexes; Reaction conditions; Iron compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989870711

It is widely recognized that such architecture suffers from CPU-memory bottleneck. The problem affects both performance and power efficiency of multicore and manycore architectures. With continuation of CPU scaling (driven by Moore's law and parallelization), the von Neumann bottleneck problem will become even more acute. Another major factor affecting today's high performance computing is the slowdown in scaling of traditional charge-based memories such as DRAM and NAND Flash. In response, many novel nano-devices and materials are under investigation to create an alternative to charge-based memory, namely resistive memory. Such alternatives include memristors, RRAM, PCM, 3D Xpoint, STT-MRAM and others. These technologies have a wide range of potential applications beyond memory, including solid state disks, digital computing, neuromorphic computing, etc. New approaches for processing-in-memory (PiM) have been suggested. One promising technology is 3D stacking, which integrates separate logic and DRAM layers with high-bandwidth, low-energy through-silicon vias. Leveraging 3D stacking technology, researchers have proposed near-DRAM acceleration architectures that integrate accelerator logic and custom 3D DRAM devices. They focus on either accelerator architecture, where the memory system is separate from the host processor's main memory system or the integration of accelerators and DRAM. © 2016 Author.","content addressable memory; in memory processing; in storage processing","Associative storage; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Dynamic random access storage; Electronics packaging; MRAM devices; Parallel architectures; Three dimensional integrated circuits; 3D stacking technology; Accelerator architectures; High performance computers; High performance computing; Many-core architecture; Neumann architecture; Neuromorphic computing; Processing in memory; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989332572

DE strain measurement requires electric energy to run the sensors. Energy is also required for information processing and telemetering of data to phone or computer. Batteries are expensive and recharging is inconvenient. One solution is to harvest energy from the strains that the sensor is exposed to. For this to work the harvester must also be wearable, soft, unobtrusive and profitable from the energy perspective; with more energy harvested than used for strain measurement. A promising way forward is to use the DE sensor as its own energy harvester. Our study indicates that it is feasible for a basic DE sensor to provide its own power to drive its own sensing signal. However telemetry and computation that are additional to this will require substantially more power than the sensing circuit. A strategy would involve keeping the number of Bluetooth data chirps low during the entire period of energy harvesting and to limit transmission to a fraction of the total time spent harvesting energy. There is much still to do to balance the energy budget. This will be a challenge but when we succeed it will open the door to autonomous DE multi-sensor systems without the requirement for battery recharge. © 2016 SPIE.","Dielectric Elastomer; Energy harvesting; Generator; Sensors","Actuators; Budget control; Conducting polymers; Digital storage; Elastomers; Electric batteries; Electroactive polymer actuators; Plastics; Secondary batteries; Sensors; Strain; Strain measurement; Telemetering; Dielectric elastomers; Electric energies; Energy Harvester; Energy perspectives; Generator; Harvesting energies; Multi-sensor systems; Sensing circuits; Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989160943

In this paper, cement-lime plaster with PCM addition is studied as a perspective material for moderation of indoor temperature and humidity fluctuations. Commercial dry plaster mixture is modified by PCM addition based on the water dispersion of polymer microencapsulated paraffinic wax. The dosage of PCM is 4, 8, and 12 mass% related to the dry mass of plaster mixture. For the developed plasters, basic physical, thermal and hygric properties are measured. Incorporation of PCM into the cement-lime matrix lead to the substantial increase of the heat storage capacity in dependence on temperature as well as to the improvement of moisture buffer value of the newly developed composites which brings efficient way to reduce daily moisture variations.

At CEA studies focused on Sodium Fast Reactor concepts that figure out the most promising features for near term industrial deployment. One option is to consider minor actinide multirecycling in a homogeneous way (in the fuel assembly). Unfortunately, the strong impact of minor actinides on sodium void coefficient allows only a small fraction of the total heavy nuclei mass to be loaded with minor actinides in the core (~2-3%). This has also a significant impact on the whole fuel cycle chain (storage, transportation, reprocessing and manufacturing process). An alternative way consists of inserting a larger amount of minor actinides in some specific locations such as inner core targets, radial and axial blankets. These locations are to be optimized in order to lower the impact on the core standard management (stabilization of sodium void worth and power form factor during irradiation). The number of such subassemblies to be manufactured is a compromise between safety criteria (acceptable degradation of Doppler Effect and other feedback effects), mean term ""achievable"" technology (maximum minor actinide mass to be loaded in the core to comply with acceptable fuel behavior) and economical considerations (cycle costs such as manufacturing and reprocessing). Due to the natural radial flux gradient at the core/reflector interface, this particular area seems to meet most of these requirements. In this framework, multirecycling management based on Minor Actinides Bearing Blankets (MABB) has been widely studied as a promising solution concerning minimization of feedback coefficients degradation. This concept exhibits a totally decoupled fuel/actinides management by putting minor actinides in radial blankets on depleted UO2 matrix. It enables high resident time for minor actinides allowing significant transmutation rates. Starting from various SFR core concepts studied at CEA (SFR-V2B and Low Sodium Void Core), scenario evaluations of a 400 TWeh electrical production fleet lead to a MABB solution involving 10% americium content. This configuration shows sufficient level of transmutation performances to be used for the whole scenario time scale from beginning of deployment up to the 100% SFR fleet equilibrium. In radial blankets, fuel pins see a wide range of irradiation configurations because of the typical flux gradient structure, interfaces with reflector and time scale. Such configurations lead to very different behaviors from the thermal-hydraulical point of view and a fine characterization needs to be performed to ensure the viability of the concept along the irradiation time imposed by scenarios considerations. Thank to the rising computer power available nowadays, Monte-Carlo approaches with depletion abilities are the required tools to access fine characterization of such object. Based on these evaluations, iterations with fuel thermo-mechanical properties are presented here to assess the viability of 10% americium content reference case considered in the scenarios.",,"Americium; Characterization; Fast reactors; Fuel storage; Fuels; Irradiation; Manufacture; Monte Carlo methods; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Nuclear power plants; Rare earth compounds; Sodium; Industrial deployment; Irradiation time; Manufacturing process; Monte Carlo approach; Scenario evaluation; Sodium fast reactors; Specific location; Thermomechanical properties; Actinides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986268177

The dependence of usual thermal characteristics, as the thermal conductivity and thermal capacity, on temperature, cannot be neglected in any computational simulation, thus the experimental identification of their effective values is required. Whereas valid technical standards related to the hot-wire measurement technique enables us only certain approximate evaluation of thermal diffusivity, the very similar experimental configuration, supplied by the more advanced physical, mathematical and computational analysis, offers a possibility of reliable simultaneous identification of more characteristics. The crucial application is to the selection of appropriate silicate materials for the design of high-temperature storage of solar energy where both high thermal conductivity and thermal capacity are required.

In this paper, we present a taxonomy of cloud computing systems and we will discuss many energy optimization considerations. Further, our paper focuses on virtualization, migration and task scheduling algorithms to minimize energy consumption in the cloud data centers. Applying a new idea of scheduling algorithms will help to control and optimize the mapping process time between the data center servers and the incoming tasks. This will perform an optimal deployment of the data center resources to achieve good computing efficiency, network load minimization and reducing the energy consumption in the data center.

The Zn/Br2 flow battery system, intended for the grid-scale energy storage system, is to be made in modular form. A Zn/Br2 flow battery module is composed of the multiple stacks consisting of bipolar carbon electrodes. Since the stacks require electrolyte circulation on both the negative and positive sides, two plumbing loops are provided. The flow loops contain an electrolyte storage tank and a circulation pump. A heat exchanger may be included for temperature control in the flow loop. The design of the electrolyte circulation plumbing determines the distributions of electrolyte flow and pressure within the stacks and the efficiency of the stack is dependent on the flow distribution throughout the stack. The modeling of the distributions of electrolyte flow and pressure within the module is needed to optimize the plumbing for electrolyte circulation and thereby to improve the performance of the module. In this work, modeling is performed to study the effect of the layout configuration of the plumbing for electrolyte circulation on the distributions of electrolyte flow and pressure within a 50 kWh Zn/Br2 flow battery module composed of four stacks. It is seen that the plumbing layout for electrolyte circulation can have a significant effect on the flow rate distribution of electrolyte through the stacks.

As compared to batteries, ultracapacitors offer a higher power density, higher efficiency, and longer shelf and cycle life. Because the performance of an ultracapacitor depends on temperature, it is important to calculate accurately the thermal behavior of a single ultracapacitor cell and the module composed of multiple ultracapacitor cells for the efficient and reliable systems integration of an ultracapacitor in grid and transport applications. In this work, modeling is performed to study the effect of the layout configugation of the ultracapacitor cells on the thermal behaviors of an ultracapacitor module. The ultracapacitor module is subject to the charge/discharge cycling with constant-current between the nominal voltage of the ultracapacitor module and the half of this voltage. The charge/discharge current values examined are 50, 100, 150, and 200 A. The validation of the modeling approach is provided through the comparison of the modeling results with the experimental measurements. Copyright © American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

Structure of tendon is stable and the metabolic activity is low, but mechanical loading and subsequent mechanotransduction and molecular anabolic signaling can result in some adaptation of the tendon especially during youth and adolescence. Within short time, tendon will get stiffer with training and lack of mechanical tissue loading through inactivity or immobilization of the human body will conversely result in a dramatic loss in tendon stiffness and collagen synthesis. This illustrates the importance of regular mechanical load in order to preserve the stabilizing role of the connective tissue for the overall function of the musculoskeletal system in both daily activity and exercise. Adaptive responses may vary along the tendon, and differ between mid-substance and insertional areas of the tendon. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Connective tissue; Inactivity; Physical training; Tendon","collagen; collagen; adaptation; aging; Article; biomechanics; collagen metabolism; collagen synthesis; daily life activity; exercise; human; mechanotransduction; muscle strength; musculoskeletal system; musculoskeletal system parameters; myotatic reflex; nonhuman; physical inactivity; priority journal; signal transduction; tendon; tendon metabolism; tendon stiffness; training; animal; connective tissue; homeostasis; metabolism; physiology; skeletal muscle; Animals; Collagen; Connective Tissue; Homeostasis; Humans; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Muscle, Skeletal; Tendons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983445440

We propose a multi-agent architecture to manage the energy production, the peak consumption, and the problem of concurrent faults. Second, we propose an agent-based architecture for an STM32F4 device where a hierarchical software agent is defined to control the environment evolution before applying local reconfigurations for a required flexibility of the smart meter SM. The reconfiguration is assumed in practice to be any addition, removal or update of new services to or from SM such as the energy consumption, the remote information reading and power shutdown, the stabilisation of the delivered power, the management of new power provider offers, the sale of energy and finally the peak consumption management. Third, a slave agent is proposed for each selected home device to control its local consumption, and a unique master agent is proposed to control the whole architecture. We optimise the use of green energy and the consumption costs by exploiting the offers from providers and also peak times.

This is linked to higher rates of obesity. Older age, co-morbidities and obesity are all associated with frailty syndrome. In the core of both frailty and sarcopenia there are dysfunction and deterioration of the muscle and the fat tissues. This overview interlinks the phenotypes presented in older adults such as sarcopenia and frailty—alone and with relation to obesity, muscle function and fat tissue accumulation. Recent findings Observational studies have well described the loss of muscle mass and strength through the years of adult life, both components of frailty and sarcopenia. They have shown that these changes are associated with dysmetabolism and functional deterioration, independent of common explanatory variables. In the metabolic mechanism core of this link, insulin resistance and higher ectopic fat accumulation may play a role. Basic experiments have partially validated this hypothesis. Whether there is a synergistic effect of obesity and frailty phenotype on morbidity risk is still questionable and currently under investigation; however, few cohort studies have shown that the frail–obese or sarcopenic–obese group have higher probability for metabolic complications. Summary Muscle mass loss and fat accumulation in the muscle in the elderly, with or without the presence of obesity, may explain some of the functional and metabolic defects shown in the frail, sarcopenic population. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Fat mass; Frailty; Muscle function; Muscle mass; Obese frail; Sarcopenia; Sarcopenic obese","aging; bioaccumulation; dynapenia; fat content; frail elderly; functional disease; human; insulin resistance; lipid storage; muscle function; muscle mass; muscle strength; muscle weakness; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; Review; risk factor; sarcopenia; age; aged; aging; complication; energy metabolism; geriatric assessment; metabolism; middle aged; muscle strength; obesity; pathophysiology; phenotype; sarcopenia; skeletal muscle; Adiposity; Age Factors; Aged; Aging; Energy Metabolism; Frail Elderly; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Middle Aged; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Obesity; Phenotype; Risk Factors; Sarcopenia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983049677

The MoS2 obtained with water alone gave a graphene-like nanoflakes (g-MoS2 ) while the other with water/acetone (1:1 ratio) gave a hollow-like morphology (h-MoS2 ). Both materials are modified with carbon nanospheres as conductive material and investigated as symmetric pseudocapacitors in aqueous electrolyte (1 M Na2 SO4 solution). The physicochemical properties of the MoS2 layered materials have been interrogated using the surface area analysis (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and advanced electrochemistry including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation (GCPL), repetitive electrochemical cycling tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Interestingly, a simple change of synthesis solvents confers on the MoS2 materials different morphologies, surface areas, and structural parameters, correlated by electrochemical capacitive properties. The g-MoS2 exhibits higher surface area, higher capacitance parameters (specific capacitance of 183 F g-1 , maximum energy density of 9.2 Wh kg-1 and power density of 2.9 kW kg-1 ) but less stable electrochemical cycling compared to the h-MoS2 . The findings show promises for the ability to tune the morphology of MoS2 materials for enhanced energy storage. © The Author(s) 2016.

They were in a poor condition, retained intact their thick corrosion crust incorporated with residual burial soil. Both the surface corrosion products and the metal substrates were studied to understand the objects corrosion process and to obtain information about their chemical composition before the conservation procedures. Optical Microscopy (OM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), and Scanning electron microscope equipped with energy-dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDX) were used for disclosing corrosion features, the nature and composition of the patina, and compositional analysis of the study group. The results indicated that the objects have been buried in wet sandy saline soil or were exposed in storage to an environment rich in many aggressive ions such as chloride, sulfur and oxygen. These corrosive conditions reflected on the patina and the composition of the corrosion layers that mostly composed of chlorides, sulfates and oxides. The objects were made by solid casting technique except the statue of Sekhmet that was made using the hollow casting technique. All the objects were made of Lead-bronze alloy, with a lead content ranging from 5.43% to 19.12%. Different approaches of cleaning were adopted according to the condition of the objects, in order to remove the corrosion and soil disfiguring deposits and to reveal the original surface details. The loose, powdery and thick encrustations were removed by subsequent manual cleaning down to the level of the original surface. The hard corrosion crust on the other objects was stripped chemically with a less aggressive alkaline solution. This procedure was followed by successive baths in distilled water and drying cycles, followed by a succession of acetone baths. For stabilization, all the treated objects were placed in 5% w/v benzotriazole in ethanol solution to prevent future outbreaks of corrosion. Finally, the objects were coated with a protective coating of Paralloid B-44 acrylic co-polymer dissolved in toluene and a waxy coating of microcrystalline wax (Cosmoloid H80) as a superficial topcoat barrier against water or water vapor and to offer a more robust protective system.","Bronze statues; Conservation; Corrosion products; EDS; Leaded bronze; XRD",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981318325

Extreme ultra-violet lithography (EUVL) processes are exploited to print the critical features: 32 nm gate pitch and 24 nm metal pitch. Layout architectures and patterning compromises for enabling the 5nm node will be discussed in details. A distinct standard-cell template for vertical FETs is proposed and elaborated for the first time. To assess electrical performances, a BSIM-CMG model has been developed and calibrated with TCAD simulations, which accounts for the quasi-ballistic transport in the nanowire channel. The results show that the inbound power rail layout construct for vertical devices could achieve the highest density while the interleaving diffusion template can maximize the port accessibility. By using a representative critical path circuit of a generic low power SoCs, it is shown that the VFET-based circuit is 40% more energy efficient than LFET designs at iso-performance. Regarding SRAMs, benefits given by vertical channel orientation in VFETs has reduced the SRAM area by 20%∼30% compared to lateral SRAMs. A double exposures with EUV canner is needed to reach a minimum tip-to-tip (T2T) of 16 nm for middle-of-line (MOL) layers. To enable HD SRAMs with two metal layers, a fully self-aligned gate contact for LFETs and 2D routing of the top electrode for VFETs are required. The standby leakage of vertical SRAMs is 4∼6X lower than LFET-based SRAMs at iso-performance and iso-area. The minimum operating voltage (Vmin) of vertical SRAMs is 170 mV lower than lateral SRAMs. A high-density SRAM bitcell of 0.014 um2 can be obtained for the iN5 technology node, which fully follows the SRAM scaling trend for the 45nm nodes and beyond. © 2016 SPIE.","5nm technology; 6T-SRAMs; CMOS scaling; disruptive transistor; DTCO; EUVL; lateral GAA FETs; nanowire; standard-cells; vertical GAA FETs","Ballistics; Benchmarking; Computer circuits; Design; Electric network analysis; Energy efficiency; Extreme ultraviolet lithography; Gallium alloys; Integrated circuit layout; Low power electronics; Nanowires; Reconfigurable hardware; 6T-SRAMs; CMOS scaling; DTCO; lateral GAA FETs; Standard cell; vertical GAA FETs; Static random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981301296

It is revealed that increase of the ratio of heat transfer surfaces leads to the decrease of melting time and vice versa. Numerical analysis, employing the 3-D model built in Ansys software, observed storage reservoir geometries with variable number of longitudinal fins.

To achieve this goal, we should increase the use and penetration of green energy while softening our dependency on gray (non-environmentally friendly) energy too. In this work we show how load shifting and storage can be incorporated into new energy markets to reduce gray energy consumption. We used multi- Agent-based simulations that are fed with real data to analyze the influence of load shifting and storage to reduce gray energy demand as well as the behaviour of prices for gray and green energy. Results suggest that reduction in gray energy consumption is feasible during peak times, i.e. up to 15%. Nonetheless, if the amount of renewable resources is increased 50%, higher reductions can be achieved, i.e. up to 30%. Furthermore, one of the findings also suggests that storage helps to keep the price of green energy low. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

As result DCs are able to shape their energy demand to provide additional load following reserve for large un-forecasted wind ramps, shed or shift energy demand over time to avoid an coincidental peak load and feed back in the grid the energy produced by turning on their backup fossil fuelled generators to maintain (local) reactive power balance under normal conditions.

However, the identification of suitable rocks to be used as a storage medium requires a prior experimental characterization, since the studies published about the behaviour of rocks at high temperatures are scarce in literature. This work aims to investigate the potential of gneiss rock as a candidate storage material in solar power plants. Thus, thermal stability of two varieties of gneiss rock has been studied at temperatures up to 1000 °C during heating and cooling by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyzer (TG/DTA). The influence of temperature on specific heat capacity, thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity has been analyzed. Furthermore, the chemical composition and crystalline phases have been identified by X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The obtained results proved the potential of this type of rocks in terms of high thermal capacities, high density and good thermal stability up to 550 °C. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Air-rock packed bed; Concentrated solar power; Thermal storage; Thermophysical properties of gneiss rock","Air; Characterization; Chemical analysis; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Differential thermal analysis; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Packed beds; Rocks; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Specific heat; Storage (materials); Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic properties; Thermodynamic stability; X ray diffraction; Candidate materials; Chemical compositions; Concentrated solar power; Cost-effective storages; Differential thermal analyzers; Experimental characterization; Heating and cooling; Thermal storage; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978900578

Carbon nanofibers and CuFe2O4nanoparticles were also prepared for comparison. The prepared samples were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Carbon nanofibers show amorphous carbon structure and CuFe2O4shows cubic inverse spinel ferrite structure, while carbon/CuFe2O4samples show composites of both structures. The oxidation states of Fe and Cu ions in CuFe2O4structure are +3 and + 2, respectively. The specific surface area of the prepared composite obtained by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis was much higher than that of pure carbon nanofibers and that of pure CuFe2O4. Consequently, the electrochemical performances of prepared samples were conducted in a three-electrode system by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The results show that the specific capacitances of carbon/CuFe2O4composite nanofibers in both Na2SO4and KOH and at various scan rates of 10–200 mV−1are higher than those of carbon nanofibers and CuFe2O4nanoparticles. These results suggest that the composite of CuFe2O4nanoparticles on carbon nanofibers can improve the capacitive behavior of the fabricated electrode. The capacitance retention was over 80% after 1000 cycles were observed for C/CuFe2O4electrode indicating their long term cycling stability. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon nanofibers; Carbon/CuFe2O4composite nanofibers; CuFe2O4; Electrochemical properties; Hybrid magnetic material","Amorphous carbon; Capacitance; Carbon nanofibers; Carbonization; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrochemical properties; Electrodes; Electron microscopy; Heavy ions; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Magnetic materials; Nanoparticles; Scanning electron microscopy; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; Amorphous carbon structures; Brunauer emmett tellers; Capacitance retention; Composite nanofibers; CuFe2O4; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical performance; Three electrode-system; Nanofibers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978795108

The phase change material PCM can be implemented in wall-covering material as a thermal storage and to become a part of the building structure. PCM is one of the latent heat material having low temperature range and high energy density of melting-solidification compared to the sensible heat storage. Two laboratory experimental cement samples are tested by using thermocouple junctions at the same external thermal load and outer ambient temperatures. The comparison of transient measured temperatures between treated and non-treated cement samples with PCM have been investigated. The study indicates that the transient measured temperatures in treated sample are lower than in non-treated sample about (7.93% to 9.67%) at the same junction position for the two samples.

It has created serious problems in overexploitation of ground and surface water resources. This issue has been intensified due to population growth and increases in energy and water demands in the industry, agriculture, and households. In this chapter, a mathematical model for energy and water distribution networks in a macroscopic system is proposed. This model considers that the water and electricity demands can be satisfied by the existing power plants in the region and the installation of new power-desalination plants. Also, the model considers that the water demand can be satisfied by supplying water from dams, rivers, and aquifers. The model considers a macroscopic system that involves several cities in a water-stressed region. It accounts for variations in water demands throughout the year, for domestic, agricultural, and industrial users. The model considers both installation costs and operating costs of the new power-desalination plants, the installation of new storage tanks, pumping, and piping costs.

Methodology: The high-voltage converter scheme synthesis was done by the synthesis algorithm with variable structure based on the graph of state changes. The synthesis procedure is the ideal arrangement of keys in a circuit with a constant structure so that the nature of electromagnetic processes in the received circuit with variable structure conforms to the originally specified graph of state changes. Findings: The synthesis of high-voltage circuit converter was performed in accordance with the requirements of energy loss reduce: the assurance of the of IGBT operation modes, which reduce current and voltage loading of the device, and allow switching the transistor with zero current or voltage, or in the case of neutral switching. Originality: A new circuit of a converter was synthesized. It can halve the working voltage of the primary capacitive storage, and reduce the current and voltage loading of the power switches. Thereby, it becomes possible to increase the allowable frequency of operation of the high-voltage converter in comparison with a single-cycle circuit of the converter. Practical value: The proposed method of implementation and the high-voltage converter device can be used in electrotechnics of cleaning of sulphur-containing gases from sulphur dioxide, since the high-voltage converter has better mass and size (by reducing the amount of magnetic knots) than similar devices based on single-cycle thyristor schemes and loses less energy (efficiency of 70 % vs. 60 %). © Lytvynenko T.

In the present work, Li4(NH2)3BH4 doped Mg(NH2)2-2LiH was formed by milling the 2LiNH2-MgH2-0.2LiBH4 composite and posterior annealing under hydrogen pressure to reduce the kinetic barrier of the Li-Mg-N-H system. The effect of repetitive dehydrogenation/rehydrogenation cycles on the kinetic and thermodynamic performance was evaluated. The dehydrogenation rate in the doped composite was twice that in the un-doped sample at 200 °C, while hydrogenation was 20 times faster. The activation energy decreases by 9% due to the presence of Li4(NH2)3BH4 compared to the un-doped composite, evidencing its catalytic role. The presence of Li4(NH2)3BH4 in the composite stabilized the hydrogen storage capacity after successive sorption cycles. Thermodynamic studies revealed a variation in the pressure composition isotherm curves between the first dehydrogenation cycle and the subsequent. The Li4(NH2)3BH4 doped composite showed a sloped plateau region at higher equilibrium pressure in regard to the flat plateau of the un-doped composite. Detailed structural investigations revealed the effective influence of Li4(NH2)3BH4 in different reactions: the irreversible dehydrogenation in the presence of MgH2 and the reversible hydrogen release when it reacts with Li2Mg2(NH)3. The role of Li4(NH2)3BH4 in improving the dehydrogenation kinetics is associated with the weakening of the N-H bond and the mobile small ion mass transfer enhancement. © 2016 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978131794

This paper presents a model for isolated system behavior in terms of control powers exchanged between sources power and loads demand. The model is based on Timed Hybrid Petri Net formalism. Therefore, an iterative algorithm for power flow management satisfies requirement of each type of load based on the photovoltaic panels production and the storage units.

The wettability of wood was investigated through the measurement of water droplet contact angle. DCSBD plasma generates a wide range of reactive species in ambient air. These species react with the treated sample surface and provide a convenient resource for surface activation of wood material and its components. DCSBD plasma activation demonstrated that plasma treatment is an effective method for changing the wood surface wettability depending on the surface/electrode distance (from 0 to 1.6 mm).

This study was carried out to determine biodiesel and its blend with fossil diesel fuel impact on high pressure fuel pump plunger pairs, if vehicles are idle for over 6 months. In order to determine with what force the plunger will move after long-term idle time, six different fuel samples were used: pure diesel fuel, diesel fuel with 5 %, 7 % and 10 % mix of biodiesel, pure rapeseed oil, and pure biodiesel. The obtained results show that increasing the biodiesel content in fuel blend with fossil diesel the agglutination force increases.

The lowest stems (73.73 ± 2.66 %) and the largest leaves (26.27 ± 2.66 %) mass percentages share were found of raw materials, then they were harvested in October. When harvested in the spring, Artemisia dubia Wall, stem weight had increased, and the leaves of the mass fraction of the raw material decreased by 20.65 percentage points. Material moisture variation depending on the harvesting time was found. From October to March, the raw material moisture content decreased from 59.15 ± 0.8 % to 10.98 ± 0.60 %. This directly affected the biological activity and storage capabilities of the raw material without additional energy input. In early spring, removing Artemisia without further preparation, it can be successfully used for thermal conversion.","Artemisia dubia Wall; Biological activity; Energy crops; Harvest; Humidity","Agriculture; Atmospheric humidity; Bioactivity; Biological materials; Crops; Moisture; Plants (botany); Regional planning; Storage (materials); Dubia; Energy crops; Herbaceous energy crops; Mechanical and thermal properties; Moisture variation; Natural conditions; Production preparation; Thermal conversion; Harvesting; alternative energy; bioactivity; biofuel; cost analysis; dry matter; energy crop; harvesting; herb; humidity; moisture content; soil quality; temperate environment; yield; Artemisia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976528128

However, the large utilization of this form of energy is possible only if the effective technology for its storage can be developed with acceptable capital and running costs. Latent heat storage is one of the most efficient ways of storing thermal energy which provides much higher storage density, with a smaller temperature difference between storing and releasing heat. One of potential techniques of storing solar energy is the application of phase change materials (PCMs). There are large numbers of PCMs that melt and solidify at a wide range of temperatures, making them attractive in a number of applications. This paper reviews previous work on latent heat storage and provides an insight to recent efforts of using PCMs in energy storage. This work summarizes the investigation and analysis of the available thermal energy storage systems incorporating PCMs and also looks at the state of artof thermal energy storage systems, utilizing PCM operating with small temperature differences, such as various Paraffin waxes, which are cheap and have moderate thermal energy storage density but low thermal conductivity and require large surface area.","Latent heat storage; Paraffin waxes; PCM; Solar energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976313875

In addition, advances in key technologies such as renewables, energy storage, communication and control have paved the way to new research directions and problems. In this work we attempt to give some structure to the complex ecosystem above, and we present key research problems that shape the area. The emphasis is on the control and optimization methodology toward approaching these problems. The first thread we consider is demand-response where the central theme is to optimize the demand load of consumers. The basic problem is the scheduling of demand load of consumers with the aim to minimize a cost function from the point of view of the utility operator or the consumer. Next, we review fundamental problems in energy storage management. The basic energy storage management problem amounts to deciding when and how much to charge and discharge the battery in order to achieve a certain optimization objective, either in terms of a generation cost or a mismatch between energy demand and supply, which again may capture the goals of the consumer or the utility. We also discuss the market interactions of various entities in the smart grid ecosystem and the impact of their strategic decisions on the market structure. Finally, we study key aspects of consumer behavior such as response to gamification models, and uncertainty due to consumer decisions that influence the system, and we discuss the role of data in building data-driven models for predicting consumer behavior. For each problem instance above, we provide an exposition that places emphasis on the related model and on key aspects of the analysis. © 2016 I. Koutsopoulos, T. P. Papaioannou, and V.

Recently the New Zealand Government has approved a set of milk cooling regulations that must be implemented by 2018. These regulations will require existing milk cooling systems to be more efficient and provide higher cooling rates. In this paper we investigate through simulations the feasibility of using Phase Change Material (PCM) heat exchangers to increase the milk cooling capacity. This is done by modelling a packed bed high conductivity PCM heat storage system. The feasibility of a PCM based refrigeration system is significant as 30% of the energy used in a dairy farm is spent for milk cooling. PCM technology allows operators to reduce operating expenses by charging the PCM system at night, under cheaper power rates to cool milk during the day at no cost. Such technology may be of great commercial interest.","Computational model; Heat exchanger; Industry policy; Milk cooling; PCM","Chains; Computation theory; Computational methods; Cooling; Dairies; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; IIR filters; Packed beds; Phase change materials; Pulse code modulation; Refrigeration; Sustainable development; Computational model; Cooling Capacity; Dairy industry; Heat storage systems; High conductivity; Industry policy; Operating expense; Refrigeration system; Cooling systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975877992

Furthermore, experiences to improve the solid-liquid phase change process were conducted to investigate a technique of enhancing the thermal conductivity of paraffin by incorporating in it a 1% mass fraction of two additives (Aluminum and Copper). The energy was stored in paraffin and was discharged to cold water.

Here, the effect of controlling on-off cooling cycles on temperature and quality change uniformity and energy consumption is investigated with transient CFD models. The quality change of apples during the storage season as a function of position in the room is calculated with a firmness model using the FRISBEE tool. The on-off cooling cycle is regulated based on three different cooling differentials (0.4, 0.5 and 0.7°C). Temperature fluctuations were large near the edges of the stack. A larger cooling differential led to larger fluctuations in the middle of the stack compared to the smaller differentials. Although off-cooling cycles were longer with larger differential, overall this strategy consumed more energy. Differences in apple firmness changes between the three cooling differentials are found insignificant. The smaller cooling differential resulted in a better overall performance.","Apple storage; Computational fluid dynamics; Energy saving; Porous medium; Refrigeration","Chains; Cooling; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Flow control; Fruits; Gears; IIR filters; Porous materials; Refrigeration; Sustainable development; Apple firmness; Cooling cycle; Electricity costs; Long-term storage; Porous medium; Quality change; Temperature fluctuation; Variable costs; Computational fluid dynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975818067

Because of the increasing computing power and the integration of other abundant resources like storage and sensors, smartphones are proving as the most common Personal Information Management (PIM) platform. Smartphones can capture a broad range of users’ experiences as compared to a traditional desktop computer which is evident from the numerous smartphone apps available in app markets for the purpose. These applications capture context of a user by utilizing full resources of the smartphone, especially the sensors. However, limited battery power of smartphones has proven to be the most significant bottleneck. Currently, app-based power consumption is estimated which provide only an indication of per app power usage and is of no use to researchers. This research identifies users’ common daily life activities on smartphones and critically analyses their effects on battery power. Our approach looks into the problem through the eyes of researchers working in the domain of intelligent and context-aware systems. An Android-based application called Smartphone Task-based Energy Monitoring System (STEMS) is developed for estimating power consumption rates of different daily life activities. The system collects activities and the power consumption data from the participants’ smartphones operating on cellular network with GSM/GPRS and Wi-Fi capabilities. It was found that activities requiring internet connectivity are more energy hungry than others.

Practical steps were taken to determine the loading capacity of the dryer. Replicas of the dryer (dimensions and materials) were selected and employed but with varying loads. This dryer is made up of glass flat-plate collector which serves as the drying chamber cover. Thermodynamic properties of the working fluid were measured at input and exit points. Energy analysis was carried out to determine their performances. Energy balance equations at the various segments of the dryer are formulated based on the balances in the solar grains dryer. The results show that energy (specific energy consumption) is optimally utilized when the dryer is optimally (not under-loaded or over-loaded with product). The dried product was tested at the end of the drying hours determine its moisture content and suitable for animal consumption and for long storage period. These results are useful for proper loading of solar grain dryer used restaurant waste.","Energy analysis; Flat-plate collector; Restaurant wastes; Solar grain dryers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971543849

At postmortem, the carcass weight, and breast muscle pH at 45 min (pH45) and 24 h (pH24) were recorded. At 36 h postmortem, breast muscles were excised, weighed and stored in a refrigerator at 4°C to measure pH, colour (CIE-L∗, lightness; a∗, redness; and b∗, yellowness) and cumulative drip loss over eight consecutive days. Chroma (C∗) and hue angle (h) were calculated. The -C had the highest (P > 0.05) dressing percentage and chilled carcass weight, and ML had the lowest. Breast meat fat and energy contents were highest (P < 0.05) in +C and MOLM supplemented diets, and lowest in -C. Dietary treatments had no effect on pH at postmortem and during storage over time. Cumulative drip loss increased with each day of storage, and it was highest (P < 0.05) in +C and lowest in MH. Dietary supplementation of MOLM significantly (P < 0.05) reduced lightness, but increased redness, yellowness, chroma and the hue angle during storage over time. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of M. oleifera leaf meal had positive effects on proximate composition and shelf-life quality indicators of broiler breast meat. © CSIRO 2016.","chicken meat quality; natural antioxidants; plant additives; refrigerated storage; shelf life","antioxidant; biochemical composition; color; deciduous tree; fat; food quality; food storage; leaf; meat; muscle; pH; plant product; poultry; Moringa oleifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971411293

To obtain better understanding of the dehydration of this material, a detailed variable-temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and first-principles calculation study was carried out. Unlike the previous studies, this one detected three distinct phase transitions during dehydration. The fully hydrated phase of AlPO4-34 first loses one water molecule per unit cell and transforms into the partly dehydrated phase I (space group P1). The molecule that was expelled first is the molecule that was initially located within the double six-membered ring and was very weakly coordinated to the aluminium atom and not involved in hydrogen bonds. During the second phase transition a water molecule is expelled from each chabazite cage. The obtained partly dehydrated phase II (space group P1) contains six water molecules in each chabazite cage and four water molecules coordinated to octahedral aluminium. The third transition leads to the completely dehydrated material. Structures of both partly dehydrated phases of AlPO4-34 were determined by the Rietveld method. Variable-temperature NMR and XRD detected very different phase-transition temperatures. This was due to very different sample packing, which significantly influenced the rate of water removal. The confirmation that the two techniques observed the same phases of AlPO4-34 was obtained by the first-principles calculations of NMR observables. Using the XRD-based structural models, the calculations predicted 31P and 27Al isotropic chemical shifts that agreed well with the observed ones. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2016.",,"adsorbent; aluminophosphate; aluminum; phosphate; unclassified drug; water; zeolite; adsorption; Article; atom; cage; calculation; crystallography; dehydration; energy; hydrogen bond; molecule; nuclear magnetic resonance; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; phase transition; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; solid state; structural model; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971324190

Selected markers were followed and correlated with sensory evaluation during the storage. The markers were: DPPH, total phenols, ascorbic acid, 5-HMF, furfural and colour (expressed as L, a*, b* and ΔE). Kinetic data (reaction rate constants, activation energies, Q10, z values) were calculated. The aim of the paper was to evaluate shelf-lives of fruit baby food.

Experiments were performed on briquette samples produced from digestate feedstock with moisture content of 8.2%, ash content of 10.9% and gross calorific value of 17.15 MJ kg-1 by hydraulic piston press with working pressure of 18 MPa with external diameter 50 mm and length 40–60 mm. Briquette samples were divided into two groups and stored inside and outside building. Both groups were subjected to five experimental testing during specific time period from May until late November 2014. Mechanical durability of each briquette was measured after every testing, subsequently overall mechanical durability of specific groups was calculated. Results showed the lowest mechanical durability after first measurement: 98.85% for Group 1 and 98.95% for Group 2. The biggest change in mechanical durability was observed between first and second testing, values of following measurements were approximately equal. The highest mechanical durability was achieved after fifth testing: 99.65% for Group 1 and 99.63% for Group 2. It implied mechanical durability equal to 99.44% for Group 1 and 99.45% for Group 2 in average. Research proved very high mechanical durability which corresponds to the highest category of this quality indicator given by standard EN ISO 17225-1. Difference between mechanical durability of groups stored in different conditions was considered as minor. Thereby briquettes made from digestate are not only secondary product of proper waste management, effectively modified fertilizer but as was found by results of this research it is also suitable fuel with outstanding mechanical properties. © 2016, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

Box 54224, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","Thermal management is essential to compact devices particularly for high heat flux removal applications. As a popular thermal technology, refrigeration cooling is able to provide relatively high heat flux removal capability and uniform device surface temperature. In a refrigeration cycle, the performance of evaporator is extremely important to the overall cooling effi- ciency. In a well-designed evaporator, effective flow boiling heat transfer can be achieved whereas the critical heat flux (CHF) or dryout condition must be avoided. Otherwise the device surface temperature would rise significantly and cause device burnout due to the poor heat transfer performance of film boiling. In order to evaluate the influence of varying imposed heat fluxes, saturated flow boiling in the evaporator is systematically studied. The complete refrigerant flow boiling hysteresis between the imposed heat flux and the exit wall superheat is characterized. Upon the occurrence of CHF at the evaporator wall exit, the wall heat flux redistributes due to the axial wall heat conduction, which drives the dryout point to propagate upstream in the evaporator. As a result, a significant amount of thermal energy is stored in the evaporator wall. While the heat flux starts decreasing, the dryout point moves downstream and closer to the exit. The stored heat in the wall dissipates slowly and leads to the delay in rewetting or quenching, which is the key to understand and predict the flow boiling hysteresis. In order to reveal the transient heat releasing mechanism, an augmented separated-flow model is developed to predict the moving rewetting point and minimum heat flux at the evaporator exit, and the model predictions are further validated Address all correspondence to this author. by experimental data from a refrigeration cooling testbed. © 2016 by ASME.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Cooling; Digital storage; Evaporators; Forecasting; Heat conduction; Heat transfer; Hysteresis; Mass transfer; Medical applications; Quenching; Refrigerants; Refrigeration; Surface properties; Thermodynamic properties; Thermonuclear reactions; Critical heat flux(CHF); Flow boiling heat transfer; High heat flux removal; Refrigeration cooling; Refrigeration cycles; Saturated flow boiling; Thermal technologies; Wall heat conduction; Heat flux",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969820596

This work shows that novel energy storage devices can be developed by using materials containing highly polarizable molecules as poly{1-(4-(3-carboxy-4-hydroxy-phenylazo) benzenesulfonamido)-1,2-ethanediyl, sodium salt} (PAZO). In the present case, layer-by-layer (LbL) of PAZO and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) thin films were prepared and the creation and relaxation of photoinduced birefringence were characterized. These results demonstrate that birefringence can be induced in these films by visible light with a spectrum similar to solar light. Comparing the characteristics parameters of birefringence creation and relaxation, it was seen that the writing birefringence characteristic time, with a value of 1.4 hours, is quite slower than the obtained with laser beam but the relaxation characteristic time is of the order of 7 days. In addition, the birefringence value is proportional to the amount of azo-groups in the sample. These preliminary results allows us conclude that solar devices based in that principle can be studied, namely, the conversion of the oriented dipoles stored energy in power. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS-Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

This paper presents a new ray traversal algorithm for bounding volume hierarchies. The algorithm reduces the required memory bandwidth and energy usage, but requires extra computations. This is achieved with a new kind of utilization of half-precision floating-point numbers, which are used to store axis aligned bounding boxes in a hierarchical manner. In the traversal the ray origin is moved to the edges of the intersected nodes. Additionally, in order to retain high accuracy for the intersection tests the moved ray origin is converted to the child's hierarchical coordinates, instead of converting the child's bound coordinates into world coordinates. This means that both storage and the ray intersection tests with axis aligned bounding boxes can be done in half-precision. The algorithm has better results with wider vector instructions. The measurements show that on a Mali-T628 GPU the algorithm increases frame rate by 3% and decreases power consumption by 9% when wide vector instructions are used. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

There have been efforts to make the global warming potential (GWP) metric dynamic to study temporary carbon storage in wood products. In this article, we test the use of dynamic LCA on bioenergy production from Jatropha oil in Mali, which offers temporary carbon sequestration in biomass and soil. We built a life-cycle inventory for land conversion to jatropha after cropland and fallow land. The assessment was made for one and for 10 consecutive rotations, and yielded dynamic emission profiles over the years. We found that dynamic LCA is sensitive to variations in emission over time, and that it resulted in lower GWP compared to the conventional static approach following IPCC rules, except for early times of analysis. But the largest variation occurs within dynamic LCA between readings at different times of analysis. The choice of time of analysis in the dynamic LCA methodology has no theoretical grounds and is therefore subjective. In the particular case of this short-lived product, we did not find an added value for the provoked increase in complexity of LCA. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Bioenergy; Biofuels; Dynamic life cycle assessment; Jatropha; Soil organic carbon","Biofuels; Biomass; Crops; Forestry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Organic carbon; Timing circuits; Bio-energy; Bioenergy productions; Carbon sequestration; Global warming potential; Jatropha; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Inventory; Soil organic carbon; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968680243

However considerable savings can be demonstrated where companies take the time to investigate their energy use and the specific production drivers that influence it. Savings of over 20 % can be achieved through changes to operational and behavioural practice. Additional benefits, such as improved production tracking and improved maintenance, can been seen which add to the value in undertaking an energy monitoring and targeting (M&T) plan. The method described involve the analysis of overall energy use from utility bills and the visualisation of power profiles to aid in understanding the drivers of energy consumption.

Hence, multi-hop communication is often required when the communication range of the sensor nodes is limited or the number of sensor nodes is very large in a network. In this paper, we propose a multi-hop spectral clustering algorithm to organize the sensor nodes in a WSN into clusters. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs better in reducing the energy consumption of sensors and effectively improves the WSN lifetime. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Clustering; Energy consumption; Gateway nodes; Multi-hop communication; Spectral classification; Wireless sensor network","Algorithms; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Gateways (computer networks); Image classification; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Clustering; Communication range; Gateway nodes; Multi hop communication; Multi-hop clustering; Reduce energy consumption; Spectral classification; Spectral clustering algorithms; Clustering algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964091516

Many systems have to store big-sets: the sets with a large number of items. Efficiently storing a large number of big-sets to support high rate updating and querying is a challenging problem in data storage systems. Nowadays, distributed key-value stores play important roles in building large-scale systems with many advantages. They support horizontal scalability, low-latency, high throughput when manipulating small or medium key-value pairs. Unfortunately, when working with big-set data structure, they do not work well and most of them are not scalable with a large number of big sets. In this research, we analyze the difficulty in storing big-sets using key-value stores. An architecture called “Forest of distributed B+Tree” and algorithms are proposed to build NoSql data store for storing big data structures such as set, dictionary. The big-sets are split into multiple small sets of limited size and stored in key-value stores. A Multi-level meta-data is also proposed and used to reduce the complexity in writing operations of big-sets when using key-value stores from O(N) to O(log(N)). This research can store larger number of items in a set than Cassandra and Google BigTable. Parts of big set in this research is distributed while a row in Google BigTable only has a limited size and must be fit in a server. Experiment results show that proposed system has better read performance than Cassandra. The proposed architecture may potentially be used in various applications such as storage system for data from sensors in the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, commercial transaction storages and social networks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Big data structure; Big set; Forest of distributed B+Tree; Key-value; Storage","Complex networks; Data storage equipment; Data structures; Database systems; Digital storage; Energy storage; Forestry; Large scale systems; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Query processing; B+-trees; Big set; Commercial transactions; Data storage systems; Distributed key-value stores; Internet of thing (IOT); Key values; Proposed architectures; Big data",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963994558

Isolated mitochondria serve as a biological model for understanding the mitochondrial respiration control, effects of various biological ly active substances, and pathophysiology of mitochondrial diseases. The aim of our study was to evaluate pig brain mitochondria as a proper biological model for investigation of activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Oxygen consumption rates of isolated pig brain mitochondria were measured using high-resolution respirometry. Mitochondrial respiration of crude mitochondrial fraction, mitochondria purified in sucrose gradient, and mitochondria purifed in Percoll gradient were assayed as a function of storage time. Oxygen flux and various mitochondrial respiratory control ratios were not changed within two days of mitochondria storage on ice. Leak respiration was found higher and Complex I-linked respiration lower in purified mitochondria compared to the crude mitochondrial fraction. Da ma ge to both outer and inner mitochondrial membrane caused by the isolation procedure was the greatest after purification in a sucrose gradient. We confirmed that pig brain mitochondria can serve as a biological model for investigation of mitochondrial respiration. The advantage of this biological model is the stability of respiratory parameters for more than 48 h and the possibility to isolate large amounts of mitochondria from specific brain areas without the need to kill laboratory animals. We suggest the use of high-resolution respirometry of pig brain mitochondria for research of the neuroprotective effects and/or mitochondrial toxicity of new medical drugs.","Mitochondria; Oxidative phosphorylation; Respiratory state; Respirometry","oxygen; sucrose; citrate synthase; oxygen; animal tissue; Article; biological model; brain mitochondrion; controlled study; isolation procedure; mitochondrial membrane; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; oxygen consumption; pig; purification; respiration control; respiratory chain; respirometry; sucrose gradient; animal; biological model; brain; cell respiration; electron transport; metabolism; mitochondrion; Animals; Brain; Cell Respiration; Citrate (si)-Synthase; Electron Transport; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Membranes; Models, Biological; Oxygen; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963977879

It is important to understand the potential effectiveness of these technologies in meeting the State goals. To this end, scenarios were examined using the HiGRID model, comparing the deployment of 5 GW of fuel cells to pumped hydro, compressed air, and flow battery storage. Cases were run for the California electricity grid at 33% and 50% renewable energy, and each scenario was evaluated based on carbon reduction potential and cost per ton carbon dioxide equivalent reduced. Fuel cell scenarios showed greater emissions reductions compared to energy storage for all cases and lower cost per ton CO2 reduced for all cases, except for pumped hydro at 50% renewables. As renewable levels increase, so does the reliance on new peaker capacity, slightly undermining emission reduction gains from fuel cell deployment. Dynamic, energy storage technologies, on the other hand, minimize new peaker capacity at high renewable levels, alluding to a greater opportunity for utilizing energy storage in the long term. While the most cost-effective energy storage technology is pumped hydro, the feasibility of large-scale deployment of pumped hydro is unclear due to the current California drought and the on-going threat of climate change. Of the technologies studied, high-efficiency baseload fuel cells show the greatest potential to support CO2 reduction goals in the near term, with the grid benefiting from more dynamic dispatch at higher renewable levels. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Compressed air; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Fuel cells; Greenhouse gases; Carbon reduction potentials; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Energy storage technologies; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Large-scale deployment; Renewable energies; Renewable generation; Gas fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962762943

Such patterns affect many human activities, mobility routes, energy storage and synchronization, among others. Because the editing of Wikipedia is the result of a voluntary process made by many independent human beings, the question about the signature of such circadian patterns on such data is not straightforward. We however show in this work that Wikipedia editing presents well defined periodic patterns with respect to daily, weekly and monthly activity. In addition, we also show the periodic nature of the number of inter-event in time. The results of our work shed some light on the activity scheduling present in our society, contributing to the circadian patterns understanding. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961143939

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the bio-properties of four different root canal filling materials with respect to storage media. Two mineral trioxide aggregates: MTA-Angelus (Angelus, Londrina, PR, Brazil) and ProRoot MTA (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) and two glass ionomer cements: one conventional Ketac Molar (3M ESPE AG, Seefeld, Germany) and a resin reinforced core build-up glass ionomer Vitremer (3M ESPE AG, Seefeld, Germany) were evaluated. Eighty healthy single-rooted human extracted teeth without curvature and with closed apices were included in this experiment. Each group was divided in two subgroups (n=10) and stored in polypropylene sealed containers for 60 days at 37°C. Specimens of the first subgroup were immersed in 5ml of a physiological-like buffered Ca- and Mg-free solution (PBS, pH=7.4) and those of the second subgroup were in 5ml of deionized water (DW, pH 6.8) After 10 minutes of immersion and at the established endpoint times, the specimens were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Statistical analysis was performed by t-test and one-way ANOVA (p<0.05). Glass ionomer cements showed the presence of thick irregular deposits (p<0.05). In deionized water, EDX analyses revealed no deposits forming after 60 days. SEM analysis showed the margins of MTA and ProRoot MTA with significant discontinuities compared with glass ionomer cements (p<0.05). Mineral trioxide aggregate cements are significantly more bioactive compared to conventional or reinforced glass ionomers upon aging in PBS.

Natural and human-made open water bodies do not all have monitoring systems, this lack of regular information generates uncertainties in modeling, and increases unaccounted time-bound residuals in water balances. A large amount of water bodies storage variations are not monitored around the World. Here we show that this can be changed by the creation and the implementation of the concept of water Level Virtual Gauges (wLVGs) based on slope tracks upstream of water bodies, correlated to publicly available satellite remote sensing information returning water levels bi-monthly on average, sometimes weekly. An operational RMSE is found to be 12-52 cm height, depending on the characteristics of the upstream slopes used to calibrate wLVGs. This methodology is simple enough to be implemented for all medium to large reservoirs, but is also found successful for smaller rural reservoirs in tropical/sub-tropical countries. We anticipate that this can open globally distributed pathways to monitor open water bodies across the World, improve public databases on water storages and give management information for non/less-monitored water bodies. © Geoinformatics Internation.",,"database; environmental monitoring; gauge; information management; lake; methodology; reservoir; water budget; water level; water storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960324986

Using a semi-empirical study, we can determine the value of monolayer coverage and isosteric heat of adsorption from available thermodynamic data. By completing the semi-empirical study, we carried out quantum mechanical calculations to determine the adsorption energy on the interior and exterior of SWCNTs. Furthermore, monolayer coverage, specific surface area, and maximum adsorption capacity as the main quantity in the adsorption process was estimated using the combination method of force-matching and a classical Lennard-Jones potential model. Hydrogen physisorption was investigated on zig-zag SWCNTs at conditions for a pressure range of 0.1 to 10 MPa at 233 K and 298.15 K temperature. The adsorption of all data can be explained with the Toth model. The results shows the SWCNT exterior physisorption energy range between 1.35 to 1.62 kcal/mol. The interior range from 1.22 to 2.43 kcal/mol. With a wide degree of temperature and pressure variations, we obtained an optimum SWCNT diameter of 8-12 Å .

As an important quality criterion, moisture content (MC) influences the revenues, demand and supply costs. For transport, the limiting factor is payload, if the MC is high. The effects of MC on costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for an optimized supply network have been analyzed using a previously developed multi-criteria optimization model by using different MCs in the range from 50 to 20%. The weighted sum scalarization approach was used to derive Pareto optimal points by changing weights stepwise from maximum profit to minimal GHG on a relatively large scale network of 356 storage locations, 119 freight stations and 228 plants. A decrease of 10% in MC from 40 to 30% will double the profit from 5.10 to 12.00 EUR×t–1. In the case of MC independent revenues, the sensitivity of the model is lower but clearly visible, with a profit increase from 6.00 EUR×t–1 at the MC of 40% to 10.00 EUR×t–1 at the MC of 30%. As expected, emissions will decrease with a decreasing MC. However, the effect on emissions is less prominent than the effect on profit. Reducing MC from 40 to 30% will save approximately 4% of the GHG per dry t. © 2016, University of Zagreb.

Unfortunately, modern buildings with lightweight building envelopes not provide sufficient heat storage capacity and indoor overheating is a common problem, mostly solved by high performance air conditioning that leads to the higher electricity consumption. Here, Phase Change Materials (PCMs) that allow significant heat storage or release when undergo phase transition can find use. On this account, a detailed testing of a new type of cement-lime plaster modified by PCM admixture with respect to the temperature change rate is presented in the paper. The studied material is based on commercial dry plaster mixture that is modified by microencapsulated polymer PCM admixture. For characterization of the developed material, measurement of basic physical and mechanical properties is done. Within the DSC analysis, the researched material is exposed to the temperature loading ranging from 0 °C to 40 °C, with the temperature change rate of 1, 5 and 10 °C/min respectively. On the basis of DSC tests, temperature of phase change and its corresponding enthalpy are determined. The obtained data show the effect of heating and cooling mode on materials performance in the form of a significant shift of DSC curves.

At present it is important to effectively use energy sources because price of energy is more and more expensive. This is the main reason for building of modern low-energy houses. The projected thermal performance of these buildings rarely exceeds 4-6 kW. During most days of heating season these buildings need only 2-4 kW of heat but almost all produced heat sources have nominal thermal power higher than 10-15 kW. Because of this the thermal power of majority heat sources is oversized and using of them could be complicated. One of the solutions of this problem should be heat storage in accumulation vessels. The paper deals about using of local heat source with warm-water heat exchanger for combustion of wood biomass. There were tested thermal and emissions parameters of wood stoves. There was measured thermal power to air and to the accumulation vessels, production of carbon monoxide (CO), production of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and production of particulate matters (PM).

Therefore, a mathematical model for prediction of marine current speed is developed and validated with the recorded measurements. Subsequently, the effect of velocity disturbances caused by the swell effect is studied and a battery energy storage station (BESS) control strategy for power fluctuation mitigation is proposed with reduced BESS capacity. Additionally, the provision of frequency control for MCT based on BESS has been discussed. The performance of the BESS-based frequency control strategy has been analyzed and compared with that of frequency control based on the combination of inertial response and deloaded operation. The simulation results depict that both these strategies can effectively enable MCTs to participate in primary frequency control, however, provision of frequency control based on BESS is more feasible in terms of profitability and reduction in fossil fuel consumption. © 2015 IEEE.","Dispatching capability; Marine current turbine; Marine speed prediction; Power fluctuation mitigation; Primary frequency control","Turbines; Battery energy storage; Control strategies; Deloaded operations; Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); Marine current turbines; Power fluctuation compensations; Power fluctuations; Primary frequency control; Asynchronous generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958118418

The UHI may affect human thermal comfort, which can influence human productivity and morbidity in the spring/summer period. A simple phenomenological model based on the energy balance was developed to generate theoretical support of UHI mitigation in Mexico City focused on the latent heat flux change by increasing tree coverage to reduce sensible heat flux and air temperature. Half-hourly data of the urban energy balance components were generated in a typical residential/commercial neighborhood of Mexico City and then parameterized using easily measured variables (air temperature, humidity, pressure, and visibility). Canopy conductance was estimated every hour in four tree species, and transpiration was estimated using sap flow technique and parameterized by the envelope function method. Averaged values of net radiation, energy storage, and sensible and latent heat flux were around 449, 224, 153, and 72 W m-2, respectively. Daily tree transpiration ranged from 3.64 to 4.35 Ld-1.

Development of more efficient energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, is the key to boost renewable energy production and the use of electric/hybrid vehicles. Electrochemistry is one of the sciences behind these challenging technologies. The performance of these devices relies on the nature of the electrodes they use. 2D and 3D nanostructured architectures composed of transition metal oxides, or their composites with carbon, have recently emerged as new materials with high potential as electrodes for supercapacitors due to their pseudocapacitive contribution and high theoretical capacitances. For application in supercapacitors, the electrodes must present high porosity and surface area. These are necessary properties to enhance charge-transfer and redox reactions at the film/electrolyte interface. One of the most promising techniques to produce transition metal films with such characteristics is electrodeposition because of its versatility and it is easy to do. Electrodeposition is a widespread cheap and clean one-step technique for the fabrication of metals, metal oxides, polymers, and composite coatings. By combining optimized deposition parameters with the required electrolyte composition, the morphology and the chemical composition of the deposited film can be tailored to achieve nanostructured architectures. In this chapter, recent advances in 2D and 3D nanostructured architectures of transition metal oxide films produced by electrodeposition and their application as electrodes for electrochemical pseudo supercapacitors, including their electrochemical performance, are reviewed, and recent trends and results are highlighted. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Electrodeposition; Supercapacitors; Transition metal oxides","Architecture; Automobile manufacture; Charge transfer; Composite coatings; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemistry; Electrodeposition; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Oxide films; Pollution control; Redox reactions; Supercapacitor; Transition metals; Chemical compositions; Cleaner production; Deposition Parameters; Electrochemical performance; Electrolyte compositions; Hot research topics; Pseudocapacitive; Renewable energies; Transition metal oxides",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957039546

The future success of this global effort is under review, and researchers are looking forward to designing more sustainable and environmentally friendly electrochemical energy storage and conversion (EESC) systems. Electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems in the broadest sense have three variants: batteries, fuel cells, and electrochemical capacitors, also known as supercapacitors. The energy storage and conversion mechanisms in these three systems are different, but the energy-providing processes in these systems-all follow solid state and surface interface chemistry, taking place in active electrode materials and at the phase boundary of the electrode/electrolyte interface. Also, all three systems consist of two electrodes which are in contact with the electrolyte but separated by a membrane. Conventional materials used in these systems cannot meet the ever-increasing demand for energy. Thereby, designing efficient and miniaturized EESC devices that achieve high energy storage or delivery at high charge and discharge rates and with lifetimes capable of matching the specific requirements of applications is one of the major challenges facing today’s research community. Thereby, this chapter will review some of the recent developments (2010-2012) in the fabrication of nanostructured electrode materials by electrochemical methods and their application in the fuel cells and supercapacitors.

It was also necessary to have a stable dough mixing torque plateau of &gt;2 Nm at a specific total mechanical energy input of 18-22 kJ kg-1. The resting temperature of the dough was also inversely related to its strength (plateau elastic modulus at time zero). Target dough strength should be about 25 kPa in a bob-cup.

Here, we demonstrate the usefulness of electricity-to-thermal conversion and RE linked to e-mobility strategies to increase the RE share much beyond the traditional self-use limit of power.

We derive a model of ion packing in cylindrical nanopores, and it quantitatively reveals the significant impact of pore geometric characteristics on the gravimetric capacitance in neat ionic liquid, which is confirmed experimentally using a series of sponge-like carbons (carbon nanosponge). With the favourable ion packing proposed by the model, the electrode using the carbon nanosponge as an active material delivered double-layer capacitances of 290 F g-1 (20 °C) and 387 F g-1 (60 °C) with an operating cell voltage of 4 V.

On the other hand, females may receive several benefits from multiple paternity (indirect and directly), and a potential sexual conflict can arise. This research describes the mating systems of an exploited crab species (Metacarcinus edwardsii), integrating (1) the individual level by assessing the mating behavior in a scenario of potential polyandry, (2) the organ level by examining histological sections of seminal receptacles from localities with scenarios of contrasting sex ratios, and (3) the genetic level by measuring the number of parents involved in egg clutches. We found that females can mate with multiple males under experimental conditions. Further, in all localities, we found histological evidences that sperm receptacles stored ejaculates from more than one male. However, contrary to expectations, genetic analysis revealed high probability of single male paternity of all progeny in each egg clutch. In this mating system, males compete to be the single male that mates with a receptive female, investing energy in guarding behavior and foregoing opportunities to mate with other females, all in order to ensure their paternity. However, females benefit from multiple mating (or potential for it) by prolonged guarding behavior, protecting them from predation after molt (soft-shelled period). The mating system of M. edwardsii can be defined as polygamous (where both sexes can mate multiple times) with genetic monogamy. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Decapoda; Mating behavior; Paternity; Polyandry; Sperm competition","crab; genetic analysis; histology; mate guarding; monogamy; paternity; polyandry; predator; reproductive strategy; sex ratio; sexual conflict; sperm competition; Decapoda (Crustacea)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953348242

An eight-year experiment proved that during the long-term storage of dried flowers a gradual reduction in the total content of EO occurs at a rate of about 0.007% per day, which means about 2.56% per year. The content of linalool, terpinen-4-ol, lavandulol, linalyl acetate, α-terpineol, and lavandulyl acetate varied between the varieties. In the case of 'Krajová' the value of the correlation coefficient showed a decreasing tendency of terpinen-4-ol, lavandulol, linalyl acetate, and linalool. In the case of the 'Beta' variety loss rates for linalyl acetate, lavandulyl acetate, and terpinen-4-ol were found. This can be partly explained by disappearance but also by degradation and rearrangement into other compounds, such as linalool, lavandulool, and α-terpineol, whose content increased. The residual moisture of the air-dried plant material and room temperature are sufficient for the changes in such compounds during long-term storage. Only the differences between the varieties that were tested and growing seasons in terms of the EO content and composition were statistically proven, although it can be assumed that the differences in the EO content and composition between determinations would also be statistically significant in longer-term monitoring. No relationship between the initial EO composition and its loss during storage was found. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Essential oil composition; Essential oil content; Essential oil degradation; Lavandula angustifolia L.; Linalool; Linalyl acetate; Storage","Alcohols; Chemical analysis; Energy storage; Monoterpenes; Storage (materials); Essential oil composition; Lavandula angustifolia; Linalool; Linalyl acetate; Oil degradation; Essential oils; degradation; essential oil; flower; phytochemistry; storage; Lavandula; Lavandula angustifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951567006

As no evidence exists of which bone biomechanical properties are impaired in those elderly women who had been exposed to Pb during their lifetime, the aim of the present study is to discern whether chronic lead poisoning magnifies the deterioration of bone biology that occurs in later stages of life. We investigated the effect of Pb in the femora of ovariectomized (OVX) female Wistar rats who had been intoxicated with 1000 ppm of Pb acetate in drinking water for 8 months. Structural properties were determined using a three-point bending mechanical test, and geometrical and material properties were evaluated after obtaining the load/deformation curve. Areal Bone Mineral Density (BMD) was estimated using a bone densitometer. Femoral histomorphometry was carried out on slices dyed with H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin). Pb and OVX decreased all structural properties with a higher effect when both treatments were applied together. Medullar and cortical area of femurs under OVX increased, allowing the bone to accommodate its architecture, which was not observed under Pb intoxication. Pb and OVX significantly decreased BMD, showing lead treated ovariectomized rats (PbOVX) animals the lowest BMD levels. Trabecular bone volume per total volume (BV/TV%) was decreased in OVX and PbOVX animals in 54% compared to the control animals (p < 0.001). Pb femurs also showed 28% less trabeculae than the control (p < 0.05). We demonstrated that Pb intoxication magnifies the impairment in bone biomechanics of OVX rats with a consequent enhancement of the risk of fracture. These results enable the discussion of the detrimental effects of lead intoxication in bone biology in elderly women. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.","Bone biomechanics; Lead poisoning; Ovariectomy","calcium; lead; lipid; lead acetate; organometallic compound; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biomechanics; bone densitometry; bone density; bone disease; bone marrow; bone mass; bone stress; chronic disease; controlled study; cortical bone; deterioration; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; elasticity; energy absorption; female; femur; fracture; histopathology; lead poisoning; lipid storage; long term exposure; mechanical stimulus test; nonhuman; ovariectomy; postmenopause osteoporosis; rat; risk; trabecular bone; animal; bone; complication; disease model; drug effects; human; lead poisoning; pathology; pathophysiology; photon absorptiometry; Wistar rat; Absorptiometry, Photon; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone and Bones; Bone Density; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Humans; Lead Poisoning; Organometallic Compounds; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Ovariectomy; Rats; Rats, Wistar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951155670

Many such structures are already completed in the northern and eastern African countries and Middle East, but many other prosperous locations require feasibility assessment and construction if found appropriate. Two types of dams are common: one built in the karst (for direct recharge), and the other into the karst connected alluvial aquifer (for indirect recharge). The former is very rare due to its complicated construction and threat of water leakage. The latter has more often, but not always been applied with the aim to improve storage in karst, but as an indirect effect of damming of the flow in adjacent alluviums. This article discusses some positive experiences with dams built in northern Iraq, Algeria, Ethiopia and Somalia and advantages of the application of such subsurface structures in several potential locations in countries with a prevailing arid and semi-arid climate, but it also explores uncertainties which end-users may face if the engineering design is not prepared based on results of a proper research programme. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Alluvium; Arid areas; Karst aquifer; Recharge; Storage; Subsurface dam","Aquifers; Dams; Design; Energy storage; Hydrogeology; Landforms; Alluvium; Arid area; Climatic conditions; Feasibility assessment; Karst aquifer; Positive experiences; Recharge; Subsurface structures; Recharging (underground waters); alluvial deposit; arid region; dam construction; karst hydrology; leakage; recharge; semiarid region; subsurface flow; water storage; Algeria; Ethiopia; Iraq; Middle East; Somalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950322650

In daily industrial production of different plastic products we often have to deal with various errors that practically occur on the mold primarily as a result of tool wear and tear, improper storage and improper settings on the injection molding machine. In the testing phase of plastic materials we use many times different inserts that are made from standard tool steels, such as OCR12VM. In case of tool steel inserts after some years of usage a few micro-cracks can occur in the early stage, which can later quickly spread according to the applied loading. With the help of different non-destructive testing methods we know that we can most certainly detect possible formation of cracks on the tool steel inserts. The acoustic emission was measured on an injection mould with the visible sign of a crack on the cavity’s surface, using two contact PZT sensors under normal and increased injection pressure loads. In this paper, we focused exclusively on the acoustic emission signal acquisition by using two resonant 150 kHz piezoelectric AE sensors on such tool steel inserts that are already affected by macro-cracks. On such tool steel insert the obtained acoustic emission results were compared with those obtained from a brand new tool steel insert. The final obtained acoustic emission results on the crack defected tool steel insert revealed as expected that the energy and intensity of the captured AE signals is higher compared with the ones that were captured on the brand new engraving insert under same processing conditions. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Bridge decks; Cracks; Injection molding; Molds; Plastic products; Signal processing; Tool steel; Tools; Acoustic emission signal; Industrial production; Injection molding process; Injection pressures; Nondestructive testing method; Processing condition; Shrinkage behaviour; Thermoplastic materials; Acoustic emission testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949870937

In the model the utilized as well as the collected energy is calculated, taking into account the energy losses by unused energy, energy delivery and energy storage. A main pillar of the method is the building typology that classifies buildings according to roof characteristics and other geometric factors influencing the domestic hot water demand. For each building type the following outputs are calculated: the solar yield, the maximum potential energy that can be produced by roof-integrated photovoltaic panels, the maximum potential energy that can be covered by solar thermal collectors and the realistic energy produced by solar thermal collectors taking into account economical considerations. Based on the model, urban-level solar potential estimations can be carried out with the use of digital cartography at low costs.

We found that only P63/mmc, P3¯c1, P63cm and P63 phases are energetically favorable. The wave-like arrangement allows the off-site symmetry positions of the H atoms, and leads to substantial changes in the pair distribution between Sc and H atoms which are associating with the changes in the electronic structure in such a way that the total energy is lowering. The symmetry breaking from P63mmc is also responsible for the band gap opening. In the P63 structure, the calculated band gap is 0.823 eV and 1.223 eV using GGA and sX-LDA functionals, respectively. This band gap can be compared with 1.7 eV derived from the optical measurement and 1.55 eV from the HSE06 calculation. Thus, the broken symmetry structures can be viewed as Peierls distortion of the P63/mmc structure. Furthermore, we found that only the P63 structure is dynamically stable, unlike YH3 where the P63cm structure is also stable. The stability of P63 comes from sufficiently strong interactions between two neighboring H atoms at their off-site symmetry positions, i.e. near the metal plane and near the tetragonal site. The P63 phonon density of states is in good agreement with the data from the neutron experiment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","A: Metal hydride; C: Symmetry breaking; D: Hydrogen storage; E: Density functional theory","Atoms; Calculations; Digital storage; Electronic structure; Energy gap; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Optical data processing; Metal hydrides; Optical measurement; Pair distributions; Peierls distortion; Phonon density of state; Strong interaction; Symmetry-breaking; Tetragonal sites; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947125476

Fatty acyl-CoA molecules are then readily utilized for the biosynthesis of storage and membrane lipids, or for the generation of energy by ß-oxidation. Acyl- CoAs also function as transcriptional activators, allosteric inhibitors, or precursors for inflammatory mediators. Recent work suggests that ACS enzymes may drive cellular fatty acid uptake by metabolic trapping, and may also regulate the channeling of fatty acids towards specific metabolic pathways. The implication of ACS enzymes in widespread lipid associated diseases like type 2 diabetes has rekindled interest in this protein family. Here, we describe in detail how to measure long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase activity by a straightforward radiometric assay. Cell lysates are incubated with ATP, coenzyme A, Mg2+ , and radiolabeled fatty acid bound to BSA. Differential phase partitioning of fatty acids and acyl-CoAs is exploited to quantify the amount of generated acyl-CoA by scintillation counting.

Depending on the availability of the resources, single energy source or a combination of several sources, including an energy storage system is used in an off-grid hybrid energy system. As there can be several candidates, the optimum sizing of the components against resource potential, cost and reliability is a vital issue. This chapter presents a study of optimum sizing of a renewable sources based off-grid hybrid energy system that is designed for electrifying a rural community in the Siyambalanduwa area in Sri Lanka. The community consists of approximately 150 households with a daily electricity demand about 270 kWh and night time peak of 25 kW. This region receives abundant of solar irradiation with an average of 5.0 kWh/m2/day. The annual average wind speed of this region is 6.3 ms-1 which results in wind power density of 300 W/m2 at a height of 50 m above the ground. The total net present cost of a configuration is calculated for 20 years of system’s lifetime to examine the lowest energy cost option. It is found that the combination of wind turbines, PV system, a battery bank and a diesel generator made the optimum hybrid system having capacities wind—40 kW, PV—30 kW, battery bank —222 kWh and the diesel generator—25 kW. This system can supply electricity at an approximate levelized cost of 0.3 $/kWh. It can supply the demand without change in energy cost more than 0.1 $/kWh even though the annual average wind speed varies in the range of 4.5–6.3 ms-1. Consequently, influence on energy cost for changes in annual average solar irradiation in the range of 4.0–5.5 kWh/m2/day has been found to be negligible. The energy cost analysis of the project has also been made considering off grid operation of hybrid systems for first 10 years and grid connected operation for next 10 years. It is found that the hybrid system is economically viable whether it is operated in off-grid or grid connected mode. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Diesel engines; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Hybrid systems; Irradiation; Rural areas; Solar radiation; Wind; Wind power; Annual average wind speed; Attractive solutions; Energy storage systems; Grid-connected modes; Grid-connected operation; Hybrid energy system; Hybrid renewable energies; Rural electrification; Cost benefit analysis",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946135500

This study was conducted to assess the effect of aging on the restoration process, in particular the aqueous de-acidification treatment. For this purpose, dry heat (at 90±2°C) and moist heat (100% of relative humidity and 90±2°C) accelerated aging tests were performed for 1, 3, 7, 21, and 28days. Fifty samples taken from four restored Moroccan manuscript papers dating to the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries including the Japanese paper used for restoration were artificially weathered. A three-analytical approach has been selected to monitor the effects of weathering on paper components by comparing the results of virgin and artificially aged samples; the diagnosis approach is based on the use of attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (EDXRF). ATR-FTIR spectroscopy allowed us to identify the major structural modifications of cellulose, including the alteration of the hydrogen bond network (3000-3600cm-1 region) and the desorption of paper residual water content indicated by the decline of the band at 1641-1647cm-1 in the dry heat aged samples. The oxidation of cellulose is the dominant mechanism of alteration during the moist heat process. It was shown that the crystallinity of cellulose is reduced as the bands at 1425, 1370, and 900cm-1 significantly decreased. XRD was used to compare the crystal phase of un-aged and aged papers and the results showed a remarkable decline in cellulose crystallinity, as evidenced by the strong decrease of crystalline index (CrI%) calculated after artificial aging.

The detection of undefined attack and intrusion is not more helpful to identify the several kinds of attack, where intrusion-based attack has become a challenging task to detect intruder on network. A skilled attacker can obtain a sensible information and data from the system after knowing the weakness. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is a major thread over the security and most enlarging thread in recent days. There are so many types of Denial of Service (DoS) such as Teardrop, Smurf, Ping of Death, and Clone attack. The aim of the cyber defense system is to detect the main cause of the several counter attacks on the enterprise network. On the way to fix these issues, we are proposing a novel idea that relies on honey pot technique and packet data analysis which are trained by the sample of malware after using the Intrusion detection technique in both ways separately as Network and Anomaly intrusion detection system. Some approaches are not being easily implemented in the network of real enterprises, because of practicability training system which is trained by the sample of malware or deep analysis of packet inspection or depends on the host-based technique that requires a big capacity for storage over the enterprise. The honey pots are one of the most successful techniques to collect the sample of malware for the purpose of analysis and identification of attacks. Honey pot is a novel technology which consists of massive energy and possibilities in the field of security.

A transient two-dimensional mathematical model is developed for predicting the coupled heat and mass transfer within the hydride bed and the PCM. For this model, the liquid fraction in the PCM was described by an analytic approximation of the Heaviside step function which, to the knowledge of the authors, is applied at the first time to study phase change problems. The unstructured control volume finite element method was used to discretize the governing equations and a computer code was developed on Fortran 90 to solve the obtained algebraic equations.

In this work, MF3 (M = Ce, Al) coated LiCoO2 was synthesized via co-precipitation method followed by a solid state reaction at 400 °C. The morphology and structure of the modified cathode material were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that the fluoride compound MF3 is successfully coated on the surface of LiCoO2 cathode particles with an average layer thickness about 12 nm and 40 nm for AlF3 and CeF3, respectively. The electrochemical tests show that the AlF3-coating layer significantly enhances the cycling performance of LiCoO2 cathode material, even at high cut-off potential. While the bare LiCoO2 cathode displays fast fading at 4.6 V vs. Li+/Li cutoff potential, the surface-modified electrode exhibits the great capacity of 160 mAh g-1 with excellent capacity retention on several cycles. We concluded that the electrochemical and the thermal enhancement at high potential are ascribed to the presence of MF3 coating layer which prevent the side reaction during the charge discharge process, alleviate the attack by the acidic electrolyte and reduce the damage of electrode structure. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

According this, the external envelopes of offices and commercial buildings are systematically composed by large glazed areas that lead to high energy losses in the winter and large solar gains in summer. The incorporation of phase change materials into building elements is a growing trend for improving the thermal energy storage capacity in the latent form and the thermal inertia. Thermal Energy Storage systems (TES), using phase change materials (PCM) in buildings, are widely investigated technologies and a fast developing research area. Therefore, there is a lack of publish research reviews on PCM solutions applied into glazed areas. This review focuses on PCM technologies developed for the translucent and transparent building envelope, such as windows, shutters and other shading devices. This review gives special attention to describe and to discuss the thermal properties, the energy storage and the saving potentials of innovative PCM solutions and presents the main results of research carried out on this domain. The most used strategy to apply the PCM into these building elements is the direct incorporation using macro capsules containers (composed by different materials).

Rovisco PaisLisbon, Portugal","Introduction of renewable energy sources (RES) in insular areas is growing on different islands of various regions in the world and the large-scale deployment of renewables in island power systems is appealing to local attention of grid operators as a method to decrease fossil fuel consumption. Planning a grid based on renewable power plants (RPP) presents serious challenges to the normal operation of a power system, precisely on voltage and frequency stability. Despite of its inherent problems, there is a consensus that in near future the RES could supply most of local needs without depending exclusively on fossil fuels. In previous grid code compliance, wind turbines did not required services to support grid operation. Thus, in order to shift to large-scale integration of renewables, the insular grid code ought to incorporate a new set of requirements with the intention of regulating the inclusion of these services. Hence, this paper discusses grid code requirements for large-scale integration of renewables in an island context, as a new contribution to earlier studies. The current trends on grid code formulation, towards an improved integration of distributed renewable resources in island power systems, are addressed. The paper also discusses advanced grid code requirement concepts such as virtual wind inertia and synthetic inertia for improving regulation capability of wind farms and the application of energy storage systems (EES) for enhancing renewable generation integration. Finally, a comparative analysis of insular grid code compliance to these requirements is presented in the European context. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage; Grid codes; Insular energy systems; Renewables penetration; Smart grid","Codes (symbols); Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; LSI circuits; Wind power; Wind turbines; Energy storage systems; Energy systems; Grid codes; Large-scale deployment; Renewable energy source; Renewable generation integrations; Renewables; Smart grid; Smart power grids",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940984154

This study explored the physical characteristics of whey protein powders, particle packing and ageing in bar matrices. The stability of a whey protein isolate (WPI) was compared with that of three WPI hydrolysates. The onset of solidity (ψ) was dependent on powder type, volume fraction (ϕ) and a particle interaction energy (U). Bars containing hydrolysates did not harden to the same extent as those containing intact WPI. For WPI, ψ occurred at ϕ of 0.73, compared with approximately 0.55 for two of the hydrolysates. Bars containing the most extensively hydrolysed proteins did not exhibit an equivalent liquid-solid transition. Hardening was lower in systems in which ψ occurred at low ϕ. Rheological characterisation of the liquid-solid boundary provides a means to better understand structural development in concentrated food systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Hardening; Powders; Liquid solids; Liquid-solid transition; Particle packings; Physical characteristics; Protein powders; Structural development; Whey protein isolate; Whey protein powders; Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940919332

The negative correlation between wind power and solar power is computed and an artificial neural network method estimates the power. The schedule is carried out by a bilevel mathematical programming approach. The upper-level determines energy and spinning reserve schedule by the maximization of profit subject to all lower-level problems. Lower-level problems minimize the post-contingency power output. A controllable degree of trust on the schedule is introduced based on n - K security criterion for worst-case contingency. The approach uses duality theory and problem approximations for a conversion into an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming problem. A case study is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach for power producers not only with transmission constraints, but also valuing safekeeping on the day-ahead schedule to ensure a degree trust on the satisfaction of compromises within electricity markets. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bilevel programming; N - K security criterion; Spinning reserve; Transmission constraints; Wind-CSP day-ahead schedule","Constraint satisfaction problems; Electric energy storage; Heat storage; Integer programming; Mathematical programming; Neural networks; Solar energy; Thermoelectric power plants; Wind power; Bi-level programming; Day-ahead; Security criterion; Spinning reserves; Transmission constraint; Power markets; artificial neural network; computer simulation; correlation; electricity supply; energy conservation; linear programing; power generation; power plant; profitability; renewable resource; solar power; thermal power; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938152497

The model parameter estimation has been performed based on measurement data obtained during the detailed examination of a demonstration cell. A series of experiments has been carried out on a HHO (Oxyhydrogen) gas producing dry cell in order to find its optimal electrochemical, (e.g. electrolyte concentration, current value, etc.) and geometric (distance between the plates) parameters. The novel element is the current and concentration dependent Matlab Simulink model of the hydrogen generation cell. Hydrogen generation enables the long range storage of spare electric energy collected but not consumed or injected into the low voltage grid. The generated hydrogen can be consumed by vehicles for transportation purposes or it can be applied in fuel cells generating direct electrical energy for energy-deficient low voltage network situations. The potentially occurring energetic situations were simulated in a complex energetic system model. The simulations showed that the presented hydrogen generating cell model met the engineering expectations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials with a large thermal mass like concrete can be optimized in terms of heat capacity. Useful for this purpose are Phase-Change Materials (PCMs), which show a high heat of fusion with a melting point within the ambient temperature range. In this paper, the effect of encapsulated PCMs on the thermal behavior and setting process of mortar at early age, and on the strength and thermal behavior of hardened mortar were studied. Such hardened PCM-mortar warms up more gradually and expands the thermal comfort in buildings. PCMs delay the setting process and cause a shift of the corresponding heat of hydration peak and reduce the strength. However, the strength remains high enough for many applications. A possible application was studied, related to thermal cracking of insulated concrete sandwich panels, where the encapsulated PCMs show an influence on the thermal properties in a positive way as they reduce strains. PCMs are innovative and promising materials to use in future applications of concrete structures to promote thermal comfort and to reduce thermal cracking. © 2014, RILEM.","Encapsulated PCM; Mechanical properties; Mortar; Sandwich panels; Thermal delay; Thermal properties","Concrete additives; Concrete construction; Concretes; Cracking (chemical); Cracks; Energy efficiency; Hardening; Heat storage; Honeycomb structures; Hydration; Mechanical properties; Mortar; Sandwich structures; Specific heat; Thermal comfort; Thermal insulation; Thermodynamic properties; Cementitious materials; Concrete sandwich panel; Encapsulated phase change materials; Energy efficiency in buildings; Future applications; Heat of hydration; Sandwich panel; Thermal delay; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916899904
