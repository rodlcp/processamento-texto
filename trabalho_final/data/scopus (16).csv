The experiments were performed at the new VUV High Energy Resolution Photoemission beamline at the storage ring ELETTRA in Trieste. We obtained the values ΔEIn 4d=-0.32 eV and ΔEP 2p=0.31 eV for the surface core level shifts of Indium and Phosphorous in InP(110), while the shifts for Ga 3d and P 2p in GaP(110) were -0.30 eV and 0.40 eV respectively. These results are discussed in terms of a simple model based on the difference between bulk and surface Madelung potentials. © 1995.",,"Approximation theory; Calculations; Electron energy levels; Mathematical models; Photoemission; Semiconducting gallium compounds; Semiconducting indium phosphide; Storage rings; Surfaces; High energy resolution photoemission; Madelung potentials; Surface core level shifts; Photoelectron spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029488611

V0.9Ti0.1 alloy powder has been sintered with Ni powder to provide a catalytic effect on the absorption/desorption of hydrogen in KOH electrolyte. The optimal sintering condition was 5 min at 900°C and the amounts of Ni powder were varied to investigate the effects of surface modification on the discharge characteristics. All electrodes sintered with Ni powder were fully activated within 10 cycles in KOH electrolyte. The discharge capacities of the electrodes showed a maximum behavior with Ni content of the sintered alloy. The optimal amount of Ni powder showing the highest discharge capacity of 302 mA h g-1 was found to be 25 wt.%. From the results of the various analysis such as scanning electron microscopy (energy dispersive spectroscopy) and X-ray, it is found that VNi3 is formed during sintering. The VNi3 phase formed on the surface of V0.9Ti0.1 particles provides the optimum discharge capacity for the electrode. In accordance with the Brewer-Engel theory, VNi3 phases are found to be highly electrocatalytic, which is reflected in an increase of the exchange current density and a decrease of the discharging overpotential. In order to develop an anode material using metal hydride which has a large hydrogen storage capacity but is inactive for electrochemical hydrogenation, it has been suggested as a new process to modify the surface by sintering with Ni powder. © 1995.","Electrode; Modification; Nickel; Sintering; Surface","Electric discharges; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Gas absorption; Hydrogen; Scanning electron microscopy; Secondary batteries; Sintering; Spectroscopic analysis; Surface treatment; X ray analysis; Discharging overpotential; Hydrogen storage capacity; Optimum discharge capacity; Vanadium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029536016

It was found that the maximum discharge capacity reached 343 mA h g-1, the discharge capacity ratio at a discharge rate of 200-50 mA g-1 was more than 80%, the number of activation cycles is less than 13 and the self-discharge ratio after 2 weeks varied between 16.1 and 53.1%. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis tests showed that the as-cast Zr-based Laves phase alloy consisted of at least eight phases. The major cubic C15-type Laves phase coexisted with the hexagonal C14-type Laves phase, orthorhombic Zr7Ni10 phase, tetragonal, Zr9Ni11 phase and a few other phases. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy proved that Zr and Mn were richer in the outer layer of the Zr-based Laves phase hydride electrode; Ni and Cr were deficient on the surface of the electrode. After 540 charging-discharging cycles, the discharge capacities of the Zr-based Laves phase hydride electrodes decreased by 20-30%. This was mainly caused by the formation of oxides at the surface of the electrodes. © 1995.","Electrochemical properties; Hydride electrode; Laves phases","Chemical activation; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Hydrides; Phase transitions; Scanning electron microscopy; Surfaces; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Discharge capacity; Energy dispersive X ray analysis; Hydrogen storage alloys; Laves phase alloys; Zirconium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029536014

The total overvoltage (η) for the hydrogen evolution reaction was divided into two components (η1 and η2) corresponding to the Volmer and the Tafel reactions. The exchange current densities of the elementary reactions (iOV and iOT) were then evaluated by extrapolating the Tafel lines for η1 and η2.

The respective reversible hydrogen capacities as a function of the number of cycles were determined for the selected cycling conditions. Regeneration conditions were determined when applicable. Various investigations (pressure-composition isotherms, thermal desorption spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffractometry, magnetization, laser granulometry, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray analysis) were performed in order to determine the degradation and regeneration mechanisms involved. The reversible storage capacity of the AB5 alloys decayed during cycling. This effect is stronger at higher temperatures and pressures. However, the original capacity of all four materials could be recovered by heating to about 400-500 °C in vacuum. Disproportionation was found to be the degradation mechanism for the AB5 alloys. The AB2 alloy showed no degradation after 42 400 cycles.

The goal of this programme was to obtain a better understanding of the technical and economic feasibility of the recovery of CO 2 from flue gases and synthesis gases and the sustainable storage of CO 2 outside the atmosphere. As far as CO 2 recovery from power plants is concerned, options based on coal gasification with CO 2 recovery turn out to be most energy- efficient. Of the remaining recovery options chemical absorption from flue gases, using amines, seems most promising. A number of recovery options based on membrane technologies have been identified, but most of them still require considerable development. In manufacturing industry, attractive options for CO 2 recovery are available in refineries equipped with residue gasification, and in the ammonia fertilizer industry. More costly options were identified in the iron and steel industry and in the petrochemical industry. CO 2 storage in aquifers is technically feasible. When injecting CO 2 in aquifers part of the water already present will be displaced. The main mechanisms for this displacement will be gravity segregation and viscous fingering, as was shown by simulation calculations. The Dutch subsurface contains a large number of aquifers that are potentially suitable for CO 2 storage. © 1995 Elsevier B.V.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957079970

The project was approved by the Chinese government at the end of 1983, and was completed in 1989. The Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory was founded in July of 1985, and the construction of the first beam line was completed in 1989. The first phase construction of BSRF was finished in 1991; three beam ports, seven beam lines, and nine experimental stations were constructed. Since 1991, BSRF has been opened to users from all over the country. The description of the beam lines and experimental stations and present research activities is given in this paper.

At the moment (July 1994) a new storage ring MAX II is near completion and will start first injections within 2 months. This work gives an overview of the MAX II project including the first beamlines and a description of the accelerator system. MAX II is a 1.5 GeV third generation light source optimized for the VUV and soft-x-ray region. It consists of a ten cell double bend achromat lattice forming the 90 m circumference ring. Injection is done at 500 MeV from the existing storage ring MAX I, and ramping up to full energy will take place in MAX II. The straight sections have a length of 3.2 m and eight sections are free to house insertion devices. At start up the ring will be equipped with one 7.5 T superconducting wiggler and one 1.8 T multipole wiggler. Two more undulators are ordered and under construction. To be able to achieve the project a few shortcuts have been made in the design of the storage ring: (1) Nonzero dispersion is allowed in the straight sections, (2) chromaticity correction is built into the quadrupole magnets, and (3) the length of the straight sections is limited to 3.2 m. The project is progressing on time. Extraction of an electron beam from the MAX I storage ring has been achieved and has successfully been transported into the MAX II building. The MAX II ring is under assembly with most of the sections already mounted.

General stability results from stochastic programming yield the asymptotic stability of optimal solutions. Kernel estimates lead to favourable numerical properties of the recourse model (no numerical integration, the optimization problem is smooth convex and of moderate dimension).

This phenomenon occurs in nature and in industrial processes, best known in the storage of liquefied natural gas (LNG). This study models the process by numerically solving the transient momentum, energy, and mass transfer equations for a binary solution in a cylindrical enclosure. Initially the fluid is stably stratified with the upper layer having a higher concentration of the lighter component. Heating through the walls is then applied, resulting in buoyancy-driven convection accompanied by heat and mass transfer, and often finally in rollover. Computations are performed for a Prandtl number of 30, Schmidt number of 5500 and for the range of modified thermal Rayleigh numbers of (1.64)109≤Ra*T≤(9.02)109 and solutal Rayleigh numbers of (4.415)109≤Ras≤(1.776)1010. As expected, the tendency to rollover increases with increasing Ra*T and decreases with increasing Ras. The most important mechanism which triggers rollover is buoyancy-driven penetration of the lower liquid into the upper layer along the heated side wall. The basic phenomena in the cylindrical and rectangular enclosures were found to be similar, but the interface descent velocity and the intensity of mixing in the cylindrical enclosure are higher, resulting in somewhat different times to onset of rollover.",,"Calculations; Enclosures; Fluids; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Natural convection; Numerical analysis; Prandtl number; Thermal conductivity; Thermal stratification; Cylindrical enclosures; Double diffusive rollover; Rayleigh numbers; Schmidt number; Thermodynamic stability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18144433328

We have developed a numerical technique for analyzing this transient flux motion along with the temporal variation of current density and magnetic field.

The milling process was monitored by x-ray diffraction, high-field magnetization, ac magnetic susceptibility, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was found that antisite disorder is generated in the early stages of milling and a phase transformation from the disordered L12 compound to the disordered fcc solid solution of Al in Ni was observed after milling for long periods. Partial amorphization occurs after prolonged periods of milling. The long-range-order parameter decreases monotonously with time in the early stages of milling and attains a zero value after relatively short periods of milling. The lattice parameter and the relative strain increase with milling time. Magnetic properties of ball-milled Ni3Al at 4.2 K differ markedly from those of the ordered state. Based on the magnetic data, it is concluded that short-range disordering could be the third source of energy storage during milling of Ni3Al.

The storage rings serve as broadband primary standard sources for the development of a source-based radiometry and as sources of tuneable monochromatic photon fluxes for the development of a detector-based radiometry in combination with primary standard detectors. The state of the art is briefly summarized based on results obtained at the Berlin storage ring BESSY I (maximum electron energy 850 MeV), which was optimized for radiometry from the outset. Further progress in radiometry is expected at the future storage ring BESSY II (start of operation in 1998). At this third-generation storage ring (maximum electron energy 1,9 GeV) radiation from undulators, wigglers and wavelength shifters will be used for radiometry in addition to traditional synchrotron radiation from bending magnets. Furthermore, there are prospects at BESSY II to extend radiometry into the γ-ray range with photon energies in the MeV region by scattering laser and undulator photons at stored relativistic electrons.",,"Bending magnets; Detector based radiometry; Electron storage rings; Photon energies; Source based radiometry; Undulators; Wavelength shifters; Wigglers; Accelerator magnets; Electron beams; Electrons; Particle detectors; Photons; Storage rings; Synchrotron radiation; Radiometry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030148118

The concentration of adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP) and their degradation products in the kidney tissue were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The study showed that the amount of ATP and AMP decreases in the ischemically damaged kidneys tissue during 24 hours of hypothermic preservation. Kidneys preserved in the simple cold storage showed an increase of adenine nucleotide degradation products and nucleotide pool, in contrast hypothermic machine perfusion resulted in a flushing of the degradation products subsequently a decrease in the nucleotide pool.

Applied in a motor-generator set, pole writing allows the generator to produce high quality constant frequency output at variable speed. The motor efficiently operates its own high inertial energy rotor as a flywheel energy storage device. The M-G set provides continuous on-line isolation between the electrical distribution system and load. It also rides through blackouts of 15 seconds or more while supplying full load at exact frequency and regulated voltage. Rotating flywheel energy is used, thereby eliminating the need for batteries for uninterruptible power. Power quality is also improved for the electrical distribution system because the generator prevents harmonic feedback. The motor is a unity power factor load with negligible harmonics and has added advantages of high efficiency and very low inrush current during across-the-line starts. Mechanical loads such as pumps and fans can be driven by written-pole motors. These can also have advantages of load ride-through during momentary power interruptions and can instantly restart. Additionally, low starting current significantly reduces voltage sags on the distribution system, improving power quality. Such motors are being developed in single-phase with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and member utilities.

Anaesthesia and surgical intervention cause stress conditions. The stress is accompanied by the alteration of hormone states and energy processes. Carnitine, which physiologically promotes the fatty acid metabolism and so plays a very important role for the heart, can be involved in these alterations. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of anaesthesia and surgical intervention on carnitine distribution in the tissues. Rats were anaesthetized with thiopental and surgical intervention was performed on the femoral artery and vein. Carnitine levels, as well as parameters indicative of energy metabolism, were measured in the blood and tissues. It was found that anaesthesia and surgical intervention increased the corticosterone levels in blood and decreased the carnitine levels in blood and kidney. Carnitine accumulated in the liver, whereas in heart and skeletal muscle it was redistributed by a decrease in the acylated form and an increase in the free form. Glycogen was accumulated in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Compared to anaesthesia, the surgical intervention increased glycogen storage and carnitine redistribution in heart and skeletal muscle. Moreover, it caused a decrease in cholesterol and an increase in urea in the blood. The fall in blood and kidney carnitine levels indicates a possible depletion of carnitine. The deacylation of carnitine in heart and skeletal muscle represents an important alteration in heart and muscle energetic metabolism. The increase in urea is a consequence of high proteolysis. Acylcarnitine administration during pre- and operative step might prevent the loss of carnitine, promoting the heart energetic metabolism and reducing the proteolysis. Moreover, in accordance with a recent interpretation of carnitine action as a membrane-stabilizing agent, the acylcarnitine supply could reduce the risk of 'oedema' that follows the anaesthesia and surgical intervention.",,"anesthetic agent; carnitine; thiopental; amino acid analysis; amino acid metabolism; anesthesia induction; animal experiment; animal model; article; deacylation; femoral artery; femoral vein; intraperitoneal drug administration; male; nonhuman; rat; tissue distribution; vascular surgery; Anesthetics, Intravenous; Animals; Carnitine; Corticosterone; Femoral Artery; Femoral Vein; Glucose; Kidney; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Myocardium; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Stress; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Thiopental",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029537470

Not only would it eliminate peaking generation and simplify generator scheduling, but it would also produce a single daily tariff and allow easier financial planning for power system development. The Electricity Supply Industry would incur capital and operating expenditures for the entire power network and additional generators of $6000 to $7000 for each kW of peak demand growth.

The OK-4 FEL has arrived at the Duke FEL Laboratory from Novosibirsk and is in the process of installation. High average intracavity power and natural synchronization of electron and optical pulses in the OK-4 FEL allow the production of intense inverse Compton γ-rays (5-150 MeV) on the return pass of the optical pulse. The projected intensity of this γ-ray source allows high energy resolution with simple geometric collimation of the γ-rays. The wide tunability of the OK-4 FEL also allows us to control the γ-ray energy.

Every plant component (compressor, combustion chamber, turbine) has been included as a block, when considering the evolving flow subjected to mass, momentum and energy storage, building in this way a mathematical model made of 13 first order ordinary differential equations and 26 algebraic equations. The turbomachinery characteristics are represented as polynomial curves: the compressor flow and efficiency maps are given for selected inlet guide vane (IGV) opening values. For the dynamic study, the thermo-fluid-dynamic upstream and downstream conditions have been evaluated for each block, choosing proper status variables. Significant results are obtained by analysing, after the linearization (done for many different operating points and utilising also an original method), the four most important transfer functions for plant control, which link the rotational speed and exhaust temperature with fuel flow and IGV opening angle. From the results, one can see that the quasi-linearity of the real system is not checked for any transfer function; this occurrence has to be considered when using the linearized model for setting up the control system (for instance, in the rpm-IGV angle transfer function the static gain sign is variable with the operating point).",,"Compressors; Control systems; Differential equations; Flow of fluids; Frequency domain analysis; Linearization; Mathematical models; Nozzles; Polynomials; Time domain analysis; Transfer functions; Turbomachinery; Nonlinear lumped parameters model; Thermo-fluid-dynamic stream conditions; Variable inlet guide vane; Gas turbine power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029529401

The present worldwide energy consumption already exceeds the level of 6000 gigawatt and is expected to further increase sharply. This implies enhanced depletion of fossil fuel reserves, leading to further aggravation of the environmental pollution. Adding to this the dangers arising from the accumulation of plutonium fission products from nuclear reactors, the quality of life on earth is threatened unless renewable energy resources can be quickly developed. Photovoltaic solar energy converters are expected to make important contributions to the identification of environmentally friendly solutions to the energy problem. One attractive strategy discussed in this paper is the development of systems that mimic natural photosynthesis in the conversion of solar energy for the fixation of carbon dioxide. We have developed a molecular photovoltaic device whose overall efficiency for solar energy conversion to electricity has already attained 10%. The system is based on the sensitization of nanocrystalline films by transition metal charge transfer sensitizers. In analogy to photosynthesis, the new chemical solar cell achieves the separation of the light absorption and charge carrier transport processes. Extraordinary yields exceeding 90% for the conversion of incident photons into electric current are obtained, in contrast to conventional photovoltaic cells which are not economical for base load utility electricity production. The low cost and ease of production of the new cell should benefit large-scale applications, in particular in underdeveloped or developing countries, which benefit from generous sunshine. Aside from its intrinsic merits as a photovoltaic device, nanocrystalline film development opens up a large number of additional avenues for energy storage ranging from intercalation batteries to the formation of chemical fuels. These systems will undoubtedly promote the acceptance of renewable energy technologies, not least by setting new standards of convenience and economy. © 1995 Indian Academy of Sciences.","Light energy conversion; nanocrystalline solar cells","Charge carriers; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Nanostructured materials; Nuclear reactors; Plutonium; Pollution; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Charge carrier transport; Charge transfer sensitizer; Nanocrystalline solar cells; Photovoltaic conversion; Photovoltaic solar energy converters; Sensitization; Solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029517775

The local variation of polarisability due to crystal defects is responsible for trapping charges. In polycrystalline ceramics, point and extended defects, grain boundaries or impurities are sites of trapping charges. The charge detrapping can be initiated by any perturbation and corresponds to the free energy minimization occurring when an activation barrier height is reached. Any kind of variation (for example electrical, mechanical or thermal variation) contributes to approach this barrier. So a soft relaxation of a charged dielectric can be obtained by annealing the sample with slow heating rates to avoid a rapid destabilization of the space charge leading to inevitable breakdown.

FERAMS can be written at high speeds (≈100 ns) and at standard supply voltages 95 V or less) without the use of charge pumps. Switching of ferroelectric capacitors at voltages of 1.5 V or below has been demonstrated. FERAMS also have a high endurance for writes (&gt;1012 cycles demonstrated). The combination of high-speed and low-voltage writing means a FERAM requires far less energy to program than a EEPROM. However, FERAMs use a destructive read followed by a rewrite so that endurance limits also apply to reading. Other reliability concerns include retention (loss of data with time) and imprint (loss of ability to write into the opposite state).

Two major design requirements are a high fuel input per unit combustion chamber volume and complete burn-out of the fuel. In order to realize these goals, a cyclone combustor has been chosen. As a first step in the development of the combustor, the flow structure of the non-reacting flow field was analyzed. The 3-D and 2-D calculations are based on a finite volume formulation. The standard κ - ε model and a Reynolds-stress model are used to account for the turbulent flow. Basically the flow field is three dimensional and the complexity of the flow field requires a fine discretization in axial and radial direction. However, gradients in circumferential direction are very strong only in some regions. Based on 3-D calculations, it is shown how the boundary conditions for a reduction to a 2-D problem should be chosen. This simplification results in a reduction of calculation time and storage requirements. Nevertheless, the 2-D calculations are in good agreement with the 3-D calculation.",,"Boundary conditions; Energy conversion; Finite volume method; Flow patterns; Gas turbines; Mathematical models; Reynolds number; Three dimensional; Turbulent flow; Wood wastes; Cyclone combustors; Flow structure; Non-reacting flow field; Reynolds-stress model; Two dimensional; Wood-fired gas turbines; Combustors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029507148

Therefore, the well concentration must be optimized taking into account the retention time distribution.",,"Calculations; Electric fields; Electrons; Epitaxial growth; Ionization; Leakage currents; Semiconductor junctions; Substrates; Transistors; Ionization energy; Retention time distribution; Thermal emission rate; Thermionic field emission current; Tunneling effects; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029490113

With this control strategy it is possible to use the cooled ceiling panels not only during working hours when an internal load is present, but also at night. With night cooling, it is possible to use the thermal mass of the building for energy storage. Night cooling helps to reduce the peak load during working hours. It makes it possible to produce part of the cold water at lower outside temperatures and when the costs for electricity are lower.

The specific magnetic behavior of these weakly correlated entities is described by ferromagnetic resonance and magnetization measurements. We showed that the magnetic properties of these cluster assembled materials can be interpreted using the random anisotropy model with a scale law related to grain size. The increasing interest of the scientific community in the magnetism of ""small particles""1 is mainly driven by their potential application as high density storage devices2,3. From the Stoner criterion, the size and the first-neighbor number reduction would be favourable to ferromagnetism in transition metals. In this context, metallic clusters are interesting for their large surface volume ratio but they are very oxygen reactive. By varying the elaboration conditions (vacuum quality, substrate temperature, size distribution of the incident clusters...) we obtained nanostructured iron-films by Low Energy Cluster Beam Deposition (LECBD). This paper is mainly concerned with the structural and magnetic properties of these original cluster assembled materials. The laser vaporization source operating in the laboratory of Lyon4 allows the production of an intense cluster beam in a wide range of size (from few to a thousand atoms per cluster), to synthetize thin films of any kind of materials even the most refractory. Roughly, the plasma created at the laser impact on the iron rod, is thermalized by a synchronized high pressure (5 bars) helium pulse. The nascent clusters are then rapidly quenched during the following isentropic expansion into the vacuum (10-4 torr) chamber containing the source. The size distributions of clusters are checked by time-of-flight mass spectrometry before deposition. The deposit of neutral clusters at low energy on various substrates are subsequently realized after the retraction of the time-of-flight acceleration grids. This type of source produces cold clusters and we succeeded previously in the stabilisation of very low size fullerenes4. In particular we deposited C20-clusters without fragmentation on the substrate in order to produce original diamondlike structures4. © 1995.",,"Deposition; Grain size and shape; Magnetic properties; Magnetic variables measurement; Magnetism; Mossbauer spectroscopy; Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy; Thermal effects; Thin films; Transition metals; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Demagnetizing field; Low energy cluster beam deposition; Magnetocrystalline materials; Nanocrystallized thin films; Saturation magnetization; Nanostructured materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029474908

In these machines nonlinear effects can become important, not only because of the high variation of the particle's energy around the ring, but also because of the necessity to have very good beam quality in wigglers, undulators, and free electron lasers. Since these instruments can have helical structure, a general reference frame with torsion is used and the Lorentz-Dirac radiation reaction of the charged particle is taken into account.

The cooling starts if the bunches are short enough. Coherent synchrotron radiation with wavelengths of the order of the length of the bunch will propagate in the vacuum chamber of the bending magnet. Achievement of such condition, linked to the bunch dimensions, is generally not possible if only the main RF system is used. Therefore it is necessary to add a tunable idle or powered extra RF cavity, whose frequency depends on the transverse dimensions of the vacuum chamber of the bending magnet and on the radius of the orbit curvature. By this mean, a self-consistent effect can be achieved. The energy transfer among particles of the same bunch leads to a dynamic reduction of all bunch dimensions. For these reasons the whole radiated spectrum becomes coherent. This should be true for all storage rings with particles which emit synchrotron radiation. Our experimental results observed on a e+/e- storage ring are described.",,"Calculations; Cavity resonators; Cooling; Energy transfer; Magnets; Storage rings; Synchrotron radiation; Vacuum technology; Bunched beams; Microbunches; Radiofrequency cavity; Supercooling; Vacuum chamber; Particle beams",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029462238

The beam lifetime is reduced by bremsstrahlung both in the field of the atomic nuclei and in the macroscopic field of the highly charged dust particle. Recent observations at some storage rings can be explained by the capture of a single macroparticle of about micron size, possibly made from silicon dioxide.

The latter was measured with a heating tube installed in the reactor. It was shown that the system was able to store thermal energy at about 400°C and to supply thermal energy at 75-120°C, and that the thermal power exceeded 50-100W per 1 kilogram of initial magnesium hydroxide during the first 60 minutes.

A key issue for the whole accelerator facility is the loss free ring injection which can be achieved by H- - H+ charge exchange. The design of an H- - injector differs remarkably from the layout of an high intensity H+ - linac [3]. At the low energy end a fast chopper operating at the ring revolution frequency has to be installed. No partly filled bunches are allowed. Funneling of two beams is preferred as it relaxes the conditions for the chopping system. The linac itself has to be designed for no emittance growth and small halo production. In order to ensure a loss free injection into the rings, the linac pulse has to be limited in energy and truncated transversely. The energy spread reduction is made by a bunch rotator after the linac. A cost saving option is to use pulsed superconducting cavities for the high β linac [4].",,"Cavity resonators; Choppers (circuits); Cyclotrons; Electric currents; Hydrogen; Ion sources; Particle beam injection; Particle beams; Storage rings; Bunches; Energy spread; Funneling; High intensity injector linacs; Loss free ring injection; Linear accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029459945

Under an applied electric field, a diagnostic x-ray signal is obtained by the direct conversion of x-ray energy to electron-hole pairs which are collected as electrical charges by individual storage capacitor associated with each pixel element. The electronic readout sequence is initiated immediately after the x-ray exposure, and in several seconds, the image data is available for display on a video monitor, for data storage, data transmission, and hard copy generation. Signal strength of this direct conversion method is estimated to be significantly higher than that of other indirect conversion methods where light is first generated using a scintillator or phosphor and then detected by charge-coupled devices (CCDs) or thin-film-transistor (TFT) arrays in conjunction with photodiodes. In addition, since charges generated by x-ray photons move mostly along the direction of the bias electric field, images of very high spatial resolution can be obtained. The resolution limits are principally defined by the smallest pixel that can be manufactured. Recent x-ray images obtained from experimental detector panels are presented.

The project is being built by a collaboration of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. DOE construction authorization was given in 1994. The asymmetric beam energies require two storage rings with the low energy ring (LER) supported above the high energy ring (HER). There will be one interaction point with head-on collisions, requiring magnetic separation of the beams, low values of the beta functions, and magnetic elements inside the solenoid of the BABAR physics detector. The high luminosity necessitates a large number of bunches requiring advances in the vacuum design, damped RF cavities, and bunch-by-bunch feedback systems. The injection scheme uses the high current, low emittance, on-energy beams available from the SLAC linac.

Measurement has shown that the frequency shift of the accelerating (π/2) mode was substantially reduced compared to that of the accelerating cavity itself. Two parasitic modes (0 and π) of ARES have to be damped so that they should not cause longitudinal coupled bunch instability. The coupling waveguides attached at the coupling cavity sufficiently damped these parasitic modes, while having negligible effect on the Q value of the π/2-mode.",,"Aluminum; Cavity resonators; Electric variables measurement; Mathematical models; Natural frequencies; Waveguides; Accelerator resonantly coupled with an energy storage; Cold model; Coupling cavity; Coupling waveguides; Frequency shift; RF characteristics; Particle accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029458057

The stainless steels and nickel alloys become irradiated after neutron bombardment and have radioactive species that must be stored for centuries before radioactivity dissipates to human safe handling levels.

The required angular impulse can easily be provided with existing pulse power technology and traveling wave structures with a transverse electric field similar to those now available [1]. The deflected beam is then restored by suitable collimation. Chopping is relatively easily done at sufficiently low energies, where the beam is easily deflected, and beam powers are not too large. However, the energy should be high enough so that the space-charge blow-up of the beam can be controlled with adequate focusing.

During this event, the quality factor of the lines changes from one value to another. The difference between these two values is minimized to simplify the realization of the quality factor switch. We present the system optimum parameters for this case.

However, in order to store enough energy over an orbit period there must be minimal heat lost with a system that is designed to remove heat for energy conversion. A unique feature of thermionics is their ability to reduce heat flow by reducing or eliminating the electron cooling. However, demonstration and quantification of this capability is needed. This paper presents the results to date of the Receiver Diode Integration Test, one of two critical experiments of the ISUS ATD program being performed by the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL).

The PCM was contained in alternating layers of a plate-fin compact heat exchanger core. At the 90 percent power condition the peak motor temperature was within 90 K of the heat sink, illustrating good source to sink thermal coupling by the thermosyphon. Conversely, when the motor was cooled by natural convection and conduction alone, the peak temperature was 170 K above sink temperature. Testing shows that the PCM material provides additional useful thermal inertia during the melting process. However, test data revealed that the melt temperature of the acetamide had been depressed from 353 to 341 K, due to absorbed water, highlighting the need to process the PCM in a dry atmosphere.

The electrons will be provided by a laser photocathode gun feeding a 210 MeV S-band electron linac, with magnetic bunch compression at 80 MeV. Electron bunches as short as 100 μm with 1 nC charge will be used for pump-probe experiments utilizing coherent transition radiation. Beam will also be injected into a compact storage ring which will be a source of millimeter wave coherent synchrotron radiation. The linac will also serve as the driver for an FEL designed to allow the study of various aspects of single pass amplifiers.

The strategy and main guidelines of ENRESA's program to fulfil this mandate are contained in the General Radioactive Waste Plan (PGRR), a basic document which ENRESA is due to submit every year to the Ministry of Industry and Energy for Government approval. The Spanish nuclear electricity generating program consists of nine Light Water Reactors (LWR) with an overall capacity of 7.1 GWe, after the Vandellos I nuclear power plant were phased - out in 1989. The spent nuclear fuel from LWRs is defined, in accordance with the 1983 National Energy Plan, as high level waste, and its management is accordingly focussed to the direct disposal option. The spent nuclear fuel from Vandellos I, a graphite gas - cooled reactor which was in operation from 1972 to 1989, in reprocessed abroad, and the wastes generated in the processes will be returned to Spain. The final objective of the Spanish High Level Waste program is to dispose of the spent nuclear fuel and high level vitrified waste into a deep geological repository. In fulfilling this target, taking into account the time frame in which it can reasonably be achieved, a previous step is necessary in order to secure the temporary storage of the spent fuel. This paper presents the strategy and a description of the different elements of the program currently under way as established in the fourth General Radioactive Waste Plan that has been approved by the Government in December 1994.",,"High level wastes (HLW); Radioactive waste management; Geological repositories; Light water reactors; Radioactive waste storage; Radioactive waste vitrification; Spent fuels; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029427605

The removal action involved four Uranium Calibration Pits (UCPs) filled with radioactive or hazardous materials. The concrete culvert pits were used between 1978 and 1984 by the United States Department of Energy (US DOE) to test and calibrate borehole radiometric logging tools for uranium exploration. The UCPs were remediated as part of a voluntary corrective measure (VCM) to reduce investigation costs and accelerate regulatory cleanup schedules. The cost of the VCM to the ER Project was approximately $100,000. A cost savings of at least $180,000 was achieved by conducting the VCM instead of following the standard regulatory process. The removal action consisted of excavating and containerizing the pit contents and contaminated soil beneath the culverts, removing the four culverts, and backfilling the excavation. Each UCP removal had unique complexities. Sixty 208-L drums of solid radioactive waste and eight 208-L drums of liquid hazardous waste were generated during the VCM. Two of the concrete culverts will be disposed as radioactive waste and two as solid waste. Uranium-238 was detected in UCP-2 ore material at 746 pCi/g, and at 59 pCi/g in UCP-1 silica sand.

Parsons was the fast engineering firm hired as a full-service RD contractor on a DOE site placed on the Superfund National Priorities List. Complicating the implementation of the first RD contract were other contract firsts, such as 1) working initially under DOE as a prime contractor, then under a management and operations (M&O) contractor as a subcontractor, and, currently, under an environmental restoration management contractor (ERMC) as a subcontractor; 2) operating under the then new DOE risk-sharing liability and indemnification regulation (termed the `Accountability Rule'); and 3) operating under new, legally enforceable DOE nuclear safety regulations instead of pre-existing, contractually enforceable DOE Orders. In addition to these contract `firsts.' Were a number of funding and technical changes resulting from shifting priorities in the environmental program. These changes include 1) a decreased local emphasis on implementing innovative remediation technologies; 2) promoting ways to accomplish remedial activities faster, better, and cheaper without sacrificing safety; 3) a new emphasis on land use planning as a means of formulating cleanup levels; and 4) the increased involvement of the public. This combination of contract `firsts' and funding and technical influences has resulted in a dynamic project environment. Managing these dynamic aspects requires systems, protocols, resources and expertise, interface mechanisms and controls, and client/customer relationships that are disciplined, yet adaptive to frequent change. An RD Contractor must recognize that a substantial part of the job will be done in the regulatory, legal, environmental, and public arenas, while the other part involves the more traditional design protocols and skills.",,"Environmental restoration management contractor (ERMC); Nuclear safety regulations; Contracts; Environmental impact; Health risks; Laws and legislation; Project management; Public policy; Radioactive waste storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029426805

The goal of reaching consensus on the best method or methods for storing and ultimately disposing of these materials can only be achieved after an open public discussion of all reasonable alternatives. The United States Department of Energy considered a number of factors in developing a program for public involvement. These factors included defining the affected public, public knowledge about the proposed action, decisions to be made, availability of pertinent information, current public perceptions, and responding to public input. Based upon an analysis of these factors, three primary techniques were selected for communicating with the public. The techniques are distribution of a quarterly newsletter, establishment of an electronic bulletin board, and holding periodic conference calls and public meetings. The newsletter is designed to reach the widest segment of the public and to be meaningful regardless of the reader's level of familiarity with the project. Periodic conference calls and meetings are used to reach the members of the public who have a real but periodic interest in the issues. The electronic bulletin board is used to communicate with a core group of stakeholders who have a continuing high interest in the total storage and disposition program. Initial indications are that these techniques are effective in reaching a wide segment of the public on highly technical and complex questions related to weapons grade nuclear materials.

Previous work at Dahlgren has shown that the breakdown strength is independent of stress time in this regime.

Based on the kinetic and potential energies of the disk/shaft system, the equations of motion are derived through Lagrange's equations. Equilibrium conditions of the equations of motion indicate the existence of steady precession (or rocking modes). In addition, the angular speed φ0 of the steady precession (or the frequencies of the rocking modes) depends substantially on the natural frequencies of one nodal diameter disk modes, the bearing stiffness, and the bearing span. During the steady precession, one nodal diameter sine modes undergo a static deformation and other disk modes remain undeformed. In particular, equilibrium conditions of the equations of motion simultaneously predict the critical speeds of a spinning disk with steady precession. Besides, an analysis of small oscillations about the steady precession indicates that the nutation of the rigid shaft and the transverse vibration of one nodal diameter sine modes of the elastic disk are coupled together. Finally, calibrated experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical predictions above.

In December 1985, Congress revisited the issue and enacted the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 (LLRWPAA). No new disposal sites have opened yet, however, and it is now evident that disposal facility development is more complex, time-consuming, and controversial than originally anticipated. For a nation with a large nuclear power industry, the lack of availability of LLW disposal capacity coupled with a similar lack of high-level radioactive waste disposal capacity could adversely affect the future viability of the nuclear energy option. The U.S. nuclear power industry, with 109 operating reactors, generates about half of the LLW shipped to commercial disposal sites and faces dwindling access to waste disposal sites and escalating waste management costs. The other produces of LLW - industries, government (except the defense related research and production waste), academic institutions, and medical institutions that account for the remaining half of the commercial LLW - face the same storage and cost uncertainties.

It would store approximately 100 MJ in the Marx generators and deliver approximately 500 TW to drive high power z-pinch implosions. The pulsed power requirements for Jupiter were evaluated by a national review panel which concluded that the modular IVA technology as used in HERMES III is capable of meeting these requirements. Modularity of construction permits design verification with less than a full size system and offers the flexibility to meet changing requirements. A program to validate this approach at the required power levels has begun with the construction and testing of components that will comprise a full scale IVA generator module. The IVA module will provide a nominal 10 MV, 1.8 MA, 100 ns FWHM output pulse and will consist of four submodules. Each submodule is composed of a Marx generator, two Intermediate Energy Storage Capacitors (ISCs) four Pulse Forming Lines (PFLs), one Voltage Adder Cavity (VAC), plus other associated switches and hardware. A conceptual design for this IVA module has been completed. Initial designs for the ISC, PFL, and their gas switches are also complete and hardware has been procured.

Additionally, the charge/discharged efficiency is known to be lower for this capacitor than for other, lower energy density capacitors. The life characteristics of the capacitor have been established under normal operating conditions.

An experimental test setup and an analytical model investigate the dynamics, advantages, and disadvantages of using popper valves to switch operation between pump and motor, leading to development of optimal switching methods. This is of particular interest in hydraulic drive vehicles that use regenerative braking. Three major areas of concern are pressure spikes during the transition, event time span, and energy loss. The analytical model uses a bond graph to help construct the system state equations for numerical integration. Experiments measured pressure, speed, and torque using a Volvo V11-60 variable displacement hydraulic pump/motor and a modular valve block. Experimental results show that transition occurs within 150 ms, pressure spikes are within acceptable limits, while energy loss is quite large. The reason for large losses and lower than expected pressure spikes is an open valve overlap, a period of time when a direct flow path exists from high to low pressure. Valves were given a simultaneous electronic signal. However, actual valve opening and closing times are very different. Thus for a fraction of second, two valves are open simultaneously.

But, shrinking memory feature sizes and the industry's tendency to use metals as link materials rather than polysilicon imposes new challenges for laser processing. So far, the majority of the research on memory link laser processing has concentrated on: The vertical structure of a link (such as the multiple layers of passivation, link, field oxidation and silicon substrate); the laser beam absorption; and, the different temperature distribution within the structure as the result of laser beam heating. Until now, the emphasis in laser link processing optimization has been aimed at creating uniform temperature distribution while severing the link before exploding the passivation layer. Our study has shown that the link width plays an important roll in the processing as well. Analysis of the mechanical stress beneath the passivation layer using finite element modeling has been carried out. Different link width and passivation layer thicknesses vary the stress dramatically. The results of this simulation will be presented and their implication on link processing optimization will be discussed. To optimize the laser processing further, we have proven that absorption contrast of laser energy between the link material and the silicon substrate beneath the link must be maximized. Based upon the fact that while the absorption of most metal materials in the 1.3- to 2-micron range remains the same as that at 1 micron, it drops dramatically for silicon. By using laser wavelengths within the 1.3- to 2-micron range, a much wider laser processing window can be realized. Comparison analysis of link processing by different laser wavelengths will be discussed.",,"Computer simulation; Finite element method; Laser applications; Light absorption; Mathematical models; Passivation; Polysilicon; Laser link processing; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029419219

Third-generation synchrotron facilities with their inherent high brightness have the unique potential to cover this energy region with high-resolution, high-flux x-ray beams ideal for spectroscopic studies. A 5.5-cm-period, planar undulator to be installed on the 7-GeV Advanced Photon Source will produce a high brightness source of intermediate-energy x rays. The 0.5- to 3-keV spectroscopy beamline is based on the spherical grating monochromator design that has already been shown to yield high resolution and throughput in the soft-x-ray region, below 1 keV. The beamline has been designed to cover the entire region with a peak resolving power of 6000-10 000. Photon flux at the sample is calculated to be in the range from 1011 to 1013 photons/s into a spot size of 1 mm2. A refocusing mirror will be used to further demagnify the image size at a second experimental station. As a second phase to the spectroscopy program, an elliptically polarized insertion device will be used. The polarization preserving nature of the grazing incidence optical elements in the SGM is crucial to obtain x rays of well-defined polarization. The beamline layout, together with calculations of resolution, throughput, power loading, and high harmonic suppression, will be presented.

In preliminary studies it was found that the quantum efficiency of the lateral diodes is comparable to that of Si XUV diodes. At 1.5 keV a quantum efficiency of about 100 electrons per photon was measured in the central position. No long-term drifts of the efficiency have been observed. The position sensitivity of the diodes is almost independent of photon energy, but is at least a factor of 2 higher than in the visible range. Hence in a white-light beam, a photon energy window was defined by a water-cooled Al-absorber foil of 200 μm thickness. Behind the foil two lateral diodes were arranged at 3.5 (15 mm length) and 7 m (30 mm length) behind the source. The horizontal position of the diodes was staggered so that the first diode does not occlude the beam to the second one.

The calculable undispersed spectral photon flux of the primary radiation standard BESSY with relative uncertainties of below 0.4% is used in a broad spectral range from 1 eV to 15 keV for the calibration of energy-dispersive detectors and of monochromator-detector systems at one beamline and for the calibration of radiation sources in the spectral range from 3 eV to 1.8 keV at three experimental stations equipped with monochromators. Monochromatized synchrotron radiation, with emphasis placed on high spectral purity, is provided at three stations covering the spectral range from 3 eV to about 1.5 keV for detector calibrations and for reflectometry.

When completed later this year, it will be the first ALS monochromatic hard-x-ray beamline, and its brightness will be an order-of-magnitude higher than presently available in this energy range. In addition, it will provide flux and resolution comparable to any other beamline now in operation. To achieve these goals, two technical improvements, relative to existing x-ray beamlines, were incorporated. First, a somewhat novel optical design for x rays, in which matched toroidal mirrors are positioned before and after the double-crystal monochromator, was adopted. This configuration allows for high resolution by passing a collimated beam through the monochromator, and for high brightness by focusing the ALS source on the sample with unit magnification. Second, a new ''Cowan type'' double-crystal monochromator based on the design used at NSLS beamline X-24A was developed. The measured mechanical precision of this new monochromator shows significant improvement over existing designs, without using positional feedback available with piezoelectric devices. Such precision is essential because of the high brightness of the radiation and the long distance (12 m) from the source (sample) to the collimating (focusing) mirror. This combination of features will provide a bright, high resolution, and stable x-ray beam for use in the x-ray spectroscopy program at the ALS. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.",,"Computer simulation; Error analysis; Light sources; Mirrors; Monochromators; Monte Carlo methods; Optical design; Optical resolving power; Storage rings; X ray spectroscopy; Advanced light source; Double crystal monochromators; High brightness beamline; Photon energy; Ray tracing; Toroidal mirrors; Optical systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029244222

Mailed TL dosimeters are used for the check of the beam output and of the beam quality of photon beams. The thermoluminescent material is PTL 717 LiF powder. The readings were first performed on a manual, and then on an automatic reader, with standard deviations of the mean of 0.7% for one dosimeter. Corrections for supralinearity and for the energy dependence of the dosimeter response are applied. An original method has been developed to correct for the variation of the LiF response as a function of time. It is shown that the sensitivity of the powder changes during storage, leading to a kind of 'inverse fading'. The global uncertainty of the TL postal measurement procedure is estimated to be about 1.5% for the 60Co beams and 2% for the X-ray beams. Intercomparisons with the IAEA and with the EORTC have shown an agreement better than 2% for all energies.

Spectral and angular distributions of radiation were measured for deflection parameter K values between 0.45 and 2.12 at low storage ring current (0.1-0.5 mA). From the calibration of the spectrometer, the absolute flux density of the undulator harmonics has been determined together with the spectral linewidth. The electron-beam emittance was determined by analyzing the angular distribution of the redshifted fundamental. Comparison has been made with radiation calculations based upon the measured magnetic-field data of the undulator.

The design suggested foresees replacement of the traditional high power systems of external rf generator and modulator by a more passive switched energy storage system. The proposed conception of a compact linac is based on known rf energy compression techniques and an efficient self-excited oscillation in a special accelerating/oscillating linac structure. The principal relations, performance estimations, and one-dimensional time-dependent simulation results for such a linac are presented. The possibility of self-excited oscillation by an unbunched low voltage beam in a waveguide linac section is proved and investigated experimentally. The common features and differences compared with a conventional backward-wave tube are analyzed. An application of this effect is proposed for impedance and group velocity measurements in slow-wave structures. Since the rf energy commutation may be one or two orders faster than the electric high voltage energy commutation (conventional modulator), combining the structure proposed and rf energy compression system can give high levels of the average beam power (10-100 kW). The linac facility would have considerably reduced weight and sizes (more than 2.5 times) as compared to similar industrial linacs. The power supply required is in 40-120 kV range dc source, and an estimated overall wall plug efficiency is a few percent. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001640851

For this spectral region it is advantageous to use Michelson interferometers because of their high throughput (Jacquinot advantage). A second advantage is that interferometers inherently give a multiplex or Felgett advantage, since one is always looking at all the wavelengths for all of the measuring time, even though there is only one detector. In such instruments it is beneficial to scan the moving mirror at a fast rate so that any mechanical or other low-frequency noise shows up as a slow modulation in the interferogram and disappears altogether in the Fourier transform from the spectral region of interest. However, audio-frequency sidebands appear from the rf energy restoring cavity as noise on the beam. These always occur at multiples of 60 Hz and can thus be readily identified. They can also be confirmed by changing the mirror velocity which changes where they appear in the spectra in a predictable way. In the present work, spectra were measured while simultaneously reducing and shifting the sidebands in the rf and thus the effects were correlated and ultimately eliminated as a source of noise. Ultimately reproducibilities of &lt;1% in 15 s of scanning time across the entire spectral region from 800 to 4000 cm-1 with a sample throughput of only 10-10 m2 sr were achieved. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001306056

Applying the formula of Kuraev and Fadin for the radiative corrections we find: Γee(Υ{hooked}(1 S))= (1.32±0.04±0.03) keV and Γee(Υ{hooked}(2 S))=(0.52±0.03±0.01) keV.

This new-type detector has been characterized using synchrotron radiation from a 2.5-GeV positron storage ring at the Photon Factory of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK). This new detector is essentially composed of four layers of commercially available photodiodes. Each photodiode is made from a 300-μm thick, and a 10×10-mm square-shaped wafer. For the common affiliation of these individual photodiodes, the quantum efficiency normalized by the photon energy η/E begins to decrease at 8 keV, and then η/E decreases down to 26% at 20 keV. On the other hand, for our newly designed detector a flat response even in the 10-20-keV energy regime (beam line 15C at the Photon Factory) is observed, and even at 100 keV η/E<30% is still anticipated. This new x-ray detector has various advantages: (i) A compact, and (ii) outgas-free detector for a high-vacuum use, along with (iii) a high degree of immunity to ambient magnetic fields. Furthermore, (iv) the combination of the x-ray signal outputs from each detector layer provides information on the x-ray emitting electron energies. These properties are quite suitable for the use of the fusion-oriented plasma x-ray diagnostics under intense-magnetic field and high-vacuum conditions so as to interpret wide-band x-ray emitting electron-velocity distribution functions from the x-ray data. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000503406

To obtain images wide enough and with sufficient vertical resolution, each of the two beams used has to be at least 100 mm wide but not more than 0.5 mm high at the patient's heart with the beam energies bracketing the iodine-K edge at 33.17 keV. A new monochromator in Laue transmission geometry has been developed, successfully tested at beamline ID11 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) and is now in use at the angiography wiggler beamline W2 at HASYLAB. The monochromator consists of two almost identical goniometer heads which are independently controlled. Within each head a bent silicon single crystal extracts a quasimonochromatic beam and focuses it vertically to the patient thus also increasing intensity compared to an unbent crystal. With a storage ring current of 50 mA the new monochromator provides 0.8×10 11 photons/mm2/s in front of the patient which is an increase by a factor of 6 compared to the formerly used Bragg design with Ge crystals.

The energy mismatch is defined as the difference between the injector energy and the synchronous energy of the storage ring. Observations of the rf capture of the injected beam when the energy acceptance or synchronous energy are varied yield the energy mismatch. The energy acceptance and synchronous energy are easily varied by changing the rf accelerating voltage, the rf frequency, or both. As an example, measurements performed on the 1 GeV electron storage ring Aladdin show an energy mismatch of 0.666 MeV at the injection energy of 108 MeV.

The constant of complexes formation on the surface has a narrow pronounced maximum at short range of molybdenum and tungsten hexacarbonyls pressures. The entry of that complex into the film occurs parallel with film growth processes at the expensaof oxidative molybdenum, tungsten carbonyls and heterocarbonylic complex thermodecomposition [1]. The recording media on base of d-metals oxides doped by organic or complex compounds are intended for thermooptic single-repeate recording on thin films with subsequent repeated many times reading. Another intention is fabrication of microrelief devices. The information recording by intensity laser beam is not accompanied with mechanic film breaking, but only causes the educing of optic contrast phase or moulding the bubbles. Nonstoichiometric oxide films are used as matrix, which absorb laser radiation, ensure mechanic stability under irradiation influence and stability during a longtime storage. Organic compounds doped into a matrix at film growing ensure decrease of threshold power of recording by laser irradiation in visible and near-infrared range of spectrum on the order of magnitude in comparison with starting matrix and make the phase educing or bubble moulding effects in dependence of dopant concentration, show on fig.l. Spectral sensitivity range of recording media - is visible and near infrared range, have a threshold exposition characteristic. Recording energy for impulse duration of 200 ns and focused laser spot of 0.8 mkm. is about 3 nJ. The resolution makes realization of information carrier with track pitch of 1.2 mkm. The phase-change recording is accompanied with increasing both of imaginary and real part of refractive index. The relief-change recording is accompanied with hard stable bubbles moulding. The formation of recording media demonstrated on example of amorphous films of nonstoichiometric tungsten oxide doped with molybdenum oxidecarbonyl compounds. The preparation of functional films and coatings by joint deposition of carbonylic compounds became one of the widely spread methods allowing to obtain deposits with controllable composition. In this case as a member of deposit can also be the intermediates of carbonyls decomposition processes. Their structure and relationship of concentration to deposition conditions provide information about film growth mechanisms. The formation of molybdenum and tungsten heterocarbonylic complexes thermodynamically is profitable in the determined temperature range [1]. Their heterocarbonylic complexes of tetrahedral configuration were revealed in the gas phase in conditions of joint thermal hexacarbonyls decomposition in the inert gas-carrier. In this case the heterocarbonylic complex formation constant in the gas phase has a weakly pronounced maximum subject to the equality of carbonyls partial pressures [1]. The molybdenum and tungsten heterocarbonylic complexes were revealed as members of films prepared by joint thermal hexacarbonyls decomposition on the surface in neutral [2] and oxidative [3] media. The functional film properties depend substantially on ratios of molybdenum and tungsten hexacarbonyls vapour pressures [4] what cannot be explained by heterocarbonylic complex formation only in the gas phase. In the paper is investigated the relationship of film composition prepared in conditions of joint oxidative hexacarbonyls thermodecomposition to the ratio of molybdenum and tungsten hexacarbonyls vapors pressure. The films prepared in vacuum in the order hundreds pascal in the flow reactor by controlling the deposition process. As an oxidizer used air. The vapor pressure measured by means of thermoelectric converters using the technique [5] to an accuracy of 5 %. The film thickness was in the order of hundreds nanometres.

In contrast to these studies on inert species, we show here that high pressures can lead to unexpected behaviour in reactive compounds. We find that mixtures of O2 and H2 are stable at pressures of around 7.6 GPa, despite their explosive nature under ambient conditions. We use microscopy and Raman spectroscopy to identify the phase boundary of the stable region. The structure of the binary phase diagram at 296 K suggests that a stoichiometric compound (O2)3(H2)4 might exist.

During the first half of the ground-contact phase, kinetic energy lost from the body is stored as elastic strain energy, predominantly in the hind limbs3–5. The subsequent recoil returns kinetic and potential energy to the body. Here we show that the allometry of structures in the legs and feet of Macropodoidea is different from that of quadrupedal eutherian mammals. The potential for elastic energy storage in hoppers is shown to scale with strong positive allometry. This is a function of the structural properties of muscle–tendon units in the distal hind limbs and the postures adopted by hopping kangaroos. Our findings demonstrate how the use of tissue elasticity is strongly mass dependent and help explain the observed energetic phenomena. © 1995, Nature Publishing Group.

It is intended for use to give a quick overview of the possible appropriateness of a wind/diesel system and indicate whether more detailed analysis would be of use. The model was developed for use on personal computers and to trade complexity for ease of operation. The wind/diesel system modelled may include: 1) Wind regime: 2) One or more wind turbines: 3) System electrical load : 4) One or more diesel generators: 5) Dumo load: 6) Short term storage, and 7) System controller. The model does not consider storage explicitly, but does distinguish between the no storage and minimal storage (power smoothing) systems. This work is based on the more detailed simulation models previously developed at the University of Massachusetts, but uses probabilistic methods rather than time series data inputs. As such it requires only mean and standard deviation of wind speed and load for each month or season. The model functions by assuming that occuftences of wind speed can be modelled by a Weibull distribution and that the load follws either a Welbull Of normal distribution, In addition, both the wind speed and load are assumed to be uncorrelated within each month or season.

The applications require the enhanced ductility resulting from the presence of spherical graphite nodules in the ductile ferrite iron matrix. Proper design of such components requires a knowledge of the mechanical properties, including how energy is absorbed and dissipated (mechanical damping) by the test material. This article is a study of the mechanical damping of a series of well-characterized ductile iron materials (four separate materials) as a function of strain amplitude, temperature over the range of -100 °C to +100 °C, and magnetic field. The major sources of damping were found to be dislocation motion in the graphite phase and magnetomechanical damping in the ferrite phase. The magnitude of the magnetomechanical damping was much larger than that due to dislocation motion. An additional goal of the investigation was to determine if any correlation existed between the measured mechanical damping and the fracture toughness of the ductile iron materials; no correlation was found. © 1995 The Minerals, Metals & Material Society.",,"Damping; Dislocations (crystals); Ductility; Ferrite; Fracture toughness; Graphite; Magnetic field effects; Metallographic microstructure; Strain rate; Thermal effects; Dislocation motion; Nodular iron",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029409488

Irrigation methods were LEPA sock, LEPA bubble, in-canopy spray near ground level, and overhead spray. The application devices were installed on a three-span, hose-fed, lateral-move sprinkler system. Irrigations were scheduled from neutron soil water measurements in a designated control treatment receiving 100% irrigation by the LEPA sock method. Soil water in the control plots was maintained above 75% of the plant available level by simultaneously applying 25-mm irrigations with all four sprinkler methods as the 100% irrigation amount. Deficit irrigation treatments received 75, 50, and 25% of the control treatment application on the same date. All furrows were diked to minimize runoff and enhance surface storage from irrigation and rainfall. The 100% irrigation treatments received 250 and 325 mm of irrigation in 1992 and 1993, respectively, along with 310 and 223 mm, respectively, of rainfall from emergence to the last irrigation. Grain sorghum yields were primarily affected by irrigation amount and to a lesser extend by sprinkler method, especially for the two smaller irrigation amounts. With deficit irrigation the LEPA bubble and sock methods yielded better than the spray methods likely due to reducing evaporation from the crop canopy and soil and thus increasing the amount of water available for transpiration. For example with LEPA in 1992, grain sorghum yields were reduced only 1% while the irrigation amount was reduced from 250 mm for 100% irrigation to 125 mm for 50% irrigation.",,"Agricultural runoff; Crops; Grain (agricultural product); Irrigation; Rain; Simulation; Soils; Spraying; Water; Bushland, Texas; Crop yield; Grain sorghum; Low energy precision application; Sprinkler systems (irrigation)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029404259

This study was designed to evaluate the subcellular protective mechanism of UW solution during cardiac myocyte storage using patch-clamp techniques for the first time as a tool for the detection of myocyte viability. Methods and Results: The protective effects of UW solution on the preservation of dihydropyridine- sensitive Ca2+ channel current response to catecholamine were evaluated in canine cardiac ventricular cells by measurement of single channel open probability. Single ventricular myocytes were isolated and stored in UW solution, in Stanford (SF) solution, or in St Thomas' (ST) solution at 4°C for 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours, and after each storage period, recordings were made of cell-attached single Ca2+ channel currents. When 0.1 μmol/L isoproterenol was applied, percent mean open probability of the Ca2+ channel tested in freshly isolated cells was 167±4% (n=24) of controls (100%). The response was decrescent with increased duration of the hypothermic storage and was only 130±12% (n=4) after 24 hours of storage in SF solution and 135±9% (n=7) in ST solution. However, it was significantly highly preserved as much as 165±9% (n=6) in UW solution. Ca2+ channel kinetics and channel conductance were not changed after up to 24 hours of hypothermic storage. Conclusions: Hypothermic storage of canine cardiac myocytes in UW solution preserved β-adrenergic response, which suggests that UW solution during cold storage preserved high-energy phosphates in myocytes that are responsible for Ca2+ channel phosphorylations.","calcium channels; cardioplegia; catecholamines; electrophysiology; transplantation","catecholamine; isoprenaline; pentobarbital; University of Wisconsin solution; animal cell; article; beta adrenergic stimulation; calcium current; cardioplegia; cell viability; controlled study; cryopreservation; dog; dose response; heart muscle cell; heart preservation; heart protection; heart transplantation; intravenous drug administration; nonhuman; organ donor; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028886524

Magnetic resonance imaging data have recently suggested an impairment of the increase in muscle perfusion during exercise in these patients. We have tested this hypothesis by direct measurement of local muscle perfusion increase. Increase in muscle perfusion was assessed by positron emission tomography with oxygen-15 labelled water in five patients with McArdle's disease and five age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Radioactivity was measured in both forearms before and after exercise of the right forearm. The exercise intensity was biochemically assessed by in vivo phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The estimated increase in muscle perfusion with exercise was 5.7±5.5-fold in the patients (range 1.5-12.8) and 22.3±12.0-fold in the healthy subjects (range 10.1-37) (P=0.022).

The drying of the capsule results in the storage of elastic energy in the capsule valves. The failure of the seam joining the two values precipitates the conversion of the elastic potential energy stored in the valves and seeds. In the hygrochastic case the failure is due to moisture absorption on wetting of the capsule beak which weakens the pectic ""glue""; in the xerochastic case the seam failure is due simply to the high stress in the bonding layer at some degree of desiccation.

The method combines the advantages of grid-based approaches to molecular dynamics problems with those of the Davidson diagonalization technique, which has found widespread usage in molecular electronic structure theory. It permits the direct computation of a prespecified vibrational state without the need to compute all lower lying levels. The wavefunctions used in the present test applications are extremely accurate and are the vibrational analogues of ""full configuration interaction (CI)"" wavefunctions in electronic structure theory. The method is applicable to large problems in that it requires the storage of only a few vectors, between six and eleven in the examples given, and no large matrices need to be retained. The theory of the new method is presented, first for the case of a single degree of vibrational freedom and then for the general case. Test results are given both for a diatomic model system and for a realistic ab initio potential energy surface computed for the formaldehyde molecule. The method is expected to provide a starting point for the development of future techniques for computing highly accurate vibrational wavefunctions for much larger molecules. As with all grid-based methods, no matrix elements of the potential need to be evaluated. The value of the potential is required only at the grid points of the multidimensional grid in coordinate space. © 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

For a better understanding of the nutritional supply during the puerulus stage, structural changes in the hepatopancreas were studied in post-settlement pueruli and first-molt, postpueruli of the rock lobster, Jasus edwardsii, collected on the southeast coast of the North Island, New Zealand between 1989 and 1990. In newly settled (transparent) pueruli, the epithelium of the hepatopancreas is dominated by presumed ""young R-(resorptive) cells"", which are devoid of lipid droplets, but show active uptake of material from the hemolymph through pinocytosis at the basal region. In the fully pigmented puerulus, the hepatopancreas is dominated by R-cells containing massive lipid droplets; also present are small numbers of F-(fibrillar) and B-(blister-like) cells. This increase of lipid inclusion in the R-cells corresponds to the reduction in size of the fat bodies as the lobster develops from the transparent to the pigmented puerulus. After the molt to the post-puerulus, the R-cells are compressed, and the lipid droplets almost disappear, while the B-cells increase both in size and number. A mechanism is proposed in the present paper to explain energy storage and utilization during the puerulus and post-puerulus stages, wherein the fat bodies and the lipid inclusions play a vital role. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",,"Jasus edwardsii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029432185

Abundance increased after the plant started operating, although the proportion of larger perch dropped to a low level. Recruitment improved, but adult mortality increased. This effect was accentuated as the fishes matured very early and at a very small size, reducing their ability to support a growing gonad in high winter temperatures. During the spawning period, condition dropped to very low levels accompanied by increased mortality. Surviving fish delayed the next spawning by one or more years and reduced their fecundity.

The (electro)chemical gradient of the solute(s) is converted into the electrochemical gradient of protons or sodium ions. The most straightforward systems are the excretion systems by which a metabolic end product is excreted out of the cell in symport with protons or sodium ions (energy recycling). Similarly, solutes that were accumulated and stored in the cell under conditions of abundant energy supply may be excreted again in symport with protons when conditions become worse (energy storage). In fermentative bacteria, a proton motive force is generated by fermentation of weak acids, such as malate and citrate. The two components of the pmf, the membrane potential and the pH gradient, are generated in separate steps. The weak acid is taken up by a secondary transporter either in exchange with a fermentation product (precursor/product exchange) or by a uniporter mechanism. In both cases, net negative charge is translocated into the cell, thereby generating a membrane potential. Decarboxylation reactions in the metabolic breakdown of the weak acid consume cytoplasmic protons, thereby generating a pH gradient across the membrane. In this review, several examples of these different types of secondary metabolic energy generation will be discussed. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Decarboxylases; End-product efflux; Malolactic fermentation; Metabolic energy; Precursor/product exchange; Proton motive force; Secondary transport","carboxylyase; lactic acid; proton; energy metabolism; energy transfer; fermentation; nonhuman; ph; priority journal; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028805648

The beam line has been designed to perform photoemission experiments in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and soft X-ray (SXR) energy range. The radiation source is an undulator which consists of three sections, with 36 periods and a period length of 12.5 cm. It allows scanning of an energy range 17-900 eV using the 1st, 3rd and 5th harmonics. The monochromator is a spherical grating type and the resolving power at 400 eV, estimated from the K-shell photoabsorption of the N2 molecule is well above 10 000. The spectra are better than any other spectra taken while operating with high flux, i.e. first order diffraction and grating not masked. Measurements taken at the oxygen and neon K-edges, the argon L23 edges and of the helium double ionization spectra, indicate that the resolution is excellent from 65 to 870 eV. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000352514

Doping was carried out in UHV by physical vapor deposition of rubidium atoms. In both systems, two different doping regimes are observed. At low doping levels, for both materials, one new electronic state appears in the originally forbidden energy gap, and a finite density of states is observed at the Fermi level. Upon increased doping, the observed state moves to lower binding energy and a second state appears within the original energy gap. The evolution of the gap states, together with the appearance of a finite density of states at Fermi level at low doping levels, indicates a transition from polaron to bipolaron charge storage states in these conjugated systems. It should be stressed that these results constitute the first direct measurements of a polaron to bipolaron transition in a conjugated polymer using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000468274

We define this kind of relationship as scalar coupling. The fact that our method turned out to be fast, robust, and highly reliable leads us to seek its extension to include those problems where the above, necessary condition is not fulfilled. In these problems, the specific source functions depend on the radiation field through a nonfactorable redistribution operator. In our definition, these are cases of vectorial coupling. In this paper we present the successful application of the IIM, through an iterative procedure, to two specific instances of vectorial coupling. The first is the determination of the temperature distribution, self-consistent with the energy conservation constraint, within a LTE stellar atmosphere model. Here the physical processes other than radiative transfer require an iterative procedure for the global solution of the problem. Thus we take advantage of this circumstance to solve iteratively the radiative transfer part as well. The second is the case of the non-LTE two-level-atom line formation problem in which partial redistribution is taken into account in the presence of a background continuum. This problem allows a direct solution, but at the cost of using algorithms that necessarily require the storage and inversion of very high order matrices. On the contrary, we show that a solution based on the iterative application of the IIM, thanks to the outstanding features of the latter, is not only fast, but above all much more reliable in numerical terms.","Line: formation; Methods: numerical; Radiative transfer; Stars: atmospheres",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11944253399

This method allows the use of the BIE method to represent those subdomains of a structure that are best suited to BIE method, and the use of the FE method to represent the rest of the structure. Different subdomains and their associated FE or BIE representations are coupled naturally through the total potential energy functional of the system. The associated discretized problem from the proposed method consists of a linear system of equations with a symmetric and blockwise banded matrix. As in regular FE methods, the derivation is started from the total potential energy principle. However, in those subdomains that are best suited to the BIE method, the exact solution of the associated free field equation is used to represent the true solution. The size and shape of each BIE subdomain, called ""macro-element"" in this paper, may be designed freely to meet various practical requirements concerning, for example, numerical efficiency, machine storage limitations, mesh generations, etc. Most significantly, unlike the existing BIE techniques, the present method does not seem to require special treatments for corner effects, thus reducing the computational complexity. Numerical experiments have been performed for generalized Poisson's equation as a prototype situation. The extension to 2D-3D elastic problems is straightforward. © 1995.",,"Boundary element method; Computational complexity; Elasticity; Finite element method; Integral equations; Matrix algebra; Structures (built objects); Boundary integral equation; Energy based macro element method; Poissons equation; Variational techniques",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029634705

Although nutritional therapy has been advised in such patients, few data are available concerning the effects of this intervention. We performed a 6-week randomized clinical trial which compared dietary counselling alone (control) versus dietary counselling plus enteral supplement (Lipisorb) in 118 male HIV-infected outpatients. The inclusion criteria were: age ≥ 18 yr; CD4+ cell count &lt;500/mm3; and &lt;90% usual weight for height or loss of &gt; 10% body weight in the previous 6 months. Each patient was instructed to consume a diet which contained 960 calories greater than estimated total energy expenditure. Nutritional outcomes were: skinfold measurements, fat free mass and total body water (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis). Functional outcomes were: grip strength (Jamar dynamometer), cognitive function (Buschke Selective Reminding test) and Quality of Life (instrument designed for this study). Ninety-nine (99) men completed the study. No differences in skinfold measurements or Quality of Life parameters were observed between the treatment groups. Compared with the control group, the Lipisorb group experienced significantly fewer decreases in total body water (p =.04). Fat free mass (p =0.07) and grip strength (p = 0.07) were increased in the Lipisorb group, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. Significant improvements in short-term memory (p = 0.03) and long-term memory storage and retrieval (p = 0.05) were observed in the Lipisorb group. In malnourished HIV-infected outpatients, dietary counselling with enteral supplementation is associated with improved cognitive function. In addition, the effects of this intervention on nutritional parameters and muscle function are promising. © 1995 American Dietetic Association.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149325191

The spatial variability in the weight-specific V NH4+of M. affinis could not be explained by the differences in the size of individuals, lipid level or lipid class composition; this emphasizes the significance of the effects of spatially differing nutritional conditions, which manifest themselves as different modes of metabolic energy production and different intensities of energy storage. In addition, the potential contribution of the amphipod populations to benthic nitrogen mineralization was estimated; in May to June, the NH4+release of different populations ranged from 12 to 237 μmol NH4+m-2d-1. In general, populations with high abundance and/or biomass release the greatest amounts of NH4+, but the values are modified by the physiological condition of the individuals. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",,"bioenergetics; geographical variability; nitrogen; population characteristics; Baltic Sea; Monoporeia; Pontoporeia; Pontoporeia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029414567

This energy equals 15,000 times the world's annual consumption by humans. People have been burning wood and other forms of biomass for thousands of years, and that is one way of tapping solar energy. But the sun also provides hydropower, wind power and fossil fuels - in fact, all forms of energy other than nuclear, geothermal and tidal. Technology will allow radiation from the sun to provide nonpolluting and cheap fuels, as well as electricity. It is unlikely that a single solar technology will predominate. Regional variations in economics and the availability of sunlight will naturally favor some approaches over others. Electricity may be generated by burning biomass, erecting wind turbines, building solar-powered heat engines, laying out photovoltaic cells or harnessing the energy in rivers with dams. Hydrogen fuel can be produced by electrochemical cells of biological processes-involving microorganisms or enzymes-that are driven by sunlight. Fuels such as ethanol and methanol may be generated from biomass or other solar technologies. At present, developed nations consume at least 10 times the energy per person than is used in developing countries. But the demand for energy is rising fast everywhere. Solar technologies could enable the developing world to skip a generation of infrastructure and move directly to a source of energy that does not contribute to global warming or otherwise degrade the environment.

In this study, energy metabolism, glycolytic substrate (glucose) and anaerobic end-product (lactate) were examined in rat liver over 24 h of cold storage to determine the mechanism of action of the HLR solution. In livers subjected to simple flush and storage with the HLR solution. levels of ATP and ADP were considerably higher than livers stored with modified UW throughout 24 h of storage; at 4 h of storage, ATP and ADP levels were 1.1 and 3.1 μmol/g for HLR solution versus 0.18 and 0.81 μmol/g for UW solution. Total adenylate contents (TA=ATP+ADP+AMP) also remained 1-2 μmol/g higher in HLR-treated livers than those preserved in UW; TA values ranged from 3.8 to 5.7 μmol/g. Glucose increased to 20-35 μmol/g by 10-24 h of storage (similar to the UW group). Lactate rose to almost twice that in livers stored in UW; total lactate accumulation was approximately 10.0 μmol/g. This study demonstrated that the combined HLR solution is able to prolong the maximum 'safe' CIT by increasing anaerobic metabolism and consequently preserving liver energetics. The second part of the experiment examined the effect of continuous perfusion (with/without O2) over the 1st h of cold ischaemia. Under current methods of liver flushing and excision, the 1st h of cold storage may be the critical time of metabolic 'adjustment' since most of the pH and ATP changes occur during this period. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the combination of a simple flush with an additional brief 1-h perfusion period prior to storage would enhance the maintenance of hepatic energetics. There was no beneficial effect of 1 h of perfusion without O2 compared to simple HLR flush and storage. However, perfusion with O2 resulted in prolonged maintenance of high energy adenylates and total adenylates; at 10 h of storage ATP was 1.0, ADP 3.3, and TA 5.7 μmol/g.

DXA was also performed on MPS cats that had a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and total body irradiation (TBI) (MPS+BMT;n=7), normal cats that had a bone marrow transplant, and TBI (control+BMT; n=8) and normal cats (control; n=14). Following euthanasia, one of the lumbar vertebrae that had been scanned (L5) was harvested and bone volume (BV/TV%) was determined by histomorphometry. The in vivo BMD and BMD measurements were compared with the BV/TV%. There was a greater BMD and BMC in the MPS+BMT cats compared with the MPS cats but the difference was not statistically significant. However, there was a greater BV/TV% in the MPS+BMT cats compared with the MPS cats and the difference was significant (P=0.0152).

Noninvasive in vivo DXA was a rapid and precise method for measuring the lumbar BMD and BMC in cats and it correlated well with histomorphometric determination of bone mass.

However, many donors staying in the intensive care unit for a long period are in a reduced nutritional state. In this study, we investigated the effects of various methods of nutritional repletion on the outcome of liver transplantation in pigs. Donor pigs were divided into three groups according to the nutritional pretreatment given for 7 days before harvesting: group I were fasted and received intravenous administration of saline; group II were fed orally; group III were fasted, but given 20% glucose intravenously. Donor livers were stored for 4 hr in cold Euro-Collins’ solution and transplanted. The serum AST level 24 hr after reperfusion remained at a lower level in group III compared with those in groups I and II. Bile production of the liver after transplantation was also well recovered in group III. The glycogen content of the liver at harvesting, which was completely consumed in group 1, was well preserved in groups II and III. These storages in both groups were rapidly consumed 1 hr after reperfusion. On the other hand, ATP content of the liver in groups I, II, and III, which were at a similar level at harvesting, were markedly decreased 4 hr after cold preservation and, 1 hr after reperfusion, recovered to 26%, 48%, and 73% of that before preservation, respectively. The mean survival time in group III was 37.2 days, significantly longer than 5.8±0.7 and 9.8±2.0 days in groups I and II, respectively (P<0.01). These results show that the favorable outcome of liver transplantation depends on the glycogen storage in the donor liver, and also on ATP generation after reperfusion. Furthermore, it was suggested that ATP generation was affected by some unknown factor related to the method of nutritional repletion. © 1995 by Williams and Wilkins.",,"adenosine triphosphate; glucose; glycogen; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; glycogen analysis; histopathology; intravenous drug administration; liver biopsy; liver transplantation; nonhuman; nutritional status; oral drug administration; priority journal; risk assessment; survival time; swine; treatment outcome; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Bile; Bilirubin; Energy Metabolism; Liver; Liver Glycogen; Liver Transplantation; Nutrition; Survival Analysis; Swine; Tissue Donors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029086670

The MCD spectra reported here are the first examples where this technique has been applied to a study of both the ferritin and the BFR core. It is clear that the two core types have different spectral characteristics in accord with their different chemical composition. At low temperature (<4K) the ferritin core displays a form of magnetic hysteresis which is not observed when the temperature is raised to 77 K. In contrast, the BFR core does not give rise to such an effect even at very low temperature. The data appear to indicate that the ferritin core is highly anisotropic at low temperature whereas the BFR core is not, and that spin relaxation between the ground state energy levels of the ferritin core is exceedingly slow. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27944497783

It is proposed to produce γ-quanta by means of Compton backscattering of laser photons on the electrons. The laser light wavelength is chosen in such a way that after the scattering the electron does not leave the separatrix. Since the probability of the scattering is rather small, energy oscillations are damped prior to the next scattering. As a result, the proposed source can operate in a ""parasitic"" mode not interfering with the main mode of the accelerator operation. It is proposed to install at PETRA a tunable free-electron laser operating in the 20-50 μm wavelength band with peak and average output power ∼ 10 MW and ∼ 1 kW, respectively. This will result in the intensity of the γ-source ∼ 3 × 1012s-1 with tunable γ-quantum energy up to 60 MeV.

The measurement of body composition as a result of given regimen will rapidly become available with dual energy X ray absorptiometry. At the present time, composition of weight gain is calculated by combining nutrient balance (metabolizable energy, protein storage) and indirect calorimetry (energy expenditure). In 72 VLBW infants, nutrient balance and indirect calorimetry were performed to determine utilization and storage of nutrients. Weight gain and it composition were compared in four groups of infants fed different regimen = unsupplemented human milk (HM, n = 10), HM supplemented with protein (HM + Pr, n = 15), HM supplemented with protein and energy (HM + Pr + En, n = 13) and preterm formula (PF, n = 34). Protein storage was significantly higher in infants fed HM + Pr (2.0 ± 0.3 g/kg/d) than in infants fed HM (1.6 ± 0.4 g/kg/d); that increase in protein storage is followed by a decrease in fat storage. The weight gain was higher in infants fed HM + Pr (16.7 ± 2.3 g/kg/d) than in infants fed HM (14.3 ± 3.1 g/kg/d), but no significant difference was observed. Absorbed protein was similar in infants fed HM + Pr (2.9 ± 0.5 g/kg/d) and in infants fed HM + Pr + E (2.8 ± 0.3 g/kg/d), but metabolizable energy was higher in the second group (103 ± 9 kcal/kg/d) than in the first one (88 ± 16 kcal/kg/d). This increase in metabolizable energy was followed by an increase in fat storage which explains the greater weight gain in infants fed HM + Pr + E. Weight gain and its composition were similar either in infants fed HM + Pr + E or in infants fed PF. Non protein energy storage is influenced by the protein/energy ratio and by the absolute amount of energy intake. From our data, it appears that an energy intake close to 120 kcal/kg/d with a Prot/En ratio close to 2.5 g Prot/100 kcal induced a weight gain of about 20 g/kg/d with 20% fat. It seems to be an appropriate goal for feeding a growing VLBW premature infants.","energy requirements; nutrition; protein; very-low-birth-weight infants","protein; artificial milk; body composition; breast milk; clinical trial; conference paper; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; energy balance; human; low birth weight; major clinical study; newborn; oral drug administration; very low birth weight; weight gain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029118813

The programs fall into three basic categories: energy efficiency, load shifting, and interruptible power. Energy-efficiency programs include commercial chillers, residential insulation, heat-pump programs, and small unitary HVAC units. Load shifting programs include off-peak water heating, commercial cool storage, and industrial heat treating. Interruptible power includes air-conditioning cycling. standby generation, and interruptible service contracts. To get a broad sample, Duke decided to monitor 200 residential and 300 commercial sites. For residential sites, total load plus three end-use loads were monitored.

Optical absorption measurements indicate that the individual SiC grains consist of relatively defect-free β-SiC surrounded by high-defect density grain-boundary material. Nominally undoped material exhibits a low de conductivity (δ≈10-8 Ω-1 cm-1) in the dark and an efficient photoconductivity apon illumination with short-wavelength UV light. The temperature dependence of the de transport exhibits a quasi-Arrhenius-type behaviour with average activation energies of the order to 0.6 eV. A characteristic feature of this kind of transport is a continuous increase in activation energy with increasing film temperature. Upon doping with N, P and Al ions, the average activation energy is decreased and room temperature conductivities of the order of 0.1 Ω-1 cm-1 are reached. Doping with B ions, on the other hand, only leads to high-resistivity material. It is shown that the electronic transport in doped SiC-On-Sapphire (SiCOS) films can be successfully modelled in terms of a grain-boundary-dominated conduction process. In this process thermal activation across potential barriers at the grain-boundary surfaces competes with funneling through these same barriers. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","72.20; 72.80; 78.65","Activation energy; Doping (additives); Grain boundaries; Ion implantation; Light absorption; Optical variables measurement; Photoconductivity; Ultraviolet radiation; Grain boundary dominated conduction process; High-defect density grain-boundary material; Optical information storage; Optical lithography; Thermal activation; Thermal crystallization technique; Silicon carbide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029352194

The rate of transport of carbon to the deepest oceanic layers is rather insensitive to the atmosphereic-ocean surface gas exchange coefficient over a wide range, hence discrepancies between researchers on the precise global average value of this coefficient do not significantly affect predictions of atmospheric response to anthropogenic inputs. Upwelling velocity, on the other hand, amplifies oceanic response by increasing primary production in the upper ocean layers, resulting in a larger flux into DOC and sediments and increased carbon storage; experiments to reduce the uncertainty in this parameter would be valuable. The location of the carbon addition, whether it is released in the atmosphere or in the middle of the oceanic thermocline, has a significant impact on the maximum atmospheric CO2 concentration (pCO2) subsequently reached, suggesting that oceanic burial of a significant fraction of carbon emissions (e.g. via clathrate hydrides) may be an important management option for limiting pCO2 buildup. Our analysis indicates that the effectiveness of ocean burial decreases asymptotically below about 1000 m depth. With a constant emissions scenario (at 1990 levels), pCO2 at year 2100 is reduced from 501 ppmv considering all emissions go to the atmosphere, to 422 ppmv with ocean burial at a depth of 1000 m of 50% of the fossil fuel emissions. An alternative scenario looks at stabilizing pCO2 at 450 ppmv; with no ocean burial of fossil fuel emissions, the rate of emissions has to be cut drastically after the year 2010, whereas oceanic burial of 2 GtC/yr allows for a smoother transition to alternative energy sources. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"air-sea interactions; anthropogenic effect; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide emission; carbon storage; climate change; oceanic transport; upwelling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028984475

V. americana leaves have a dispersed structure and it was possible to measure the energy storage properties of the epidermal cells independently of the rest of the leaf. The abaxial epidermis had a higher value of ES at zero light fluence than the adaxial epidermis but ES in the abaxial epidermis declined much more rapidly with light fluence. Thus the abaxial epidermis is more suited to lower light fluences than the adaxial epidermis. ES declined as the pH rose from 4.0 to 8.0 at a constant dissolved inorganic carbon concentration. This paralleled the change from carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and suggests that these leaves utilise CO2 more efficiently than bicarbonate. ES increased by about 50% at pH 8.0 as leaf sections further from the leaf tip were examined which demonstrates that the older epidermal cells are less well able to use bicarbonate. Exposure to 30 min of a saturating light fluence caused the epidermal chloroplasts to move from the periclinal walls to the anticlinal walls. This decreased the photothermal signal by increasing the thermal diffusion distance and lowering the light fluence due to greater chloroplast shading. The latter effect increased ES. It appears that chloroplast movement could assist the epidermis to survive harmful light fluences. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","chloroplast movement; photosynthesis; photothermal deflection spectroscopy; Vallisneria americana",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0008592402

Experiments were performed at the LURE (Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation du Rayonnement Electro-magnétique), DCI (Dispositif de Collision sous Igloo) storage-ring with a Si (Li) detector, using local data handling and processing programs. A complex population of trace elements gives rise to interferences on the diagnostic Au-Lα line, namely from K-lines of lighter elements (Zn-Kα, Ge-Kα, Ga-Kα) and from the L-spectra ofTa and W, which were accounted forin data processing.

Distributions of age of first performance differed among task sets; tasks at increasing distance from the nest interior were performed later in life. However, individuals varied in the rate of passage through the task sequence. Weight of extractable lipids, corrected for differences in body weight, decreased with time elapsed since first performance of tasks outside the nest.

We suggest studies of the ontogenetic development of plant defense systems can help resolve the question. As an example of this approach to the cost question, we explore the problems associated with production of immobile chemical defenses that defend juvenile resin birches against browsing by mammals. From this exploration we draw two conclusions: (1) Shortly after germination, production of chemical defenses by small-seeded species, such as birch, is energetically costly. (2) Opposing selection for defense versus competitive ability in the seedling stage of birch has resulted in a trade-off in allocation of carbon to production of immobile chemical defense versus allocation of carbon to production of storage reserves. We suggest this trade-off results in a large indirect cost of defense because carbon used for production of immobile chemical defenses is unavailable for support of growth in the future, but stored carbon can be used to support future growth. © 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","cost; ontogeny; Plant chemical defense; seedling; storage","Betula spp.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028873084

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to measure changes in the oxidation state of the Ce and Ni present in the washcoat of the catalyst after various oxidation and reduction treatments and rate measurements of the carbon monoxide oxidation reaction were used to determine the reaction kinetics and activity. The catalyst was tested fresh and after hydrothermal aging at 1000°C under cyclic redox conditions. To determine which Ce species were present on the surface, we fit the XPS Ce(3d) data with combinations of spectra from standard materials (CeO2 and Ce2O3). Based on our measurements we conclude that aging the catalyst causes a loss of oxygen storage capacity due to sintering of the ceria particles which reduces the ceria/noble metal interaction and does not allow the Ce to cycle between oxidation states. In addition, hydrothermal aging causes the loss of oxygen storage of the Ni due to the irreversible formation of NiAl2O4. For the fresh catalyst, the observed kinetics for the uncycled carbon monoxide oxidation reaction show all of the signatures attributable to a catalyst with a high degree of ceria/noble metal interaction (complete suppression of the carbon monoxide inhibition effect, decreased sensitivity of the reaction rate to gas-phase oxygen concentration, and decreased apparent activation energy). Changes in the kinetics upon aging are consistent with a loss of ceria/noble metal contact area due to sintering of the ceria particles. © 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

The energy conversion at each instant of the deformation process is characterized by the instantaneous rate of energy storage, des dew, where es is the stored energy and ew is the mechanical energy expended on the plastic deformation. It has been shown experimentally that, in the initial stage of plastic deformation in this austenitic steel, the dependence of the rate des dew on ew exhibits a maximum. The location of the maximum depends on the grain size of the material. In fine-grained samples, the maximum appears at smaller strains. After reaching a certain degree of deformation, plots of des dew vs. the strain for the samples of both groups are practically the same.

This paper describes the distinctive qualities of the x-ray source technology necessary to prove the feasibility of the mine detection technique in the field. The imaging system requires that an x-ray beam, having a nominal illumination area on the ground of two centimeters by two centimeters, sweeps across a width of three meters in a time of 15 milliseconds or less. The source must produce an integrated flux of 106 x-rays (min) at 120 kVp (min) for each pixel. The source technology is based on a plasma-focused electron beam operating up to 140 kilovolts with a current of 0.7 ampere. The electron beam is magnetically shaped to form a thin ellipse with dimensions of approximately one millimeter by ten millimeters. The scanner is designed to run continuously with target temperature of 160 °F (max). The overall design allows the scanner to run with operational and auxiliary power generators in the field. A unique 400 hertz, 440 volt, 3-phase, SCR-controlled, low energy storage DC source, with low ripple and 1% voltage regulation, supplies the scanner with 100 kilowatts of power at up to 160 kilovolts. The uniqueness of the mine detection technique and scanner design limits radiation hazards: (1) focussing and tight collimation minimizes stray x-rays; (2) the x-rays travels directly into the ground and are mostly absorbed; (3) radiation leakage from the source is not permitted; and (4) backscatter radiation is strongly localized around the irradiation area, is directed upward and has a small angular distribution. © 1995 SPIE.","Detection; Electron beam; Heat dissipation; High voltage; High voltage power supply; Land mines; Scanner; X-ray generator; X-ray machine; X-rays","Angular distribution; Backscattering; Bombs (ordnance); Electron beams; Electron sources; Error detection; Heat losses; HVDC power transmission; Imaging techniques; Landmine detection; Radiation hazards; Scanning; Voltage regulators; X ray apparatus; High voltage; High voltage power supply; Land mine; Scanner; X ray generators; X ray machine; X rays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055471204

That a large area all sky monitor is an outstanding design was demonstrated by the BATSE (Burst And Transient Source Experiment) on board the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO). The proposed All Sky Low Energy Gamma-Ray Observatory (ALLEGRO) will combine the best characteristics of BATSE and OSSE (Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment), namely continuous all-sky coverage with a reduced background obtained from relatively narrow field of view collimation. The design goals call for an effective area of greater than or approximately equal to 2000 cm2 (in the 20- 200 keV range) provided by 35 separate detectors aligned to cover the entire sky, plus 1/8 ms time tagging of all events and energy coverage from 7 - 200 keV. We combine this with what have probably been the greatest advances in technology over the past few years, namely, advances in electronics, computing power, and data storage and retrieval. With these capabilities plus enhancements to the design based on our experience with BATSE and OSSE, we will explore the realm of high time resolution phase space with all-sky coverage at unprecedented sensitivity. Such a satellite will provide a myriad of fascinating studies of the hard x-ray sky. Three general areas where we expect to make major advances are the understanding of gamma-ray bursts, rotationally powered neutron stars, and binary x-ray sources. As an added bonus, this satellite will allow us to monitor the hard x-ray sky, provide hard x-ray maps, and even provide a stringent test of the general relativistic Shapiro delay. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

It provides x-ray beams of unprecedented quality in an energy range from hundred eV to several hundred keV. In order to fully exploit the source quality adequate x-ray beamline optics are needed that can cope with not only the very low emittance but also the extremely high brilliance involving severe heat load. The strategies and the solutions of x-ray optics research and development at the ESRF that started seven years ago are described. The results of first experience gathered during more than two years of beamline operation on the performances of mirrors, single crystal monochromators, and multilayer structures exposed to these very powerful x-ray beams are presented, together with their mechanical supports for bending, cooling, and alignment. New developments like Bragg-Fresnel optics for microfocusing, x-ray phase plates for polarization studies, adaptive optics, cryogenic cooling, diamond crystals, and other relevant optics materials are included, too. It is shown that today the x-ray optics developed for the ESRF are capable of preserving the high quality of the x-ray beams, a result that was not clear at all a few years ago. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The surface morphology of the microencapsulated LaNi5 was studied for different electroless plating conditions. The deactivation, regeneration, and catalytic activity of LaNi5 were compared before and after the microencapsulation. The amount of Cu deposited on the LaNi5 surface increased with increasing concentration of the plating solution. A relatively smooth morphology was obtained by decreasing the plating rate. The extent of the deactivation of the microencapsulated LaNi5 was very low compared to that of LaNi5 and decreases with the number of the microencapsulation. Almost complete regeneration was achieved for microencapsulated LaNi5, but the extent of the regeneration decreased with the number of regeneration cycles at higher temperatures. The microencapsulated LaNi5 showed a higher catalytic activity for methanation of carbon monoxide, where the conversion was almost quantitative. © 1995.","Electroless plating; Hydrogen storage alloys; Microencapsulation","Activation energy; Catalyst activity; Copper; Electroless plating; Encapsulation; Morphology; Particles (particulate matter); pH; Surfaces; Deactivation; Hydrogen storage alloy; Microencapsulation; Regeneration; Lanthanum alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029325683

The ion exchange material was a hydrous sodium crystalline silicotitanate, labeled TAM-5, which is being developed by Texas A&amp;M University, Sandia National Laboratories, and UOP Associates. Cesium distribution coefficients collected by Bray et al. on a NCAW simulated waste solution were predicted with deviations of less than 25% for solutions containing 1 M, 3 M, and 5 M Na+ and Na:Cs ratios of 103-108. The deviations were less than 5% for the solutions with 1 M Na+. Cesium distribution coefficients were also predicted and compared with values measured by Egan et al. for TAM-5 and for a storage tank supernate and a “newly generated” waste solution. Excellent results were obtained for the “newly generated” waste simulated solution, which did not contain potassium or rubidium. The predictions for the other simulated waste solution were significantly greater than the measured values, because of the presence of large concentrations of potassium or rubidium. The effect of competitive ion exchange between Cs, Rb, and K was not included in the theory. However, the effect of competitive exchange of Cs, Rb, and K appears to be greater for the Oak Ridge simulated waste solution than for the NCAW waste. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

The reduction of nitric oxide on the palladium catalysts is inhibited significantly by hydrocarbon. However, the reduction of nitric oxide was improved by the addition of cerium to the catalysts. The XPS and TPR studies showed that the presence of cerium provided palladium oxide in a hard-reduced state and suppressed the chemisorption of hydrocarbons on the palladium oxide. Additionally, cerium can increase the surface specific oxygen storage capacity and decrease the apparent activation energy for the reaction CO+NO→CO2+1/2N2.

A neglected area of such a science is the interrelationship between childbearing and chronic health conditions, such as obesity. Recent increases in guidelines for gestational weight gain (GWG) have raised concerns that these guidelines may contribute inadvertently to later obesity in women. On average, existing research shows that pregnancy accounts for small gains in postpartal weight, especially if the effects of aging are considered. However, there is great variability in postpartal weight gain, and some women, especially minority women, are more vulnerable to excessive weight gains following childbirth. Although GWG is an important predictor of postpartal weight gain, psychosocial factors, such as personal health patterns and stress, also may potentially contribute to women's weight gain after childbirth. Further research is needed to determine the impact of women's psychosocial context on postpartal weight. © 1995 The Society of Behavioral Medicine.",,"aging; caloric intake; childbirth; disease association; energy expenditure; health care delivery; health hazard; human; lipid storage; obesity; pregnancy complication; primary medical care; psychosocial disorder; puerperium; reproduction; review; risk assessment; weight gain",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029131976

Methods: Ten patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus and eight healthy volunteers were studied. Diabetic patients were well controlled under intensive insulin treatment (0.6 Ul/kg body weight, HbAlc = 5.5 ± 0.7%). During the 30 hours each subject spent in the respiration chamber VOz, VC02, respiratory quotient, daily energy intake, 24-hour, day-time, night-time and basal energy expenditure as well as energy expenditure during exercise (at 40% maximal exercise capacity), main substrate oxidation (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins) and overall diet-induced thermogenesis, were measured. The results were corrected for 24-hour urinary nitrogen loss. Results: Diet-induced thermogenesis, expressed as percent of energy intake, was found to be significantly lower in diabetic patients than in control subjects (6.69 ± 1.29% vs 11.8 ± 4.71% of energy intake, p < 0.05). A negative correlation was found between diet-induced thermogenesis and daily average glycemia for diabetic patients (r = —0.65, p < 0.01). Energy expenditure during exercise, calculated in terms of net work efficiency, was not different between the two groups. Conclusions: In conclusion, since diet-induced thermogenesis is highly correlated with the theoretical cost of glucose storage and since no difference was found in carbohydrate oxidation, glucose storage in diabetic patients is probably reduced when hyperglycemia occurs. Diabetic patients in good metabolic control are able to perform mild exercise with a work efficiency very similar to that of control subjects. © 1995 American College of Nutrition.","Energy expenditure; Indirect calorimetry; Respiration chamber; Type 1 diabetes","insulin; adult; article; caloric intake; clinical article; controlled study; energy balance; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; glucose blood level; human; hyperglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin treatment; male; thermogenesis; Adult; Anthropometry; Body Temperature Regulation; Carbohydrates; Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Human; Insulin; Lipids; Male; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen Consumption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029075765

Rapidly digging surf clams such as the tuatua (P. sub-triangulatum) and trough shell (Mactra discors) do not fare as well at low oxygen levels, but perform better under the functional anaerobiosis generated by burrowing, and energy production is supported by octopine dehydrogenase.

Optimisation of the composition of the active medium of a 10-J XeCl laser, as well as of the cavity parameters, discharge area, and interelectrode distance (or the initial voltage across a storage capacitor) of this laser is carried out either for a fixed initial voltage across the storage capacitor (fixed interelectrode distance) and for given parameters of the circuit. It is shown that the lasing efficiency, relative to the energy stored in the capacitors, can reach -6.5% both in the presence and absence of dissociation of NeXe+ ions, but in these two cases there is a major difference between the optimal conditions (composition, discharge area, etc.) under which the maximum efficiency is reached.

Tube resolution exceeded 16 1p/mm at 50% modulation. Breakdown is higher in a dielectric than in a vacuum.

This process is applicable to any device incorporating a proximity-focused MCP and screen, including streak tubes and gated MCP x-ray imagers. Other improvements discussed include a patented use of a collimator for eliminating the electrons that are elastically scattered from the screen. This method also provides for further improvement in screen gap limited resolution to any desired degree by eliminating electrons with high transverse energy.

Amorphous sucrose and lactose, being in high energy states, are thermodynamically and physically unstable. When exposed to high humidity, they took up moisture to a certain critical uptake level, depending on temperature, then crystallised and released the sorbed moisture. The crystallisation was described as a deactivation process as it ordered the constituent molecules as well as reduced the total energy content of the system. Water vapour uptake of amorphous sucrose and lactose reduced the glass transition temperature (Tg). The Tg was also affected by the heating rate during the DSC scan. When Tg was reduced to, or below, the operating temperature, transformation of the amorphous solids from the glassy state to the rubbery state occurred. The transformation set up conditions for crystallisation to occur. The time delay for crystallisation depended on the temperature difference between the operating temperature and Tg. © 1995.","Amorphous material; Crystallization; Disordered material; DSC; Glass transition temperature; Moisture sorption; Thermomechanical analysis","lactose; sucrose; article; crystallization; differential scanning calorimetry; drug storage; drug structure; humidity; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; spray drying; temperature; thermodynamics; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028957759

Initial thermoelastic stress wave propagation, cavitation bubble formation and material ejection were observed and recorded at the microsecond time-scale with 10-ns temporal resolution. Previously, the important role of tensile phase of thermoelastic stress that causes an efficient cavitation in irradiated volume and drives material ejection at temperatures substantially below 100 °C was demonstrated for aqueous solutions. The experiments reported here have confirmed possibility of similar ablation mechanism for biological tissues. The dynamics of material ejection upon short pulse ablation is dependent on incident laser fluence and tissue optical and mechanical properties. Ablation process duration increases from several microseconds to several hundred microseconds with the increase of water content in tissues and/or decrease of tissue mechanical strength. Duration time of ejection also increases with the rise of the absorbed energy density from the cavitation threshold to the thermal explosion threshold. On the basis of experimental data, cold ablation process in soft tissues upon short laser pulse irradiation is proposed to include two stages of material ejection: (1) initial ejection of subsurface layer due to the expansion and rupture of cavitation bubbles, (2) delayed ejection of bulk material due to the hydrodynamic motions stimulated by initial crater and also by collapse of large coalesced bubbles. © 1995 SPIE.

Both rings are being designed to permit a high circulating current of 3 A, corresponding to a beam particle number of 1.38 × 1014. Dose calculations were made to estimate the potential for radiation damages to the electronics and magnet coil insulation in the arc section of the tunnel. An analytical code, SHIELD11, was used to calculate the dose from photon and neutron radiations resulting from beam losses in various modes of operation. Several EGS4 Monte Carlo user codes were developed to calculate the dose from the synchrotron radiation escaping the vacuum chamber in stored beam mode. Two different LER vacuum chamber designs were studied: a 0.35-cm-thick copper wall chamber and a 1-cm-thick aluminum wall chamber with a copper absorber 6 m downstream of every dipole to absorb the synchrotron radiation in a local spot. The HER has a 0.5-cm-thick copper vacuum chamber. Shielding from the 5.4-m-long, C-shaped iron bending magnet for the HER was considered for the beam radiation, while no other structural shielding was assumed for the LER.

The Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) architecture, built around a low cost high performance platform (Personal Computers (PC) and Microsoft Windows NT), presents a very scaleable and distributed solution ideal for meeting the needs of client/server environments such as Tele-medicine, Tele-radiology, and PACS2. These image based systems typically require storage capacities mirroring those of film based technology (multi-terabyte with 10+ years storage) and patient data retrieval times at near on-line performance as demanded by radiologists. With the scaleable architecture, storage requirements can be easily configured to meet the needs of the small clinic (multi-gigabyte) to those of a major hospital (multi-terabyte). The patient data retrieval performance requirement was achieved by employing System Intelligence to manage migration and caching of archived data. Relevant information from HIS/RIS triggers prefetching of data whenever possible based on simple rules. System Intelligence embedded in the Migration manager allows the clustering of patient data onto a single tape during data migration from optical to tape medium. Clustering of patient data on the same tape eliminates multiple tape loading and associated seek time during patient data retrieval. Optimal tape performance can then be achieved by utilizing the tape drives high performance data streaming capabilities thereby reducing typical data retrieval delays associated with streaming tape devices. © 1995 SPIE.

A promising solution is proposed consisting of a mobile electron accelerator, installed on a couple of trucks and traveling from one customer to another. The energy of the accelerated electrons was chosen at 5 MeV, with 10 to 50 kW beam power. The irradiation is possible either with electrons or with bremsstrahlung. A major problem of the above solution is the provision of adequate shielding at the customer, with a minimum investment cost. Plans for a bunker are presented, which houses the truck carrying the radiation head. The beam is vertical downwards, through the truck floor, through a transport pipe and a scanning horn. The irradiation takes place in a pit, where the products are transported through a belt. The belt path is so chosen as to minimize openings in the shielding. Shielding calculations are presented supposing a working regime with 5 MeV bremsstrahlung. Leakage and scattered radiation are taken into account. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149211843

One of the most interesting of these processes is the sparking of the vacuum to produce lepton-antilepton pairs. The process of electron capture from vacuum pair production is a principal beam-loss mechanism for highly charged relativistic ions in a storage ring, and thus must be considered in the design and the operation of these machines. In this paper, we present calculated impact-parameter-dependent probabilities and cross sections for muon capture from vacuum production in collisions of relativistic heavy ions by solving the time-dependent Dirac equation in unrestricted three-dimensional space using lattice-collocation techniques. Calculations are performed for muon-pair production with capture into the K-shell in collisions of 197Au + 197Au at collider kinetic energies of 2 GeV per nucleon. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5344266258

Electron time-of-flight (TOF) spectrometers which utilize the time structure of the electron bunches in the storage ring are particularly well-suited to study simultaneous double-ionization processes due to their ability to detect electrons of all kinetic energies simultaneously within a certain acceptance angle.

Specific features of the experimental setup are the high electron density (up to 1010 cm-3) and the high magnetic field (up to 1 T) in the electron target, which exceed the corresponding numbers for typical electron coolers in storage rings by nearly two orders of magnitude. This provides unique possibilities to study new effects in electron-ion recombination. A previous experiment with U28+ ions has shown a large enhancement of the recombination rate at low center-of-mass energies, where the dominating contribution is expected from radiative recombination. The observed rates exceed theoretical calculations by more than an order of magnitude. For the clarification of this observation we extended the previous measurement up to a center-of-mass energy E = 450 eV, checking the possibility of fortuitous resonances of dielectronic recombination near zero center-of-mass energy. The analysis of Rydberg sequences in the observed spectrum of resonances does not suggest the presence of DR at E = 0. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342371833

Less attention has been devoted to the transport and redistribution of solutes caused by heating. Solar radiation, radioactive waste repositories, underground energy storage, buried electric cables and steam pipes, disposal of waste heat from power plants are examples of heat sources in the soil. Soil-water properties, such as surface tension, viscosity, density, as well as the equilibrium composition of phases, depend on temperature. Hence, nonuniform heating of a soil partially saturated by saline water has an effect on such processes as water flow under capillary and gravitational forces, evaporation, condensation and diffusion of vapor and transport and precipitation of salts. A mathematical model is presented for the migration of salts in the vadoze zone in the soil under nonisothermal conditions, taking into account the above-mentioned phenomena. The physical assumptions underlying the model are briefly discussed. The study of a particular case shows that under certain conditions, a heat source may attract dissolved salts, and cause their precipitation in the hot area. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","diffusion; evaporation; heat; nonisothermal transport; Porous media; precipitation; salinity; unsaturated zone","Heat Transfer; Migration; Salt; diffusion; evaporation; heat; heat source; mathematical model; non-isothermal transport; nonisothermal transport; porous medium; precipitation; salinity; solute transport; unsaturated zone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029413222

This colloidal sulfur acted as intermediate energy storage and was transferred by contact to daughter cells not directly attached to the sulfide substrate. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Bioleaching; Sulfide oxidation; Sulfur colloids; Thiobacillus ferrooxidans","sulfide; sulfur; Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans; article; bacterial metabolism; energy metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; transmission electron microscopy; Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans; Bacteria (microorganisms); Thiobacillus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029043541

Aposematic last-instar larvae were fed with ouabain and other cardiac glycosides of differing polarities. Time course experiments show that ouabain is sequestered in the integument within 48 hr after feeding, whereas midgut tissue and hemolymph function as transient CG storage compartments. About 63% of ouabain was transferred from larvae to the butterflies, whereas 37% of ouabain was lost with larval and pupal exuviae and with the meconium. The main sites of storage in imagines are wings and integument. If mixtures of CGs are fed to D. plexippus larvae, differential sequestration can be observed: The polar ouabain contributes 58.8% of total CGs, followed by digitoxin (19.6%), oleandrin (10.6%), digoxin (4.9%), digoxigenin (4.6%) and proscillaridin A (1.5%). Thus, uptake and sequestration must be selective processes. Uptake of [3H]ouabain in vitro by isolated larval midguts was time-, pH-, and temperature-dependent and displayed an activation energy of 49 kJ/mol. Furthermore, the in vitro uptake of ouabain was inhibited (probably competitively) by the structurally similar convallatoxin. These data provide first evidence that ouabain uptake does not proceed by simple diffusion but with the aid of a carrier mechanism, which would explain the differential cardenolide uptake observed in living larvae. © 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","cardenolides; carrier; chemical defense; Danaus plexippus; integument; midgut; sequestration; uptake","Danaus plexippus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028850899

Growth, the amount of lipid in the tissue, and reproductive activity were measured simultaneously at fortnightly intervals during the summer months when production of planulae was expected, and monthly for the cooler period of the year. Two group of corals could be identified: those which produced brooded larvae and formed ova and sperm during gametogenesis, and those which did not brood larvae and produced only sperm. Although they exhibited no morphological differences, these two groups displayed different patterns of energy allocation to growth, reproduction and lipid storage. Corals which did not produce brooded larvae grew one and a half times faster and had more lipid for storage after reproduction than those which produced brooded larvae. Corals that brooded larvae had more structural lipid before release of larvae than those without brooded larvae, reflecting a greater volume of reproductive material rich in lipid. These results demonstrate a substantial cost of reproduction since corals which did not produce brooded larvae and ova put more resources into grwoth and storage of lipid. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002443365

Electrochemical measurements were taken of two different AB5-type alloys, one with manganese and one without manganese (LaNi3.4Co1.2Al0.4 and LaNi3.4Co1.2Al0.3Mn0.1).

Through the coherent generation of radiation, they provide as much as 12 orders of magnitude increase in peak power over the third generation storage ring machines of today. Facilities have been proposed which will extend the operating wavelength of these devices well beyond the reach of existing solid state laser technology. In addition, it appears possible to generate pulses of unprecedented brevity, down to a few femtoseconds, with mJ pulse energies. The combination of these attributes has stimulated considerable interest in short wavelength FELs for experiments in chemical, surface and solid state physics, biology and materials science.

However, there are several problems related to ODWT: as a time-frequency analyzer, the time-frequency resolution and localization of ODWT are poor; from a spectral analysis point of view, the ODWT produces a distorted spectrum with energy leaking, aliasing, and magnitude distortion; to produce a reasonable time-varying spectrum, the signal is required to be octave-distributed with a spectral shape matching the spectra of the wavelets. To overcome these problems, a new approach for designing the optimal wavelet is proposed. Using the multiresolution parametric spectral estimator, the new method continuously tracks the time-varying signal to adapt the optimal wavelets, and yields high resolution, localization, and fidelity for the resulting time-frequency decomposition. When the optimal wavelets act as matched filters they can greatly reduce broadband background noise in the decomposition process. © 1995 SPIE.

Thus, cold-storage warehouse and food-processing plant owners should only contract qualified technicians to install cold-storage doors.",,"Cold storage; Collision avoidance; Costs; Electric rates; Food processing; Heat losses; Industrial plants; Polyvinyl chlorides; Speed; Trucks; Warehouses; Energy costs; Food processing plants; High temperature differentials; Polyvinyl chloride curtain doors; Power operated sliding doors; Power operators; Thermal energy loss; Doors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029290119

As a result there has been continued interest in the development of new materials. One major weakness in the development of improved materials has been the lack of clear understanding of structure/property relationships. This paper deals with the determination of visco-elastic properties such as E′ (Storage modulus) and tan δ (damping factor) of four commercial materials. They represent the broad range of chemical types available for denture base soft liners. A DMA study of four materials: (1) Molloplast B (silicone); (2) Novus (phosphazine); (3) Kurepeet (fluropolymer); and (4) Super Soft (acrylic) was made using a Perkin-Elmer DMA-7. Samples were made following the manufacturers' instructions, in the form of sheets 1.5 mm thick and 15.0 mm square. The samples were tested compressively using a 3 mm flat tip probe cycled at a frequency of 1 Hz. Wet and dry specimens were evaluated for E′ and tan δ over a 5-95°C temperature range. Water sorption was determined gravimetrically at 37°C. Changes in E′ between the wet and dry conditions for Molloplast (B), Kurepeet and Super Soft were insignificant. A significant increase in tan δ for wet Novus was observed, suggesting that the material is capable of dissipating more energy. The 'wet' modulus (E′) is about 42% lower than the ""dry"" modulus (E′). This difference may be attributed to the very high water sorption (34%) of Novus. i.e. the significant decrease in E′ indicates plasticization due to sorbed water. Changes in visco-elastic properties seem to occur for materials which take up large amounts of water at 37°C. DMA is found to be a useful supplement for the evaluation of soft lining materials in conjunction with the standard mechanical test methods. © 1995 Chapman & Hall.",,"Acrylics; Characterization; Fluorine containing polymers; Plasticity; Plasticizers; Silicones; Sorption; Viscoelasticity; Damping factor; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Phosphazine; Plasticization; Soft liners; Storage moduli; Dental materials; polyacrylic acid; polymer; silicone; article; compression; denture; mechanics; priority journal; viscoelasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029278579

During storage in plasma, free fatty acids are major oxidative fuels. Glutamine is also present as a potential fuel but relatively little is metabolized beyond glutamate. In synthetic media, acetate is oxidized and provides a poorly understood buffering function. In the current work, acetate and pyruvate (6 to 25 mmol/l, sometimes with their 14-c- labeled counterparts) were added to PCs stored in plasma. They were both vigorously metabolized, predominantly to CO2 (0.51 ± 0.08 and 0.31 ± 0.06 mmol/d/1012 platelets for acetate and pyruvate, respectively). The metabolism of these exogenous substrates was associated with significantly increased oxygen consumption and decreased glucose consumption, fatty acid oxidation, and bicarbonate utilization for buffering. In a more limited number of studies, similar findings were observed with addition of beta- hydroxy-butyrate. Superior maintenance of pH in the presence of these additives could be attributed to the fact that the metabolism of an organic anion requires that a proton be brought with the anion into the metabolic pathway, thus providing an alkalinizing effect. Pyruvate (but not acetate) also stimulated the metabolism of glutamate. Studies with 14-C-labeled glucose suggested significant activity of the hexose-monophosphate shunt during PC storage and confirmed that little, if any, pyruvate derived from glucose was fully oxidized. Taken together, the results provide a relatively complete picture of the pathways of energy metabolism used by platelets during PC storage and suggest a strategy by which organic anions such as acetate can be used to improve the results of such storage.",,"acetic acid; bicarbonate; fatty acid; glucose; glutamine; hydroxybutyric acid; oxygen; pyruvic acid; thrombocyte concentrate; article; controlled study; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; glycolysis; human; human cell; human experiment; human tissue; normal human; oxidation; oxygen consumption; pH measurement; priority journal; thrombocyte metabolism; thrombocyte preservation; thrombocyte transfusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028929437

Recording spectroscopic information, i.e. 1-dimensional images, requires only a few sensitive lines of a 2-dimensional CCD array. A camera is presented where the unexposed part of the CCD is used as a buffer to store successive spectra with high frame rates. In this 'streak mode' the time resolution for data acquisition depends only on the line shift time of the CCD and no longer on the slow pixel readout time. A frame rate of 10 kHz for X-ray absorption spectra has been achieved. The CCD is part of an X-ray camera consisting of a scintillating screen lens-coupled to the CCD. The camera provides a high dynamic range of 17 bit, a spatial resolution of 60 μm (FWRM) and a high detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of >40% for Xray energies between 4 keV and 25 keY. The camera is used for time-resolved energy-dispersive XAFS (X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) experiments.

The ring within the retinal chromophore of BR5.12 blocks the C-13=C-14 isomerization proposed to be a primary step in the energy storage/transduction mechanism in the BR photocycle. Relative to the native BR pigment (BR-570), the absorption spectrum of BR5.12 is red-shifted by 8 nm. The fluorescence spectrum of BR5.12 closely resembles that of BR-570 although the relative fluorescence yield is higher (≃10-fold). Picosecond transient absorption (4-ps pulses, 568-662 nm) measurements reveal an intermediate absorbing to the red side of BR5.12. Kinetic fits show that the red-absorbing intermediate appears within <3 ps and decays with a time constant of 17 ± 1 ps to form only BR5.12. No emission in the 650- to 900- nm region can be attributed to the red-absorbing species. Since rotation around C-12-C-13 and isomerization around C-13=C-14 are prevented in BR5.12, these results demonstrate that motion in these regions of the retinal is (i) necessary to form the K-like intermediate observed in the native BR-570 photocycle and (ii) not necessary to form a red-absorbing intermediate that has spectral and kinetic properties analogous to those of J-625 in the native BR photocycle.

The maximum shield temperature may be much higher than that for the blanket because radiation damage is significantly reduced. During the dwell period, thermal power discharged from the shield and coolant temperature are simultaneously regulated by controlling the coolant mass flow rate at the shield inlet. This is facilitated by throttled coolant bypass. Design concepts using helium and lithium coolant have been developed.

In spite of numerous efforts, finding a simple technique for predicting the recovery of the liver after ischemic damage is still an unresolved problem. During the ischemic storage of isolated rat livers at 25°C, tissue concentrations of high energy phosphates, glycogen and lactate were determined photometrically and, in comparison, the metabolic rate was measured continuously by direct calorimetry. In addition, interstitial pH was measured with microelectrodes. In a second series of experiments these results were compared with functional recovery after ischemia and reperfusion. Following ischemic storage at 25°C for 60, 120 and 240 min, the isolated livers were reperfused for 30 min in a non-recirculating system with a constant flow rate. During reperfusion, functional recovery as assessed by oxygen consumption and bile flow was determined. At the end of reperfusion, tissue samples were taken for biochemical analysis of adenine nucleotides and tissue lactate. Though the ATP concentration drops within 60 min of ischemia to 6.94% of the control value without further significant change, the metabolic rate measured continuously by direct calorimetry decreases in an exponential manner. According to the calorimetrically measured heat output, functional hepatic metabolism, as assessed by oxygen consumption, bile flow and restoration of high energy phosphates during reperfusion, recovered to an extent depending on the duration of ischemia. It is concluded that the metabolic rate of the ischemic rat liver, as determined continuously by direct calorimetry, is a good predictor for recovery after ischemic damage. © 1995.","ATP; Ischemia; Liver; Metabolic rate; Microcalorimetry; Reperfusion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149321528

Its occurrence can, however, be seen in many ways: i) For constant composition of the system and a reference temperature lower than Tgel, the storage modulus G′ is larger than the loss modulus G″ in the glass transition zone of the master curve and both vary in an almost parallel manner with the angular frequency ω over almost two decades (whereas this feature is normally found for other gelling systems within the rubber plateau or the flow region). ii) The entanglement molecular weight obtained from G″max is markedly less max than the entanglement molecular weight in the melt divided by φ{symbol}2, the volume fraction of the polymer. iii) The temperature influences change from WLF like to Arrhenius-like behavior as T is lowered in the case of highly concentrated polymer solutions; analogous considerations hold true as φ{symbol}2 is increased at constant T. iv) For sufficiently low temperatures, the activation energy of flow exhibits a maximum in the concentration range where the gelation is - according to DSC experiments - most pronounced. Like with ordinary non-gelling systems it is possible to construct master curves. On the basis of Graessley's theory identical dependencies are obtained for the variation of the entanglement parts of the stationary viscosity with shear rate and for the dependence of the entanglement part of the complex viscosity on the frequency ω of oscillation. Zero shear viscosity and limiting value of the complex viscosity for vanishing ω as a function of φ{symbol}2 match smoothly and exhibit two points of inflection. © 1995 Steinkopff Verlag.","2-propanol; activation energies of flow; concentration and temperature influences; entanglement molecular weights; glass transition; loss modulus; poly(n-butyl methacrylate); storage modulus; Thermoreversible gelation; viscosity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043208664

This machine, which would operate in a pulsed mode, would feature reduced capital and operating costs compared with steady-state devices requiring complex current drive systems. However, a pulsed reactor would need an energy storage system and face greater structural demands from cyclic fatigue. This paper presents the results of the fatigue analyses for the plasma-facing components of PULSAR. PULSAR features two major engineering designs: a liquid lithium-cooled vanadium alloy design and a helium-cooled silicon carbide composite design. Results are given for each. It is shown that the superior thermal and strength properties of the vanadium alloy allow a much wider spectrum of design options. The SiC composite properties cause significantly more difficulty for the designer and, in particular, no credible design is found for a divertor fabricated solely from the SiC composite. This conclusion is based on current (limited) data for the thermophysical properties and fatigue strength of SiC fiber composites. The developments in these composites needed to create a viable SiC composite diverter are discussed. © 1995.",,"Helium; Lithium; Silicon carbide; Strength of materials; Thermodynamic properties; Tokamak devices; Vanadium alloys; Divertor; First wall; Inductive current drive; Plasma facing components; Pulsed reactor; Fatigue of materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029277580

Results showed that customers decrease peak electricity use and increase off-peak electricity use significantly under TOU tariffs. Also, it was indicated that large social benefits can be obtained from load management by indirect control of loads via a TOU rate structure. Generally, the magnitude of welfare gain closely depends on the customers' response to TOU schedule.

This objective was mainly pursued by means of a self-consistent, theoretical assessment in order to remain independent from test image. The six statistical parameters are energy, contrast, variance, correlation, entropy and inverse difference moment, which are considered the most relevant among the 14 originally proposed by Haralick et al. The functional analysis supporting theoretical considerations was based on natural clustering in the feature space of segment texture values. The results show that among the six GLCM statistical parameters, five different sets can be identified, each set featuring a specific textural meaning. The first set contains energy and entropy, while the four remaining parameters can be regarded as belonging to four different sets. Two parameters, energy and contrast, are considered to be the most efficient for discriminating different textural patterns. A new GLCM statistical parameter, recursivity, is presented in order to replace energy which presents some degree of correlation with contrast. It is demonstrated that in some cases it may be reasonable to replace the computation of GLCM with that of GLDH (Gray Level Difference Histogram), in order to benefit by a better compromise between texture measurement accuracy, computer storage and computation time.",,"Computational methods; Data storage equipment; Entropy; Inverse problems; Recursive functions; Response time (computer systems); Statistical methods; Gray level cooccurrence matrix; Gray level difference histogram; Inverse difference moment; Statistical parameters; Textural characteristics; Variance; Image analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029273845

Hence, the corresponding continuum theory is capable of modeling dissipative behavior associated with phase transformations which has potential applications in the design of adaptive structures. The present work indicates that this dissipative behavior is characterized by a material function, called the driving-traction-response function, which is uniquely determined by the strain energy potential of the material.

A key requirement of such batteries is that the density of energy stored electrochemically in the electrodes is high. In this context, the use of organic materials has attracted interest; they combine high theoretical energy storage capability with low weight and good mechanical strength. Here we report the development of a rechargeable lithium battery with a composite organic cathode based on a mixture of a dimercaptan and polyaniline. The redox behaviour of the dimercaptan, which is normally too slow for practical applications1, 2, is accelerated when coupled to that of the polyaniline3–5 (which itself functions as an active cathode material). Intimate mixing of the two materials is achieved by casting them jointly from solution. The resulting electrode can be repeatedly charged to near its theoretical limit and discharged. The gravimetric energy density of our materials exceeds that of the oxide electrodes in commercially available lithium-ion batteries6, a feature that is likely to prove advantageous in applications where weight, rather than volume, is a critical factor. © 2015 Nature Publisher Group.",,"aniline derivative; lithium; organic compound; oxide; article; electric battery; electrochemistry; electrode; energy resource; gravimetry; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028800764

The central (third) metatarsal is greatly reduced proximally, completely excluded from anterior view and nearly to completely excluded in dorsal aspect. This bone forms a wedge shape distally, triangular in transverse cross section, which is buttressed against the more columnar metatarsals II and IV. This morphology forms a tightly bound structure, here termed the arctometatarsalian condition. Morphometric analysis indicates that the arctometatarsalian structure is significantly more elongate and gracile than underived metatarsi, and this structure is associated with relatively elongate distal hind limbs per unit femoral length. When compared with limb proportions of modern and extinct mammals and flightless birds, these limb proportions are seen to be consistent with a hypothesis of enhanced cursoriality in the derived theropods. In some genera, intrametatarsal mobility in this structure may have served as an energy storage system analogous to the snap-ligaments of modern equids. The wedge-and-buttress morphology would have resulted in a more direct transmission of locomotory forces to the epipodium than in less derived theropods. Biomechanical analysis indicates that this type of relatively gracile pes was not significantly weaker than pedes of underived theropods with regards to bending stresses, due to elongation into the parasagittal plane. To the contrary, these metatarsi were well designed to withstand the forces and stresses associated with enhanced cursorial ability. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890308061

On the other hand, highly cooled ions tend to become unstable. This implies that once the ion beam upper density limit is attained, the electron current intensity has to be reduced to a level which prevents the ion beam instability and maintains low emittances. An adiabatic-type gun [4-6] has been constructed, which provides low-temperature electrons of large, but variable densities. The electron current density is adjusted through the voltage control, Ug, of a so-called grid electrode. Its main drawback is the storage of secondary electrons when the grid potential is larger than the anode potential, thus inducing a reduction of the nominal electron current intensity. A detailed analysis of the storage process is presented, and the way to cure this drawback is explained.

The performance of these models is examined in detail. One model solves the non-linear differential equation for heat diffusion in solids using a set of submodels for surface energy budget components. The model performance is examined under three desert conditions thought to be a strong test of the submodels. The accuracy of the temperature predictions and submodels is described. The accuracy of the model is generally good but some discrepancies between some of the submodels and measurements are noted. The sensitivity of the submodels is examined and is seen to be strongly controlled by interaction and feedback among energy components that are a function of surface temperature. The second model simulates vegetation canopies with detailed effects of surface geometry on radiant transfer in the canopy. Foliage solar absorption coefficients are calculated using a radiosity approach for a three layer canopy and long wave fluxes are modeled using a view factor matrix. Sensible and latent heat transfer through the canopy are also simulated using nearby meteorological data but heat storage in the canopy is not included. Simulations for a coniferous forest canopy are presented and the sensitivity of the model to environmental inputs is discussed. © 1995 SPIE.

A laser optically pumped polarized 3He internal gas target has been used with circulating beams of 197-414 MeV polarized protons to carry out an extensive set of measurements of spin dependent scattering. A large acceptance non-magnetic detector system consisting of wire-chambers, scintillators and microstrip detectors was used to detect protons, neutrons, deuterons, and 3He nuclei from the beam-target interaction. It is demonstrated that these techniques result in low backgrounds (&lt; 1%) due to scattering from species other than the polarized target gas and allow detection of low energy recoiling nuclei. Specific issues such as interfacing the experiment to the storage ring and monitoring the luminosity and polarizations are discussed in detail. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000342680

At present, considerable amount of waste heat is emitted from metallurgical and chemical industries, which can be used not only for municipal purposes but also for industries if recovered. In this paper, fundamental studies on heat transfer was conducted for developing a heat storage process by latent heat for recovering the high temperature waste heat over 500 K. Heat transfer experiments were attempted for a single encapsulated phase change materials and for a packed bed. Six different materials were tested as PCM from the points of view of high energy density storage, chemical stability, non-toxicity and cost performance. Those were two inorganic and four metallic materials. A single capsule containing PCM was heated for heat storage and then cooled for heat release in nitrogen gas stream where convective heat transfer was predominant. The metal PCMs were found to be excellent for heat storage because of uniform temperature in the capsule. Heat transfer simulation was also conducted for a packed bed process of spherical capsules providing the fundamental informations on the optimal design. As a result, concurrent flow for heat storage and release showed better result for effective use of storaged heat than counter-current flow. Exergy efficiency was also evaluated. © 1995.",,"Cooling; Costs; Energy efficiency; Heat convection; Heat losses; Inorganic compounds; Packed beds; Toxicity; Waste heat utilization; Chemical stability; Concurrent flow; Counter current flow; Exergy efficiency; Latent heat; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029196682

The beam line comprises a 31 m long vacuum duct within an axial magnetic field and a following electrostatic guided section. In order to vary the energy of a positron beam dedicated to depth-profile measurements, a high voltage station capable of applying 60 kV has been installed in the beam transport system. The target assembly (a water-cooled tantalum rod of 5 radiation lengths and a moderator with multiple tungsten vanes) and the following straight section (8 m; used for positron storage) are under high voltage. The beam duct located downstream is at ground potential. Positron beams passing through this region have a high kinetic energy. A focusing triplet quadrupole lens and a moderator on the retarding electrode are located at the end of the magnetic transport. This beam line has 9 right-angle-curved ducts, comprising a radius of curvature of 40 cm. Positrons with a maximum energy of 60 keV are guided by bending magnets attached to the beam-transport ducts. A transport system to switch from magnetically guided to electrostatically guided has been installed. The design of the brightness-enhancement stage of the positron beam for positron re-emission microscopy is in progress. In a preliminary experiments at 2.0 GeV with a 2 kW primary beam, 4×106e+/s of slow positrons were observed by detecting annihilation γ-rays at the end of the magnetic beam-transport line.

Heating-cooling cycles were designed in accordance with earlier calorimetric and spectroscopic studies of thermal transitions of human stratum corneum lipids and/or proteins. Two different protocols were used. (A) Heat treatment and electrical analysis were carried out simultaneously in pH 7.4 phosphate buffered saline, starting with prehydrated stratum corneum (70% w/w) of pH 7.4. (B) Heat treatment was performed before electrical analysis, using dried stratum corneum (&lt; 10% w/w), followed by prehydration and measurement of the electrical properties in phosphate buffered saline at 20°C. Square-wave alternating current pulses of 13 μA cm-2 were applied every 60 s. Analysis of the resulting voltage waveform across stratum corneum yielded an equivalent electrical model of stratum corneum composed of a series connection of two RC circuits (R1∥C1 and R2∥C2). Below 60°C a constant activation energy of 5.4 ± 0.7 kcal mol-1 was measured, which was close to the activation energy of K+ diffusion in a fluid aqueous medium. The total resistance of stratum corneum was less than 100 kΩ cm2, which is very low compared to the resistance of black lipid membranes (1-10 MΩ cm2). Both the low activation energy and resistance of human stratum corneum suggest the presence of highly conductive pathways through the membrane. Between 60 and 75°C an abrupt decline of the resistances R1 and R2 and a rapid rise of the capacitances C1 and C2 was observed. This temperature interval corresponded to the temperature interval of the second thermal transition observed in human stratum corneum, which is a lipid phase transition. Beyond 75°C, the resistances were fairly constant, while the capacitances continued to increase. The changes in the resistances and capacitances brought about by heating to 75 and 95°C were completely irreversible. This is in agreement with X-ray diffraction studies, which have shown that the originally predominant lamellar structure with a repeat distance of 6.4 nm does not reappear after recrystallization from 75 and 90°C. The final resistances after heating desiccated stratum corneum (≤ 10% w/w hydration) to temperatures of 75 and 95°C and subsequent cooling were less different from the original values than those of hydrated samples, suggesting that the impact of heating depends on the level of stratum corneum hydration. After chloroform-methanol lipid extraction, stratum corneum was characterized by a single RC circuit. The resistance of extracted stratum corneum was less than 1% of the original pre-extraction value, which indicates that the resistance of stratum corneum is mainly determined by the intercellular lipids. Taken together, the correlation between the temperature dependence of the resistances and capacitances between 20 and 75°C suggests that the electrical barrier and the charge storage capacity of stratum corneum are determined by the same substructures. Most probably these structures are the intercellular lipid lamellae, because the changes of the electrical properties mainly take place within the interval 60 to 75°C, which corresponds to the phase transition of free intercellular lipids, and also because these changes are irreversible. This conclusion is also confirmed by chloroform-methanol extraction. However, the continued increases of the capacitances between 75 and 95°C, indicates that the charge storage capacity of stratum corneum also depends on lipids attached to protein. The low resistance and activation energy at temperatures between 20 and 60°C indicate that stratum corneum possesses highly conductive pathways. © 1995.","Capacitance; Human skin barrier; Resistance; Skin; TA",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009353287

This tool is seeing ever wider application in a range of industries, including aerospace industry, marine industry, and building trades. The automotive industry is beginning to explore the application of SEA to high frequency vehicle acoustic design. The SEA model of vibrational power transmission has a direct analogy to thermal power transmission (diffusion). As thermal power flow is proportional to temperature difference, vibrational power flow is proportional to modal energy difference. In this paper the thermal analogy is exploited to visualize the SEA results. This is accomplished by color coding a finite element representation of the structure. In this paper, the thermal analogy is used to correlate test data with SEA model results. This is accomplished by constructing a test based modal power thermogram. The test based modal powers are calculated from a space averaged velocity and a space averaged drive point impedance. The drive point impedance is a representation of a mass normalized modal density. Dividing the mean square velocity by the averaged impedance results in an estimate of the energy divided by the modal density (modal power). This test derived quantity is then used to construct a thermogram in the same sense as the analytical results. The correlation of the test and analytical thermograms then insures that the desired response is correctly predicted and that the energy transfer path is also correct. This insures that the proper response is calculated and that the model is robust. This procedure is applied to a D-class trimmed body for structureborne input. The structureborne response is calculated and test and analytical thermograms are shown.",,"Acoustic impedance; Aerospace industry; Automotive industry; Digital storage; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Energy management; Energy transfer; Marine industry; Power transmission; Temperature measuring instruments; Thermography (temperature measurement); Analytical results; Complex dynamic systems; Finite-element representation; High frequency HF; Mean square velocity; Statistical energy analysis; Temperature differences; Vehicle acoustics; Testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072501780

At the same time, the engine consumes more gasoline and emits more pollutants in the form of CO, HC, NOX. The thermal comfort in the passenger compartment is also poor. To avoid or minimize some of these problems, Valeo Engine Cooling is developing a new, economical system, the Insulated Expansion Tank (IET), which makes it possible to instantaneously heat the engine coolant by sensible heat from the IET, the volume of this tank has been increased especially for this application. The component actually has two functions: 1.Allows for expansion and degassing of the cooling circuit 2.Thermal storage of sensible heat The IET is installed in the engine cooling circuit according to figure 1. Temperature and flow rate controls work according to the servo schematic depending on the coolant temperature inside the IET during an engine cold start. The IET can transfer 150 to 200 Wh of thermal energy into the engine cooling circuit in a very short time; less than 30 seconds. However, the heat flux is equivalent to 18 to 24 kW. Two types of servo controls have been studied: ELECTRONIC CONTROLS-more efficient, but with higher costs. The components are: the electronic control unit, a (3) way electric solenoid valves and temperature sensors. THERMOSTATIC CONTROLS-(mechanical) This solution requires only one 3 way thermostatic valve. The performance is similar to the electronic control, but the cost is less.

Establishing stable and reasonably priced sources of methanol (in particular) and of alternative fuels generally is essential to their demonstration and commercialization. Development both of vehicle technologies and of fuel supply and distribution are complementary and must proceed in parallel. However, the sequence of scaling up supply and distribution is not necessarily smooth; achievement of volume thresholds in demand and through-put of alternative fuels are marked by different kinds of challenges. Four basic conditions should be met in establishing a fuel supply: (1) it must be price competitive with petroleum-based fuels, at least when accounting for environmental and performance benefits; (2) bulk supply must be meet volumes required at each phase; necessitating resilience among suppliers and a means of designating priority for high value users; (3) distribution systems must be reliable, comporting with end users' operational schedules; (4) volatility in prices to the end user for the fuel must be minimal. The California Energy Commission's California Fuel Methanol Reserve (CFMR), based on a framework of agreements with the methanol industry to mobilize private sector storage and distribution facilities was designed in an effort to meet these conditions. However, conditions in the world methanol markets have threatened to overwhelm the price/supply stabilization hitherto provided by the CFMR, with demand for methanol as a feedstock for MTBE pricing methanol out of the existing direct fuel market. California clean air regulations include a mandatory ""make-available"" provision for alternative fuels, including methanol, once alternative-fueled vehicle production reaches certain thresholds. Because of the gradual market development thus far, triggering of these provisions may affect the situation but is unlikely to alter it dramatically. Current and projected fuel volumes appear to be insufficient to induce necessary economies of scale in production and distribution for fuel use. Despite their benefits, existing programs will suffer absent measures to secure economical fuel supplies. One solution is to develop sources that are dedicated to fuel markets and located within the end-use region. Methanol still represents an important alternative fuel, since it is readily available from renewable sources, offers clean air benefits and is an excellent energy carrier, especially for advanced vehicle propulsion systems such as fuel cells. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Commerce; Costs; Demonstrations; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Propulsion; Vehicles; California energy commissions; Clean air regulations; Demonstration programs; Distribution facilities; Distribution systems; Economies of scale; Methanol industries; Performance benefits; Alternative fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072444401

The major divisions of responsibility are: system analysis, engine design, and kinetics modeling by LLNL; performance and emission testing, and friction reduction by SNL; computational fluid mechanics and combustion modeling by LANL. This project is a component of the Department of Energy, Office of Utility Technology, National Hydrogen Program. We report here on the progress on system analysis and preliminary engine testing. We have done system studies of series hybrid automobiles that approach the PNGV design goal of 34 km/liter (80 mpg), for 384 km (240 mi) and 608 km (380 mi) ranges. Our results indicate that such a vehicle appears feasible using an optimized hydrogen engine. The impact of various on-board storage options on fuel economy are evaluated. Initial experiments with neat hydrogen and an available engine at Sandia Combustion Research Facility demonstrated NOx emissions of 10 to 20 ppm for an equivalence ratio of 0.4 and about 500 ppm for an equivalence ratio of 0.5. Hybrid vehicle simulation studies indicate that exhaust NO x concentrations must be less than 180 ppm to meet the 0.2 g/mile California Air Resources Board ULEV or Federal Tier II emissions regulations. Current experiments involve a first generation optimized hydrogen engine consisting of an in-house designed and fabricated cylinder head and an Onan single cylinder diesel block. This head currently features 14.8:1 compression ratio, dual ignition, water cooling, two valves and open quiescent combustion chamber to minimize heat transfer losses. Initial testing shows promise of achieving an indicated efficiency of 42 to 46% and emissions of less than 100 ppm NOx. Hydrocarbons and CO are to be measured, but are expected to be very low since their only source is engine lubricating oil. A successful friction reduction program on the Onan engine should result in a brake thermal efficiency in excess of 40% compared to today's gasoline engines of 32%. Preliminary engine test data on indicated efficiency, MBT timing and burn duration are reported. Based on system studies requirements, the next generation engine will have a displacement of about 2 liters and is projected to achieve 46% brake thermal efficiency with outputs of 15 kW for cruise and 40 kW for hill climb.

Hybrid systems, series and parallel, may require unique test procedures to allow the emissions and fuel consumption results to be properly compared to existing and future engine emission standards. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Commercial vehicles; Electric energy storage; Electric traction; Fuel consumption; Fuel economy; Fuel storage; Fuels; Hybrid systems; Internal combustion engines; Propulsion; Trucks; Electric energies; Electricity-consumption; Engine emission; High-speed turbine; Test procedures; Transient cycle; Transit vehicles; Vehicle emission; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072430204

In the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), vehicles are crashed into a stationary, full width, rigid barrier at 35 mi/h (56 km/h). Occupant protection is measured by comparing accelerations, forces, and deflections experienced by the head, chest, and upper legs of 50th percentile male Hybrid II or III anthropometric dummies restrained in the driver and right front seat passenger positions. The procedures are similar to those specified in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, except that the speed is 5 mi/h faster resulting in a test that requires the car to manage 36 percent more energy. NCAP was created to be a consumer information program, and the higher test speed was chosen to provide consumers with a clear indication of which cars offered significantly greater occupant protection than the minimum levels specified in FMVSS 208. NCAP has been one of NHTSA's most successful motor vehicle safety programs. In the first years of the program, the information provided to consumers was very revealing. For example, in the 1979 model year, head injury criterion (HIC) scores ranged from 500-halfway to the injury threshold of 1000 specified in FMVSS 208-to more than 4000, or four times the injury threshold. Of the 30 cars tested, 22 had a driver or passenger HIC more than 1000, 13 had a HIC greater than 1500. Despite manufacturers' concerns that the test results are too variable and that the single test represents too few real-world crash situations [1], analyses of fatality data have confirmed that vehicles with poor NCAP test results also have poor performance in real-world crashes [2] [3] [4]. Thus, keeping in mind that valid comparisons can only be made among cars of similar size and weight, the early NCAP testing offered consumers valuable information about occupant protection in frontal crashes. Even though the automobile manufacturers continued to object to the program, they could not ignore it, and getting good NCAP scores became a design objective for new models. However, the success of NCAP frontal crash testing has begun to limit the usefulness of its information to consumers. As auto manufacturers responded to consumer interest in the crash test results with improved designs, and especially as air bags have become standard equipment in new cars sold in the United States, the incidence of test scores that exceed injury thresholds has declined greatly. In the 1994 model year, only 10 of the 38 cars and light trucks tested had a driver or passenger HIC greater than 1000, and only three had a HIC greater than 1500. Among the 100 vehicles tested with driver air bags since the 1990 model year, only three had driver HICS greater than 1000, and those were less than 1100. Thus, NCAP tests of new passenger vehicles are increasingly unlikely to produce the driver HICs or other injury scores that approach the levels associated with increased fatality in the field data. At the same time, the limitations of full-frontal, flat barrier crash tests as measures of occupant protection in all types of frontal crashes are increasingly being recognized. Mercedes-Benz, for example, has argued for more than a decade that, although the flat barrier test used in NCAP is a good test of restraint systems, it does not provide an adequate test of the ability of vehicle structure to resist intrusion [5]. Mercedes-Benz and others have suggested that offset barrier crash tests are needed in addition to full frontal tests for assessing frontal crashworthiness [6] [7]. Achieving low scores in full frontal barrier tests indicates that a vehicle's front end and restraint system can manage the forces associated with the high vehicle decelerations of full frontal crashes. Low scores in offset barrier tests would indicate that the vehicle's front end structures are able to prevent intrusion even when the crash energy is concentrated on only part of the front structure. The potential significance of offset frontal crashes is illustrated by their frequency in real-world crash data [6] [8] [9]. O'Neill et al., for example, noted that nearly half of the vehicles involved in two-vehicle collisions and about three quarters of those in single-vehicle collisions in the U.S. National Accident Sampling System in 1990-92 incurred direct contact damage to two-thirds or less of their front ends. There has been general agreement that an offset test could result in vehicle designs that improve occupant protection in crashes not currently addressed, or addressed inadequately, by the flat barrier test, although there has been considerable debate on the form and speed of the test. Mercedes-Benz initially adopted a 40 percent overlap test into a rigid barrier at 55 km/h as an internal manufacturing standard [10]. Hobbs has argued, however, that even in the offset configuration, rigid barriers provide too little replication of the structural stresses that vehicles must handle in vehicle-to-vehicle crashes, which constitute a substantial portion of offset frontal crashes [6] [11]. According to Hobbs, because the fronts of other cars are a mixture of stiff and soft areas, frontal structures must be designed such that the main structural members (e.g., front longitudinal rails) absorb their intended share of crash energy regardless of the surface struck; the front ends should not allow uneven deformation of softer structure to compromise the structural members such that they buckle catastrophically rather than crush uniformly to absorb energy. Rigid barriers do not test this aspect of design because the rigid barrier face directs crash forces into the structural members. Therefore, Hobbs has proposed that offset tests should utilize a deformable element to provide a better assessment of this aspect of design. This argument has been persuasive, and an offset frontal crash test has been tentatively recommended by Working Group 11 (WG-11) of the European Experimental Vehicles Committee (EEVC) for the second phase of new European Economic Community dynamic frontal crash test performance requirements for new vehicles [12] [13]. Mercedes-Benz has also accepted the argument for deformable barriers in offset tests [14], and new car comparison testing using the proposed European standard has begun in Australia [15]. Nevertheless, published results from offset tests using deformable barrier faces for validating the representativeness and repeatability of the proposed offset test procedure are still limited. WG-11 participants are currently completing a series of 16 tests with European vehicles to assess the proposed standard. This paper provides additional data from tests at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety using vehicles from the U.S. fleet. The test series includes car-to-car frontal crashes of recent models of the Oldsmobile Ciera, which is a front-wheel drive unibody midsize American sedan, at nominal speeds of 56 and 64 km/h, with overlaps around 50 percent. These car-to-car tests served as the baseline condition intended to be replicated through offset barrier tests, following Hobbs' argument that vehicle to vehicle crashes exert the greatest demands on front end designs. The ability of various barrier configurations to replicate these crashes was assessed in terms of the frontal deformations that resulted. Subsequent comparisons considered the deformation patterns of stiff underbody structures, occupant compartment intrusion, and velocity change of the occupant compartment. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Accident prevention; Automobile air bags; Automobile manufacture; Automobile parts and equipment; Automobile testing; Consumer protection; Deformation; Digital storage; Fleet operations; Front wheel drive automobiles; Highway accidents; Highway engineering; Hybrid integrated circuits; Mobile telecommunication systems; Safety testing; Software testing; Structural members; Vehicle performance; Automobile manufacturers; Consumer information programs; European economic communities; Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208; Manufacturing standard; National highway traffic safety administrations; Off-set configuration; Vehicle-to-vehicle crashes; Crashworthiness",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072428711

There is a continuing need to reduce emissions and fuel consumption. Much of the focus of current work is on engine development as a stand-alone subsystem. While this has yielded impressive gains so far, further improvement in emissions or engine efficiency is unlikely in a cost effective manner. Consequently, an integrated approach looking at the whole powertrain is required. A computer model of the heavy duty truck system was built and evaluated. The model includes both conventional and hybrid powertrains. It uses a series of interacting sub-models for the vehicle, transmission, engine, exhaust aftertreatment and braking energy recovery/storage devices. A specified driving cycle is used to calculate the power requirements at the wheels and energy flow and inefficiencies throughout the drivetrain. The total energy consumed and pollutants emitted is accumulated over the driving cycle. It is shown that for an urban heavy duty driving cycle, up to 20 percent improvement in vehicle fuel economy can be achieved with up to 30 percent possible with more advanced controls. Fuel savings over a representative driving cycle for interstate long haul trucks have not been evaluated yet, but are likely to be substantial. Global positioning systems and known route and terrain can be used to implement a ""look ahead"" control strategy. Further fuel economy improvements are therefore possible. A typical long haul truck consumes about 75 to 150,000 liters of diesel fuel a year. At 1995 fuel prices, a 10 percent improvement in fuel economy results in savings of about $6,000 to $9,000 over a 2 to 3 year period. The added costs of hybrid powertrain should be kept within this target value. It is shown that with the use of a hybrid powertrain, the engine can be run at selected, narrow ranges of speed and load. Such a strategy allows both nitric oxide and particulate emissions to be reduced by over 50 percent compared to current levels. Thus, with a systems approach (rather than concentrating on the engine alone), it is possible to simultaneously reduce emissions and fuel consumption by 50 percent and 30 percent respectively over current levels. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Cost effectiveness; Costs; Diesel fuels; Engines; Fuels; Hybrid powertrains; Nitric oxide; Trucks; Urban transportation; Vehicle transmissions; Wages; Braking energy recoveries; Control strategies; Engine development; Exhaust aftertreatment; Integrated approach; Over-current levels; Transportation fuels; Vehicle fuel economy; Fuel economy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072428297

This has occurred even for batteries for which the manufacturer has claimed a cycle life of several hundred deep discharge cycles. In this paper, the reasons are explored for this large difference between the expected and experienced battery cycle life and what life cycle testing should be done to greatly reduce the uncertainty in battery pack life. Test procedures for battery life testing are discussed and it is shown that there is a large difference in the cycle life that would be inferred from test results for one or two modules compared to that from testing a pack of many modules (at least ten). Measurements of the module-to-module variability in terms of the standard deviation of the module voltages showed that the increase of these module imbalances signals the degradation of the performance of the pack and they must be controlled through quality control in the manufacturing process and monitoring of module voltages during charge and discharge in the vehicle. Test data for packs of sealed lead-acid batteries discharged at constant power (10 W/kg) and on the SFUDS cycle indicated the module-to-module variability was much greater on the transient power SFUDS cycle and accordingly, the battery pack cycle life on the SFUDS cycle was much shorter than on the constant power cycle. The effects of load leveling on the initial and life cycle costs of the energy storage system in electric and hybrid vehicles as a function of vehicle acceleration and range characteristics were studied using spreadsheet models that related cycle life, $/kWh, average depth-of-discharge, energy density, battery peak power density, and load leveled battery power density. The load leveling was done using ultracapacitors having an energy density of 10 Wh/kg. The spreadsheet results show that the advantages of load leveling the batteries are largest for hybrid vehicles with relatively short all- electric range (less than 50 km) and for electric vehicles with 0-60 mph acceleration times of 10 seconds or less. The over-riding factor in assessing the operating cost of all the vehicles is battery cycle life and how it is affected by the maximum working power density of the battery and the average daily depth-of-discharge it experiences over its life. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automoive Engineers, Inc.",,"Automobile manufacture; Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Electric discharges; Hybrid vehicles; Lead acid batteries; Life cycle; Quality control; Spreadsheets; Testing; Vehicle performance; Charge and discharge; Depth of discharges; Electric and hybrid vehicles; Energy storage systems; Manufacturing process; Peak power densities; Sealed lead-acid batteries; Vehicle acceleration; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072424566

All energy requirements are ultimately met from the fuel tank. Essentially all the performance achievements of current conventional cars are met by this hybrid. Two versions of the hybrid are considered: one in which the vehicle loads are the same as those of the average 1993 car, but the drive train is replaced with a hybrid system, and one, where, in addition, the vehicle loads are reduced, at fixed performance and interior volume, to levels slightly beyond the best achievements in current production vehicles. The first of these vehicles has a fuel economy twice that of the average 1993 car; the second three times.

Duplicate EPA FTP emission tests were conducted with each fuel. Hydrocarbon speciation was utilized to determine reactivity-adjusted non-methane organic gases (NMOG) emissions for one test on each fuel. Results showed that all eight fuels could allow the converted vehicle to pass California ultra-low emission vehicle (ULEV) NMOG and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) standards. Six of the eight fuels could allow the vehicle to pass ULEV carbon monoxide (CO) standards. BUTANE has been an important gasoline blending component for many years. With a road octane number of 92 and a high blending vapor pressure, butane has been used to upgrade the octane of gasoline blends and to aid in wintertime cold starting. Due to reformulated gasoline requirements for lower fuel vapor pressure, industry has had to remove increasing amounts of butane from the gasoline pool. Paradoxically, butane is one of the cleanest burning components of gasoline. This increasing inability to use butane in motor fuel represents both an economic and environmental waste. Other than reformulated gasoline and clean diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is the most widely used alternative fuel in the United States. The primary constituent of LPG used for this purpose is propane. Propane has many attributes which make it an attractive vehicular fuel. Since it is a single relatively simple species, engines and aftertreatment systems can be designed to burn it cleanly. It also reacts very slowly in the atmosphere so it tends to form less ground level ozone in cities. Propane is also stored onboard as a liquid at ambient temperature in a pressurized system; therefore, by definition, it produces no evaporative emissions. As a liquid, it has a good volumetric energy content so vehicle range is improved over many of the other alternative fuels. The road octane number of propane is greater than 100 so vehicle power can be optimized in vehicles equipped to take advantage of this property. There is also a wide distribution system for propane so vehicle refueling is performed more readily than with most of the alternatives. Importantly, however, barriers exist which may inhibit the growth of propane as a motor fuel. There are other developed, mature markets for propane such as its use as a heating fuel or as a chemical feedstock. Propane is produced as a side product from natural gas production or petroleum refinery processing. Additional demand could create shortages and/or price increases, because it is unlikely that either of these two sources would be ramped up solely to produce more propane. Although vehicle range is good, it remains three-fourths that of conventional gasoline vehicles. These constraints have limited LPG vehicle implementation. A thoughtful consideration of the use of butane as a motor fuel shows that it should have many of the positive attributes of propane. Butane is also a single, relatively simple chemical species so theoretically engines and exhaust catalysts could be optimized for low emissions with its use. It also has relatively low reactivity in the atmosphere and like propane, would be stored on-board as a pressurized liquid. Consequently, a butane-fueled vehicle would also have no evaporative emissions, and could also be classified as an inherently low emissions vehicle (ILEV). Butane has a greater volumetric energy content than propane so vehicle range could be extended over that of propane. Since butane storage pressure is lower than that of propane, there is an opportunity to use the same equipment for delivery and refueling of butane as is currently used for propane. Butane tends to be in slight oversupply on a yearly basis in the U.S. and this excess should grow larger as gasoline volatility is reduced. The imbalance is projected to equal as much as 100,000 barrels per day this year and increase by 20 percent by the year 2000.(1)* Although butane is used as a chemical feedstock, it has not been used extensively as a heating fuel as has propane. Like propane, butane production is associated with natural gas production and petroleum refining. However, butane production is more easily swung between gasoline and neat product than propane. This could allow butane supply to more easily balance demand than propane. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Antiknock rating; Automotive fuels; Blending; Butane; Carbon monoxide; Engines; Environmental Protection Agency; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Hydrostatic pressure; Liquefied petroleum gas; Liquids; Natural gas; Natural gas well production; Ozone; Petroleum refining; Propane; Reformulated gasoline; Roads and streets; Silicon compounds; Vehicles; Aftertreatment systems; Gasoline volatilities; Hydrocarbon speciation; Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Low emission vehicles; Natural-gas production; Ozone-forming potential; Ultra Low Emission Vehicles; Alternative fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072417991

All the thermal couplings among active devices are rigorously taken into account. The heat flow among the hot spots of the chip surface (e.g., the FET gates) is described in terms of a thermal conductance matrix. The latter is evaluated by a 3-D layout-oriented numerical analysis based on an electrostatic analogy. The storage of thermal energy inside the chip is described in terms of the chip enthalpy, so that thermal transient effects may be taken into account. The resulting thermal equations are coupled to the electrical equations of the circuit through the state-dependent dissipated powers in the active devices. The whole problem is formulated in the frequency domain as a nonlinear set of coupled electro thermal HB equations which are simultaneously solved by a Newton iteration. © 1995 IEEE.",,"Frequency domain analysis; Iterative methods; Microwave circuits; Microwaves; Nonlinear analysis; Nonlinear equations; Timing circuits; Electrical equations; Electrostatic analogy; Electrothermal analysis; Harmonic balance techniques; Nonlinear microwave circuits; Temperature dependent; Thermal conductance; Thermal transient effect; Coupled circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040630700

An important question is what controls the current sheet structure and particle distribution functions and how they may be coupled to the surrounding regions. A key factor in determining the current sheet properties is that the charged particle motion is collisionless, with negligible classical resistivity or diffusion. It has been found that local particle distribution function properties (microscale), the current sheet structure (mesoscale), and the physical processes on larger(macro) scales are inseparably coupled and that the properties on a given (e.g., macro) scale are not reducible to those on other (e.g., micro) scales. The present paper provides a tutorial review of recent research results in the underlying charged particle motion and the properties of the magnetotail current sheet. © 1995 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040231245

Plasticizers consisted of three 2‐nitroxyethylnitramine (NENA) compounds, diethylene glycol dinitrate (DEGDN), and nitroglycerin (NG). Initial concentration of plasticizer and degree of nitration of NC were also varied. Each propellant was tested at three temperatures. Plasticizer diffusivities (D) and their activation energies were calculated. Observed trends were generally consistent with calculated plasticizer solubility parameters, expected increases in molecular mobility for more highly plasticized materials, and the more polar and more disordered structure of NC with a lower degree of nitration. Some unexpected effects could be explained by changes in entropy of activation due to variation in plasticizer or NC structure. In general, the NENA plasticizers had lower vaporization rates than DEGDN or NG, suggesting that plasticizer losses during manufacturing or storage of practical formulations should not be a problem.

The frequency of the inverter to drive the machine A is given so that the solar power can be utilized maximumly. This system can stably supply a mechanical load with the desired power by parallel operation of two induction machines even in rainy weather, and moreover regenerate extra power of the solar battery to the utility line in fine weather.

By placing this chamber above the piston surface, the detonation and primary shock waves are directed parallel to the piston surface, thus avoiding potentially destructive loads to the piston. The rapid burning followed by mixing with air in the vortex chamber may reduce the formation of NOx and unburned hydrocarbons as compared to conventional combustion.

The whole process consists of two main stages: nucleation of special shear defects, called PSTs (plastic shear transformations), and their disappearance. The important feature of plastic deformation of glasses is the storage of a large amount of internal energy ΔUdef upon straining. Such energy storage is the critical issue for mechanical performance of polymeric material: if the amount of stored energy is high, the appearance of macroscopic failure is very probable while glassy materials collecting a small amount of stored deformation energy are quite ductile. It is proposed that the rate of disappearance of PSTs is a key factor in dissipation of stored deformation energy. A parameter describing the dissipation ability of material upon deformation is introduced.

The fish were fed extruded diets containing 24 g and 602 g kg−1, 98 g and 521 g kg−1, 165 g and 454 g kg−1, 230 g and 384 g kg−1 of carbohydrate and protein, respectively. The contents of lipid were kept constant at 280 g kg−1. The experiment lasted for 9 months until the fish had reached about 4 kg. All groups showed good growth in the experimental period. Feed efficiency decreased and feed intake increased linearly with increased level of carbohydrate in the diet. Digestibility of dry matter and energy were seriously decreased with increased carbohydrate level in the diets. This was mainly due to decreased digestibility of carbohydrate, but also to decreased digestibility of lipid. The digestibility of protein or amino acids was not affected by diet. Higher levels of carbohydrate resulted in increased storage of energy as lipid in fillet and abdominal fat. Red coloration showed an optimum at 98 g kg−1 carbohydrate in the diets. No differences in maturation were found between diets. Overall, based on feed efficiency, growth and slaughter quality, the optimum level of carbohydrate in the diet for Atlantic salmon in sea water is found to be approximately 100 g kg−1 dry matter.

Each of the raw sources of herring was subjected to two processing temperatures, 75°C and 100°C, during meal preparation. Also, protein hydrolysates were prepared using ocean perch when fresh or after storage at 2‐5°C for 4 or 8 days. Subsequently, each of the three hydrolysates was dried at 85°C or 93°C. In two separate experiments, each of the herring press cake meals and dried perch protein hydrolysates was blended with a reference diet in a 30:70 ratio (test protein source: reference diet). All diets contained 5 g kg−1 chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. The reference diet and all test diets were provided to satiation to chinook salmon in salt water and rainbow trout in fresh water, with digestibility of organic matter, protein and energy measured by difference. Digestibility of protein was also measured by the pH‐stat and dilute pepsin solubility in vitro techniques. The results indicated that variation in processing temperature to a maximum of 100°C had little effect on digestibility of marine fish protein sources. By contrast, raw material storage for 8 days or more at 2‐5°C prior to processing was found to reduce organic matter digestibility and sometimes nitrogen digestibility in salmonids. In vitro measures of digestibility were of little help in predicting the nutritive value of the test protein sources.

Abundance increased after the plant started operating, although the proportion of larger perch dropped to a low level. Recruitment improved, but adult mortality increased. This effect was accentuated as the fishes matured very early and at a very small size, reducing their ability to support a growing gonad in high winter temperatures. During the spawning period, condition dropped to very low levels accompanied by increased mortality. Surviving fish delayed the next spawning by one or more years and reduced their fecundity. Body condition thus improved in large perch at the end of the study period. Life‐time fecundity was reduced, and reproductive performance shifted to youner ages. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

With this technique, the continuous ion beam from the ESI source is collimated by a set of focusing lenses into the ion trap where the ions are accumulated for a predetermined period of time. Extraction of the ions into the flight tube of the TOF mass spectrometer is achieved by applying a short duration voltage pulse to the exit endcap of the ion trap. The extraction frequency is variable, but is typically set at 10 Hz. It was shown that with a linear TOF mass spectrometer, mass resolution in the range of 600–950 can be routinely obtained. It was also demonstrated that a complete mass spectrum of bradykinin can be obtained with a direct injection of 75 fmol, or 0.5 μL of 150 nM of sample solution.

The soy sample was reconstituted at 30C and networks were developed either during cooling to 5C or on heating to 90C (complete denaturation of the protein) followed by cooling to 5C. Throughout the course of experimentation, dynamic oscillatory (time, temperature, frequency and strain sweeps) and creep testing (in aqueous or urea solutions) measurements were recorded. Reduction in the thermal energy of the system causes a monotonic increase in storage modulus (G′) whereas the temperature rise results in equilibrium G′ values well below the elastic response observed at 30C. The absence of a positive thermal transition, observed in the gelation of native globular proteins, indicates a different mechanism for structure formation in commercial soy isolates. Application of the cascade treatment to the concentration dependence of the storage modulus argues that the heated and cooled networks possess a higher degree of bond permanency than their cooled‐only counterparts. Mechanical spectra in combination with the pattern of network breakage at high deformations suggests that disulphide bonds participate in the network formed by totally denatured soy protein (heated and cooled samples). Inclusion of urea in the aqueous preparations destabilises the predominantly physical forces of attraction in the unheated gels. By contrast, the heated and cooled samples achieve an equilibrium deformation whose storage modulus can be employed in the constitutive equation of rubber elasticity theory. On that basis the number of disulphide bridges per molecule was found to vary between 2.0 and 2.03. This result is consistent with the “string of beads” model proposed for the three‐dimensional structure of globular protein gels, where a dendric network is built by the occasional cross‐linking of corpuscular strands.

Input data include the global irradiance on inclined plane and temperature of HASP data of Tokyo, ten kinds of electrical load forms with 400 MWh electric power a year, and conversion efficiencies of each subsystem. As a result of simulation, it was revealed that the area of PV array with 8170 m2 and the volume of hydrogen tank from 22 × 103 to 30 × 103 kl are necessary.

The Pyhäsalmi mine is located in the middle of Finland in Precambrian crystalline rocks. The basic case of the CAES optimised for the energy system was 210 MWh/30 000 m3 with 34 MWe output of the gas turbine and 25 MW, input into the compressor. Comparisons and analyses for different sizes, types and locations of the storage were made. The estimated minimum total investment is about 18 million USD. In the Pyhäsalmi case, a new storage cavern excavated on deep levels in hard and tight rock mass far from the mine openings would be more feasible and 30 % cheaper in investment compared with a storage converted from the existing excavations or from the access tunnel.

The steady state and the quasi-steady state methods were used for the experimental evaluation. A two-dimensional, transient, misymmetric analytical model was developed to study the phase change heat transfer process.

The first system is the CAES Plant Integrated with a Gas Turbine (CAESIGT), in which 40 percent of the power output is produced by a standard gas turbine, and 60 percent by an air expander utilizing compressed air that is preheated by the exhaust gases of the gas turbine. For certain initial parameters of the compressed air, its temperature after expansion becomes lower than the ambient temperature. This cold air can be used as a source for refrigeration of the gas turbine inlet air and for other purposes. In the CAES system of the second type, multistage expansion of compressed air is applied.

In contrast, non-feeding infective juvenile entomopathogenic nematodes forage exclusively for a single host. Two questions were posed: (1) what is the relationship between metabolic rate, energy reserves and foraging strategy and (2) when a foraging strategy fails, will an infective-stage parasite switch strategies ? Three species of entomopathogenic nematodes were stored in water and changes in their behaviour, metabolic rate, energy reserves, and infectivity were measured throughout the storage period. Steinernema carpocapsae ambushes insect hosts, whereas S. glaseri and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora cruise forage. Steinernema carpocapsae was least active and had the lowest metabolic rate. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora was more active and had the highest metabolic rate. Steinernema glaseri was most active and had an intermediate metabolic rate. Neither cruising species changed foraging strategy. Steinernema carpocapsae decreased nictation (a behaviour associated with ambushing only) and increased their locomotory rate. Any change in searching strategy occurred without assessment of the profitability or distribution of potential hosts, but the advantage this confers is unknown. © 1995, Cambridge University Press.

A bimodal system, (ISUS) was identified which will provide orbit transfer capability combined with on-orbit electrical power production. Before selecting the current design approach, a trade study was performed to identify overall system configurations. Deployable, rigid concentrators were selected over inflatable concentrators because of the lack of data on inflatables and the difficulty of demonstrating operability and lifetime on the ground. Two bimodal systems were then identified and compared. One concept (SEBA-1) utilized a refractory metal receiver and the second (SEBA-2) utilized a refractory metal- coated graphite receiver. The graphite provided thermal energy storage, allowing impulsive bums during orbit transfer and eliminating the need for batteries to provide power during periods of eclipse. Both concepts were capable of inserting significantly more mass in geosynchronous orbit than conventional chemical propulsion systems.

This research is motivated by the feet that the chemical propellants are about three order of magnitude more compact in weight and size than electromagnetic energy production and storage systems. Therefore, there is great interest in developing accelerators of hypervelocity projectiles using chemical propellants. There are two methods for in-tube chemical accelerators utilizing premixed gaseous detonative mixtures; the Ram Accelerator (RA) and the External Propulsion Accelerator (EPA). These in-tube chemical launchers for accelerating projectiles to hypervelocity utilize, in the superdetonative mode of operation, the possibilities of generating continuous thrust by initiating detonation in the premixed fuel/oxidizer mixture by shock wave interactions. The first method proposed for an in-tube chemical launcher was the Ram Accelerator, originated and developed by A. Hertzberg and his colleagues at the University of Washington. The second method for operating the chemical in-tube accelerator is based on the utilization of the external propulsion cycle, proposed by J. Rom at the Technion-Israe! Institute of Technology. In the External Propulsion Accelerator the projectile is fired into the launcher tube which is filled with premixed fuel/oxidizer mixture, however, here the projectile diameter is much smaller than the tube diameter (about 25%) so that there is no interaction between the flow over the projectile and the tube wall over the complete length of the projectile. In this case the detonation is established by aerodynamic means on the projectile, such as a forward lacing step on the projectile shoulder or by the blunt leading edge of a ring wing positioned on the center/rear part of the projectile. By the interactions of the detonation wave with the nose shock wave an “external combustion chamber” is produced. This aerodynamically confined Tegion which is filled with the hot chemical reaction products is then expanded on the rear part and into the base region of the projcctile, producing thrust on the projectile. In this paper we present some investigations of the operational performance limits of the Ram and the External Propulsion Accelerators using an energy balance analysis. Hie energy balance analysis is applied to evaluate the maximum velocity which can be achieved in the in-tube accelerators when the available chemical reaction energy is utilized. It is shown that the maximum velocity of the projectile in the RA is limited, due to the high drag caused by the choking, to about 1.3 the detonation velocity while the maximum velocity of the projectile in the EPA can reach up to 6 times the detonation velocity. Then the results of numerical simulation of the flow over projectile configurations and some performance parameters of the External Propulsion Accelerator are presented. The applications of the EPA to ground test facilities such as a launcher for a hypersonic range and as a facility for combustion research in scramjet engines are discussed. © 1995, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Subsequent research has led to the development of a capacitor technology which has high power and energy density. While the energy density is less than most battery technologies, the power density is factors of 10 - 50 greater than that of most batteries. For high energy/power density applications, the ultimate device would possess the energy storage characteristics of a battery and the power characteristics of a capacitor. The Chemical Double Layer (CDL) capacitor technology is a step in the right direction. As a result, a combination of prime power in the form of a solar array or solar array-battery and a chemical double layer capacitor form a unique combination of high peak power and average power system for many applications. Typical of the applications envisioned are power system backup, directed energy weapons concepts, electric automobiles, pulsed communications, electric actuators and in high peak power, low average power electric thrusters. Potential applications of this technology for high peak power, low average power space and terrestrial applications are described in this paper. © 1995, by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The model includes advective and diffusive vapor transport processes for a wide range of gas flow, from viscous to molecular. Existing single component approaches to the separation of vacuum flow into molecular and viscous fractions have been extended to include multicomponent transport with partial advection and interdiffusion. A set of nonlinear partial differential equations describing vacuum flow and transport in a tube are derived and solved with an iterative numerical scheme. Comparison of model simulations with laboratory measurements of vapor transport in a long vacuum sampling tube showed that the model accurately represents the process of interdiffusion in all flow regimes. Advection was accurately simulated by the model for all vapor components in fully viscous flow. Partial advection and tube limited diffusion in the transition flow range were also well simulated by the model for an argon-air mixture, while benzene-air and 1,1,1-trichloroethane-air mixtures showed slightly less than predicted partial advection. Reduced advection with these latter compounds may be due to the many energy storage modes available to the multiatomic molecules, which result in less momentum transfer than would be predicted by methods that assume fully elastic collisions between molecules. © 1995, American Vacuum Society.

The Cranchiidae use a unique coelomic cavity to store ammoniacal fluid; in 15 other families, ammonium appears to be sequestered in either vacuoles in the active body tissues or in a gelatinous outer layer. The hypothesis that these squids form a single lineage is here reconsidered through reviews of morphological characters that could support this hypothesis and physiological mechanisms that could contribute to the repeated evolution of ammonium storage. No readily apparent character identifies all ammoniacal squids as belonging to a single lineage, although 5 families of tissue ammoniacal squids appear to be monophyletic. If the elaborate funnel locking apparatus of this group arose within the clade, it is not homologous with that in other taxa, refuting a basis on which close relationships were suggested for ammoniacal squids. Given the limited data available, we question whether some squids considered to be ammoniacal may develop these characters as a result of senescence. Squids are all thought to derive energy from amino acid catabolism, produce large quantities of ammonia and have very low blood pH's which effectively remove ammonia from cells that produce it. They also minimize H+ ion transfer between muscle cells and blood. These features may be important preadaptations for ammonium storage. Given the physiological data, and the absence of morphological evidence supporting monophyly, we argue that ammoniacal squids be best considered to be a polyphyletic group, evolved in parallel. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group.

Electrodialysis is used widely today for desalination of brackish water and in some areas of the world it is the main process for the production of potable water. Although of major importance, water desalination is by no means the only significant application. In addition to conventional electrodialysis there are other closely related processes, such as diffusion dialysis, Donnan dialysis, electrodialytic water dissociation, etc., with a multitude of potential large-scale applications. Most of these processes that are utilizing standard or special property ion-exchange membranes as key-elements are still in an early stage of development but they are also rapidly gaining commercial and technical relevance. Ion-exchange membranes are also used on a large scale in energy storage or conversion systems such as batteries and fuel cells and in electrochemical production processes, such as the chlorine-alkaline electrolyses. In many applications, electrodialysis and related processes are in direct competition with other separation techniques, such as distillation, ion exchange, reverse osmosis and various chromatographic procedures. In other applications, there are very few technically and economically feasible alternatives to the electro-membrane processes. © 1995 Elsevier B.V.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957008892

In particular near magnetized compact objects accretion can be modified by repeated magnetic energy storage and release. Further also in the absence of a central magnetosphere, such as around galactic and extragalactic black holes, magnetic flaring activity is possible in a corona on both sides of the disk. Moreover strong observational evidence exists for the occurrence of magnetic flares in accretion disks in the form of X-ray and radio bursts. We point out similarities and differences of accretion disk flares with solar flares. Finally coronal magnetic fields and magnetic flares can play an important role in providing a large effective ""anomalous"" viscosity. We estimate the equivalent alpha-parameter in case of a filling factor f of the disk surface with magnetic flux tubes to be αB = (f2r)(6H)-1, where r is the central distance and H the disk half-thickness. It is suggested that observed bimodal behaviour in disk accretion is related to a threshold in magnetic filling factor.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449128346

The objective was to examine energetic strategies, seasonal fattening in particular, in the species using data on weight and chemical composition of different tissues. Methods: carcass analysis was used for estimating the allocation of energy into different tissues. A total of 72 fin whales were weighed and the data used to create a formula for the prediction of weight from simple anatomical measurements. Seasonal increase in weight was calculated from the observed increase in girth dimensions and this, in combination with analysis of energetic densities of different tissues, was used to estimate the total energy deposition within the body throughout the summer and fall. Results: pregnant females had the highest rates of seasonal fattening, increasing their weight by 26% and the total energy content of the body by nearly 80%. The corresponding values for immatures were 15% and less than 30%, respectively. Muscle tissue appears to be an important energy depot in all reproductive classes, and pregnant females store relatively more energy in visceral fat and blubber than other reproductive classes. Conclusions: the results support previous findings that energy deposition is closely linked with reproduction. The deposition rates reported here are, however, slightly lower than those in a previous report. A rough transformation of the calculated energy storage into feeding rates of 2–3% of body weight is in concordance with indications from stomach content analysis. © 1995 Elsevier B.V.","energetics; feeding rates; seasonal fattening; weight",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349740501

The samples were vacuum packed and tested monthly for pH, colour, haematin complex, soluble nitrogen and microbiological spoilage. Proteolysis and increase in pH showed a high correlation for both samples. Temperature-dependent changes in colour and concentration of haematin complex during storage were also found in both samples. The activation energy for haematin transformation was found to be around 1 kcal/mol. Based on the low activation energy for haematin complex degradation (around 1 kcal/mol) for both samples, this process may be regarded as a low energy biochemical process. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149364477

The crop residues present were millet and maize stover, rice straw and groundnut hay. The yield of crop residues was estimated by sampling quadrats which were randomly placed along transects in ten fields per crop. Agricultural by-products included millet bran, maize bran, rice bran, sesame cake and groundnut cake. Yields of agricultural by-products were determined by estimating the amount of crop which was processed in the village and directly measuring extraction rate. The nutritive value of crop residues and by-products was determined by the detergent systems of forage analysis. Most of the cereal crop residues were grazed in the field. Groundnut crop residue was harvested and stored for feeding livestock but only 47% of this hay was collected. Groundnut leaves contained high concentrations of crude protein and metabolizable energy, and the groundnut stems were higher in crude protein than all fractions of the cereal crop residues. Stored groundnut hay was of lower nutritive value than immediately after harvest, since substantial loss of nutrients occurred during harvest and storage. Millet bran was the most abundant by-product available in the village, and was higher in crude protein and metabolizable energy and lower in neutral-detergent fibre than either maize and rice bran. Rice bran had a low nutritive value because of contamination with hulls that contain high amounts of lignin and biogenic silica and are not removed before milling. The high content of ether extract in groundnut and sesame cakes indicated that the oil press used in the village was inefficient. Only 10% of the groundnut cake was available in the village because most of the groundnuts were sold to the government marketing board. The results indicated that the village has adequate quantities of crop residues and by-products to meet the feed requirements of improved sheep production systems. However, many production constraints exist and research and extension programmes for improved sheep production are needed.

A global Vision of the benefits of developing and deploying this System, including the role of highly developed countries is presented. In this Vision, the ALMR System is heavily used, in conjunction with light water reactors (LWRs), in highly developed countries thus displacing fossil fuel demand in those economies, and making them more available for developing/undeveloped countries. In addition, LWRs in developing countries can further reduce global fossil fuel demand.This Vision provides quality of life and standard of living improvements in these developing/underdeveloped economies, which should also lead to more political stability. Turning to another aspect of the global energy challenge, it becomes clear that some form of advanced automotive propulsion is required in order to reduce the burden on the environment and energy resources. Among those being considered are electric and hydrogen powered autos. Both systems will require significant increases in the electric production infrastructure, which must be done economically. Thus, the need for clean, reliable, large electric stations is clear, and non-polluting nuclear based alternatives become very attractive. This expansion of nuclear energy will eventually strain uranium supplies and spent fuel disposition sites. If the ALMR System is deployed, known uranium resources can be extended 50 - 70; the amount of residual nuclear waste to be disposed of in long-term storage will be significantly reduced, and the required storage volume will also be reduced, by a factor of 4 or more. In addition, the time period required for this residual waste to reach natural uranium levels of toxicity will be shortened by many orders of magnitude to about 200 to 300 years. The System, if deployed, will also reduce the potential for nuclear weapons proliferation and will be kind to the environment, with no emissions to the air or water. The ALMR's development should be supported by the global community and deployed if it's potential can be demonstrated.Discussions of potential are interesting, but without demonstrations and experience, are only discussions!

The EOS-AM spacecraft is the first of the intermediate-sized spacecraft. EOS-AM accommodates sensors that measure cloud and aerosol radiative properties, and that provide data to study the water and energy cycles. Scheduled for launch in the late 1990s, the EOS-AM spacecraft is designed for a 5-year mission. The spacecraft will be launched from the Western Space and Missile Center (California) into a polar, Sun-synchronous, low-Earth orbit with a 16-day repeat cycle. In its flight configuration, the spacecraft is almost 20 ft long (including instruments mounted at the fore end of the spacecraft) and 6 ft wide (in its widest dimension), has a mass of about 13,000 Ibs and uses about 3000 W of electrical power. The spacecraft is compatible with the Atlas IIAS launch vehicle. EOS-AM has on-board storage for at least two orbits of science data. These data will be transmitted to the ground via the tracking and data relay satellite system (using data structures and protocols in compliance with the recommendations of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems). A direct downlink system to support distributed users will also be available. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149209434

It is evident that reaction occurs with atmospheric water and carbon dioxide forming carbonates. The inhibition of these reactions by the application of protective coatings is considered, Such techniques appear to be gaining importance in pyrotechnic applications, and criteria for suitable coatants are discussed. Various surfactants were applied to BaO2 and evaluated in an accelerated aging test. Selected anionic and non‐ionic surfactants conferred improved aging resistance, with stearic acid giving the greatest advantage. A very high degree of protection was also afforded to PbO2. Low energy fuses based on a BaO2/Si composition were evaluated and a high resistance to aging was realized using the coated BaO2. There were no adverse effects on other properties, thus satisfying the criteria established for coatants. Copyright © 1995 Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

The ions were stored for about 25 s before data taking, which is several orders of magnitude longer than their vibrational lifetimes towards spontaneous emission of infrared radiation. A broad resonance in the cross section at 512 eV is due to recombination into a manifold of doubly excited states. Multichannel quantum-defect theory was used to calculate the absolute cross section of this resonance. The calculations required inclusion of different mechanisms, such as dissociative autoionization, and many molecular states in order to reproduce the resonance region. Very good agreement of experiment and theory is found, and the results strongly reinforce that vibrationally cold ions were used in the experiment. © 1995 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243952841

From these measurements the volume fraction dependency of the static shear modulus was obtained. The theoretical static shear modulus has been deduced from a stress tensor expression which only takes into account the electrostatic pair interactions between nearest neighbors. The electrostatic pair interaction is modeled adequately to account for the multiparticle environment of a particle and for high surface charges. The interactions are described by the linear superposition approximation for the pair interaction energy between two particles given by Bell et at, [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 33, 335 (1970)]. The apparent surface potential and the effective Debije screening length used in this expression are determined from the electrostatic potential which is numerically determined from the Poisson—Boltzmann equation in a spherical cell. The theoretical model is also compared with measurements of several other investigators. Most of the experimental data can be scaled to a single mastercurve resulting from the proposed theoretical model. © 1995, The Society of Rheology",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36949040556

In essence, the method eliminates correlation between distant eigenstates through a short-time filter while correlations between closely lying states are eliminated by diagonalization. Here we extend Filter- Diagonalization. When used to extract eigenvalues for a given operator H, we show that all eigenvalue information is directly extracted from a short segment of the correlation function C(t) = (ψ(0)|e-iHt\ψ(0)), or alternately from a small number of residues (ψ(0)\Rn(H)\ψ(0)) , where ψ(0) is a random initial function and Rn(H) is any desired polynomial expansion in H. The implications of this feature are twofold. First, in contrast to the previous version the wave packet needs only to be propagated once (to prepare C(t)), and eigenstates at all desired energy windows can then be extracted with negligible extra computation time (and negligible storage requirements). In a simulation presented here, accurate eigenvalues are extracted using propagation times which are only a 0.0041 fraction of the ""natural"" time, i.e., the time by which the relative phase of the two closest eigenstates reaches 2 π. The second and more important feature is that the method is automatically suitable for extracting eigenvalues (or normal modes) using a short-time segment of any signal C(t) which is a sum of (unknown) Fourier components (C(t)=Σndne -iεnt) regardless of its origin. In addition to its use for determining eigenvalues of known operators, the method may also be utilized to extract normal modes from classical-dynamics simulations, eigenstates from real-time Quantum Monte-Carlo studies, frequencies from experimental optical or electrical signals, or be utilized in any other circumstance where a correlation function or general signal is only known for short times (or expensive to generate at long times). © 1995 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36449006911

It first examines the economics of gasification, showing that the potential for this form of renewable energy lies in either processing low-cost wastes or relying on some sort of fiscal incentive, even at relatively large scales of operation and with high-efficiency processes. The paper then considers all the elements required with respect to wood handling and preparation, gasification, gas quality and gas cleaning, and establishes the criteria for their selection for delivery of a clean gas to a gas turbine or engine. Special emphasis has been placed on the technology status and key uncertainties that are considered to be crucial to the success or failure of a biomass-based IGCC system. The main conclusions are that wood handling, storage, drying, comminution and screening are well established and present no uncertainties in operation and performance. The technology of biomass gasifiers is sufficiently advanced to justify a substantial demonstration plant to prove the total IGCC concept and obtain reliable performance data. There are still areas of uncertainty, but these are relatively minor and will not be resolved until and unless a large integrated plant is built. Gas cleaning has been successfully developed in laboratories to the point where large-scale demonstration and long-term operating experience are necessary. This area can be considered the least developed and most likely to create problems in a demonstration plant.

Explicit spin-orbital equations for the energy and its first derivative are documented for both approaches [EOMEE-CCSD(2) and EOMIP-CCSD(2), respectively], and have been implemented in a large-scale quantum chemistry program.

Applications of both EOMIP-CCSD(2) and EOMEE-CCSD(2) provide results for final state properties that compare favorably with those obtained in full EOM-CCSD calculations.

The control principle of these facilities to enhance the system damping is the same in the sense that these stabilizers control the active power so as to stabilize power systems. The generalized control method for these facilities has not been studied from the viewpoint of active power control. The generalized control method applying the variable structure control from the viewpoint of acceleration power for the synchronous generators is proposed in this paper. The variable structure control can be applied to both nonlinear and linear systems and has robustness against parameter variations. In this paper, the control law is derived first in general form from the viewpoint of active power in the synchronous generator. This control law can take into account the automatic voltage regulator and governor effect indirectly. The feedback gains of the controller can be determined taking into account parameter variations in the synchronous generator. Second, this method is applied to the one‐machine infinite‐bus system with a variable series inductance so as to investigate the validity of this control method. The simulation results show that the controller is able to improve the system damping of the power system and is especially effective against parameter variations.

Also measured is the rate coefficient for He+-e recombination at zero relative energy. The experimental data are reported at two different transverse temperatures of the electron beam, namely, 0.1 and 0.01 eV/k. The present data are compared with calculations for radiative recombination, which is expected to be the dominant recombination process for our experimental conditions. The calculations of the rate coefficients are performed using the nonrelativistic dipole approximation represented by the semiclassical Kramers approximation, corrected by the Gaunt factor. The measured rate coefficients are systematically higher than the theoretical predictions for radiative recombination, corrected for field-ionization effects in the dipole magnets of the ring.

Many of these materials are thermally unstable and may polymerize during handling and storage with a release of significant amounts of energy. If this energy is not controlled properly, it can lead to a runaway reaction. Compounding the concern for the stability of monomers is the fact that these materials are typically transported and stored in large volume. The undesired initiation of the polymerization reaction may be caused by a number of factors, including contamination, exposure to extreme environmental conditions, or inhibitor loss. For example, an “unintended” polymerization can result from a seemingly benign procedure such as spill control with common absorbents. These and other factors mean that the reactive chemicals evaluation of monomers presents special problems and concerns which require more detailed experimental design for reliable hazard testing. This paper discusses the practical aspects of reactive chemicals testing strategies for monomers and rules‐of‐thumb for monomer inhibition, compatibility, spill control, and so‐called quenching (also called short‐stopping) agents. The techniques discussed range from simple “age and observe” type tests to more sophisticated heat flux calorimetry evaluations. We also discuss the more routine application of Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Accelerating Rate Calorimetry to monomers. Vent sizing applications with the VSP device are also presented with emphasis on total containment during a runaway.

We present measurements of the branching fractions scrB(B̄0→D*+l-ν̄)= (0.5/f00)[4.49±0.32(stat.)±0.39 (syst.)]% and scrB(B-→D*0l-(ν̄)= (0.5/f+-)[5.13±0.54 (stat) ±0.64 (syst)]%, where f00 and f+- are the neutral and charged B meson production fractions at the Υ(4S) resonance, respectively. Assuming isospin invariance and taking the ratio of charged to neutral B meson lifetimes measured at higher energy machines, we determine the ratio f+-/f00=1.04±0.13 (stat) ±0.12 (syst) ±0.10 (lifetime); further assuming f+-+f00=1 we also determine the partial width Γ(B̄→D*lν̄)=[29.9±1.9 (stat) ±2.7 (syst.) ±2.0 (lifetime)] ns-1 (independent of f+-/f00). From this partial width we calculate B̄→D*lν̄ branching fractions that do not depend on f+-/f00 or the individual B lifetimes, but only on the charged to neutral B lifetime ratio. The product of the CKM matrix element -Vcb- times the normalization of the decay form factor at the point of no recoil of the D* meson, scrF(y=1), is determined from a linear fit to the combined differential decay rate of the exclusive B̄→D*lν̄ decays: -Vcb-scrF(1)=0.0351±0.0019 (stat) ±0.0018 (syst) ±0.0008 (lifetime). The value for -Vcb- is extracted using theoretical calculations of the form factor normalization. © 1995 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20544464182

These beams circulate with energies of MeV per amu and are merged with an electron beam traveling at nearly the same velocity. In this way, relative energies from a fraction of a meV to tens of an eV are achieved. When dissociative recombination (DR) takes place, the neutral fragments exit the ring and strike a detector, enabling the measurement of total DR cross sections. Using this technique, coupled with a translucent barrier in which some particles pass directly through holes and others pass through a thin solid and lose part of their energy before striking the detector, we are able to measure the total cross section for DR in H3+ and the branching into the three-body (H+H+H) channel and the two-body (H2+H) channel. Coupling this method with the use of energy absorbers, we are able to measure these quantities for H2D+ and the separate two-body channels HD+H and H2+D.

It is one of a series to validate an analytical computer program that predicts void behavior of substances undergoing phase change under microgravity. Two flight experiments were launched in STS-62. The first, TES-l, containing lithium fluoride in an annular volume, performed flawlessly in the 22 hours of its operation. Results are reported in this paper. A software failure in TES-2 caused its shutdown after 4 seconds. A computer program, TESSIM, for “Thermal Energy Storage Simulation” is being developed to analyze the phenomena occurring within the TES containment vessel. The first order effects, particularly the surface tension forces, have been incorporated into TESSIM. TESSIM validation is based on two types of results. First is the temperature history of various points of the containment structure; and second, upon return from flight, the distribution of the TES material within the containment vessel following the last freeze cycle. The temperature data over the four cycles showed a repetition of results over the third and fourth cycles. This result is a confirmation that any initial conditions prior to the first cycle had been damped out by the third cycle. The TESSIM simulation showed a close comparison with the flight data. The solidified TES material distribution within the containment vessel was obtained by a tomography imaging process. The frozen material was concentrated toward the colder end of the annular volume. The TESSIM prediction showed the same pattern. With the general agreement of TESSIM and the data, a computerized visual representation can be shown which accurately shows the movement and behavior of the void during the entire freezing and melting cycles. © 1995, by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

While a large fraction of the research focused onto local aspects, some significant investigations were also undertaken to place local aspects of substorm dynamics into a more global framework. This report attempts, in an interpretive way, to summarize the results of the latter research, and to point out open questions. The title of the present report raises the question of the importance of the magnetotail in magnetospheric dynamics: The engine, or a mere exhaust. “Engine” is here taken to refer to an energy conversion device, whereas an “exhaust” operates primarily as a drainage channel for all or part of the converted energy. We address this question through the use of research emphasizing energy storage, transport, and dissipation. The report finds that the primary role of the magnetotail is the engine, i.e., the driver, of substorm dynamics. The exhaust pipe function, seen primarily in the ejection of plasmoids, is of secondary importance compared to the major energy transfer and conversion device nessessarily operating in the magnetotail during magnetospheric storms and substorms.

Early research used simple statistical methods and cross-correlation analyses. Such work suggested that solar wind-magnetosphere coupling is strongly controlled by the interplanetary electric field (-V × B). Later studies have used more sophisticated techniques such as linear prediction filtering to understand quantitatively the time scales and efficiency of such coupling. In fact, there emerge two distinct aspects and time scales for coupling processes: (1) Directly-driven ionospheric dissipation with response time scales of 10-20 min.; and (2) Storage-release mechanisms involving energy loading in the magnetotail for-1 hour. Very recent research has used nonlinear dynamical models and nonlinear filter techniques to incorporate both directly driven and loading-unloading behavior. The result is that very accurate predictions of magnetosphere-ionosphere response are possible using state-input space reconstruction and “nearest neighbor” nonlinear filters. © 1995, Society of Geomagnetism and Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences.

Variation in daily fecundity and longevity. Once the rates of hatching after cold storage had been tested, it was necessary to consider biotic potentialities of Encarsia formosa born from black pupae stored at low temperature. In spite of good rates of hatching, black pupae stored for 15 and 20 days at 9°C exhibited a reduction in the insects' biotic potentialities (daily fecundity and longevity). The addition of sugar providing energy during the hatching of the parasite palliates the injurious effect of the cold but the length of storage is still limited. The study shows that, on the one hand, minor variations in biotic potentialities exist due to differences in, for example, photoperiod, but that on the other hand, the stress due to the cold storage removes this variation. Après avoir testé le pourcentage d'éclosion d'Encarsia formosa en fonction des paramètres températures el durées de stockage an froid. l'examen des potentialités biotiques des auxiliaires issus de pupes noires stockées a basse température s'imposait.

L'ajout de sucre (substance énergétique) dès l'éclosion des parasites pallie l'effet nocif du froid mais la durée de stockage reste limitée. Il ressort de plus de cette étude, d'une part qu'il existe une variation du potentiel biotique selon les lots de parasites utilises (la photopénode apparaissant comme le principal facteur de ce changement) et d'autre part que le stress dû an froid aplanit cette variation. 1995 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",,"Aphelinidae; Encarsia formosa; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345143035

With current technologies, this remediation is estimated to cost at least 100 billion dollars. In an effort to reduce costs, improve safety, and minimize delays, the Underground Storage Tank—Integrated Demonstration was created for demonstration, testing, and evaluation of promising new technologies that can be used for UST remediation. These UST—ID demonstrations, which are typically at the pilot-plant scale, are performed by the Characterization and Waste Retrieval Program or by the Waste Processing and Disposal Program (WPDP). The results from these demonstrations will help to determine which processes will be used in the full-scale remediation of the USTs.

The method starts from a crystal orbital Hartree-Fock (COHF) wavefunction with the occupied Bloch orbitals transformed into Wannier orbitals. The coupled-cluster equations for the infinite system are simplified by CEPA-type approximations: A CEPA-0 (or linear coupled-cluster) formula is applied for the small intercell contributions to the total correlation energy while CI-SD, ACPF or other CEPA variants are used for the large intracell contributions. The enormous number of single and double excitations into the virtual space is greatly reduced by the use of pair natural orbitals (PNOs), which leads to large savings in the necessary computer time and disk storage. First applications to the van der Waals interaction in the linear chain and the hexagonal plane of He atoms, performed with medium size and large atomic basis sets, show that an accuracy can be reached for the infinite systems which is comparable to the accuracy of the corresponding calculations for small He clusters. Because of the extended use of the translational symmetry of the Wannier orbitals, the calculations for the linear infinite systems are even considerably faster than those for the oligomers He5 and He7. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040319028

Their catalytic and structural properties were compared with those of a Pd/ZrO2 catalyst of similar composition, prepared by conventional coprecipitation. For the preparation of Pd/ZrO2, the glassy PdZr3 alloy was either oxidized in situ, i.e. under CO oxidation conditions or oxidation in air. The catalysts were characterized by thermal analysis (TG, DTA), XRD, electron microscopy, CO chemisorption and nitrogen physiorption measurements. In situ, oxidation of the Pd-Zr alloy led to significantly higher BET and palladium surface areas than oxidation in air. The catalysts derived from the glassy Pd-Zr alloy exhibited considerably higher activities for both oxidation and disproportionation of CO at low temperature than the coprecipitated Pd/ZrO2 catalyst and palladium powder. The higher activities are attributed to the extremely large interfacial area of palladium and zirconia phases in the alloy-derived Pd/ZrO2 compared to the coprecipitated catalyst. For both alloy-derived catalysts the apparent activation energy for CO oxidation was 58±3 kJmol−1. In the absence of oxygen, disproportionation of CO with subsequent incorporation of carbon into the palladium lattice occurred with the alloy-derived catalysts readily at ca. 150°C, whereas no similar phenomenon was observed with the palladium powder up to 400°C. The interstitial carbon was found to be very reactive towards oxygen forming CO2. The storage of carbon by formation of a solid solution with Pd was found to influence significnatly the behaviour of the catalyst under forced cycling between CO and O2 feed. © 1995, Elsevier B.V.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039831839

Until 1980 the use of NMR in meat science was almost entirely restricted to the assay and the dynamics of water. In 1974, it was reported that informative 31P NMR spectra could be obtained from intact muscle. About 3040% of the weight of the live animal consists of skeletal muscle. Bones and other connective tissues provide support for the skeletal muscle system. Adipose tissue provides a storage site for energy. The meat industry needs to know the relative quantities of muscle, bone, and fat in the carcass. The main constituents of muscle are water (=75%), protein (18-20%), carbohydrates (1%), and fat ( ∼ 2 % ). Fat and protein are also to be determined accurately and quickly in meat products. Fat content decreases as water content increases and vice versa. The water-holding capacity of muscle is particularly relevant to meat quality and loss of water during storage is an important economic factor. Water-holding capacity is very sensitive to structural changes in protein and many NMR studies provide a better understanding of the water-protein interaction. © 1995, Academic Press Limited",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039270945

It has been used to study the effect of electron correlation on these properties in all trans finite polyenes of up to 16 carbon atoms. For smaller molecules it has been possible to carry out a complete set of CI calculations, from singly excited (SCI) to full configuration interaction (FCI). For the larger molecules the SCI and doubly excited CI (SDCI) calculations have been performed. The program permits the execution of a configuration interaction calculation of any order, n, in which all configurations involving the excitation of 1,2,...,n electrons from the occupied π-orbitals of the Hartree-Fock ground-state to the virtual π-orbitals are included. The set of π-orbitals is extracted from the ground state obtained from an all valence-electron, complete neglect of differential overlap (CNDO) calculation. The configurations are represented by binary integers so that their generation and storage is very rapid and efficient. The nonlinear optical properties have been computed mainly by the correction vector method but in some cases the sum-over-states (SOS) method has also been used to study the evolution of the THG coefficient as virtual states of increasing energy are added. The results obtained for the finite polyenes are found to be in very good agreement with both experimental and other theoretical values in literature.

The fragmentation patterns observed in the tandem mass spectra of peptides containing covalent modifications is used to directly search and fit linear amino acid sequences in the database. Specific information relevant to sites of modification is not contained in the character-based sequence information of the databases. The search method considers each putative modification site as both modified and unmodified in one pass through the database and simultaneously considers up to three different sites of modification. The search method will identify the correct sequence if the tandem mass spectrum did not represent a modified peptide. This approach is demonstrated with peptides containing modifications such as S-carboxymethylated cysteine, oxidized methionine, phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or phosphotyrosine. In addition, a scanning approach is used in which neutral loss scans are used to initiate the acquisition of product ion MS/MS spectra of doubly charged phosphorylated peptides during a single chromatographic run for data analysis with the databasesearching algorithm.

The key to this work is that ion decay can be induced by MALDI activation but requires an extended period of time to occur in large peptides. This extended decay period, which may be in excess of 20 ms, is provided in these experiments using the long storage times of the ion trap device. The ions are stored until decay is complete and then rapidly pulsed into a reflectron TOF for analysis. Since the ions decay within the trap, they ultimately appear as stable ions in the reTOF rather than as metastable decay peaks. The ion fragmentation was found to depend strongly on laser power and the rf voltage placed on the ring electrode of the trap. The fragmentation obtained was shown to be similar to but different from that observed in FAB-low-energy CAD. In particular, enhanced fragmentation was obtained in the lower mass range and large species could be more easily fragmented than with FAB-low-energy CAD.

To determine whether their feeding behavior is sensitive to carbohydrate and/or fatty acid utilization, white- crowned sparrows maintained on short daylength (9L15D) were injected intraperitoneally with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) or 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol (2,5-AM). Low doses of 2-DG (25 or 50 mg/kg) had no effect on food intake, and higher doses (100 or 300 mg/kg) significantly suppressed feeding after 1 and 2 h. No dose of 2-DG increased meal size. Similarly, low doses of 2,5-AM (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg) had no effect on food intake, and higher doses (300 and 600 mg/kg) significantly suppressed intake. These data suggest that decreased carbohydrate metabolism does not elicit feeding in this species. Importantly, these drugs, as well as insulin and glucagon, were demonstrated to increase plasma fatty acids as well as to decrease feeding. Injections of tributyrin (100, 300, 600, or 2,000 mg/kg ip) or glycerol (300, 450, and 600 mg/kg) also significantly suppressed 60-min and 120-min food intake dose dependently in these birds, and equimolar glucose (1,200 mg/kg) had no effect. We conclude that feeding by the white-crowned sparrow is unresponsive to manipulations of carbohydrate metabolism and is decreased after manipulations that increase plasma lipids.","2,5-anhydro-D- mannitol; 2-deoxy-D-glucose; birds; body weight; glucagon; insulin","deoxyglucose; glucagon; insulin; mannitol; animal experiment; article; bird; carbohydrate intake; carbohydrate metabolism; energy expenditure; fat intake; fatty acid blood level; feeding behavior; migration; nonhuman; priority journal; seasonal variation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029615980

All effects were compared to those of livers flushed/stored with a modified University of Wisconsin solution. Results: Glycine-treatment showed no improvement in liver energetics (ATP, ADP, AMP) and lactate accumulation; this solution had the lowest buffering capacity of the four tested (approximately 30% of the University of Wisconsin solution). The glycylglycine solution had the highest buffering capacity of the four solutions tested (including University of Wisconsin solution). Complete titration of the glycine-, combined amino acids-, and University of Wisconsin solutions (from 8.0 to pH=6.0) resulted in a minor decrease in glycylglycine buffer pH; pH dropped by 0.2 pH units. In glycylglycine-treated livers, energetics showed an improvement over the first 1 h cold storage; ATP and 'energy charge' values remained high and ADP levels (and consequently total adenylate contents) were 0.7-2.4 μmol/g greater than livers stored in University of Wisconsin solution. A 2-fold increase in lactate accumulation suggested that the improvement in liver energetics for the glycylglycine buffer was due to maintained flux through glycolysis brought about by enhanced buffering capacity. The solution containing a combination of amino acids exhibited maximum maintenance of liver energetics via increased glycolytic flux, despite its slightly inferior buffering capacity (85% of University of Wisconsin solution). ATP levels were maintained over the first 2 h storage and ADP levles (and consequently, total adenylate contents) were 1.2-2.1 μmol/g greater than University of Wisconsin solution-treated livers during the entire 24 h storage period. Energy charge values for livers treated with the combination of amino acids were also significantly higher than with glycine-, glycylglycine- and University of Wisconsin solution-treatment; even at 24 h, energy charge was 0.36 (comparable to only 4 h storage in University of Wisconsin solution). Conclusions: Our data suggest that a combination of amino acids may be required for maximum protection of the liver, and furthermore there may be several independent mechanisms, including buffering capacity, responsible for cytoprotection of the liver during cold storage. © 1995.","Amino acids; Buffering capacity; Energy metabolism; Glycine; Glycolysis; Liver preservation","amino acid; buffer; glycine; university of wisconsin solution; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cell protection; controlled study; energy metabolism; glycolysis; liver transplantation; nonhuman; organ preservation; priority journal; rat; Adenosine; Adenosine Monophosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Allopurinol; Amino Acids; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Glutathione; Glycine; Glycylglycine; Insulin; Liver; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Raffinose; Rats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029585435

Hydrogen is cost-effective in all scenarios with higher CO2 reduction targets. Hydrogen would be produced from fossil fuels, or from water and electricity or heat, depending upon the scenario. Hydrogen would be used in the residential and commercial sectors and for transport vehicles, industry, and electricity generation in fuel cells. At severe (50-70%) CO2 reduction targets, hydrogen would cost-effectively supply more than half of the total useful energy demands in three out of four scenarios. The marginal emission reduction costs in the CO2 removal scenario at severe CO2 reduction targets are DFL 200/tCO2 (ca $ 100/t). In the nuclear, renewable and energy conservation scenarios these costs are much higher. Whilst the fossil fuel scenario would be less expensive than the other scenarios, the possibility of CO2 storage in depleted gas reservoirs is a conditio sine qua non. © 1995.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Electricity; Energy conservation; Energy resources; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Industrial applications; Linear programming; Water; Carbon dioxide reduction; Energy demands; Energy systems; Gas reservoirs; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029546615

This information was used to identify the appropriate technologies which could enhance the value of the waste produced and, at the same time, improve the economic conditions of rural people. The study indicated that nearly 2364 tons of rural wastes in the form of crop residues, animal manure and human excreta are produced annually in the village with a population of 510. About 77% of the waste generated in the village was used as domestic fuel, animal fodder and organic fertilizer for crop production. The rest (23%) was left out in open fields for natural decomposition. The energy balance sheet of the village indicated that the present consumption of biomass resources was 50% less than that actually required for various domestic and agricultural applications. Anaerobic digestion of animal manure and human excreta produced in the village could yield 82% of the domestic energy required besides enriching the waste by 3-4 times as compared to conventional storage on the ground. If the traditional mud chulha (stove) were replaced by an improved chulha, each family unit could reduce their annual biomass (fire wood) consumption by about 2/3. Commercializing the utilization of coconut and paddy biomass using the village's man-power and facilities could increase the rural family income several fold. © 1995.","animal waste; biogas; chulha; coconut biomass; Crop residue; domestic refuse; mushroom","fertilizer; fuel; anaerobic digestion; animal food; article; biomass; domestic waste; energy balance; feces; fire; India; manure; priority journal; rural area; waste management; Animalia; Basidiomycota; agricultural waste; appropriate technology; developing country; energy supply; management approach; rural community; village economy; waste management; India; India, (South)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029545252

The integration of these weapons aboard land based vehicles will likely require careful consideration of the energy balances and power flows to all of the major loads aboard. Leveraging against ongoing research in electric drive trains capitalizes on a common power system bus and sharing of prime power between these loads, and such conceptual vehicles are classified as all electric. Early conceptual studies of “all electric” vehicle power systems under the complex dynamic loadings experienced in real mission profiles are needed to optimally configure and size their components. This paper describes a power simulation model built in the Matlab/ Simulink programming environment, which allows these early studies to be rapidly conducted. This tool can also be used to evaluate the relative penalty in mobility and firepower performance for degradation in selected component characteristics, thus highlighting weak links in the power system architecture.

The present work reports on the performance of lead-acid batteries associated with domestic PV lighting kits. A sample of 555 batteries, from a total of 2512 PV kits installed in the region of study at the time of the survey, was randomly taken for analysis. Batteries were rated using a semiquantitative methodology developed at the Electrical Research Institute of Mexico (IIE). Results obtained from the survey are on the positive side, meaning that car-type batteries (representing 87% of the sample) perform reasonably well as part of PV lighting kits. However, there may be reasons for concern. A number of factors of technical, environmental and socio cultural nature, can negatively influence the performance of batteries in the field. Results from the survey show that undersized storage capacity is one of the main technical factors contributing to a rapid decrease in battery performance. However, improper operation and maintenance practices, derived from socio cultural factors and a lack of proper user training, are important recurring elements that may result in battery lifes shorter than anticipated, and the subsequent disappointment of the user with respect to PV rural electrification. Local availability of spare batteries at the rural community level is identified as one critical issue for the sustainability of massive PV rural electrification projects. Proper disposal of spent batteries is seen as a potential environmental problem requiring due consideration. © 1995.",,"Maintenance; Mexico; Performance; Rural areas; Solar cell arrays; Battery; Electrification; Field study; Lead battery; Photovoltaic conversion; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029538095

For most countries the largest category of greenhouse gas emissions are those related to energy production and consumption, particularly CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels. There are two basic methods for calculation of these emissions: the ""top-down,' or aggregate fuel statistics method, and the ""botton-up,' or detailed fuel consumption method. Discrepancies may exist due to differences in data sources, accounting procedures, product definitions, heat equivalents, and carbon content coefficients. Special problems exist for calculating emissions from bioenergy and emissions of pollutants other than CO2 from fuel combustion. Problems necessitate country specific research to insure accurate emission estimates. The production, distribution, and storage of energy can also be significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Accuracy of emission estimates is greatly improved by country specific refinements based on in-country research and industry experience. -from Authors",,"emission inventory; greenhouse gas; inventory method; methodological problem; pollution monitoring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029536255

The common practice for large DHW solar systems, of employing a central storage and delivery facility, has been shown in the past to exhibit a rather poor performance and considerable heat losses. This is due to the extensive lengths of pipework required for both the transfer of solar energy and the delivery of hot water. The CCSS solar system presented can overcome the above problems by employing separate storage tanks for each family, thus being best suited for multistory buildings. The simulation analysis has revealed a number of interesting features for the system performance: (i) the collected energy is distributed to all users in a fair manner, irrespective of their distance from the collector field and the daily hot water consumption profiles; (ii) an energy saving behaviour is most likely to evolve by most users, since the auxiliary energy consumptions are charged individually (unlike in large DHW solar systems with central water storage and delivery); and (iii) high values of solar fractions, comparable with those attained by thermosiphon systems, have been derived. © 1995.",,"Design; Performance; Water tanks; Distributed system; Theoretical study; Solar water heaters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029532873

These are: (a) the characteristic plateau-like structure, the presence of autonomous intrinsic high-frequency oscillations, current bistability, and hysteresis of the current voltage (I-V) curve; (b) the high-frequency small signal response when the RTS, biased in the negative differential resistance region, operates in the stable mode, and the role of the electron inertia at very high frequencies; (c) the binary information storage at zero bias, without energy dissipation, and the accompanying 'anomalous' current bistability phenomena in quantum well diodes with special source and/or drain structures; (d) the hysteresis of trapped hole charge in the barrier region and accompanying current bistability before the onset of the resonant-tunneling current peak in quantum-well diodes with type II band-edge alignment. © 1995.","Quantum effects; Quantum well; Resonant tunnelling structures; Theory of electron transport","Band structure; Current voltage characteristics; Electron transport properties; Electron tunneling; Frequencies; Hysteresis; Oscillations; Semiconductor device structures; Semiconductor diodes; Semiconductor quantum wells; Binary information storage; Current bistability; Electron transport theory; Nonlinear quantum transport effects; Quantum distribution function; Resonant tunneling structures; Quantum theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029519438

This layer contains about l.5 × 108 tons of Amazon sediment deposited rapidly (~1 cm/d) from a fluid-mud suspension (10-400 g/l) during the months between January and June. Virtually the entire layer is remobilized in July-December and the sediment is advected alongshore to the northwest. Seasonal variations in trade-wind strength and in supply of Amazon shelf sediment are thought to control emplacement, and removal of this ephemeral deposit. Solitary surface gravity waves characteristic of this setting generate a net landward sediment flux, which, with shore-normal tidal currents, controls spatial geometry of the surface layer. The resultant lens-shaped deposit dissipates incident wave energy and provides a substrate above mean high water for mangrove colonization and irregular shoreline progradation of meters per year. Macroscale (sand/silt laminations) and microscale (plasmic fabric) sedimentary structures in the ephemeral layer record diverse temporal variations (e.g., tidal and wave-induced) in bottom shear stress and sediment supply. Ephemeral deposition of 108 tons is inferred to be common in coastal areas associated with large and energetic river dispersal systems. © 1995.",,"fluid mud; fluid mud suspension; isotopic analysis; mud flat; mud flats; mudflat; river dispersal system; seasonal variation; seasonal variations; sediment dynamics; sediment storage; Brazil, Amazon Coast; Brazil, Amazon River Mouth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029516717

Exploration strategies are guided by models of ore deposit occurrence and formation derived from both observation and an understanding of geological process. The construction of ore deposit models is dynamic and benefits from collaborative research, at times between disciplines apparently unrelated to economic geology. The use of both uniformitarian and non-uniformitarian concepts, will further define favourable epochs and regimes for major mineralization. New technology is dramatically affecting geology at all scales and, while the use of tried and proven methods continues, digital data acquisition and analysis, a product of Global Positioning Systems and Geographic Information Systems, amongst others, is becoming integral with geology. The density of measurement, and growing power of interpretation, of magnetic, electromagnetic and gravity fields is undergoing a paradigm shift, comparable to that seen in the oil exploration industry some twenty years ago. Isotopes are being used to develop ore deposit process models with practical exploration criteria. Petrological research is refining ideas of copper and gold concentration in favourable magma systems and is developing criteria for ore deposit search. Laboratory measurement techniques are evolving to a degree of precision enabling the origin and potential diamond grade of kimberlitic rocks to be predicted. Computerized prediction of gold deposits using regional structural concepts is now a reality. Geology will quantify the debate on global climatic change and influence types of energy consumption. A revolution in the electronic storage, retrieval and use of information is taking geology into the world of information cyberspace where publication media are undergoing a paradigm shift.

Undamped power swings with low frequency tend to occur in large power systems with complex configuration. Therefore, several stabilizing control schemes, e.g., a power system stabilizer (PSS), have already been investigated. On the other hand, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) is expected to be an effective apparatus in power systems since any SMES located in power systems is capable of leveling load demand, compensating for load changes, maintaining bus voltages and stabilizing power swings. The effectiveness of each function, however, depends upon the location of the SMES in the power system because output power from the SMES is distributed according to the impedance ratio of the transmission line at the SMES location. Therefore, it is difficult for SMES to serve two different purposes simultaneously. This paper proposes a combination of SMES with a high‐speed phase shifter (HSPS). The HSPS, which consists of a phase shift transformer and a set of power converters, is capable of controlling the power flow of the transmission line by adjusting the phase angle of a phase shift transformer. Therefore, it is expected that the combination of SMES and HSPS can realize a highly effective controller independent of its location. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed apparatus located far from a generator in a long distance bulk power transmission system is capable of stabilizing the power swing as effectively as the SMES located at a generator terminal. In addition, the effectiveness of both load change compensation and power system stabilization is confirmed numerically.

Although advantageous in terms of its energy density, the melting point of this salt (1121K) is beyond the commonly accepted upper- use temperature of 1100 K for chromium- bearing superalloys in vacuum. However, one commercially available nickel- base superalloy (Hastelloy B- 2) is chromium free; unfortunately, because of its high molybdenum content, this alloy can form phases that cause high- temperature embrittlement. To test the suitability of Hastelloy B- 2, it has been exposed to molten LiF, its vapor and vacuum at 1173 K for 2500, 5000, and 10 h. For control, the chromium- containing cobalt- base Haynes alloy 188 and nickel- base Haynes alloy 230 were also exposed to LiF and vacuum at 1173 K for 5000 h. Neither LiF nor vacuum exposures had any significant effect on Hastelloy B- 2 in terms of microstructural surface damage or weight change. Measurement of the post exposure tensile properties of Hastelloy B- 2, nevertheless, revealed low tensile ductility at 1050 K. Such embrittlement and low strength at elevated temperatures appear to preclude the use of Hastelloy B- 2 as a containment material for LiF. Little evidence of significant attack by LiF was seen in either of the chromium- containing superalloys; however, considerable weight loss and near- surface microstructural damage occurred in both alloys exposed to vacuum. Although measurement of the post exposure room-temperature tensile properties of Haynes alloys 188 and 230 revealed no significant loss of strength or ductility, the severe degree of microstructural damage found in unshielded alloys exposed to vacuum indicates that chromium-bearing superalloys might also be unsuitable for prolonged containment of LiF in space above 1100 K.

The Bioenergy Assessment Model (BEAM) has been developed to allow the techno-economic assessment of biomass to electricity and biomass to ethanol schemes, including investigation of the interfacing issues. Technical and economic parameters can be assessed for a variety of feedstocks, conversion technologies and generating cycles. A spreadsheet format has been used to make the model inherently expandable: new system options can be added by adding new spreadsheets and making minor adjustments to the executive program that links the spreadsheets together. Production modules are currently available for biomass supply from short rotation coppice and conventional forestry relevant to conditions and practices in NW Europe. The biomass conversion modules include pre-treatment (reception, storage, handling, comminution, screening and drying); atmospheric gasification (generic gasifier, wet gas scrubbing, dual fuel engine); pressure gasification (generic gasifier, hot gas filtration, gas turbine combined cycle); fast pyrolysis for liquid bio-fuel-oil (pyrolyser, oil storage, pilot-injected diesel engine); combustion (fluid bed combuster steam turbine), conventional acid hydrolysis fermentation and the NREL SSF process to ethanol. In addition there is a further module which can be used to examine the collection, mass burn and generation of electricity from MSW. BEAM has been used, and the results presented in this paper, to determine the costs of generating bio-electricity from short rotation coppice and conventional forestry over a range of power outputs and for each conversion technology. Alternative feedstock supply strategies have been examined and relations drawn between delivered feedstock cost and cost of electricity. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the cost of bio-electricity production from short rotation coppice is highly sensitive to the yield of the crop. BEAM has been shown to work well with the systems under consideration and is capable of further development. The long term aim is to provide a simple model with on-line help and information that will allow biomass systems developers to make initial assessments of the feedstock and technology options that are available and to direct research and development towards the more promising areas. © 1995.","Biomass; coppice; economics; modelling; pyrolysis; systems analysis","Combustion; Decision support systems; Economics; Electricity; Energy conversion; Ethanol; Fermentation; Gasification; Pyrolysis; Sensitivity analysis; Spreadsheets; Systems analysis; Acid hydrolysis fermentation; Atmospheric gasification; Bioelectricity; Bioenergy assessment model; Biomass conversion; Coppice; Liquid bio-fuel-oil; Pressure gasification; Technoeconomic assessment; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029485018

The variation of the surrounding medium's resistivity due to changes in climatic conditions makes it difficult to stop the corrosion completely. So, the development of an automatic CP system is necessary to overcome this difficulty. This work aims to automate the conventional manually used impressed current method for buried steel pipelines.

With 400 m2 of high efficiency collectors, the solar energy supplied 38% of the demand in winter and 91% of the demand in summer. © 1995.",,"Computer simulation; Performance; Turkey; Absorption heat pump; Heat pump; Numerical simulation; R 22 fluid; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029470071

The solar energy is stored in a salt-hydrate phase-change material (PCM) held in the collector and is discharged to cold water flowing through a surface heat exchanger located in a layer of stationary heat transfer liquid (SHTL), floating over an immiscible layer of PCM. A theoretical model for the charging process of the proposed integrated collector is presented. The model assumes one-dimensional transient heat conduction in the PCM and SHTL layers and neglects the effect of convection heat transfer in these regions. The model was solved numerically by an enthalpy-based finite differences method and validated against experimental data.

With a ME-intake of 1.3 MJ/kg0.75 the proportion of retained protein from the protein pool varied from 50 to 75% depending on the age of animals and the protein quality. At a low protein intake and ME of 0.6 MJ/kg0.75 the utilization of protein was reduced to about 25% as a substantial part of the protein pool was oxidized. The carbohydrate group from the protein sources constituted less than 5% of the carbohydrate pool. The oxidation of carbohydrates was between 50-75% of the pool in all experiments, while the rest was used for lipogenesis. Even on a low feeding level the pattern occurred indicating a requirement for specific substances formed in the body. Lipogenesis constituted 46-96% of the fat pool depending of the amount on digested fat in the different experiments. No oxidation of fat was observed in experiments with pigs (30-90 kg LW) on a high feeding level in spite of the broad variation in the amount of digested fat, indicating a complete storage of the fat pool into body fat. In experiments with piglets (3-9 kg LW) on the same energy intake fat oxidation of about 30% occurred, probably caused by the high energy requirement of the piglets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,"protein; soybean oil; animal; animal food; article; barley; biological model; caloric intake; carbohydrate metabolism; comparative study; lipid metabolism; maize; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; physiology; protein intake; swine; Animal Feed; Animals; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Hordeum; Lipid Metabolism; Models, Biological; Oxidation-Reduction; Proteins; Soybean Oil; Swine; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029451353

In the present work we tested whether the motility at nonomolar ATP-concentrations could be supported by cardiac myosin as well. Actomyosin (skeletal actin and bovine ventricular myosin) was pretreated in the in vitro motility assay with 1 mM ATP; subsequently, the ATP level was reduced by multiple rigor-solution washes. By the final rigor-solution wash, the ATP concentration, monitored by the luciferin-luciferase assay, dropped to the order of 100 nM. Even at this low ATP level actin-filament movement remained in evidence. This was in marked contrast to the situation where ATP concentration was gradually increased from zero; in the latter, filament movement began only as ATP levels exceeded 1-2 microM. The difference indicates that potential energy is stored during the initial ATP treatment, and utilized later as the free ATP falls below micromolar levels. Although the velocity of cardiac myosin-supported movement was only one fourth of that of skeletal myosin, both myosins supported actin movement down to similar ATP concentrations. The similarity in response of the two myosins to ATP implies a similar degree of potential energy storage. Given the significantly different specific ATPase activities, however, it appears that the mechanism of potential energy storage and release involves factors different from those involved in the release of chemical energy by the myosin ATPase.",,"actin; adenosine triphosphate; animal; article; cattle; comparative study; energy metabolism; heart; heart muscle; metabolism; muscle contraction; physiology; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; skeletal muscle; spectrofluorometry; Actins; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Cattle; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Energy Metabolism; Heart; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Myocardium; Spectrometry, Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029434075

Distribution coefficients (Kd) were determined as a function of contact time, pH, sorbent and sorbate concentration and temperature. The data were interpreted in terms of Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms. Thermodynamic parameters for the sorption system were determined at three different temperatures. The positive value of the heat of sorption, ΔH° = 30.62 kJ/mol at 298 K, shows that the sorption of strontium on bentonite is endothermic. The negative value of the free energy of sorption, ΔG° = -10.69 kJ/mol at 298 K, shows the spontaneity of the reaction. ΔG° becomes more negative with increasing temperature, which shows that the sorption process is more favorable at higher temperatures. The mean free energy for sorption, E ∼ 9 kJ/mol, suggests that ion exchange is the predominant mode of sorption in the Sr concentration range studied, i.e. 0.01 - 0.3 mol/dm3. The presence of complementary cations depresses the sorption of strontium on bentonite in the order Ca2+&gt;Mg2+&gt;K+&gt;Na+.

Consideration of the experimental data, using an empirical model for the copper foils obtained from fast capacitor bank experiments, showed that the predictions are only accurate until the fuse begins to vaporize. The knowledge gained will enable better fuse designs for FC conditioning to be produced, but a complete understanding of the post-burst fuse behaviour must await a detailed theoretical approach which is under development elsewhere. The paper concludes by describing a novel circuit arrangement, which avoids the post-burst fuse behaviour.

Due to the difficulty in estimating reservoir evaporation by accepted energy budget methods, it is useful to determine the sensitivity of estimated reservoir yield to both factors. First, an experiment comparing storage-yield curves generated by a daily, monthly, and annual time-step mass-balance reservoir model is performed. The monthly time-step model’s estimated yield is slightly larger than that estimated using a daily time-step model, and the error becomes smaller as the storage capacity gets larger. In a second experiment, comparisons are made for yield estimates using different combinations of precipitation and potential evaporation time series and/or mean monthly values. Assuming that the best reservoir yield is determined using a year-round, open-water, potential-evaporation time series, fixed average monthly values of potential evaporation and monthly precipitation time series are shown to accurately estimate reservoir yield in Massachusetts regardless of the storage capacity. The sensitivity of yield estimates to reservoir ice and snow cover is shown to be negligible. © ASCE.",,"mass balance model; potential evaporation; precipitation time series; reservoir yield; storage yield curve; time step; USA, Massachusetts; Errors; Estimation; Evaporation; Mathematical models; Precipitation (chemical); Sensitivity analysis; Stream flow; Surfaces; Reservoir yield estimates; Time step surface moisture fluxes; Reservoirs (water)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029416576

The methodology addresses the issue of nonuniqueness of the inverse solutions by generating an ensemble of transmissivity fields considered to be equally likely, each of which is in agreement with the measured transmissivity and pressure data. It consists of generating a selected number of conditionally simulated transmissivity fields and then calibrating each of the fields to match the measured steady state or transient pressures, in a least squares sense. The calibration phase involves an iterative implementation of an automated pilot point approach coupled with conditional simulations. Pilot points are the parameters of calibration. They are synthetic transmissivity data which are added to the transmissivity database to produce a revised conditional simulation during calibration. Coupled kriging and adjoint sensitivity analysis is employed for the optimal location of pilot points, and gradient search methods are used to derive their optimal transmissivities. The pilot point methodology is well suited for characterizing the spatial variability of the transmissivity field in contrast to methods using zonation. Pilot points are located where their potential for minimizing the objective function is the highest. This minimizes the perturbations in the transmissivities which are optimally assigned to the pilot point and results in minimal changes to the covariance structure of the transmissivity field. The calibrated fields honor the transmissivity measurements at their locations, preserve the variogram, and match the measured pressures in a least squares sense. Since there are numerous options in the execution of this methodology, computational experiments have been conducted to identify the most efficient among them. The method has been applied to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) site, in southeastern New Mexico, where the U.S. Department of Energy is conducting probabilistic system assessment for the permanent disposal of transuranic nuclear waste. The resulting calibrated transmissivity fields are input to a Monte Carlo analysis of the total system performance. The present paper, paper 1 of a two‐paper presentation, describes the methodology.

Earlier work indicated for non-foaming systems one of the two drift-flux correlations can be chosen on the basis of viscosity. Herein, for the churn-turbulent drift-flux correlation (low-viscosity system), the dependence average void fraction and dimensionless superficial vapor velocity [1] on vessel shape (e.g., vertical cylinder, horizontal cylinder, or sphere) is explored. There is very little shape dependence and it is quantified below. A simple two-constant correlation is suggested, which satisfies the conditions at low and high dimensionless superficial vapor velocity conditions. Constants are given for vertical cylinders, horizontal cylinders, and spheres for the churnturbulent drift-flux correlation. The disengagement model is based on a constant energy generation per unit mass of liquid. Thus, the application to runaway reaction with vaporization is straightforward. The application of the correlation to reactive systems producing gas (i.e., gassy systems) and to those both producing gas and involving vaporization (i.e., hybrid systems) in non-constant cross-sectional area vessels is clarified here. Rating calculation equations are developed, and the calculations are illustrated. For a rating calculation, the maximum gas rate (based on vent capacity) is known. The calculation of maximum average void fraction (i.e., 1-fill ratio) and gas generation per unit of liquid is straightforward. Thus, the rate of reaction (i.e., gas generation) must be found to assure that the vent capacity is sufficient. © 1995.","Churn-turbulent drift-flux correlation; DIERS; Disengagement; Pressure relief design; Two-phase flow; Venting; Void fraction","Calculations; Correlation methods; Cylinders (shapes); Gases; Liquids; Pressure relief valves; Rating; Spheres; Turbulence; Vaporization; Vents; Viscosity; Churn-turbulent; DIERS; Disengagement; Drift-flux correlation; Shape dependence; Venting; Void fraction; Mathematical models; article; correlation function; dangerous goods; flow; gas; prediction; pressure; storage; vaporization; velocity; vessel; viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029411976

Mounting the line on the top of the vessel does not necessarily guarantee all vapor flow. One must calculate whether vapor bubbles formed in the liquid will disengage before they reach the vent entrance. Disengagement can be predicted via an axial void fraction profile that is calculated based upon volumetric gas production. It is assumed that the liquid phase is continuous and that pseudo-steady state is reached. The disengagement model is based on a constant energy generation per unit mass of liquid. For non-foaming systems, one of two drift-flux correlations can be chosen on the basis of viscosity. The churn-turbulent drift-flux correlation is for low-viscosity systems, and the DIERS' viscous-bubbly drift-flux correlation is for high-viscosity system [1, 2]. This model reduces to a single ordinary differential equation (ode). Analytic integration results for this model are possible for constant cross-sectional area vessels (e.g., vertical cylinder) and non-unity distribution parameters Co [3-5]. If this calculation shows the bubbles do not disengage, either a partial differential equation model must be solved or the coupling equation must be used. The coupling equation uses the maximum void fraction (calculated from the ode) and ties together the vessel and vent models. The ode solutions relate the local and average void fractions to the dimensionless superficial vapor velocity. For the churn-turbulent drift-flux correlation, explicit relationships are presented for the first time. They validate the earlier approximation of Fauske et al. [6] (see also Ref. [3]). For the DIERS' viscous-bubbly drift-flux correlation, implicit relationships are presented for the first time in the open literature. The earlier approximation of Fauske et al. [6] (see also Ref. [7]) fit the data, but is different than these integration results. Further work is in progress to refit the data [8] and to clarify the best model to use. For non-constant cross-sectional area vessels (e.g., horizontal cylinders and spheres), the analytic integration is difficult, but numeric results have been presented [3, 7]. The details of the numeric integration are presented and discussed here. As the cross-sectional area converges (toward the top of the vessel), the vapor concentration (i.e., the void fraction) and velocity increase. The maximum local void fraction occurs at the top of the vessel. Numerical difficulties are encountered as a result of the cross-sectional area going to zero at the bottom and top of the vessel. The pseudo-steady-state model imposes void fractions of minimum and maximum at these extremes (i.e., 0 and 1/Co). © 1995.","Churn-turbulent; DIERS; DIERS' viscous bubbly; Disengagement; Drift-flux correlations; Two-phase flow; Venting; Void fraction","Bubbles (in fluids); Calculations; Correlation methods; Design; Integration; Mathematical models; Partial differential equations; Pressure relief valves; Turbulence; Vents; Viscosity; Churn-turbulent; DIERS; Disengagement; Drift-flux correlations; Ordinary differential equations; Venting; Void fraction; Volumetric gas production; Two phase flow; article; calculation; dangerous goods; liquid; pressure; storage; turbulent flow; vapor; velocity; vessel; viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029411961

A main reason of energy loss during the summer is the system design which necessitates PV array oversizing to supply the load during the winter season when solar energy is limited. Other reasons that cause energy loss are mismatch between the array and the load or battery, energy loss in batteries and loss due to PV array disconnect. The array disconnect loss takes place during the summer season when the storage battery is fully charged. To avoid the disconnect loss, a novel Battery Voltage Regulator (BVR) that allows supplying the load directly from the array is used, when the battery is fully charged. In this work, energy losses have been analysed and divided into fundamental (unavoidable) and non-fundamental losses. Both conventional (using conventional BVR) and novel (using novel BVR) PV systems are studied. A load consuming a constant power 24 h a day through the year is considered.

Variational formulations which originate from the principle of minimum potential energy, the Hellinger-Reissner principle and the Hu-Washizu principle are considered. They are characterized by the weak enforcement of the velocity-displacement relation and of the initial displacement and velocity. Special cases are obtained by a priori enforcement of these conditions. The time integration algorithms obtained discretizing in the space and time domains are studied with reference to accuracy, stability and high-frequency behaviour. It is shown that some of these algorithms are very competitive with respect to classical finite difference methods. The only drawback of variational methods seems to be the large size of the set of simultaneous equations which they generate. Effective solution procedures, aiming at minimizing both the storage and the computational effort, will be discussed in a separate paper. © 1995.",,"Algorithms; Dynamics; Equations of motion; Finite difference method; Stability; Time domain analysis; Velocity; Wave propagation; Accuracy; Algebraic equations; Finite difference time discretization; High frequency; Minimum potential energy; Time integration; Velocity-displacement rotations; Weak variational formulation; Weighted residual method; Variational techniques",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029407361

The results show that both stress softening and hardening can occur in controlled load cyclic conditions. At high stress levels and/or frequencies, both the polyacetal and nylon6,6 show evidence of thermal softening as characterized by changes in their dynamic viscoelastic properties and decrease in storage modulus with corresponding increases in loss modulus and loss tangent. This effect is supported by observed decreases in the overall crystallinity as measured in DSC experiments. At lower stress levels (the mechanically dominated region), all results indicate that, although fatigue crack propagation (FCP) is one of the mechanisms governing the fatigue life, its contribution is minor and crack initiation time constitutes the majority of the fatigue life. Also, during the initiation stage, both materials become less viscoelastic and more elastic.

Downs Laboratory of Physics, Pasadena, CA 91125, United States","The three large solar particle events, beginning on October 19, 1989 and lasting approximately six days, were characterized by high fluences of solar protons and heavy ions at 1 AU. During these events, an abnormally large number of upsets (243) were observed in the random access memory of the attitude control system (ACS) control processing electronics (CPE) on-board the geosynchronous TDRS-1 (Telemetry and Data Relay Satellite). The RAM unit affected was composed of eight Fairchild 93L422 memory chips. The Galileo spacecraft, launched on October 18,1989 (one day prior to the solar particle events) observed the fluxes of heavy ions experienced by TDRS-1. Two solid-state detector telescopes on-board Galileo, designed to measure heavy ion species and energy, were turned on during time periods within each of the three separate events. The heavy ion data have been modeled and the time history of the events reconstructed to estimate heavy ion fluences. These fluences were converted to effective LET spectra after transport through the estimated shielding distribution around the TDRS-1 ACS system. The number of single event upsets (SEU) expected was calculated by integrating the measured cross section for the Fairchild 93L422 memory chip with average effective LET spectrum. The expected number of heavy ion induced SEU's calculated was 176. GOES-7 proton data, observed during the solar particle events, were used to estimate the number of proton-induced SEU's by integrating the proton fluence spectrum incident on the memory chips, with the two-parameter Bendel cross section for proton SEU's. The proton fluence spectrum at the device level was gotten by transporting the protons through the estimated shielding distribution. The number of calculated proton-induced SEU's was 72, yielding a total of 248 predicted SEU's, very close to the 243 observed SEU's. These calculations uniquely demonstrate the roles that solar heavy ions and protons played in the production of SEU's during the October 1989 solar particle events. © 1995 IEEE",,"Calculations; Control systems; Ions; Particle detectors; Protons; Radiation counters; Random access storage; Satellites; Solid state devices; Telescopes; Attitude control systems; Heavy ions; Proton fluence spectrum; Solar heavy ion fluxes; Solar particle events; Solid state detectors; Elementary particles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029390728

The use of a short term thermal storage is considered in order to match heat supply and demand. Heat demand reduction and cogeneration appear to have a considerable fuel saving potential in new Dutch houses. At present Dutch natural gas prices both options are not cost-effective. However, expected investment cost reductions and energy taxes that are under consideration may eliminate this hindrance. These developments would also open possibilities towards combinations of heat demand reduction and cogeneration.

The results showed that the resistance and inductance of discharges in the ignition system and in the laser chamber vary as the values of the capacitors change. This occurs because the driving circuit, and particularly its capacitances, affect the formation of the two discharges and finally the laser output. The coupling of the two circuit loops is weak and is achieved through laser channel inductance. Finally, the behavior of the laser output versus storage and peaking capacitors is determined from a) the electric energy deposited in the laser channel, as a short pumping pulse and b) the laser oscillation time delay which depends on the upper laser level and the Q factor of the cavity. © 1995 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","Discharges; Nitrogen lasers; Pulsed gas lasers","Capacitance; Capacitor storage; Capacitors; Electric discharges; Electric resistance; Equivalent circuits; Laser pulses; Networks (circuits); Nitrogen; Inductance; Laser oscillation time delay; Peaking capacitors; Pulsed gas lasers; Gas lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029389295

We wanted to determine the effects of aging on the material and ultrasonographic properties of equine superficial digital flexor (SDF) tendon. Ultrasonographic measurements of left forelimb SDF tendon cross-sectional area and mean echogenicity were made in 23 standing horses ranging in age from 2 to 23 years. All horses had not been in work for a minimum of 6 months prior to the study. After euthanasia, left forelimb bone-muscle-tendon-bone specimens were mounted in a materials testing system. The SDF tendon was cyclically loaded sinusoidally 100 times at 0.5 Hz from 1.5 to 5.0% strain, then was submitted to 10-minute creep-and-stress relaxation tests. Modulus of elasticity, load at 3% strain, and creep-and-stress relaxation were determined for each specimen. A significant positive correlation was found between elastic modulus and age. Correlation was not found between age and SDF tendon cross-sectional area or mean echogenicity. When 2-year-old horses were compared with older horses, the latter had tendons with a significantly (P = 0.007) greater modulus of elasticity. The authors conclude that increasing age through maturity is associated with a corresponding increase in equine SDF tendon elastic modulus.",,"aging; animal; article; biomechanics; body weight; echography; elastic tissue; elasticity; female; forelimb; histology; horse; male; physiology; tendon; Aging; Animals; Biomechanics; Body Weight; Elastic Tissue; Elasticity; Female; Forelimb; Horses; Male; Tendons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029382971

Energy intake is difficult to measure accurately; changes in body weight, for example, are not a good measure of the adequacy of energy intake, because fluctuations in body weight are common even if the overall trend is toward weight loss. It is now customary to assess energy requirements indirectly from total energy expenditure. Total energy expenditure consists of basal metabolism, postprandial thermogenesis, and physical activity. Energy expenditure is related to both body weight and body composition. A reduction in total energy expenditure accompanies weight loss, because basal metabolic rate decreases with the loss of lean tissue mass. Similarly, with weight gain, there is an increase in basal metabolic rate, because lean tissue mass grows to support the increase in fat tissue mass. Excess energy intake over energy expenditure causes weight gain and an accompanying increase in total energy expenditure. Following a period of adaptation, total energy expenditure will match energy intake and body weight will stabilize at a higher level. This same relationship holds for weight loss. Respiratory quotient (measured in steady state) is an indication of the proportion of energy expenditure derived from fat and carbohydrate oxidation. Over long periods of time, fat balance is equivalent to energy balance, as an excess of fat intake over fat oxidation causes fat storage. © 1995.",,"body weight; caloric intake; carbohydrate diet; energy metabolism; fat intake; human; nutrition; nutritional status; obesity; pathophysiology; review; Body Weight; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Human; Nutrition; Nutritional Status; Obesity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029377506

However, lack of space because of frameworks often precludes the use of conventional retention by diatorics and pins. Adhesion of porcelain denture teeth to denture resin could also stiffen and possibly strengthen dentures and decrease stain ingress between porcelain teeth and resin denture bases. Unlike previous studies that investigated the bond between conventional feldspathic metal-ceramic porcelain and bis-GMA based composite resin, this study investigated adhesion of denture tooth porcelain to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). High-energy air abrasion, hydrofluoric acid etching, and the use of a general purpose bonding agent resulted in an improved bond strength of heat-cured denture PMMA bonded to denture tooth porcelain. Silane, coating did not improve bond strengths, and conventional air abrasion was no more effective than polishing with 600-grit, silicon carbide. Storage in water and artificial aging substantially decreased bond strengths. The strongest bond strengths were achieved by a high-energy-abrasion + etching + multiple-purpose bonding-agent treatment, but a simpler etching + multiple-purpose bonding-agent treatment also produced reliable results. A laboratory technique was suggested. The role of surface treatment in the mechanism of adhesion was examined with scanning electron microscopy. High-energy abrasion produced a slightly more detailed initial topography than conventional air abrasion, but after etching, the high-energy topography became much more detailed. Surface topography alone did not account for all differences found. © 1995 Editorial Council of The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.",,"methacrylic acid derivative; methacrylic acid methyl ester; silane derivative; Tenure adhesive; tooth cement; analysis of variance; article; cementation; chemistry; comparative study; dental care; denture; elasticity; materials testing; methodology; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; tensile strength; tooth brushing; tooth prosthesis; Analysis of Variance; Comparative Study; Dental Bonding; Dental Cements; Dental Polishing; Dental Porcelain; Dental Stress Analysis; Denture Bases; Elasticity; Materials Testing; Methacrylates; Methylmethacrylates; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Silanes; Surface Properties; Tensile Strength; Tooth, Artificial",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029375102

The finite element method was used to find the upper and lower edge frequencies of the shorted and open‐ended gratings corresponding to the shorted and open electrical terminal of the NSPUDT, the potential standing wave distribution and the static capacitance per pair of NSPUDT, needed for determination of the circuit parameters. Due to the analysis method, the anisotropy of the substrate, the electrical perturbation effect, the acoustic perturbation effect, and the energy storage effect can be taken into account. Actually, the equivalent circuit parameters of the NSPUDT on an ST‐cut 25° X‐propagation quartz substrate were computed and the reflection and excitation characteristics of the surface wave were derived.

The effects of freezing on tissues that comprise spinal segments have been examined separately, but little work has been done on intact specimens. We examined the effect of freezing on the structural properties of porcine cervical spines. The intact cervical spines of seven pigs (a total of 14 specimens–seven of C2–C4 and seven of C5–C7) were stored frozen (−20°C) for 1 month. The ultimate compressive load, displacement, stiffness, and energy absorbed were obtained using a monotonic compressive load applied at 3,000 N/sec. The structural properties were compared with those of another 14 porcine cervical specimens (control group, matched for age and weight) that were tested in a fresh state. The frozen storage of the vertebral specimens significantly increased the ultimate compressive load (24%) and energy absorbed to failure (33%). The stiffness and displacement at failure were not affected. We concluded that the use of freezing as a storage medium should be of concern when the resulting measures are used to quantify the ultimate compressive load of the spinal motion segments.

The vacuum system for the LHC will be at cryogenic temperatures (between 1.9 and 20 K) and will be exposed to synchrotron radiation emitted by the protons. A stringent limitation on the vacuum is given by the energy deposition in the superconducting coils of the magnets due to nuclear scattering of the protons on residual gas molecules because this may provoke a quench. This effect imposes an upper limit to a local region of increased gas density (e.g. a leak), while considerations of beam lifetime (100 h) will determine more stringent requirements on the average gas density. The proton beam creates ions from the residual gas which may strike the vacuum chamber with sufficient energy to lead to a pressure 'run-away' when the net ion induced desorption yield exceeds a stable limit. Synchrotron radiation induced gas desorption, well known from electron rings, also affects the dynamic vacuum in the cold LHC by the gradual accumulation of easily re-desorbable, condensed gas and by the steeply rising H2 vapour pressure as the coverage exceeds a monolayer. These dynamic pressure effects will be limited to an acceptable level by installing a perforated 'beam screen' which shields the cryopumped gas molecules at 1.9 K from synchrotron radiation and which also absorbs the synchrotron radiation power at a higher and, therefore, thermodynamically more efficient temperature. © 1995.",,"Colliding beam accelerators; Cryogenics; Density (specific gravity); Deposition; Gases; Molecules; Protons; Scattering; Superconducting magnets; Synchrotron radiation; Temperature; Vacuum; Beam lifetime; Cryogenic temperature; Energy deposition; Gas density; Gas desorption; Large hadron collider; Nuclear scattering; Residual gas molecules; Superconducting coils; Vacuum system; Vacuum technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029358157

In this work, these properties are studied in thermoplastic elastomer matrix materials (SBS) filled with commercial carbon fiber (PAN), oxidated, and subsequently treated with diazide, which generates SO2N3 groups on the fiber surface, theoretically capable of chemical reaction with the polymeric chain. For the composite containing diazide‐treated oxidated fiber, certain phenomena have been proven to occur, such as lesser storing modulus losses in case of increasing strain, greater equivalent interfacial thickness values, and higher mechanical energy loss values than those of composite containing oxidated fiber. An increase in glass transition temperature and apparent activation energy of the relaxation process, with respect to composite‐containing commercial fiber, are also observed, which, altogether, allow for the statement that new matrix–fiber bonds are generated through the sulfonyl azide group, conferring greater strength to the interface, although it is less stiff than the one formed with oxidated fiber.

Useful collected energy, radiationinduced stratification and draw-induced mixing are characterized in eight trials in which test duration, initial tank water temperature, flow rate during withdrawal of heated water from the collector, withdrawal pattern and reflectance of the backplane were varied. All tests were performed at nominal irradiance of 900 W/m2normal incidence, and collector slope of 45 degrees. The capability of the TRNSYS integral collector storage model to predict performance for operating conditions for which data are assumed to be unavailable was assessed. Using data from one experimental trial, optical efficiency (T α) of the collector was determined by matching predicted useful energy gain to measured gain. Effectiveness of the calibrated model was based on a comparison of predicted gains to measured values obtained in the remaining seven trials. For five of seven trials, predicted performance is within nine percent of measured performance and less than experimental error. For the other two trials, predicted performance is within 15 percent of measured performance. The higher discrepancies may be partially due to experimental conditions not modeled such as heating of the piping connecting the collector to the test facility and inadequate characterization of back-plane reflectivity. The model does not predict radiation- induced stratification. Although the effect of mixing during draws can be approximated by specifying the number of fully mixed volume segments in the tanks, selection of number of nodes requires knowledge of the behavior of the system. The number of nodes selected has minimal impact on total energy gain, but does affect the temperature of water delivered to the load. © 1995 by ASME.",,"Gain measurement; Heat storage; Mathematical models; Performance; Solar collectors; Solar radiation; Temperature; Thermal stratification; Energy gain; Integral collector storage; Optical efficiency; Solar simulators; Solar water heaters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029356732

The charge and discharge process in a cool energy storage system is typically a 24-hour cycle. In this paper an optimal controller for this process is designed that minimizes the operating costs of the storage facility. The cool energy storage system is characterized mathematically as a state-variable system, and management of its operation is developed as a discrete-time optimal control problem. The optimal system operating strategy is defined to be a management policy that minimizes the total operating costs over a 24-hour horizon, while satisfying a set of constraints imposed by the cooling requirements on the system and the capacities of individual components of the system. The control variables are the operating levels of the ice-builder compressors and auxiliary chiller plants in the cooling system. A 24-hour load-forecast model is developed to achieve dynamic system response to the variations in the ambient weather conditions. Hourly building cooling loads are predicted over the 24-hour horizon to schedule adequate charging of storage to meet peak-period loads. The degradation of performance of the optimal control algorithm attributable to the lack of perfect foresight of weather conditions and associated building loads is analyzed via a case study, and a safety margin is calculated and presented to compensate for same. © 1995 IEEE","Control; Cool Storage; Load forecasting; Optimal; Optimal Operations","Algorithms; Compressors; Energy storage; Mathematical models; Nonlinear programming; Optimal control systems; Optimization; Refrigeration; Scheduling; Cool storage system; Cooling loads; Thermal energy storage; Cooling systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029354760

The current U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) strategy of direct disposal of unprocessed light-water reactor (LWR) spent fuel poses significant long-term proliferation risks and may result in poor long-term containment of radionuclides. An alternative strategy based on the RAPD (Reactor/Accelerator Plutonium Destruction) system produces a final waste form that is highly resistant to proliferation and contained effectively by ceramic coatings for very long time periods, and shows great potential for generating net revenues from the sale of electricity. The RAPD system utilizes modular helium reactors (MHRs), which can be used also for effective destruction and degradation of weapons-grade plutonium, production of tritium for national defense purposes, and demonstration of an advanced reactor technology for low-cost production of electricity with high thermal efficiency. The growing shortage of storage space i spent-fuel pools at commercial LWR sites and the lack of a centralized facility for monitored retrievable storage (MRS) of spent fuel has already adversely affected one utility, and many reactors face possible premature shutdown unless an MRS facility becomes available in the near term. The RAPD-based strategy would utilize an MRS facility to alleviate this near-term, spent-fuel burden for many nuclear utilities. © 1995.",,"Ceramic coatings; Energy efficiency; Light water reactors; Radioisotopes; Risks; Spent fuels; Strategic planning; Modular helium reactors; Monitored retrievable storage; Proliferation risks; Reactor/accelerator plutonium destruction; Radioactive waste disposal; management strategy; permanent disposal; radioactive waste; waste management; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029347140

The hydrogen concentration profile of the planar waveguides was measured after aging with Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) and compared to the profile from a control sample.

Hypothermic storage extends heart preservation by effectively stopping cellular metabolism, thereby preventing toxic accumulations of metabolic wastes and depletion of energy stores.

The air-powder polisher was introduced to provide a method to quickly remove stains and plaque. The purpose of this study was to evaluate what effect preparing teeth with an air-powder polisher (Air-flow 2, Shofu) has on bonding to enamel and dentin substrates. Methods. The bonding systems used in this study were one-step etching/priming systems (KBT-5, Kanebo; and Clearfil Liner Bond II, Kuraray) and a two-step etching/priming system (Superbond D-Liner Plus, Sun Medical). Bovine enamel and dentin surfaces were prepared and finished with 600-grit silicon carbide paper. Then the surfaces were either not treated (control) or air-powder polished for 15 s. A 4-mm bonding area was demarcated, and the tooth substrates were bonded with the three bonding systems according to the manufacturers' instructions. Tensile bond strengths were measured 24 h after storage in water at 37°C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were performed on air-powder polished specimens to determine changes in the surface morphology and detect residual material from the air-powder polisher. SEM and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) observations of the interface between the bonding resins and dentin were performed to detect variations in the hybrid layers of the control and treated specimens. Results. The results indicated that air-powder polishing did not influence the tensile bond strength to enamel, but adversely affected the tensile bond strength to dentin for the one-step systems, but not for the two-step system. Changes to the enamel surface after air-powder polishing were minimal, but an increase in surface roughness and complete removal of the smear layer were observed on dentin. SEM and TEM observations of the resin/dentin interface suggested that the air-powder polisher might cause superficial maceration of the collagen fibers on the dentin surface. This change may have decreased the ability of the etching/priming agents and bonding resin to penetrate into the dentin, which would have resulted in a poor quality hybrid layer. Significance. For those systems that contain only an acidic primer for dentin conditioning, the use of air-powder polishing for surface preparation prior to restoration of dentin margin cavities is contraindicated because of the loss of reliable bonding. © 1995.",,"Clearfil Linerbond System; dentin bonding agent; KBT 5 Bonding System; KBT-5 Bonding System; methacrylic acid derivative; Super Bond D Liner; Super Bond D-Liner; analysis of variance; animal; article; atmospheric pressure; cattle; chemistry; dental bonding; dentin; electron microscopy; methodology; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; tensile strength; tooth brushing; ultrastructure; Air Pressure; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Cattle; Dental Bonding; Dental Polishing; Dentin; Dentin-Bonding Agents; Methacrylates; Microscopy, Electron; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Surface Properties; Tensile Strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029330527

Black graphs giving the variations of the stiffness K—proportional to the complex viscoelastic modulus E*(T)ω—according to the phase angle δ, were used for a predictive approach to increase the comfort of removable dentures. Cole–Cole diagrams, describing the variation of the loss modulus E″(T)ω in relation to the storage modulus E′(T)ω additionally provide quantitative data. The values obtained were related to the noninteger parameter h used for modelization of the viscoelastic behavior of the materials by means of nonlinear Zener models.

Of greatest concern today is the manifestation of PCL that results in failure of the porous component of the positive plate. While much of the previous work in this area has focussed on the localized interactions between constituent particles of the porous material, we suggest that important bulk factors, such as plate compression and apparent density, have not received sufficient consideration. Indeed, evidence from experimental studies indicates that apparent density is the critical determinant of positive-plate performance and that compression is the primary means by which density is controlled in contemporary plate designs. Moreover, the extension of positive-plate cycle life depends on maintaining apparent density above a minimum value. In light of this relationship, we present strategies by which gains in plate performance can be achieved. © 1995.","Apparent density; Capacity loss; Compression; Lead/acid batteries","Acids; Compaction; Corrosion; Density (specific gravity); Energy storage; Failure (mechanical); Lead; Passivation; Performance; Physical properties; Plate metal; Porosity; Apparent density; Lead acid batteries; Positive plate material; Premature capacity loss; Electric batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029327658

The aim of the work has been to investigate theoretical and practical approaches to the design of heat-exchanger networks, including heat storage, for wasteheat recovery in batch processes. The study is limited to the incorporation of energystorage systems based on fixed-temperature variable-mass stores. The background for preferring this to the alternatives (variable-temperature fixed-mass and constant-mass constant-temperature (latent-heat) stores) is given. It is shown that the maximum energy- saving targets as calculated by the pinch-point method (time average model, TAM) can be achieved by locating energy stores at either end of each process stream. This theoretically large number of heat-storage tanks (twice the number of process streams) can be reduced to just a few tanks. A simple procedure for determining a number of heat-storage tanks sufficient to achieve the maximum energy-saving targets as calculated by the pinch-point method is described. This procedure relies on combinatorial considerations, and could therefore be labeled the ""combinatorial method"" for incorporation of heat storage in heat-exchanger networks. Qualitative arguments justifying the procedure are presented. For simple systems, waste-heat recovery systems with only three heat-storage temperatures (a hot storage, a cold storage, and a heat store at the pinch temperature) often can achieve the maximum energy-saving targets. Through case studies, six of which are presented, it is found that a theoretically large number of heat-storage tanks (twice the number of process streams) can be reduced to just a few tanks. The description of these six cases is intended to be sufficiently detailed to serve as benchmark cases for development of alternative methods. © 1995 by ASME.",,"Calculations; Combinatorial mathematics; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Machine design; Numerical methods; Tanks (containers); Temperature; Batch processes; Combinatorial method; Energy saving; Fixed temperature variable mass stores; Heat exchanger networks; Heat storage tanks; Heat storage temperature; Pinch-point method; Waste heat utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029325571

Some of these systems have already been successfully applied while others are constantly being evaluated for future applications in order to improve the transmission capability, stability and dynamic performance of existing power systems. Superconducting energy storage systems (SMES) represent an interesting prospective FACTS technology since they can generate/absorb active and reactive power in rapid response to power system requirements. SMES' systems are considered for a variety of applications: automatic generation control; fast spinning reserve; peak generation and load sh fting; improving stability, dynamics, transmission efficiency and voltage performance; etc. A number of such applications have been studied and a few experimental systems have been built and evaluated. SMES application is particularly interesting for long transmission systems such as Hydro-Quebec's, for example. This paper presents the use of the optimal control of SMES systems to achieve transient stability and damping of the power system. The synthesis of an optimal controller is illustrated on a two-machine equivalent for simplicity. Solving this problem yields some important conclusions with regard to the control and efficiency of active and reactive power when applied to improve system stability and damping.

In the future, the hydrogen required to raise the product's solH C ratio will be increasingly produced via gasification of large amounts of heavy residues. In the light of the strong preference towards using liquid fuels in the transport sector, the Shell Middle Distillate Synthesis process to convert natural gas into diesel of very high quality is discussed.

The bearing consists of six melt-textured YBCO pellets mounted inside a continuous flow LN2 cryostat. A disk measuring 0 190 mm x 30 mm was safely rotated at speeds up to 15 000 rpm. The disk was driven by a high speed three phase synchronous homopolar motor/generator. Maximum energy capacity was 4.8 Wh, maximum power was 1.5 kW. The dynamic behavior of the prototype was tested, characterized and evaluated with respect to axial and lateral stiffness, damping, decay torques (bearing drag), vibrational modes and critical speeds.

An oxygen-free high-conductivity (OFHC) copper test chamber is extruded and degreased, then the inner surface is cut by broaching. The length of the test chamber is 300 mm and the outer diameter is 65 mm. For comparison, three OFHC copper test chambers are manufactured with different surface treatments. These treatments are (1) acid cleaning (pickling in a mixed solution of HN03 and H2S04, followed by passivation in a chromic acid with H2S04), (2) broaching with oil, and (3) oil-free broaching. These test chambers were exposed to synchrotron radiation with 4 keV critical energy from BL21 beamline at the Photon Factory 2.5 GeV storage ring at KEK. The photodesorption coefficients (N2 or CO equivalent) for the chamber treated with oil-free broaching and for the chamber treated with acid cleaning are almost the same. However the decreasing slope of the photodesorption coefficients for oil-free broaching is steeper than for the acid cleaning. These photodesorption coefficients are proportional to D-053and Z)-047, respectively, as a function of beam dose. The surface of the broached chamber is evaluated by measuring the roughness and by Auger electron spectroscopy analysis. The average roughness of the broached chamber is less than 1 μm, and the carbon concentration in the surface of the chamber treated by oil-free broaching is less than that of other two chambers. © 1995, American Vacuum Society.

Polyamide II shows the highest capacity of the polyamides I-V. The dissolution of the thiolate ions that occurs in the usual organodisulfide system was not observed in the polyamide electrode. The electrochemical behavior of the polyamide II(graphite) electrode that was prepared by dipping the graphite powder into methanoic acid solution containing polyamide II is also described. The electrochemical behavior of the polyamide II(graphite) electrode was basically similiar to that of the polyamide II graphite electrode. However, the capacity for the polyamide II(graphite) electrode is lower than that for the polyamide II/graphite electrode. © 1995.","battery; disulfide; polyamide; positive material; thiol","Disulfide bonds; Energy storage batteries; Positive active material; Chemical bonds; Condensation; Cyclic voltammetry; Dissolution; Electric energy storage; Electrochemical electrodes; Polymerization; Redox reactions; Secondary batteries; Solutions; Polyamides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029306631

The theoretical analysis predicts that voltage drop is a significant parameter, which when decreasing in the system results in a considerable increase of the charging current. Based on the above theoretical requirements a Battery Voltage Regulator (BVR) has been designed, fabricated and tested. The results show that due to reduction in the voltage-drop, there is a gain in the charging current of about 5% at 25° C with respect to a conventional BVR for a 12 V system. In the worst case, when the ambient temperature rises to above 45°C, the current-gain increases to 10%. The charging current is regulated by the pulse-width modulation technique to automatically meet the load demand and self discharge of battery-bank (since the battery-bank is never disconnected once the battery-bank is fully charged). Therefore, the load voltage regulation is not required. This technique is superior to the conventional techniques because it does not require field adjustment and knowledge of load characteristics by the user. The net BVR can be easily extended for higher voltage systems. The theoretical analysis is also important for a PV system designer, because one can augment the system for available BVR and interconnecting wire with the help of this,. © 1995.",,"Electric currents; Electric discharges; Electric loads; Energy storage; Mathematical models; Photovoltaic cells; Pulse width modulation; Thermal effects; Voltage regulators; Battery voltage regulator; Integrated photovoltaic system; Photovoltaic effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029306389

The pyrrole and indole derivatives did not produce any appreciable sediment except 2,6-dimethylpyrrole. Air, temperature, dissolved oxygen and light all strongly accelerate the process of sediment formation. On the other hand removal of dissolved oxygen significantly reduces it. Acids and phenols act respectively as accelerator and inhibitor towards sedimentation. The reaction has a low apparent activation energy and appears to involve a free radical oxidative self condensation of nitrogen compounds. The lower O/C ratios of sediment also supported the view point that oxidation is a key aspect of jet fuel thermal instability.

For the case of long distance transmission of wind electricity, this change can be achieved at a negligible increase or even a decrease in the per unit cost of electricity. The economic and technical feasibility of this process can be illustrated by studying the example of a wind farm located in central Kansas and a 2000 km, 2000 megawatt transmission line to southern California. Such a system can have a capacity factor of 60 percent, with no economic penalty and without storage. With compressed air energy storage (CAES) (and with a negligible economic penalty), capacity factors of 70-95 percent can be achieved.

A night insulation cover is used at the top surface of the heater to reduce the losses from the system during the off-sunshine hours. Another way to reduce the losses from the system is by using an insulating baffle plate in the tank. This plate divides the tank water into two portions, the water above this plate is known as the upper column and below is known as the lower column. The water of the two columns is in contact with each other with the help of the incoming and outgoing vents provided in the baffle plate. This plate also suppresses losses from the lower column during the off-sunshine hours. In this paper, we have studied the effect of a baffle plate on the performance of a triangular built-in-storage solar water heater. To obtain the thermal behavior of the system, the energy balance equations are written at the different nodes, and the well-known finite difference forward time step marching technique is used for their solution. The proposed system is studied by varying the vent area, the water mass in the two columns and under a constant flow rate for different durations. The effects of the thermal conductivity and thickness of the baffle plate on the water temperature are also investigated. It is found that the presence of the baffle plate greatly improves the system performance during off-sunshine hours. © 1995.","Baffle plate; Collection-cum-storage; Finite difference method; Solar water heating; Transient performance; Triangular configuration","Finite difference method; Heat losses; Heat storage; Heat transfer coefficients; Natural convection; Numerical analysis; Plates (structural components); Specific heat; Thermal conductivity; Thermal insulation; Baffle plate; Collection cum storage; Constant flow rate; Heat loss coefficient; Solar intensity; Transient performance; Triangular configuration; Solar water heaters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029305426

To achieve minimum energy design goals, system designers need a technique to accurately model the energy consumption of their design alternatives without performing a full physical design and full-circuit simulation. This paper presents and compares five approaches for modeling the energy consumption of CMOS circuits. These five modeling approaches have been chosen to represent the various levels of model complexity and accuracy found in the current literature. These modeling approaches are applied to the energy consumption of SRAM's to provide examples of their use and to allow for the comparison of their modeling qualities. It was found that a mixed characterization model—using a CV2 prediction for digital subsections and fitted simulation results for the analog subsections—is satisfactory (within ±1 process variation) for predicting the absolute energy consumed per cycle. This same model is also very good (within 2%) for predicting an optimum organization for the internal structures of the SRAM. Several common architectures and circuit designs for SRAM's are analyzed with these models. This analysis shows that global, rather than local improvements, produce the largest energy savings. © 1995 IEEE",,"CMOS integrated circuits; Computer simulation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Integrated circuit layout; Personal computers; Technology; Energy consumption; Static random access memory; Random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029304587

The parameters qPF were similarly sensitive to light intensity as demonstrated by their half-saturation light intensity. However, the nonvariable part of thermal dissipation (Ho) represented a greater proportion of the maximal thermal dissipation yield in comparison with the corresponding non-variable component of fluorescence (Fo) as a result of the thermal energy losses occurring during electron transport.

Box 136, North Ryde, NSW 2113, Australia","The reforming of CH4 with CO2 produces synthesis gas with a lower H2/CO ratio than that generated by the widely employed steam/CH4 reforming reaction. The two reactions have similar thermodynamic characteristics except that in the case of CO2/CH4 reforming there is a greater potential for carbon formation, primarily due to the lower H/C ratio of this system. Thermodynamic analysis of the CO2/CH4 reforming reaction system shows that carbon formation is possible over a wide range of reaction conditions of possible commercial interest. Whilst technology has been developed to enable CO2/CH4 and steam/CH4 reforming to be carried out simultaneously, the former reaction has to date had no significant commercial application by itself. However, there is now renewed interest in C1-chemistry to produce chemicals and fuels requiring synthesis gas with a 1/1 H2/CO ratio. Conducted in the absence of steam/CH4 reforming, CO2/CH4 reforming has a number of major advantages over alternative chemical reactions for the thermochemical storage and transmission of renewable energy sources such as solar energy. Hence it is likely to become an increasingly important industrial reaction in the future. A review of the literature on the catalysis of CO2/CH4 reforming shows that Group VIII metals, when distributed in reduced form on suitable supports, are effective catalysts for this reaction. Rh appears intrinsically to be the most suitable, and considering the relative material costs, Ni catalysts deserve closer attention. In the latter case the emphasis should be on developing catalysts which are capable of carbon-free operation under practical reaction conditions. Of the various supports studied to date, alumina and magnesia or combinations thereof are most promising. Analysis of the reaction mechanism indicates that the effective catalysts are those metal-support combinations which actively dissociate CH4 into CHx residues including carbon, whilst at the same time also activating CO2 to generate CO and an adsorbed O species on the catalyst surface. The O thus produced is consumed in the conversion of CHx and C to CO. Net carbon formation becomes a problem when the CH4 dissociation and CO2 activation steps are out of balance. Considering the current status of catalyst development and the likely future large-scale applications for CO2/CH4 reforming, significant scope exists for further work in optimising both catalysts and reactor design for this reaction. © 1995.",,"Alumina; Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Catalyst supports; Catalysts; Dissociation; Magnesia; Reaction kinetics; Reforming reactions; Rhodium; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic properties; Thermochemical storage; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029293691

Small form factors, portability, and low cost will require low power operation. While continued scaling of silicon technology to dimensions below quarter micron devices and interconnections appears technically feasible, higher levels of integration and operation at higher speed have been driving the power consumption of logic chips up instead of down. This paper discusses how scaled submicron silicon technology can provide leverage to reduce power, while gaining in throughput for logic chips, and in capacity for memory functions. Strong reductions in voltage supply have to accompany shrinking dimensions. Materials limits such as tunneling currents through ultra-thin silicon-dioxide gate dielectrics and electromigration in minimum pitch interconnections emerge to be key challenges to realize low power 0.1 μm level CMOS circuits.

In order to clarify the issues that seem to underlie this controversy, we provide an extended analysis of the genesis and development of fluids of differential type. As part of our analysis, we will show that certain ideas of flow retardation and model approximation have been consistently misinterpreted. Additionally, we establish several new results concerning the thermodynamics of these materials.

Using a tunable, free running 900-nm Cr:LiSAF oscillator as a pump source for a Yb:S-FAP rod, the saturation fluence for pumping was measured to be 2.2 J/cm2 based on either the spatial, temporal, or energy transmission properties of the Yb:S-FAP rod. The emission peak of Yb:S-FAP (1047.5 nm in air) is shown to overlap with that of Nd:YLiF4 (Nd:YLF) to within 0.1 nm, rendering Yb:S-FAP suitable as an effective power amplifier for Nd:YLF oscillators. The small signal gain, under varying pumping conditions, was measured with a cw Nd:YLF probe laser. These measurements implied emission cross sections of 6.0 × 10–20 and 1.5 × 10–20 cm2 for π and σ polarized light, respectively, which fall within the error limits of the previously reported values of 7.3 × 10–20 and 1.4 × 10–20 cm2 for π and σ polarized light, obtained from purely spectroscopic techniques. The effects of radiation trapping on the emission lifetime have been quantified and have been shown to lead to emission lifetimes as long as 1.7 ms, for large optically dense crystals.

The comparative cost of full and partial solar desalting systems was also evaluated by a more detailed case study of 20,000 m3/d and 200,000 m3/d systems. Two solar technologies were considered: salt gradient solar ponds and dual-purpose solar electric power stations supplying low pressure steam to thermal desalting systems. The solar field could use any concentrating collector technology such as parabolic troughs, dishes or heleliostats. At the present state of heat storage technology, back-up of external fuel will have to be used for continuous operation. Two desalting technologies were considered: multi-effect distillation (MED) and hybrid MED/SWRO systems. The first uses thermal process heat from the solar field and a relatively small supply of commercial electricity for pumping purposes. The second uses solar energy only for the MED portion of the hybrid system while the SWRO portion uses commercial electricity. The hybrid concept represents therefore a partial rather than a full solar system. Solar pond powered desalting systems were found to have a considerable potential to be cost effective if favorable site conditions exist. Only for very low specific solar field cost and/or high commercial electricity prices would the fully solar options be more cost competitive than the partial solar options. © 1995.",,"Low pressure steam; Multi effect distillation; Seawater desalination; Solar desalination systems; Solar electric power stations; Cost effectiveness; Distillation; Economic and social effects; Electric power systems; Electricity; Pressure effects; Seawater; Solar energy; Technology; Thermal gradients; Desalination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029277239

Experience proves that most dips are characterized by a residual voltage at the delivery bus, where full outages (or micro‐interruptions) are only a small share. A remarkable improvement in the power‐supply quality can then be obtained by means of a cheap and simple static voltage booster (SVB), without energy storage, just able to sustain the voltage at the load bus bar during sag transients. In the paper this particular subject is investigated, trying to develop, among the various possible solutions, the most suitable SVB device to meet the target. The SVB dynamic performance has been tested by computer simulation, including the sag detection, control and firing system. In order to estimate the booster practical effectiveness in reducing the voltage sag's consequences, improving so the apparent utility power quality, the standard immunity characteristics of sensitive loads, like computers, and the SVB‐compensated voltage transients are compared and discussed.

In the literature perturbation approximations, finite element methods and various phenomenological parameter-fitting using experimental data are among the techniques which have been exploited. In this paper, a nonperturbation approximation method, which attempts to parallel some well-established techniques used in solving electromagnetic waveguide-discontinuity problems, is explored as an alternate numerical procedure for calculating SAW reflections. Implementing such a method requires that the full solution to SAW propagation in the free and in the layered regions be obtained. Thus, for a free-to-metallized discontinuity, the two SAW phase velocities, the total SAW power flow in the free region and in the layered region, and the electroacoustic fields, must be calculated.

The lithium intercalation capacity in the carbon materials prepared from the same raw materials and by the same preparation methods depends on the heat-treatment temperature. A higher capacity is obtained in the carbons prepared at higher temperatures, which have a graphite structure. The graphite is more reactive in reaction with organic solvents. The reaction of the graphite with solvents is reduced by a pretreatment of the carbon materials with acid and hydrazine. © 1995 Elsevier Science S.A.

Based on the analysis of the worst-case PEM scenario for military applications, demonstrating the moisture reliability under long-term (20 years) dormant storage environments has become the last hurdle for PEM. Recent studies have demonstrated that PEM can meet the typical missile environments in long-term storage. To further validate PEM reliability in missile applications, Texas Instruments (TI) recently conducted three separate studies involved 6 years of PEM moisture-life monitoring & assessment, testing of the standard PEM electrical characteristics under the military temperature ranges (-55 °C to +125°C), and assessing their robustness in moisture environments after the assembly processes. These TI studies support the use of PEM in missile (or similar) applications. However, “not all parts (PEM as well as hermetic packaged devices) are created equal.” Effective focus on part & supplier selection, supplier teaming, and process monitoring is necessary to maintain the PEM reliability over the required environments at the lowest cost. This paper assesses PEM reliability for a selected missile storage environment using the industry-standard moisture testing, such as biased HAST or 85°C/85%RH (relative humidity), for demonstrating the PEM moisture survivability. The moisture reliability (MTTF) or average moisture lifetime of PEM is assessed to correlate PEM capability to anticipated field-performance environments. ©1995 IEEE","Moisture; Plastic-encapsulated microcircuit","Activation energy; Assembly; Electric properties; Failure analysis; Microelectronics; Military applications; Missiles; Moisture; Printed circuit boards; Printed circuit manufacture; Reliability; Surface mount technology; High accelerated stress test; Mean time to corrosion failure; Moisture testing; Plastic encapsulated microcircuits; Integrated circuit testing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029275727

Thin film media are modeled as planar hexagonal arrays of hexagonally shaped grains. The computation uses the conjugate gradient algorithm to minimize the variation of the total energy. In particular, the effect of the stress on the relaxation process is investigated. Also the change in the remanent magnetization due to repetitive head-disk impacts is calculated.

Our case studies considered two partial ice storage systems in Northern California. For each case, we compiled historical data on design, installation, and operation of the TES system; and also metered data. This information was further enhanced by data obtained through interviews with the building owners and operators. The performance and historical data of the TES systems and their components were grouped into issues related to design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the systems. Our analysis indicated that (1) almost all problems related to the operation of TES and non-TES systems could be traced back to the design of the system, and (2) the identified problems were not unique to the TES systems. Judging from the problems related to non-TES components identified in these two case studies, it is reasonable to conclude that conventional systems have as many problems as TES systems. After the initial trouble-shooting period, in a typical summer week for Case 1, the TES system saved 640, 780, and 660 on-peak kW compared to the single chiller, split chiller, and two-chiller systems, respectively, at a cost of additional energy use of 20.5, 37.6, 47.2 MWh per week. For Case 2, the diurnal energy performance of the conventional single chiller system and the TES system were comparable; however, the TES system used less power than the conventional system. Once the performances of the TES with split and two chiller conventional systems were compared, the energy penalties increased substantially and the peak power savings diminished. © 1995.","Case studies; Commercial buildings; Monitored data; Peak power savings; Performance evaluation; Thermal energy storage","Case studies; Chiller systems; Commercial buildings; Historical data; Ice storage systems; Metered data; Peak power savings; Buildings; Costs; Energy utilization; Installation; Maintenance; Performance; Systems analysis; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029272868

The resulting performance has been compared with that of the optimal equalization system which yields the minimum probability of error at the output of the Viterbi detector. The results indicate that depending on the constraint used in the MMSE design, the amount of noise correlation varies significantly at the equalizer output, which in turn makes a large difference in the performance of the Viterbi detector.

Six male expert jumpers participated in the study. They performed maximal vertical jumps with five different preloads. The kinematics and dynamics of the jumping movements were analysed from force plate and high speed film recordings. The amount of elastic energy stored in the tendons of the leg extensor muscles was calculated by a generalised tendon model, and the muscle coordination was analysed by surface EMG. The best jumping performances were achieved in the jumps with low preloads (counter movement jumps and drop jumps from 0.3 m). A considerable amount of the energy imposed on the legs by prestretch loading was stored in the tendons (26 ± 3%), but the increased performance could not be explained by a contribution of clastic energy to the positive work performed during the push off. During the preloading, the involved muscles were activated at the onset of the loading. Slow prestretches at the onset of muscle activation under relatively low average stretch loads, as observed during counter movement jumps and drop jumps from 0.3 m, prevented excessive stretching of the muscle fibres in relation to the tendon length changes. This consequently conserved the potential of the muscle fibres to produce positive work during the following muscle-tendon shortening in concert with the release of the tendon strain energy. A significant increase in the activity of m. rectus femoris between jumps with and without prestretch indicated a pronounced action of m. rectus femoris in a transport of mechanical energy produced by the proximal monoarticular m. gluteus maximus at the hip to the knee and thereby enhanced the transformation of rotational joint work to translational work on the mass centre of the body. The changes in muscle activity were reflected in the net muscle powers. Vertical jumping is like most movements constrained by the intended direction of the movement. The movements of the body segments during the prestretches induced a forward rotation and during the take off, a backward rotation of the body. A reciprocal shift in the activities of the biarticular m. rectus femoris and m. semitendinosus indicated that these rotations were counteracted by changes in the direction of the resultant ground reaction vector controlled by these muscles. The rotational actions around the mass centre of the body should be minimised in maximal vertical jumping because the muscle work used to control these actions is lost for the achievement of jumping height. © 1994.",,"Elasticity; Electromyography; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Kinematics; Loads (forces); Mathematical models; Motion control; Muscle; Strain; Tendons; Maximal vertical jumping; Muscle activation; Muscle activation loading dynamics; Prestretch loads; Biomechanics; adult; article; dynamics; elasticity; electromyography; extensor muscle; film; force; gluteus maximus muscle; hip; human; human experiment; jumping; knee; leg muscle; loading test; male; muscle contraction; muscle strength; normal human; physical performance; priority journal; rotation; tendon; Adult; Elasticity; Electromyography; Energy Transfer; Hip Joint; Human; Knee Joint; Leg; Male; Motion Pictures; Movement; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Fibers; Muscle, Skeletal; Rotation; Stress, Mechanical; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tendons; Weight-Bearing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029256489

Changes in the structure of the electric power supply industry have required these companies to seek more cost-effective ways of meeting the needs of their customers. Through experience gained, primarily in the USA, batteries have been shown to provide multiple benefits to electric utilities. Also, lower maintenance batteries, more reliable electrical systems, and the availability of methods to predict costs and benefits have made battery energy-storage systems more attractive. Technology-transfer efforts in the USA have resulted in a willingness of electric utilities to install a number of these systems for a variety of tasks, including load levelling, peak shaving, frequency regulation and spinning reserve. Additional systems are being planned for several additional locations for similar applications, plus transmission and distribution deferral and enhanced power quality. In the absence of US champions such as the US Department of Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute, ILZRO is attempting to mount a technology-transfer programme to bring the benefits of battery energy-storage to European power suppliers. As a result of these efforts, a study group on battery energy-storage systems has been established with membership primarily in Germany and Austria. Also, a two-day workshop, prepared by the Electric Power Research Institute was held in Dublin. Participants included representatives of several European power suppliers. As a result, ESB National Grid of Ireland has embarked upon a detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of a battery energy-storage system in their network. Plans for the future include continuation of this technology-transfer effort, assistance in the Irish effort, and a possible approach to the European Commission for funding. © 1995.","Battery energy-storage systems; Lead/acid batteries; Market","Availability; Cost effectiveness; Electric power distribution; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Maintainability; Marketing; Technical presentations; Technology transfer; Battery energy storage systems; Frequency regulation; Lead/acid batteries; Load levelling; Peak shaving; Spinning reserve; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029253694

These drawbacks can be avoided by use of a practical controller and variable speed fan to provide heated air from the collector at constant temperature and a continually varying flow rate.

Two forms of energy are generated by two separate systems. The present work is about the study of a system which combines thermal and photovoltaic systems in one unit. The system is basically a conventional forced circulation type water heater. It is converted into a combined system by pasting solar cells directly over the absorber plate. The system equations are solved by a finite difference method. The simulations are done for different solar cell areas, mass flow rates and different water masses. The differential temperature controller, i.e. pump-off and pump-on, are used. It is shown that the pump-on time is more or less independent of the total stagnant water mass in the collector unit. The pump-off time is a sensitive function of the water flow rate. At higher flow rates, the pump is switched off early in the afternoon. Since the total working time decreases, the efficiency also decreases. There is an optimum flow rate for which the collector efficiency is a maximum. The cell efficiency, which is a function of temperature, is calculated using an iterative method. The average cell efficiency turns out to be more or less independent of the solar cell area on the absorber plate. This result helps in saving calculation time because the total electrical energy available for any solar cell area can be calculated simply. A normal domestic solar water heater of about 2 m2 generates sufficient electrical energy (after taking into account the various losses in storage, etc. and the energy required by the pump) to run 2 tube lights of 20 W each for 5 h and 1 television of 30 W for 4 h. © 1995.","Finite difference method; Photovoltaics; PV/T collector; Theoretical model","Calculations; Energy storage; Finite difference method; Iterative methods; Mathematical models; Numerical analysis; Plates (structural components); Reynolds number; Sensitivity analysis; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Temperature; Absorber plate; Collector efficiency; Conventional forced circulation type; Differential temperature controller; Electrical energy; Head loss coefficient; Pump off time; Solar insulation; Solar water heater; Water mass flow rate; Solar water heaters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029244588

The distending edema fluid causes the nonlinear elastic elements to operate on a stiffer region of their length-tension relation, thus causing a stiffer ventricle.

Currently, the state-of-the-art CMOS device has a 0.25-μm effective channel length and operates at 2.5 V. As the CMOS technology is extended into the deep submicron range, it is estimated that the next generation will have a nominal channel length of 0.15 μm with a supply voltage of ≤2 V. In this paper, two potential technologies with application to 1.X-V CMOS are presented. First, a bulk CMOS technology with the nominal channel length of 0.15 μm is described. It is next argued that because of issues related to power dissipation, such a device may face problems when operated at its maximum speed-density potential in high-performance logic chips. CMOS on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate offers circuits with lower power at the same performance. Such a CMOS technology, with channel lengths down to less than 0.1 μm, is described next. This technology is particularly useful for applications near a 1.0-V supply. We describe, for example, a 512Kb SRAM with an access time of less than 3.5 ns at 1.X V. The clear power-performance advantage of CMOS on SOI over that of CMOS on bulk silicon in the 1.X-V regime makes it the technology of choice for sub-0.25-μm CMOS generations.",,"Energy dissipation; Logic circuits; Performance; Random access storage; Semiconductor devices; Silicon on insulator technology; Substrates; ULSI circuits; CMOS devices; CMOS technology; Deep submicron CMOS; Logic chips; Nominal CMOS channel length; CMOS integrated circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029233869

Proportions of the stored hydrogen and oxygen may be employed for combustion purposes, depending upon the application.

In order to optimize their uses for noise and vibration attenuation, it is necessary to characterize their damping properties as a function of strain amplitude. This work reports the strain amplitude dependent non-linear dynamic behavior of two elastomer compounds, NBR and Neoprene, studied at various frequencies and strain amplitudes using the Fourier transform mechanical analysis (FTMA) technique, developed by us. The basic theory and experimental results are presented for a one-dimensional isothermal simple shear deformation. The Green-Rivlin constitutive equation was used to model the observed behavior. The results indicate that a complete characterization of non-linear dynamic properties is rather complex. The energy dissipation is governed, however, by a simple mechanism. It is shown that the energy dissipation is governed only by the first harmonic loss modulus term of the Green-Rivlin representation, but the energy storage is related to many material functions. An expression for the energy dissipation of a non-linear viscoelastic material is derived. It is also shown that irrespective of the material constitutive law the energy dissipation can occur only at the frequency of excitation but it can be stored in a complex manner. The results are rather generalized to show that the amplitude dependence can be modeled by a power law function. It is also shown that an examination of the stress Fourier spectra can give a quantitative indication of material non-linearity and suggest a direction for developing an adequate model of these complex materials.",,"Deformation; Dynamic response; Elastomers; Fourier transforms; Polymers; Strain; Stresses; Vibration control; Viscoelasticity; Energy dissipation; Green-Rivlin constitutive equation; Damping",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029233315

Since that time, injection has been taking place intermittently into the two wells: the Garfield well (since October 1992), and the Jourdan well (since March 1993). As of April, 1994, the City has injected about 3,000 acre-feet (af) of potable water at rates of as much as 2,500 gpm. The wells are completed within the unconfined alluvial aquifer of the Raymond Basin. Two methods of injection are used to introduce water into the wells: 1) down the pump column; and, 2) in the space between the well casing and pump column. Observed drawup during injection is significantly different than that predicted from drawdown data and from projections based upon an ideal Theis-type aquifer. These data indicate well clogging during injection. However, post-injection specific capacity of production data appear similar to pre-injection values, indicating no remnant clogging of the well and aquifer. During injection testing the motors were allowed to back spin, and the feasibility of recovering energy during injection was evaluated. The payback period for marginal costs associated with power-generation facilities is about 3 years. Water quality data indicate that a generally good quality water is produced after injection and storage.

In order to simulate this realistic state of loading in the laboratory, a simple and handy apparatus for biaxial fracture tests was developed. Here, the principle of wedge splitting is applied and is extended by a hydraulic pressure device in order to realise the biaxial state of stress in the specimen. In this device, rectangular-shaped notched specimens were broken under a defined biaxial state of stress with stable crack propagation. The load-displacement curves that were then measured permit a characterisation of the biaxial fracture behaviour of the material. Thus, the specific fracture energy and a nominal notch tensile strength can be easily determined from these graphs. By means of this testing method the fracture-mechanical characteristics of concrete with diverse forms of aggregate (natural/crushed gravel) and under different storage conditions (wet/ dry) were defined.

This optimization problem is considered as a multiobjective one, and a discrete set of Pareto optimal solutions is derived numerically by using the weighting method. A case study on a system with the option of reverse power flow into the grid is carried out using measured data on solar insolation.

The accompanying circuit comprises a pre-charged capacitor bank, connected in series with the inductive load, which has to be provided with a current pulse. Upon actuation, a resonant counterpulse current is created in the opening switch, connected in parallel with the current source and the load. In this way, the opening switch is opened at low current. A separate closing switch prevents closing of the opening switch at high voltage. Operation of the opening switch, often a mechanical switch, at low current and low voltage prevents arc erosion of the contacts. The advantage of this circuit compared to other counterpulse circuits is that the capacitor bank does not experience a voltage reversal. Electrolytic capacitors, which have a high energy density, are applied. The remaining energy of the capacitor bank after opening the opening switch, is transferred to the load. The required initial voltage of the capacitor bank is only a few hundred volts, whereas it may be above a kilovolt in other circuits. Another advantage of the method described here is that the load does not experience a pre-current, causing unwanted preheating of the load, before the resonant current is activated. At the moment, work is being performed at the Pulse Physics Laboratory to develop the resonant series counterpulse circuit for use with rail accelerators, which must be supplied with current pulses in the millisecond range up to the mega-ampere level. © 1995 IEEE",,"Capacitor storage; Electric contacts; Electric currents; Electric inductors; Electric loads; Electric power systems; Electrolytic capacitors; Resonant circuits; Arc erosion; High current opening switches; High energy density; Homopolar generator; Rail accelerators; Resonant series counterpulse; Electric switches",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029230898

To do this, we have designed a simple system having no vacuum and no preaccelerator. The 1–2 g mass projectile is launched at the maximum possible constant acceleration—the limit of the projectile strength or the electrothermal explosion of rail surfaces, while making use of the effects of the material strengthening under the great confining pressure and rail current redistribution due to the presence of conducting shields. Such an approach provides the maximum possible energy efficiency of the launcher at its minimum conceivable length (as short as 50–80 cm). This greatly simplifies the design and fabrication but leads inevitably to the idea of the “fixed round”—“one assembly-one shot”. Our experiments have confirmed the known hypothesis that the cause of the velocity saturation at the 6 km/s level is drag and decay of PA owing to the increase of the inductive counter-emf with velocity and overload of PA with the ablated matter. The use of a compacted PA allowed us to overcome the “6 km/s limit” and to launch a 1 g projectile to 7.1 km/s in a bore length of 56 cm at a total efficiency of 10%. We believe that the simplest way to further velocity increase, while taking advantage of the compacted PA, is to increase the barrel length along with a corresponding increase of the energy stored. © 1995 IEEE",,"Acceleration; Electric charge; Electric currents; Electric discharges; Electric energy storage; Electric losses; Electromagnetic launchers; Energy conversion; Fabrication; Projectiles; Surfaces; Velocity; Electromagnetic acceleration; Electrothermal explosion; Kinetic energy; Plasma armature; Projectile velocity; Rail guns",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029230301

This paper describes the SPEAR, its electromagnetic operation, its construction, and the tests performed to prove its principle. It describes the composite stator sections and the glass reinforced armature coils. It describes how engineers at CEM-UT overcame the problem of keeping solid state switch volume low by employing a modular switch design with a unique snubbing circuit that reduces required volume. Results of test #5, described in the paper, show how well the operation of the SPEAR matches the computer simulation predictions. Conceptually, the proximity of the approaching armature electromagnetically drives a stator coil's current through zero. At zero crossing the stator freewheel switch turns off, preventing reestablishment of stator current as the armature moves away.

The projectile could be accelerated above 6 km/sec and it was comfirmed that the powder stayed in the original configuration in the polycarbonate base without any deformation during flight. To prove the effectiveness, impact experiments were perfromed in which the total weight and the diameter of projectile with and without the metal powder are fixed for comparison. Using 2.5 cm thick stainless steel as a target, the produced craters are compared. The crater made by the projectile with palladium (Pd) power is much deeper than the one with the simple polycarbonate projectile.

The synergistic effect of atomic oxygen, ultraviolet radiation, and contamination has made it difficult to duplicate space exposures in the laboratory.

The model relies on breaking up the semiconductor drift space into small cells, each of which contains an imaginary transmission line element so as to allow an electromagnetic wave to propagate away from the generated plasma. The same transmission line may be used to convey light energy produced in the semiconductor. The transmission line also serves as the energy storage element.

The nodal resistors embody the physics of the semiconductor, whereas the transmission line matrix accounts for energy spread.

The conventional fuel for aero turbine engines, for example, is aviation kerosine, several variants of which exist for specific applications. Aviation fuel specifications are invariably stringent, and variations with density are shown for typical properties. The dwindling availability of optimal crudes over the last 25 years has resulted in a general degradation in the quality of aviation kerosine, with adverse effects on combustion performance, emissions and engine life except where hardware solutions emerged in parallel. In fact, the reduction of emissions is seen to be more a matter of engine design than fuel technology. In the near term, supplies of kerosine may be supplemented from sources other than crude oil, whereas in the longer term, kerosine may be substituted by liquid methane and/or liquid hydrogen. In comparison with kerosine, liquid hydrogen produces more nitrogen in its combustion products on a fuel mass basis, but less on an energy basis, although the flame temperature is higher giving possibilities of more NO x. The fuel requirements of high energy content and storage stability apply across the board, but additional parameters of concern are heat capacity in the case of ramjets, and combustion-product chemistry with rockets, which demand a range of candidate high-performance fuels. © 1995, Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

This innovative design takes advantage of stainless steel laminations with a composite overwrap to provide radial and longitudinal support for the rail/insulator package. The goal of this design effort was to build a 90 mm bore gun with a 9 MJ muzzle energy and provide comparable stiffness to the hydraulically pre stressed 90 mm railgun at CEM-UT. The fabrication phase involved building a 90 mm x 7 m long railgun in conjunction with a 30 mm x 3 m sub-scale version for performance testing up to full design loads. The 30 mm subscale launcher has been successfully tested at CEM-UT up to its full current rating of 1.0 MA. With the outstanding results from the 30 mm sub-scale gun, the full scale 90 mm gun was completed and sent to the U.S. Army's Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) for testing while the skid mounted power supply is completed. A new and improved version of the original 30 mm subscale launcher was also designed and built by CEM upon request by U.S. Army ARDEC. This new design improved fabrication techniques as well as made the gun more durable for laboratory testing. The updated 30 mm railgun was also sent to U.S. Army ARDEC to be fired on their capacitor bank power supply. This paper discusses the problems encountered during the final assembly of the 90 mm skid gun and how these difficulties were overcome. The paper also discusses the successful testing to full load of a 30 mm one-third scale version of the 90 mm gun. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on an additional 30 mm laminated gun which was redesigned based on experience with the previous laminated gun assemblies.

The development of the filling of a storage tank with particulate ice resulted in the code ICEPAC. The numerical models for establishing the ice-melting process are based on finite-difference methods of solving the Navier-Stokes equations governing the three-dimensional flow of melt water through the water in the tank. This part of the project resulted in the development of two codes, MSOLA and MELTCONTROL, which are executable on an appropriately equipped personal computer. The scale-model laboratory experiments were performed using a 1.2-m-wide by 2.4-m-long by 1.2-m-high rectangular tank. The results of the ICEPAC software were used as input data to the ice-melting software. The results of the ice-melting numerical simulations compare well with the experimental data for water level, exit water temperature, and quantity of remaining ice mass.

The electron storage ring BESSY, in combination with suitable monochromators, reproducible produces monochromatic radiation of tunable photon energy, high spectral purity, and high radiant power which can be reduced by twelve orders of magnitude. With this source of monochromatic radiation a cryogenic electrical substitution radiometer (ESR) is operated as a primary detector standard in the photon energy range from 3 eV to 1500 eV. The ESR is optimized for synchrotron radiation, capable of measuring radiant power in the order of some μW with an uncertainty below 0.2%. Radiation detectors can be calibrated against the ESR with uncertainties well below 1%. Recent progress in this field will be demonstrated for the calibration of photodiodes.

Several alternative cask and canister concepts were evaluated for SNF assembly packaging to determine the most suitable concept. Of these alternatives, the multi-purpose canister (MPC)-based subsystem, as depicted in Figure 1, was determined to be the most suitable. Based on the results of these evaluations, the decision was made to proceed with design and certification of the MPC subsystem. A decision whether to fabricate and deploy MPCs will be made after further studies and the preparation of an environmental impact statement.

The carriers allow for the insertion of conductor wires at different axial locations (tiers) in the launch package and provide initial contact loading between the wires and rails. This study began by investigating the possibility that armature electrical behavior could be obscured by conductive material in front of the primary current carrying elements. As the study progressed it became clear that more current was carried in the forward conductors than originally anticipated. This fact led to more detailed analytical and experimental investigations of insulator bodies equipped with several tiers of conductor wires. A mathematical model of the multi-tiered armature was developed to assist in defining the electrical behavior. A variety of configurations of these launch packages have been tested in a 25 mm railgun powered by a laboratory capacitor bank. The packages maintained low voltage operation while incurring electrical actions that would have melted the conductor wires if all of the current were confined in the rear most tier. The testing, modeling, and analysis of voltage shielding and current sharing are presented along with the test results from several firings of the 25 mm railgun. © 1995 IEEE",,"Calculations; Capacitor storage; Electric conductors; Electric currents; Electric insulators; Electric wire; Electronics packaging; Mathematical models; Projectiles; Technology; Velocity; Electric energy guns; Multi tiered copper wire; Muzzle voltage probe; Solid armatures; Voltage shielding; Rail guns",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029218881

Wind power densities usually are greatest during the spring, and decrease by at least 30 percent relative to the annual average in many areas during the summer months, when demand is highest. This problem can be overcome by using an oversized wind farm and a compressed air energy storage system (a baseload wind energy system). A minimum volume storage reservoir is needed to transform intermittent wind energy to baseload power, while a larger reservoir can be used to store excess power produced during the spring for either peak power or baseload output during the summer. The yearly average cost of energy increases by about 3 percent for the largest storage reservoir, indicating that seasonal storage of wind energy is economically as well as technically feasible.",,"Compressed air; Cost accounting; Cost effectiveness; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric power utilization; Baseload power; Compressed air energy storage system; Wind power density; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029218874

Although a typical sag is only 5 to 20 cycles, electronic equipment may fail or 'trip.' A trip of industrial process equipment, such as a motor drive or programmable logic controller, may be extremely costly. Methods to improve the 'ride-through' capability of the equipment usually is a system solution: uninterruptable power supplies, motor-generator sets, etc. Often, only a few of the devices in an industrial process are very sensitive to sags. Therefore, a better solution is to desensitize the components which are affected by sags. Compared to ac variable frequency drives, dc motor drives are particularly susceptible to sags because they inherently lack electrical energy storage devices. The addition of capacitance on the dc-side of the drive will not improve ride-through and can be detrimental to controllability.

Generally, the retrofit is performed either by pouring a thin slab over the existing floor with the heating elements embedded in it or by attaching the heating elements to the subfloor from the joist space, if accessible. In this study, a computer program was developed for space heating from the joisted subfloor. Noting the energy storage in the heated floor and exposed building elements, a quasi-steady-state thermal model was employed, justified in practice by either continuous operation with water temperature modulation or intermittent operation with reasonably short off-periods. The algorithm is capable of predicting the required mean water temperature in a hydronic system when the floor construction details, tube spacing and material, heating load, and room characteristics are known. Alternatively, with a given limitation on the supply water temperature, the system can be optimally selected by reviewing and manipulating all the pertinent design variables.

This paper presents work to exploit the dependence of the microwave properties of ferrites on applied magnetic fields, and to develop such an absorbent material. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) is known to result in absorption of incident microwave energy at a characteristic frequency for any given ferrite. The FMR frequency is dependent on the anisotropy field Han, which in turn can be modified by chemical doping. Therefore, ferrite RAMs can be produced to operate at required frequencies through judicious choice of the ferrite. Furthermore, if Han is supplemented by an applied magnetic field Happ, the FMR frequency will be increased by an amount dependent on the strength of Happ and on the sense of anisotropy. The microwave permeability and permittivity spectra of a range of ferrites were measured as functions of Happ, using a vector network analyzer. These were used as input to a computer model for calculating absorber performance, and the effects of bias fields on a variety of absorber designs were predicted. A novel system was developed to apply large fields in test panels, for validating performance predictions.",,"Computer simulation; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Ferromagnetic resonance; Magnetic fields; Microwave devices; Network analyzers; Random access storage; Chemical doping; Microwave absorbent materials; Ferrites",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029213287

This paper describes results of laboratory testing involving two low voltage capacitor charging schemes. These experiments demonstrate the power conditioning equipment's voltage and current control characteristics. The first sequence of tests utilized a phase-controlled rectifier to control the current. A series of constant phase delay angles and a pre-determined phase delay angle profile were tested to produce a constant current charge on the capacitors. The second sequence utilized generator field control to ramp the charge voltage through a diode bridge to charge the capacitors. Using the results of each configuration, an optimum design of simultaneous current and voltage control can be developed. The control aspects of using combined generator field control and rectifier current control will be addressed. © 1995 IEEE",,"Capacitors; Diodes; Electric charge; Electric current control; Electric currents; Electric generators; Electric power systems; Electric rectifiers; Thyristors; Transients; Controlled full wave bridge rectifiers; Electrothermal chemical guns; Muzzle energy; Phase controlled rectifier; Pulse forming network; Capacitor storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029208105

The Hypervelocity High Efficiency (HYPE) railgun concept uses a distributed power feed railgun design, but eliminates the need for many separate distributed power supplies. Nested, segmented main rails are individually connected to a single pair of augmenting secondary rails. The augmenting secondary rails are powered from a single energy source. A 15 mm square bore, 300 mm long HYPE railgun was built and tested to evaluate concept feasibility.

Thermal energy storage also allows a cogeneration facility to provide dispatchable electric power while providing a constant thermal load. The first of two studies reported here focused on the relative performance and economic benefits of incorporating a diurnal thermal energy storage (TES) system with a simple-cycle gas turbine cogeneration system to produce dispatchable power during peak- and/or intermediate-demand periods. The results show that the oil/rock storage system for TES was the most attractive option for the assumed thermal load quality.

This is paiticularly the case for small and medium sized machines because their low inertias and high resistances make them inherently more unstable. Research has therefore been directed into new techniques for detecting pole slipping and the formulation of protection algorithms which can be included into an integrated microcomputer based protection scheme for these generators. This paper describes a method for detecting pole slipping using power measurements taken at the generator's terminals. This technique has been shown to correctly detect pole slipping using both computer simulation and a laboratory model power system.

As a trade-off, reducing interface stiffness also lowers zero motion force bandwidth. In this paper, we propose that for natural tasks, zero motion force bandwidth isn't everything, and incorporating series elasticity as a purposeful element within an actuator is a good idea. We use the term elasticity instead of compliance to indicate the presence of a passive mechanical spring in the actuator. After a discussion of the trade-offs inherent in series elastic actuators, we present a control system for their use under general force or impedance control.

Therefore, we examined, using differential scanning calorimetry, the thermal behavior of glass transitions in axes of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with water contents (WC) between O and 1 g H2O/g dry weight (g/g) and temperatures between -120 and +120°C. Three types of thermal behaviors associated with the glass transition were observed. The appearance, the glass → liquid transition temperature, and the amount of energy released during these transitions were dependent on the tissue WC. No glass transitions were observed at WC lower than 0.03 and higher than 0.45 g/g. A brief exposure to 100°C altered the glass properties of tissues with WC between 0.03 and 0.08 g/g but did not affect the thermal behavior of glasses with higher WC, demonstrating that thermal history is important to the intracellular glass behavior at lower WC. Correspondence of data from bean to models predicting the effects of glass components on the glass → liquid transition temperature suggests that the intracellular glasses are composed of a highly complex sugar matrix, in which sugar and water molecules interact together and influence the glass properties. Our data provide evidence that additional glass properties must be characterized to understand the implications of a glassy state in storage stability of seeds.",,"Phaseolus (angiosperm); Phaseolus vulgaris; Phaseolus (angiosperm); Phaseolus vulgaris; Phaseolus vulgaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029188402

The population contained both solid- and hollow-stiped plants. Growth rate was at its minimum from October to December, and started to increase in mid-winter, slightly earlier at 3 m than at 5 m. The increase in growth rate coincided with a strong reduction in stored carbohydrates and an increase in nitrate content of the laminae, indicating that stored mannitol and laminaran provided extra energy for increased lamina growth and/or for nitrate uptake. The results showed that stored mannitol was utilised before laminaran. The growth rate was at its maximum from April to June, and was reduced from June to July. The ambient nitrate concentration at the locality was low from May to August. The nitrate content of the lamina tissue in relation to dry weight was high during spring but was reduced to low values by July, indicating that nitrate levels limited growth during summer. However, high nitrate concentration of the sea-water and high levels of storage carbohydrates in the plants during autumn indicate that the low growth rate at this time cannot be attributed to lack of nitrate or energy in the form of stored carbon.

The sensitive area of the detector is 150 mm × 150 mm, with 3,072 × 3,072 pixel sampling, resulting in roughly a 50 μm pixel raster. The x-ray image formed on the face of the detector is converted to visible light by a thin phosphor layer. This image is transferred optically to nine CCD sensors by nine square fiberoptic tapers (one for each CCD), arranged in a 3 × 3 array. Each taper demagnifies the image by a factor of approximately 2. Each CCD has a 1,024 × 1,024 pixel raster and is read out through two independent data channels. After each x- ray exposure period the x-ray shutter is closed and the electronic image is digitized (16-bit) and read out in 1.8s. Alternatively, the image may be binned 2 × 2 during readout, resulting in a 1,536 × 1,536 raster of 100 μm pixels; this image can be read out in 0.4s. The CCD sensors are operated at -40°C to reduce electronic noise. The detector is operated under full computer control: all operational parameters (readout rates, CCD temperature, etc.) can be adjusted from the console. The image data (18 MByte/image) are transferred via a fast VME system to a control processor and ultimately to disk storage. During April 1994 we carried out a complete set of measurements at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) for a full characterization of the gold detector. Characterization includes quantitative evaluation of the instrument's conversion gain (signal level/x-ray photon); detective quantum efficiency (DQE); point-spread function; sensitivity as a function of x-ray energy; geometrical distortion of images; spatial uniformity; read noise; and dark image and dark image noise.

A high frequency electrical signal travels down the sensor inside a storage vessel and is reflected at the surface of the product in the vessel. Since electrical energy travels at a fixed constant velocity, the phase angle at the input to the sensor, between the transmitted and reflected signals, is a direct measure of the empty space and is used to transmit tank level. This recently developed technique has proven very effective for level control and inventory management in both dry bulk solids and liquids.

The adaptations they possess for efficient and rapid swimming, efficient and rapid food processing, turnover of nutrients and storage and mobilization of internal fuel supplies, and for rapid recovery rates, are discussed. Overall, tunas and billfishes are designed for high performance, at both sustainable and burst swimming speeds, but there are several differences between tunas and billfishes. Tunas' aerobic metabolic capacities exceed those of ectothermic fishes, including billfishes and other scombrids, by virtue of their elevated red muscle temperatures, and because heart and white muscle aerobic capacities are significantly greater in tunas. The adaptations for high performance involve some costs, including the need for a constant high energy input to sustain high metabolic rates, high activity levels, and endothermy, Yet, tunas and billfishes have adopted successful lifestyles, as evidenced by their large numbers and biomass within the marine environment. Although our knowledge of these fishes has increased dramatically during the past 15 years, there are major gaps in our understanding of the metabolic biochemistry and physiology of these fishes, and these are highlighted so that additional research can be directed towards filling these gaps. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Aerobic; Anaerobic; Endothermy; Locomotion; Muscle; Predator; Scombroidei; Swimming performance",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029159118

Reversal of the hematologic and visceral abnormalities characteristic of Gaucher disease, the most common lipid storage disorder, with biweekly infusions of macrophage-targeted glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase) is well documented. The extent to which the skeleton responds to enzyme replacement therapy has not been systematically investigated. Methods. To assess the skeletal response to enzyme replacement therapy, we treated 12 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, who had intact spleens, with macrophage-targeted glucocerebrosidase. The initial dose of enzyme was 60 U/kg body weight every 2 weeks for 24 months, followed by reduction in dosage to 30 and then 15 U/kg body weight every 2 weeks, each for 9 months. Results. The lipid composition of bone marrow, determined by direct chemical analysis, began to improve after 6 months of treatment at a time when noninvasive imaging studies showed no significant changes. By 42 months, improvement in marrow composition was demonstrable on all noninvasive, quantitative imaging modalities (magnetic resonance score, quantitative xenon scintigraphy, and quantitative chemical shift imaging) used in this study. Quantitative chemical shift imaging, the most sensitive technique, demonstrated a dramatic normalization of the marrow fat content in all patients. Net increases in either cortical or trabecular bone mass, as assessed by combined cortical thickness measurements and dual-energy quantitative computed tomography, respectively, occurred in 10 patients. Conclusions. Prolonged treatment over 3 1/2 years with macrophage-targeted glucocerebrosidase produces objective reversal of disease in both the axial and appendicular skeleton in patients with Gaucher disease. Marked improvement occurs in marrow composition and bone mass in both children and adults.","bone marrow; combined cortical thickness; enzyme replacement therapy; Gaucher disease; macrophage-targeted glucocerebrosidase; trabecular bone density","alglucerase; glucosylceramidase; adolescent; adult; article; bone marrow cell; bone mass; clinical article; dose response; drug efficacy; enzyme replacement; female; gaucher disease; human; human cell; human tissue; intravenous drug administration; lipid composition; male; muscle injury; priority journal; quantitative assay; school child; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Bone and Bones; Bone Density; Bone Marrow; Child; Drug Delivery Systems; Female; Gaucher Disease; Glucosylceramidase; Human; Lipids; Male",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029155493

The recovery of free product by pumping from extraction wells or trenches is often an essential prerequisite step prior to further remedial actions. Vacuum-enhanced NAPL recovery (sometimes referred to as dual-phase extraction or bioslurping) has attracted recent attention because it offers a means to increase NAPL recovery rates compared with conventional methods, and to accomplish dewatering, while also facilitating vapor-based unsaturated zone cleanup. A conceptual model is presented that recognizes the effects that vacuum-enhanced recovery has on soil water and NAPL, with a focus on liquid residing at negative gage pressures and therefore lacking sufficient potential energy to flow into a conventional recovery well or trench. The imposition during vacuum-enhanced recovery of subatmospheric pressures within the subsurface can reduce the required potential energy (i.e., the entry suction), allowing liquid to be extracted that hitherto had not been able to flow into the well; moreover, it induces both pneumatic and hydraulic gradients toward the vacuum source that increase the rate of water and NAPL recovery. This conceptual model was tested during a 3-week-long pilot study at a South Carolina industrial site at which diesel fuel had been discovered in a saprolite formation. During Phase 1 of the pilot study, conventional recovery (liquid only) was carried out from a well screened at the water table, while during Phase 2 dual-phase extraction was performed at the same well. The application of 27 kPa vacuum resulted in an increase in NAPL recovery from negligible (Phase 1) to approximately 6.6 I/d (Phase 2), with a concurrent increase in water recovery from approximately 190 to 7601/ d. Neutron moisture probe observations revealed that vadose-zone liquids underwent redistribution toward the extraction well in response to the onset of Phase 2, also in accordance with the conceptual model. An understanding of soil physical relationships is crucial to the successful application of these and other in situ soil remediation technologies. 1058-8337/95/$.50. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Two-phase flow is an excellent alternative to the conventional single-phase system in transporting large amount of thermal energy at a uniform temperature regardless of variations in the heat loads. In addition, two-phase flows exist in a wide range of applications and enabling technologies in space. These include material processing and ceramics at ultra high temperatures, bioreactors and life-support systems, storage and transport of cryogenics, tank filling and fluid management, and in the design of many cold plate assemblies where heating (or cooling) takes place at the instrument/utility interface. Reliable design of such systems and many others require a thorough understanding of the mechanics of the two-phase flow under microgravity conditions. Of most interest are the phase distribution in a conduit (the flow patterns/regimes), the pressure drop, and the heat-transfer rates at different liquid and gas flow rates. Recent progress in the study of gas-liquid flows at microgravity conditions will be reviewed and discussed in this paper. © 1995.",,"Aerospace Applications; Heat Transfer; Two-Phase Flow(Gas/Liquid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029152305

In the human body, Mg2+ plays important roles including cofactors in many crucial enzyme systems, especially those involving energy transfer, storage and utilization. Alteration of the concentration of Mg2+ may cause neuromuscular hyperactivity, psychiatric disturbances, calcium/potassium abnormalities, and overactivity of cardiac muscle. Most information on the effect of Mg2+ on muscle contraction has been obtained from studies on cardiac, skeletal, and vascular muscle; much less is known about the effect of Mg2+ in other smooth muscle systems. In the current study, we investigated the effect of Mg2+ on the contraction and intracellular free calcium of rabbit urinary bladder detrusor muscle in response to carbachol and transmural field stimulation (FS). The results can be summarized as follows: (1) Reduction of the concentration of magnesium [Mg2+] from normal Ty-rode’s solution enhanced the spontaneous basal activity, whereas addition of Mg2+ gradually abolished this spontaneous activity. (2) Muscle contraction induced by FS or carbachol was enhanced in Mg2+-free Tyrode’s solution. Addition of Mg2+ inhibited the response to both forms of stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. (3) Inhibitory effects of Mg2+ were potentiated when the Ca2+ concentration in the Tyrode’s solution was reduced to 0.6 mM, whereas increasing the extracellular concentration of Ca2+ (5.4 mM) reduced the inhibitory effects of Mg2+. (4) Using FURA-2 to monitor intracellular free calcium simultaneous with contractile tension, we demonstrated that the alterations in the contractile responses observed at different concentrations of extracellular Mg2+ correlated with similar changes in intracellular free calcium. We conclude from this study that Mg2+ can significantly alter the contractile responses to FS and muscarinic stimulation by alteration of calcium influx during contraction. © 1995 S.

This study investigates the energy available to, and the efficiency with which it can be extracted by, four species of bathyergid mole‐rats fed natural diets ranging from the underground storage organs of geophytes to grass roots and leaves. The digestibility coefficients of geophytes ranged from 53% for the fibrous tuber of the gemsbok cucumber to 95–7% for corms and bulbs. One species, Bathyergus suillus whose diet consists of over 80% grass, had a digestibility coefficient of 87% on an all grass diet. All species had similar coefficients of digestibility of > 90% when fed on a uniform diet of sweet potato. Bulbs and corms had a low fibre content (3–3–4%), high calorific value (15–16kJ/g) and high digestibility coefficients (95–7–96%) and on this diet the mole‐rats maintained their body mass. Food of lower digestibility tended to have a high fibre content (8–2–45%) and, with the exception of B. suillus, although the mole‐rats consumed a greater quantity of food, they lost mass.

The mandible strike is released within less than 10 ms upon stimulation of particular mechanosensory trigger hairs. It is based on the storage of mechanical energy produced by the large but slow mandible closer muscle which cocks the mandible several seconds in advance of the strike. The strike is released from the catch by a small trigger muscle composed of tubular fibers. It features fast potentials and highly synchronized activation of all its muscle fibers only a few milliseconds in advance of the strike. The trigger muscle is supplied by two unusually large motor neurons that are enclosed in a glial sheath. The trap jaw action is thus controlled by a system composed of 2 giant sensory and 2 giant motor neurons on either side. The giant neurons are most likely monosynaptically coupled. The large axon diameter and the synaptic coupling result in high conduction velocity which underlies the very fast mandible reflex. The reflex activity is modulated by antennal and other sensory input probably converging onto the large dendritic trees of the trigger motor neurons. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Fast movements; Giant neurons; Glial sheath; Insect; Muscle structure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029138467

This is the case since it is behaviour which translates biological propensities into action on the environment, and it is behaviour which mediates (in part) the effect of the environment upon biology. Two particularly important behavioural aspects of the genes-environment interaction are low levels of physical activity (high sedentariness) and dietary habits which favour overconsumption (high intake of energy, particularly as fat). One continuing theme of research is the development of drugs to allow people to gain control over appetite by modifying eating patterns (dietary habits) through a number of possible mechanisms. The use of drugs to make people more willing or more able to engage in physical activity is not widely discussed although the use of drugs to increase total energy expenditure (via a variety of mechanisms) is actively researched. More than a decade ago Sullivan defined the framework for the development of anti-obesity drugs by specifying that drugs could act on energy intake, energy output or on those mechanisms involved in the assimilation and storage of lipids in the body. Consequently the range of possible actions of anti-obesity drugs extends from the adjustment of habitual patterns of behaviour to an action on the genetic transcription of molecules regulating the biochemistry of adipocytes. Additionally, other writers have set out the optimal properties for an anti-obesity drug. These should include a suppression of energy intake. reduction in body fat mass, preservation of lean body tissue and an ergogenic action which would at least prevent the decline in resting metabolic rate which may occur with food restriction. Is there currently a drug that meets these criteria or could such a drug ever be developed?","Appetite; CCK; Fat; Peptides; Serotonin; Thermogenic agents","adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; anorexigenic agent; cholecystokinin receptor stimulating agent; serotonin agonist; adipocyte; appetite; behavior; body fat; body weight; caloric intake; conference paper; developing country; diet; energy expenditure; environment; fat intake; genetic transcription; human; obesity; priority journal; psychobiology; rural area; rural population; thermogenesis; Body Weight; Cholecystokinin; Feeding Behavior; Forecasting; Human; Obesity; Serotonin Agonists; Sympathomimetics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029131192

Small birds show slight but very consistent changes in body mass during the course of a day, being lightest at dawn and heaviest at dusk. Here we show for the first time that this natural diurnal variation in mass has a highly significant and disproportionate impact on flight performance: individual zebra finches were over 30% slower at dusk than at dawn, despite being less than 7% heavier.

The resulting left ventricular. insufficiency depends on the size of the infarct and time. The infarcted area remodels, due to proteolytic activity of inflammatory cells and collagenogenesis from fibroblast activity. The phenotype of the residual healthy cardiac muscle undergoes modification and there are peripheral vascular changes which are partly dependent on the activation of pressor systems and/or inactivation of dilator systems. The changes are proportional to the infarct size at any given time after induction of the model. The degree of right ventricular hypertrophy and the drop in arterial pressure are upstream and downstream markers of the loss of left ventricular function and therefore indicate the extent of the remodelling. The increase in type V3 isomyosin, the amount of subendocardial collagen, and the biosynthesis, storage and secretion of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) are all proportional to the infarct size and the degree of cardiac overload. The level of urinary cGMP is also correlated with infarct size. These indices show ventricular remodelling, increased stress and energy restriction of the residual healthy cardiac muscle. The activation of peripheral presser systems also depends on infarct size. They reflect the influence of defective cardiac pumping on the kidney, liver, brain and endothelium. Massive infarcts are accompanied by an increase in circulating renin and in renal renin content, by a decrease in angiotensinogen due to its consumption by renin, and to its insufficient hepatic synthesis, and by an increase in vasopressin secretion and biosynthesis in the hypothalamus. Converting enzyme inhibition has a beneficial effect in this model by lowering cardiac load. It reduces arterial pressure, reverses bi-atrial and right ventricular hypertrophy, reduces the changes in the myosin isoenzyme patterns and normalizes subendocardial fibrosis and the level of ANF Although the effects of converting enzyme inhibition are beneficial in this model, they are restricted by their inability to normalize the load and stress when the initial loss of cardiac contractile material exceeds 40%.","Atrial natriuretic factor; Converting enzyme inhibition; Cyclic GMP; Renin angiotensin system; Vasopressin","angiotensin; atrial natriuretic factor; captopril; collagen; cyclic GMP; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; myosin adenosine triphosphatase isoenzyme; renin; vasopressin; angiotensin blood level; animal experiment; animal model; arterial pressure; biosynthesis; collagen synthesis; conference paper; congestive heart failure; controlled study; disease model; enzyme inhibition; etiology; fibroblast; heart infarction; heart infarction size; heart left ventricle failure; heart left ventricle function; heart muscle; heart right ventricle hypertrophy; hypothalamus function; inflammatory cell; liver function; plasma renin activity; priority journal; protein degradation; rat; urine level; vascularization; vasopressin blood level",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029120745

Thus, the search for the best performance at the least cost for such multipurpose plants is made much more difficult by the fact that such facilities must meet differing goals or demands. Such a facility exists at the Ecole Polytechnique Federate de Lausanne (EPFL) and has been studied in order to find the optimum modes of operation as a function of time for variations in both the heating and electrical demands this facility must meet. The results of this study are presented here. The plant itself provides heat and electricity for both the EPFL and the University of Lausanne and is projected to supply electricity to the exterior utility grid provided it can be shown to be economically viable. The plant's primary components include two gas turbines, a heat recovery system, two heat pumps, a set of heat storage tanks, and both medium and low-temperature district heating networks. In order to find the optimum mode of operation, a mixed-integer linear programming approach was used, which balances the competing costs of operation and minimizes these costs subject to the operational constraints placed on the system. The effects of both the cost of the fuel and the costs of electricity sold and bought on the best performance of the system are evaluated.

In most mammals, the relatively high ratio of milk energy production to maintenance demands a cycle of energy storage during pregnancy, lipid mobilization and increased feed intake during lactation, and restoration of body fat in late lactation or after weaning. In well-fed women, the energy balance usually remains positive. However, in situations of low-energy supply, the stored lipid can be critical to establishment of lactation and maintenance of maternal health. There is a commonality among mammals in the adaptative responses during lactation and in their general regulation. However, in rodents and most domestic species the magnitude of metabolic response is greater than in women. The importance of adipose tissue to lactation is demonstrated by the number of highly coordinated and redudant control elements that regulate the adaptations of metabolism. This coordination is carried out by the central nervous system through the endocrine organs and the sympathetic nervous system. Recently, insights have been gained into the quantitation of the adaptations due to rate of milk production, stage of lactation, and intake of energy-yielding compounds and the physiological mechanisms of action of several regulatory factors. The intake of nutrients and demand for milk precursors have differential effect on the enzymes of lipid synthesis and release from adipose tissue, and the equations describing these chemical interconversions vary with stage of lactation, nutrient intake, and genetic propensity for milk production. Regulatory mechanisms that are now better understood include those of the interactions of growth hormone and insulin to control lipogenesis and the activity of the sympathetic nervous system to regulate lipolysis. Improvements in understanding and managing lactational energy metabolism have been limited by the complexity of the chemical interconversions of nutrients and their regulation. For women specifically, the severe lack of information on adaptations at the tissue level hinder further advancement. Improvement in this area will require a coordinated effort to study both physiological control mechanisms and quantitative parameters of lipid metabolism. © 1995 Elsevier Science Inc.","adipose; energy; lactation; lipids; metabolic control; regulation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029104633

Present implantable cardioverter defibrillators use a wide range of capacitance values for the storage capacitor. However, the optimal capacitance value is unknown. We hypothesized that a smaller capacitor, by delivering its charge in a time closer to the heart chronaxie, should lower the defibrillation threshold (DFT). We compared the energy required to defibrillate 10 open‐chest dogs, after 15 seconds of ventricular fibrillation, with a monophasic, time‐truncated waveform delivered from either a 85‐µF or a 140‐µF capacitor. Shocks were delivered through a pair of 14‐cm2 epicardial patch electrodes. The two capacitors were randomly tested twice with each dog using a modified 3‐reversal method for each DFT determination. The average stored and delivered DFT energies for the 85‐µF capacitor were 6.0 ± 1.7 joules and 5.2 ± 1.5 joules, respectively, compared to 6.7 ± 1.7 joules and 6.0 ± 1.5 joules for the 140‐µF capacitor (P = 0.01 and P = 0.004, respectively). The mean leading edge voltages were higher, the pulse duration shorter, and the mean impedance lower for the 85‐µF capacitor. The impedance was inversely related to the pulse duration and the voltage decay suggesting that, at least in part, the mechanism of improved defibrillation could be accounted for by the waveform electrical characteristics. There was an equal number of episodes of postshock bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias following discharges from each capacitor. Moreover, there was no relationship between the likelihood of these arrhythmias and either the initial voltage or the delivered current nor there was a higher number of episodes of postshock hypotension following the smaller capacitor discharges. The value of the storage capacitor significantly affects the DFT by delivering a waveform with inherently superior defibrillation characteristics, which despite its higher initial voltage and current, does not show evidence of electrically mediated myocardial depression.

This development has created a demand for high energy diets, which presently dominate the market place. Such diets limit waste load to the surrounding environment, but is the quality of the fish as end product affected? It is well established that fillet quality varies according to several factors, including feed composition and feeding regime. An experiment was thus designed to evaluate the effect of differing: i) amount of protein fed, ii) amount of fat fed, iii) starvation period before harvesting, iv) method of slaughter and v) storage time post mortem on fillet quality of 6009 trout. The fillet fat content was examined and related to each of the five factors investigated in order to determine which had the most pronounced effect on fillet texture post mortem. Texture measurements were undertaken using an Instron Universal Testing Machine and sensory analysis. Results indicated that fillet fat content could be increased 20% without affecting texture. Storage time post mortem was found to be the single most important factor affecting fillet texture. Sensory analyses verified the results obtained by instrumental texture testing. © 1995, International Association on Water Quality.

The animals used were from birth to 61 d of age, fed ad lib. on different milk replacers containing 200,240 and 280 g crude protein/kg DM and 200, 240 and 280 g fat/kg DM, thus giving nine dietary treatments. The utilization of the milk replacers and the animals’ body composition were determined by balance and slaughter trials. There were significant positive effects of protein concentration of the milk replacers on component digestibilities, energy metabolizability, feed intake, empty-body weights, empty-body composition and protein and fat retention. The concentration of fat in the milk replacers also had a significant positive effect on the digestible and metabolizable energy concentration of the diets and on fat retention. The relationships existing between feed intake and diet composition (concentration of digestible protein, metabolizable energy and digestible protein:metabolizable energy ratio) as well as between empty-body composition or protein and fat retention and diet composition, were examined. From these it was deduced that feed intake was significantly influenced by the digestible protein concentration of the diets. The higher the digestible protein concentration the higher the feed intake up to a maximum digestible protein concentration value. As the digestible protein concentration of the diets was the dietary factor which significantly influenced feed intake, this also significantly influenced the body composition and the protein and fat retention. The protein concentration of the feed at which metabolizable energy intake in these animals would be greatest was estimated to be 347 g/kg DM. © 1995, The Nutrition Society.

Box 016129, Miami, FL 33101-6129, United States","The discovery of glycogenin as a self-glycosylating protein that primes glycogen synthesis has significantly increased our understanding of the structure and metabolism of this storage polysaccharide. The amount of glycogenin will influence how much glycogen the cell can store. Therefore, the production of active glycogenin primer in the cell has the potential to be the overall rate-limiting process in glycogen formation, capable of overriding the better understood hormonally controlled mechanisms of protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation that regulate the activities of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase. There are indications that a similar covalent modification control is also being exerted on glycogenin. Glycogenin has the ability to glucosylate molecules other than itself and to hydrolyze UDPglucose. These are independent of self-glucosylation, so that glycogenin, even when it has completed its priming role and become part of the glycogen molecule, retains its catalytic potential. Another new component of glycogen metabolism has been discovered that may have even greater influence on total glycogen stores than does glycogenin. This is proglycogen, a low molecular mass (~400 kDa) form of glycogen that serves as a stable intermediate on the pathways to and from depot glycogen (macroglycogen, mass 107 Da, in muscle). It is suggested that glycogen oscillates, according to glucose supply and energy demand, between the macroglycogen and proglycogen, but not usually the glycogenin, forms. The proportion of proglycogen to macroglycogen varies widely between liver, skeletal muscle, and heart, from 3 to 15% to 50% by weight, respectively. On a molar basis, proglycogen is greatly in excess over macroglycogen in muscle and heart, meaning that if the proglycogen in these tissues could be converted into macroglycogen, they could store much more total glycogen. Discovering the factors that regulate the balance between glycogenin, proglycogen, and macroglycogen may have important implications for the understanding and management of noninsulin-dependent diabetes and for exercise physiology.","glycogen biogenesis; glycogenin; macroglycogen; macroglycogen synthase; proglycogen; proglycogen; synthase","gluconic acid; glycogen phosphorylase; glycogen synthase; glycopeptide; uridine diphosphate glucose; cellular distribution; dephosphorylation; enzyme specificity; glucose metabolism; glycogen metabolism; glycogen synthesis; glycosylation; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; regulatory mechanism; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029091079

Eight subjects performed two series of runs (FFS and RFS) on a treadmill at an average speed of 2.50, 2.78, 3.06, 3.33, 3.61, 3.89, 4.17 m s‐1 Step frequency, oxygen uptake, mechanical work, and its tow components, external and internal, were measured. No differences were found for step frequency, mechanical internal work per unit time and oxygen uptake, while external and total mechanical work per unit time were significantly higher, 7–12%, for FFS. The higher external work was the result of an increase of the work performed against both gravitational and inertial forces. As the energy expenditure was the same it has been speculated that a higher storage and release of energy takes place in the elastic structures of the lower leg with FFS. In a different series of experiments on six subjects contact time, time of deceleration and time of acceleration were measured by means of a video camera while running on the treadmill at 2.50, 3.33 and 4.17 ms‐1, both FFS and RFS. Time of deceleration is similar for FFS and RFS, but contact time and time of acceleration are shorter, respectively 123 and 25%, for FFS. As the average speed is considered equal to the ratio of the distance travelled when the foot is on the ground to the contact time and this distance tends to level off at high speed, mainly for anatomical constraint, it conceivable that, beside other mechanical or metabolic factors, FFS is an obligatory choice for sprinters and middle distance runners to attain higher speed. © 1995 Scandinavian Physiological Society","foot contact time; foot strike type; mechanical work; oxygen uptake; running","acceleration; adult; article; carbon dioxide tension; deceleration; energy expenditure; foot; gravity; human; human experiment; lung ventilation; male; mechanics; normal human; oxygen consumption; oxygen tension; priority journal; running; treadmill exercise; Adult; Biomechanics; Energy Metabolism; Foot; Human; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Running",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029087356

In the second case, partitioning and transmutation of these materials can be considered to reduce the impact of radiation on man due to the storage. On the basis of the SPIN programme developed by CEA in this field, the main features of transmutation will be presented. To reduce the long-term radiotoxicity. Pu, minor actinides and some long-lived fission products have to be transmuted. To assess the feasibility of such transmutation in reactors or advanced systems, one has to consider constraints on the nuetron balance, safety, the fuel cycle, technology and cost. Goals are to use every long-lived element with a minimized production of other long-lived elements in order to obtain an appreciable radiotoxicity reduction. It implies multirecycling of Pu which favours fast neutron reactors and different strategies of multirecycling for Np, Am, Cm. Multirecycling makes the results are strongly dependent on losses. Research to obtain the high partitioning efficiency needed are in progress.

The importance of the level of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (malate, citrate and fumarate) for energy transduction during exercise has been investigated in six healthy subjects and in two patients with muscle phosphorylase deficiency (McArdle's disease). 2. Healthy subjects cycled for 10 min at low (50 W), moderate [130 ± 6 W (mean ± SEM)] and high (226 ± 12 W) work rates, corresponding to 26, 50 and 80% of their maximal O2 uptake, respectively. Patients with McArdle's disease cycled for 11-13 min at submaximal (40 W) rates, and to fatigue at maximal work rates of 60-90 W. 3. In healthy subjects, phosphocreatine was unchanged during low work rates, but decreased to 79 and 32% of the initial level during moderate and high work rates. In patients with McArdle's disease, phosphocreatine decreased to 82 and 34% of the initial level during submaximal and peak exercise. Muscle lactate increased in healthy subjects during exercise at moderate and high work rates, but remained low in patients with McArdle's disease. 4. In healthy subjects, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates were similar at rest and at low work rates (0.48±0.04 mmol/kg dry weight), but increased to 1.6±0.2 mmol/kg dry weight and 4.0±0.3 mmol/kg dry weight at moderate and high work rates. The tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate level in patients with McArdle's disease was similar to that in healthy subjects at rest, but was markedly reduced during exercise when compared at the same relative intensity. The peak level of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates in patients with McArdle's disease was 22% of that in healthy subjects. However, when compared at the same absolute workload, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates were similar in patients with McArdle's disease and in healthy subjects. 5. The decrease in glutamate and increase in alanine suggest that the alanine aminotransaminase reaction was the major anaplerotic process in healthy subjects. However, in patients with McArdle's disease (n= 1), muscle alanine remained unchanged and the purine nucleotide cycle may instead be the route of a limited anaplerosis during maximal exercise. The muscle content of glutamate and glutamine (n= 1) was markedly reduced in patients with McArdle's disease. 6. It is concluded that the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate level is related to the work rate in healthy subjects, and that the attenuated peak level in patients with McArdle's disease may be a limitation for aerobic energy transduction.","amino acids; anaplerosis; citrate; fumarate; glycogen storage disease; glycogenolysis; malate; metabolic control; muscle contraction; oxidative metabolism","aminotransferase; creatine phosphate; phosphorylase; adult; aerobic metabolism; amino acid metabolism; article; citric acid cycle; energy transfer; enzyme activity; enzyme deficiency; exercise; female; glycogen storage disease type 5; glycogenolysis; high energy phosphate; human; major clinical study; male; oxygen transport; priority journal; respiratory chain; skeletal muscle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029076371

Myogenic hyperuricemia is ascribed to excessive degradation of muscle purine nucleotides, secondary to impaired ATP generation. Although this pathophysiological condition has been observed not only in glycolytic defects but also in mitochondrial diseases affecting lipid and carbohydrate oxidation, it is most common and prominent in muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency, in which neither glycogen nor glucose can be used as metabolic fuels. The first key reaction of muscle purine degradation is catalysis by AMP deaminase. Numerous studies have indicated that AMP deaminase may play an important role in energy metabolism in contracting muscle. Arguments against this hypothesis have emerged through analyses on muscle AMP deaminase deficiency.

It is not fully understood why, under conditions of negative calorie balance where complete energy release from storage fat is critical, ketosis should arise with a concomitant wastage of energy. Here, I wish to propose a theory that relates the formation of ketone bodies under such conditions to a deficiency in dietary pantothenic acid. Supplementation of this vitamin would facilitate complete catabolism of fatty acids and thus the formation of ketone bodies could be circumvented. As a result, a sufficient amount of energy would be released from storage fat to relieve dieters of the sensation of hunger and weakness which otherwise would be difficult to endure. Hence, using this method for weight reduction together with a careful observation of calorie intake, I have great success in treating overweight-to-obese patients to lose weight. © 1995.",,"fat; ketone body; pantothenic acid; diet; human; ketoacidosis; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; obesity; priority journal; short survey; weakness; weight reduction; Acetyl Coenzyme A; Appetite Depressants; Fasting; Fatigue; Human; Hunger; Ketosis; Lipids; Models, Biological; Pantothenic Acid; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029067748

The ability of exercise to selectively promote fat oxidation should be optimized if exercise is done post-absorptively (preferably during morning fasting metabolism), if caffeine and possibly hydroxycitrate/carnitine are administered prior to exercise, if the exercise regimen is of moderate intensity and prolonged duration, and if no calories are ingested for several hours following exercise. A simple mathematical model is presented which delineates the factors that determine daily fat balance during exercise training. This model clarifies the crucial importance of low-fat eating if exercise is to have an optimal impact on fat stores. As a complement to aerobics, resistance exercise can benefit dieters by helping to preserve lean mass and metabolic rate in the face of a persistently negative caloric balance. © 1995.",,"caffeine; fat; exercise; human; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipogenesis; mathematical model; priority journal; respiratory quotient; review; weight reduction; Adipose Tissue; Aerobiosis; Caffeine; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Human; Lipids; Mathematics; Models, Biological; Oxygen Consumption; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029064026

The image detector is an image intensifier with digital image storage/processing facilities. Images were taken at the accelerator of treatment fields in seven patients (pelvic, head and neck, chest fields) and these images were comparable in anatomical contrast to simulator radiographs. Two techniques for marking the therapy field onto the portal images were successfully demonstrated. One was to mark relevant corners or edges of the therapy light field on the skin using small Pb markers which become clearly visible in the 'diagnostic' portal image. The other was to record a separate 'therapy' image and through the software, extract and superimpose the field edges on to the 'diagnostic' image.

The underlying mechanisms behind imbalance in energy intake and energy expenditure that lead to obesity are still controversial. In most populations, obesity is more common among women than men and is a multifactorial phenotype, which may result from a complex network of genetic and nongenetic factors. The relative importance of genetic factors for obesity is under debate4-7. Genome searches using polymorphic markers in inbred mice with phenotypes that result in extreme obesity8,9 and studies of human candidate genes are being performed in an attempt to identify genes that contribute to obesity. There is evidence that body weight is physiologically regulated4,10,11 and it has been postulated that the storage of fat may provide signals to the brain that the body is obese, which in turn may make the subject eat less and burn more fuel12,13. One of the molecules that may be involved in such signalling is the obese (ob) gene product. Mutations in ob result in profound obesity and type II diabetes in mice14,15. The mouse ob gene and its human homologue have been cloned and sequenced8. The gene is expressed in adipose tissue and the product has features of a secreted protein.

However, it is of further interest to determine whether the addition of fat and protein to carbohydrate feedings affects muscle glycogen storage. Eight well-trained triathletes [23.1 ± 2.0 (SE) yr; 74.0 ± 3.4 kg; peak O2 consumption = 4.7 ± 0.4 l/min] undertook an exercise trial (2 h at 75% peak O2 consumption, followed by four 30-s sprints) on three occasions, each 1 wk apart. For 24 h after each trial, the subjects rested and were assigned to the following diets in randomized order: control (C) diet (high glycemic index CHO foods; CHO = 7 g · kg-1 · day- 1), added fat and protein (FP) diet (C diet + 1.6 g · kg-1 · day-1 fat + 1.2 g · kg-1 · day-1 protein), and matched-energy diet [C diet + 4.8 g · kg-1 · day-1 additional CHO (Polycose) to match the additional energy in the FP diet]. Meals were eaten at t = 0, 4, 8, and 21 h of recovery. The total postprandial incremental plasma glucose area was significantly reduced after the FP diet (P &lt; 0.05). Serum free fatty acid and plasma triglyceride responses were significantly elevated during the FP trial (P &lt; 0.05).

Results of this study suggest that the addition of fat and protein to a recovery diet does not alter glycogen storage over 24 h, provided CHO intake is adequate.","fat intake; protein intake; recovery","fat; glucose; glycogen; protein; triacylglycerol; article; carbohydrate intake; controlled study; fat intake; glucose blood level; glycogen muscle level; glycogen synthesis; human; human experiment; normal human; physical stress; priority journal; protein intake; triacylglycerol blood level",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029048763

Methods: Rats with thioacetamide-induced cirrhosis underwent a 70% hepatectomy, and were divided into three groups. Each group was then injected with 14C-labeled glucose, 14C-labeled MCT or 14C-labeled LCT, respectively. The subsequent tissue distribution of 14C and the cumulative amount of expired 14CO2 were determined. In a second experiment, the 70%-hepatectomized cirrhotic rats received total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The source of the nonprotein calories was 100% glucose (glucose group), 60% MCT + 40% glucose (MCT group), and 60% LCT + 40% glucose (LCT group). The adenylate energy charge and the glycogen content in the liver remnant were determined. Results: The tissue distribution of 14C revealed that the fat emulsions accumulated preferentially in the liver. One hour after the partial hepatectomy, the concentration of 14C-labeled MCT in the liver remnants was threefold higher than in sham-operated controls. Similarly, the concentration of 14C-labeled LCT was twofold higher. The adenylate energy charge in the glucose group with TPN recovered to preoperative levels within 1-hour after the partial hepatectomy, whereas the LCT group with TPN showed a 24-hour delay in their recovery. The MCT group with TPN exhibited an intermediate time course. Conclusions: It is suggested that the specific accumulation of MCT and especially LCT emulsions in the cirrhotic liver remnant acts as an energy load rather than an energy substrate.

Henning Building, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, United States","Growth hormone (GH) administration to nonruminant red meat animals markedly alters carcass composition so that dramatic reductions in adipose tissue accretion and enhancement of lean tissue growth occur. These repartitioning effects of GH in the pig are reported to reflect antagonism of the lipogenic effect of insulin on adipose tissue, the primary site of fatty acid synthesis in this species, so that glucose disposal and utilization by adipose tissue are markedly reduced, and substrate availability to muscle is increased. In poultry, a significant positive response to GH administration is not consistently achieved, and factors such as posthatch period of development and the pattern of tissue exposure to GH are important determinants of the response to GH enhancement. This may relate to the status of target tissue GH receptors that appear subject to down regulation in the adult chicken. Sensitivity of the bird to the appetite-suppressive effects of GH and interaction between this effect and energy intake have recently been demonstrated and need to be further explored. Growth hormone clearly influences hepatic lipogenesis and net lipid deposition in the broiler chicken. However, future research emphasis on the regulation of GH receptor binding activity and gene expression and their relationship to GH action, as well as on newer components of the GH axis such as GH-binding proteins, will help to clarify controlling mechanisms in poultry.","growth hormone; lipid metabolism; poultry; receptor","growth hormone; growth hormone binding protein; growth hormone receptor; insulin; adipose tissue; binding affinity; caloric intake; conference paper; fatty acid synthesis; gene expression; glucose utilization; growth regulation; hormone action; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; poultry; tissue growth; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Female; Growth; Growth Hormone; Human; Lipids; Male; Poultry; Receptors, Somatotropin",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029046213

In contrast, non-feeding infective juvenile entomopathogenic nematodes forage exclusively for a single host. Two questions were posed: (1) what is the relationship between metabolic rate, energy reserves and foraging strategy and (2) when a foraging strategy fails, will an infective-stage parasite switch strategies? Three species of entomopathogenic nematodes were stored in water and changes in their behaviour, metabolic rate, energy reserves, and infectivity were measured throughout the storage period. Steinernema carpocapsae ambushes insect hosts, whereas S. glaseri and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora cruise forage. Steinernema carpocapsae was least active and had the lowest metabolic rate. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora was more active and had the highest metabolic rate. Steinernema glaseri was most active and had an intermediate metabolic rate. Neither cruising species changed foraging strategy. Steinernema carpocapsae decreased nictation (a behaviour associated with ambushing only) and increased their locomotory rate. Any change in searching strategy occurred without assessment of the profitability or distribution of potential hosts, but the advantage this confers is unknown.","Behaviour; Entomopathogenic nematodes; Foraging strategies; Metabolism","animal experiment; article; behavior; controlled study; metabolism; nematode; nonhuman; priority journal; zoology; Heterorhabditis bacteriophora; Steinernema carpocapsae; Steinernema glaseri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029045323

We tested the interactions of corticosterone and insulin on caloric efficiency, white adipose tissue (WAT) stores, and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Two experiments were performed: 1) adrenalectomized rats were treated with corticosterone with or without streptozotocin-induced diabetes and 2) adrenalectomized, corticosterone-treated, diabetic rats were treated with insulin. By 4-5 days later, ≥50% of the variance in caloric efficiency, plasma triglycerides, and WAT stores was explained by regression of these variables on corticosterone (catabolic) and insulin (anabolic). When the ratio of the hormones was normal, but concentrations high, overall gain of energy stores decreased and energy was redistributed to fat. Both hormones were anabolic on BAT lipid storage; the hormones played a complex role in the regulation of uncoupling protein (UCP) in BAT. Although corticosterone inhibited and insulin stimulated UCP, these effects were only evident in diabetics and with normoglycemia, respectively. For BAT variables, ≤50% of the variance was explained by regression on corticosterone and insulin, suggesting that the effects of these hormones are mediated through an intermediate such as sympathetic nervous system input to BAT.","caloric efficiency; uncoupling protein; white adipose tissue","corticosterone; glucocorticoid; insulin; streptozocin; triacylglycerol; uncoupling protein; adrenalectomy; adrenergic system; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; body weight; brown adipose tissue; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; food intake; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; triacylglycerol blood level; white adipose tissue",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029041678

No effect of the low sodium diet in pregnancy on the course of blood pressure and the incidence of hypertensive disorders was observed. The reduction in sodium intake also caused a significant reduction in the intake of energy, protein, carbohydrates, fat, calcium, zinc, magnesiuim, iron and cholesterol. The reduced intake of calcium, zinc and magnesium in the women on the low sodium diet did not result in signficant changes in circulating total calcium, ionized calcium, parathyroid hormone, zinc, alkaline phosphatase or magnesium, probably because of homeostatic adaptations by the kidneys. In the women on the low sodium diet non-significant reductions in weight gain (1.5 kg) and fat mass gain (0.9 kg) over pregnancy were observed. These reductions in weight and fat mass gain were more pronounced (3.4 kg (P=0.003) and 1.3 kg (P = 0.15), respectively) when only the data of the women with good compliance were analyzed.

From energy and nutrient balances (intake -expenditure) we estimated the amount and composition of energy stored. Carbohydrate overfeeding produced progressive increases in carbohydrate oxidation and total energy expenditure resulting in 75-85% of excess energy being stored. Alternatively, fat overfeeding had minimal effects on fat oxidation and total energy expenditure, leading to storage of 90-95% of excess energy. Excess dietary fat leads to greater fat accumulation than does excess dietary carbohydrate, and the difference was greatest early in the overfeeding period.","diet composition; energy balance; nutrient balance; nutrient partitioning; Obesity","carbohydrate; fat; fatty acid; glucose; insulin; protein; adult; article; body composition; carbohydrate intake; carbohydrate metabolism; clinical article; controlled study; energy balance; energy expenditure; fat intake; fatty acid oxidation; human; lean body weight; male; nutrient; obesity; overnutrition; protein metabolism; weight gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029031491

We examined the possibility of applying positron emitter-labeled compounds to functional imaging in brain slices kept viable in an oxygenated buffer solution. Brain slices (300 μm thick) containing the striatum were incubated with positron emitter-labeled tracers for 30-45 min. The slices were then rinsed and placed on the bottom of a Plexiglas chamber filled with oxygenated Krebs-Ringer solution. The bottom of the chamber consisted of a thin polypropylene film to allow good penetration of β+ particles from the brain slices. The chamber was placed on a storage phosphor screen, which has a higher sensitivity and a wider dynamic range than X-ray films. After an exposure period of 15-60 min, the screen was scanned by the analyzer and radioactivity images of brain slices were obtained within 20 min. We succeeded in obtaining quantitative images of (1) [18F]fluoro-deoxyglucose uptake, (2) dopamine D2 receptor binding, (3) dopa-decarboxylase activity, and (4) release of [ 11 C]dopamine preloaded as l-[11C]DOPA in the brain slice preparation.

First, triacylglycerol is hydrolyzed to 1,2‐diacylglycerol, which is subsequently converted to 2‐monoacylglycerol. We studied the kinetics of trioleoylglycerol hydrolysis by rabbit and human pancreatic lipases. The products (acylglycerols and fatty acid) were analyzed by extraction from the reaction mixture, separation by thin‐layer chromatography, and quantification by capillary gas chromatography. The first‐order rate constants of trioleoylglycerol and dioleoylglycerol hydrolysis were calculated showing that both enzymes hydrolyze dioleoylglycerol faster than trioleoylglycerol. Using rabbit pancreatic lipase, we found that deoxycholate enhanced dioleoylglycerol hydrolysis to a higher degree than trioleoylglycerol hydrolysis. Colipase increased both rate constants similarly at high deoxycholate concentrations (35 mM), while at low concentrations (5 mM) a selectivity toward trioleoylglycerol was observed. From the variation of the rate constants with respect to temperature, we calculated the apparent activation energies of trioleoylglycerol and dioleoylglycerol hydrolysis to be 59.8 kJ • mol−1 and 53.5 kJ · mol−1, respectively. Upon storage, both rabbit and human pancreatic lipases showed a greater loss of activity toward dioleoylglycerol as compared to trioleoylglycerol, suggesting that different conformational elements of the enzyme molecule are responsible for the interaction with each substrate.

We measured lung input impedance in dogs from 0.2 to 8 Hz with an optimal ventilator waveform at four tidal volumes (VT; from 75 to 450 ml) in intact animals using an esophageal balloon as well as after opening the chest. The lung impedance from both conditions was partitioned into airway and tissue compartments as characterized by airway resistance and inertance (law) and tissue damping (G) and elastance (H) parameters respectively. All parameters except law depended to some extent on VT. The in situ tissue G and H slightly decreased with VT while in the open- chest condition; G decreased and H increased slightly with VT.

Although we cannot completely rule out certain artifacts, these differences most likely reflect real alterations in the lung due to the different configurations and possible differences in the distribution of pleural pressures in the two conditions. The G being smaller and E being larger in situ resulted in hysteresivity (G/H) 36% smaller in situ (P < 0.001). Consequently, energy dissipation in the lung tissues relative to energy storage as characterized by hysteresivity is somewhat increased in the open-chest configuration. This may be anticipated because the mechanical efficiency of the lungs is expected to be better in its natural state than in any artificially maintained condition that was the end result of an invasive intervention.","airway resistance; amplitude dependence; esophageal balloon; hysteresivity; tissue elastance; tissue resistance","airway resistance; animal experiment; article; breathing mechanics; dog; lung compliance; lung model; lung resistance; nonhuman; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029028082

Right ventricular dysplasia is being recognized with increasing frequency. It should be considered as a cause of ventricular tachycardia of left bundle branch block configuration and/or sudden unexpected death particularly during exercise in young men. The electrocardiogram (ECG) may show anterior precordial T wave inversion, particularly in lead V2 and/or a QRS complex duration ≥ 110 ms in the right precordial leads. Echocardiographic studies focusing on the size and wall‐motion abnormalities of the right ventricle are useful in confirming the diagnosis. Radionuclide angiography usually shows a moderately or markedly depressed right ventricular ejection fraction with normal or relatively well preserved left ventricular function. Cinemagnetic resonance imaging demonstrates abnormal fatty infiltration of the right ventricular myocardium and can show increased right ventricular dimensions as well as wall‐motion abnormalities. Contrast ventricular angiography remains the gold standard to establish the diagnosis but must be performed with appropriate views and with care to avoid ventricular premature beats. Quantitative analysis of right ventricular dimensions can be performed in selected centers. Three‐dimensional echocardiography is a promising approach to evaluate right ventricular wall‐motion abnormalities as well as to demonstrate enlargement. The etiology and pathogenesis of this condition is not clear. A familial incidence has been well‐documented in certain areas and an abnormal gene has been identified. Sporadic cases are the most common. In contrast to Uhl's anomaly, characterized pathologically by areas of paper thin myocardium, the right ventricular free wall is minimally decreased in thickness. Histologically there appears to be a replacement of musculature by fatty tissue. Medical therapy with sotalol or amiodarone, or combination therapy (Class Ic drugs plus beta‐blocking drugs, or amiodarone plus beta‐blocking drugs) is frequently effective in preventing recurrent ventricular tachycardia. Ablation using radiofrequency (RF) or direct current (DC) energy is reserved for patients who are unresponsive or intolerant of antiarrhythmic drugs. Ventricular arrhythmia recurrence of different morphology is not uncommon after apparent successful ablation. There appears to be a lower rate of successful ablation using RF energy. However, patients with this condition who have been resuscitated from sudden cardiac death or those refractory to medical treatment are candidates for ablation, implantation of an automatic cardioverter defibrillator, or cardiac transplantation. Surgery consisting of total disconnection of the right ventricle is a promising therapeutic modality. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

The last 4 h of storage were characterized by 1) absence of high-energy phosphates, 2) increased sodium influx rate and sodium accumulation, 3) increased Na+/H2O ratio, indicating an enhanced efflux of intracellular components, 4) preserved membrane selectivity for the extracellular markers Dy(TTHA)3- and Co(CN)6/3-, and 5) deterioration of hemodynamic function: left ventricular pressure of 75 and 40% and initiation of activity after 8 and 26 min for 8 and 12 h of ischemia, respectively. These data indicate that changes in membrane selectivity and permeability occur during hypothermic ischemia and are associated in time with depletion of energy stores and deterioration of functional recovery.

As a tissue it represents the greatest reservoir of carotenoids in the body. Halogenated hydrocarbons may be measured in concentrations of hundreds-fold greater than those in blood of the same individuals. The composition of adipose tissue also reflects the long-term dietary intakes of a number of essential fatty acids. The turnover times of all of these substances in adipose tissue remain under-researched. Sampling and storage of adipose tissue, homogeneity of sampling sites, turnover times, and the effects of diet, age, gender, race, hormones, and disease on adipose tissue composition are discussed in this review of current knowledge about adipose tissue stability.

The aim of the present study was to establish the mechanisms involved in this IL-1 effect and thereby assess its importance in BM pathophysiology. Direct morphological observation showed that indi-vidual adipocytes lost their fat in the presence of IL-1β and regained it when the cytokine was withdrawn. These morphological observations were supported by metabolic studies using [14]acetate as a precursor of storage fat. These metabolic studies showed that IL-1β inhibited the incorporation of label into triglycerides. In addition, the cytokine enhanced the release of radioactivity from prelabelled adipocytes and reduced their triglyceride stores. It was therefore concluded that IL-1β can both inhibit lipogenesis and stimulate lipolysis in BM adipocytes. Forskolin (an adenylate cyclase activator) produced lipolytic effects similar to those of IL-1β, while indomethacin (an inhibitor of prostaglandin [PG] production) fully blocked the release of radioactivity induced by IL-1β and greatly increased triglyceride synthesis. However, IL-1β was still able to decrease triglyceride synthesis in the presence of indomethacin. These results indicate that a prostaglandin-dependent increase in cAMP is important in the lipolytic effects of IL-1β but that the anti-lipogenic effects of the cytokine are, at least in part, independent of PG synthesis. These observations suggest that local production of IL-1β has a potential role in regulating BM storage fat metabolism in a way that would contribute to the energy required for the marrow's ability to expand its haemato-poietic capacity. © 1995 Academic Press, Inc.","Adipocytes; Il-1β; Lipid metabolism; Marrow; Prostaglandins","acetic acid; adenylate cyclase; carbon 14; forskolin; indometacin; interleukin 1beta; prostaglandin; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; article; bone marrow cell; cell structure; controlled study; human; human cell; isotope labeling; lipogenesis; lipolysis; normal human; pathophysiology; priority journal; stroma cell; Acetates; Adenylate Cyclase; Adipose Tissue; Bone Marrow Cells; Cells, Cultured; Dinoprostone; Forskolin; Hematopoiesis; Human; Indomethacin; Interleukin-1; Lipids; Lipolysis; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029019315

The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in energy production and substrate oxidation rates in a group of 26 nonanorectic severely malnourished cirrhotic patients in stable clinical condition after 1 month of an oral diet. Child-Pugh score, nutritional status, energy expenditure, rates of nutrient oxidation, and plasma levels of intermediary metabolites in the postabsorptive phase were assessed before and after 1 month of oral nutrition. Upon entry onto the study, caloric and protein intakes were 40.1 ± 2.0 kcal/kg and 1.44 ± 0.8 g/kg, respectively. The Child-Pugh score did not change during the study, whereas nutritional status improved as shown by increased muscular midarm circumference, ([MMAC] P < .02), height-creatinine index (P < .05), triceps skinfold thickness ([TST] P < .01), and fat mass (P < .001). Inflammatory state improved during the study, as shown by the decrease of C-reactive protein ([CRP] P < .01) and orosomucoid (P < .001). The ratio of caloric intake to resting energy expenditure (REE) increased (1.53 ± 0.06 v 1.66 ± 0.07, P < .05), as well as the rates of glucose oxidation ([Gox] 73.6 ± 9.9 v 128.1 ± 10.3 mg/min, P < .001) and urine nitrogen excretion (6.69 ± 0.47 v 7.96 ± 0.48 g/d, P < .02). On the other hand, the rate of lipid oxidation (Lox) decreased (67.3 ± 3.9 v 47.3 ± 4.9 mg/min, P < .001) and was correlated with the decrease of free fatty acid (FFA) levels (P < .05). These results show that a regular oral diet may improve nutritional status in malnourished cirrhotic patients, provided caloric intake is well adapted to energy requirements. Improvement of nutritional status is related to the change in energy metabolism, showing a normalization of carbohydrate storage while mobilization of fat stores is reduced. © 1995.",,"3 hydroxybutyric acid; acetoacetic acid; c reactive protein; creatinine; fatty acid; glucose; glycerol; lactic acid; lipid; nitrogen; orosomucoid; adult; aged; article; caloric intake; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diet therapy; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; female; glucose oxidation; human; lipid oxidation; liver cirrhosis; male; malnutrition; morphometrics; nitrogen urine level; nutrient; nutritional status; priority journal; protein intake; scoring system; Adult; Aged; Anthropometry; Blood Chemical Analysis; Diet; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Feces; Female; Humans; Lipids; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Aged; Nitrogen; Nutrition Disorders; Oxidation-Reduction; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029018382

To measure the molecular mobility of amorphous pharmaceutical solids below their glass transition temperatures (Tg), using indomethacin, poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and sucrose as model compounds. Methods. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to measure enthalpic relaxation of the amorphous samples after storage at temperatures 16-47 K below Tg for various time periods. The measured enthalpy changes were used to calculate molecular relaxation time parameters. Analogous changes in specimen dimensions were measured for PVP films using thermomechanical analysis. Results. For all the model materials it was necessary to cool to at least 50 K below the experimental Tg before the molecular motions detected by DSC could be considered to be negligible over the lifetime of a typical pharmaceutical product. In each case the temperature dependence of the molecular motions below Tg was less than that typically reported above Tg and was rapidly changing. Conclusions. In the temperature range studied the model amorphous solids were in a transition zone between regions of very high molecular mobility above Tg and very low molecular mobility much further below Tg. In general glassy pharmaceutical solids should be expected to experience significant molecular mobility at temperatures up to fifty degrees below their glass transition temperature. © 1995, Plenum Publishing Corporation.

Daily EE was estimated by the Tritrac, a 3-d physical activity log (PAL), and a 7-d recall (SDR). Digital storage of activity data by the Tritrac allowed us to tabulate the number of minutes the monitor recorded EE at specific activity intensities. Twenty-five men and women (mean age and body mass 26.7 yr, 72.5 kg) wore the monitor for 7 d. The Tritrac significantly underestimated daily EE compared with the PAL and SDR, 2552.7 vs 2915.5 kcal-d−1 and 2530.0 vs 2840.3 kcal•d−1, respectively (both, P &lt; 0.01). Correlations between the Tritrac and PAL and the SDR were r = 0.82 and r = 0.77 (both, P &lt; 0.001). Compared with the PAL, the Tritrac overestimated time accumulated in sedentary activities (862.7 vs 827.2 min-d−1) but underestimated time accumulated in active behaviors (37.5 vs 78.0 min-d−1).

Examination of the central nervous system revealed severe destruction of the basal ganglia and dentate nucleus, with considerable iron deposition in neuronal and glial cells, whereas the cerebral cortex showed mild iron deposition in glial cells without neuronal involvement. An electron microscopic study with energy‐dispersive x‐ray analysis showed iron depositions in the hepatocytes, of both the neural and glial cells of the brain.

Whether smoking is at the origin of central adiposity and its related metabolic disturbances is unclear. Moreover, it is controversial whether smoking influences fuel metabolism. Therefore, young healthy male volunteers smoking more than 10 cigarettes/day for more than 5 yr (n = 14) were compared with nonsmokers (n = 13) matched for age, sex, body mass index, alcohol consumption, physical activity, as well as family history for hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and coronary heart disease. After an overnight fast, blood was drawn for chemistry, body composition was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and fuel metabolism was determined by indirect calorimetry. Nicotine uptake was estimated by 24-h urinary excretion of cotinine. Lean and fat body mass as well as their respective segmental distribution (i.e. arms, trunk, legs, and head), total bone mineral content, resting energy expenditure, and fat, carbohydrate, and protein oxidation were similar between smokers and nonsmokers. In contrast, 24-h urinary cotinine excretion (72.0 ± 11.4 vs. 0.8 ± 0.2 mumol/L.24 h; P < 0.001), plasma glucose (4.62 ± 0.09 vs. 4.25 ± 0.1 mmol/L; P < 0.01), total cholesterol (4.87 ± 0.15 vs. 4.27 ± 0.16 mmol/L; P < 0.02), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.05 ± 0.19 vs. 2.43 ± 0.16 mmol/L; P < 0.02), and apolipoprotein B concentrations (1.09 ± 0.11 vs. 0.83 ± 0.03 mmol/L; P < 0.03) were all higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. In smokers, 24-h urinary cotinine excretion positively correlated with the waist to hip ratio (r = 0.58; P = 0.03) and negatively with hip circumference (r = 0.87; P < 0.001). Moreover, 24-h cotinine excretion positively correlated with fat oxidation (r = 0.57; P = 0.03), but was independent of the other metabolic parameters studied. These results suggest that the dyslipidemia and glucose intolerance observed in smokers are not related to either central obesity or the amount of nicotine inhaled, but, rather, are due to some other component in cigarette smoke. In contrast, in smokers, fat oxidation increases with increasing nicotine uptake, a fact that might account for the often observed weight gain after cessation of smoking, thus suggesting different mechanisms of action of tobacco consumption on cholesterol and glucose metabolism on one side and fat oxidation on the other. © 1995 by The Endocrine Society.",,"cotinine; adult; article; basal metabolic rate; body fat; bone mineral; cigarette smoking; disease predisposition; energy expenditure; fatty acid oxidation; glucose metabolism; human; human experiment; lipid storage; male; normal human; obesity; priority journal; risk factor; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Apolipoprotein A-I; Apolipoproteins B; Blood Glucose; Body Composition; Carboxyhemoglobin; Cholesterol; Cohort Studies; Comparative Study; Cotinine; Diet; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Human; Insulin; Lipoproteins, HDL Cholesterol; Lipoproteins, LDL Cholesterol; Male; Smoking; Triglycerides; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029007005

No intraspecific difference was found in glycogen content in comparisons between late spring and winter, which roughly correspond to minimum and maximum gonadic development. No evident correlation with body size was detected within each species in both seasons. When comparing the glycogen content of fed specimens of the two species, a significant difference emerged, as concentrations in the foot of P. rustica were, on average, higher than those of P. caerulea in both seasons. When limpets were exposed to increasing periods of starvation (10-30 days) under controlled laboratory conditions, a marked difference between the two species emerged: P. rustica did not show any consistent variation in glycogen level, even after 30 days of starvation, whereas in P. caerulea, glycogen content declined exponentially as starvation proceeded. These findings agree with previous observations on the ecology and behaviour of the two species in the same area: the high shore P. rustica, which is naturally exposed to prolonged periods of starvation on account of the dependence of its foraging activity upon unpredictable and often infrequent favourable conditions (usually during rough sea), is able to store glycogen at greater concentrations, and has an efficient mechanism for saving energy during starvation. The low shore P. caerulea, which usually has a more regular foraging regime (being active at high tide on most days), stores glycogen at lower concentrations and shows a lower capacity to reduce energy losses when starved. © 1995.","Carbohydrate metabolism; Foraging behaviour; Glycogen content; Intertidal ecophysiology; Limpets; Patella; Prosobranch molluscs; Starvation","glycogen; animal experiment; article; caloric restriction; carbohydrate metabolism; controlled study; food intake; mollusc; nonhuman; priority journal; Patella caerulea; Patella rustica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029005729

In a more detailed analysis of bioenergy strategies, two main effects have to be investigated: on the one hand, carbon in fossil fuels is substituted and thus not emitted to the atmosphere, while on the other hand, the use of biofuels might result in a reduction of carbon stored in the biosphere (plants, litter and soil). One of the possibilities to use biomass for energy is to burn logging residues from conventional forestry for heat and/or power production. For this type of bioenergy strategy, a model has been developed which allows one to calculate the change in carbon storage in three soil carbon pools and the carbon fluxes to and from these pools. The model results indicate that the carbon stored in the forest soil is reduced when logging residues are removed for bioenergy to displace fossil fuels. However, this effect is limited, as eventually a new equilibrium of carbon storage in the forest soil is reached, while fossil fuel substitution is continued further on. The time-dependent characteristic value 'carbon neutrality' (CN), which is the ratio of net emission reduction (fossil fuel substitution minus carbon losses of the soil) to the 'saved' carbon emissions from the substituted reference energy system, reflects this effect. CN equal to one means that bioenergy is completely 'CO2-neutral'. For bioenergy from logging residues, CN is very low at the beginning when bioenergy is introduced, increases continuously and approaches one at infinity. According to the results of parameter studies, CN of bioenergy from logging residues in temperate and boreal forests lies between 0.49 and 0.82 after 20 years and between 0.75 and 0.88 after 100 years. © 1995.","bioenergy; biomass; carbon balance; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; energy; forestry; Logging residues; soil","alternative energy; biomass energy; carbon balance; energy potential; logging residue",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028994370

These include exergy, the useful work content of energy, which measures distance from thermodynamic ground; emergy, which increases in proportion to the number of steps energy has taken away from its point of input to a system; power, which is work per unit time, and can be measured as the total energy flow in an ecosystem; ascendency, which combines a mutual information measure of the distribution of flows in a system network with the total flow; and indirect effects, which concern relationships at a distance in energy networks. S.E. Jørgensen recently obtained high correlations between exergy, emergy, ascendency, and the ratio of indirect to direct effects, in a set of ecosystem models. These results suggest that these optimality criteria may be formally related. This paper shows, for systems at macroscopic steady states, that they are. Exergy, emergy, power, ascendency, and indirect effects all have common origins in the path structure and associated microscopic dynamics of energy and matter flows and storages in ecosystem networks. Thus, these organizational measures, originally derived from different perspectives on ecosystems, are in fact related through a common basis. © 1995.","Ascendency; Emergy; Exergy; Indirect effects; Networks; Power","ascendency; ecological extremal principle; emergy; exergy; power; self-organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028992903

Good genes models of female choice propose that these ornaments serve as indicators of the bearer's heritable ability to resist parasites, maximize fat deposition or attain greater age. Aesthetic models propose no such ability of ornaments to indicate these correlates of fitness. These models were tested by (1) determining the male characters assessed by captive females, using artificial and live males in mate-choice trials, and (2) examining the correlates of ornamentation in wild-caught males. Females preferred males with longer snoods and wider skullcaps. These traits were negatively correlated with coccidian oocyst loads in the faeces of wild-caught males.

Component costs appropriate to the year 2000-2010 time frame are assumed throughout. For low insolation conditions (160 W m-2 mean annual solar radiation), photovoltaic electricity could cost 5-13 cents/kWh by year 2000-2010, while for high insolation conditions (260 W m-2) the cost could be 4-9 cents/kWh. Advanced fossil fuel-based power generation should achieve efficiencies of 50% using coal and 55% using natural gas. Carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced by a factor of 2 to 3 compared to conventional coal-based electricity production in industrialized countries. In a solar-fossil fuel hybrid, some electricity would be supplied from solar energy whenever the sun is shining and remaining demand satisfied by fossil fuels. This increases total capital costs but saves on fuel costs. For low insolation conditions, the costs of electricity increases by 0-2 cents/kWh, while the cost of electricity decreases in many cases for high insolation conditions. Solar energy would provide 20% or 30% of electricity demand for the low and high insolation cases, respectively. In the solar-hydrogen energy system, some photovoltaic arrays would provide current electricity demand while others would be used to produce hydrogen electrolytically for storage and later use in fuel cells to generate electricity. Electricity costs from the solar-hydrogen system are 0.2-5.4 cents/kWh greater than from a natural gas power plant, and 1.0-4.5 cents/kWh greater than from coal plant for the cost and performance assumptions adopted here. The carbon tax required to make the solar-hydrogen system competitive with fossil fuels ranges from $70-660/tonne, depending on the cost and performance of system components and the future price of fossil fuels. Leakage of hydrogen from storage into the atmosphere, and the eventual transport of a portion of the leaked hydrogen to the stratosphere, would result in the formation of stratospheric water vapor. This could perturb stratospheric ozone amounts and contribute to global warming. Order-of-magnitude calculations indicate that, for a leakage rate of 0.5% yr-1 of total hydrogen production -which might be characteristic of underground hydrogen storage - the global warming effect of solarhydrogen electricity generation is comparable to that of a natural gas-solar energy hybrid system after one year of emission, but is on the order of 1% the impact of the hybrid system at a 100 year time scale. Impacts on stratospheric ozone are likely to be minuscule. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

However, because muscle efficiency and elastic storage have proven difficult variables to measure, it is not known which of these strategies is actually used. By comparison of mechanical power measurements based on gas exchange with simultaneously measured flight kinematics in Drosophila, a method was developed for determining both the mechanical efficiency and the minimum degree of elastic storage within the flight motor. Muscle efficiency values of 10 percent suggest that insects may minimize energy use in flight by employing an elastic flight motor rather than by using extraordinarily efficient muscles.

Numbers of viable aerobic heterotrophic bacteria were determined by plate counts and metabolic activities were determined by [14C]glucose radiorespirometry at t = 0 and at various post-sampling time points up to 154 d in order to assess the influence of sample storage on microbiological properties of subsurface samples. Increases in post-sampling populations of viable bacteria were observed in all samples, although the magnitude of the increase and time after sampling at which the maximum population size was reached varied with the sample type.

To preserve homeostasis, most of the glucose and fat absorbed must be stored to be mobilized later at rates appropriate to bring about the oxidation of a fuel mix matching on average the macronutrient distribution in the diet. The body's glycogen stores are so small that regulatory mechanisms capable of efficiently adjusting carbohydrate oxidation to carbohydrate intake have developed through evolution. Fat oxidation is regulated primarily by events pertaining to the body's carbohydrate economy, rather than by fat intake. Adjustment of fat oxidation to intake occurs because cumulative errors in the fat balance lead over time to changes in adipose tissue mass, which can substantially alter free fatty acid concentration, insulin sensitivity, and fat oxidation. Fat intake and habitual glycogen concentrations are important in determining how fat one has to be to oxidize as much fat as one eats.","body fat content; Dietary carbohydrate; dietary fat; exercise; glycogen; macronutrient balance; obesity; respiratory quotient; weight maintenance","adenosine triphosphate; albumin; amino acid; carbohydrate; cholesterol; chylomicron; fat; fatty acid; glucose; glucose polymer; glycerol; glycogen; insulin; lactic acid; lipoprotein; lipoprotein lipase; margarine; monosaccharide; phosphorylase; starch; sugar; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; water; adipose tissue; body composition; carbohydrate diet; carbohydrate metabolism; conference paper; energy; energy expenditure; gluconeogenesis; glucose transport; human; insulin sensitivity; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; liver; muscle; nonhuman; obesity; oxidation; palatability; physical activity; respiratory quotient; starvation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028948266

Currently, the liver, pancreas, and kidney can be successfully preserved for up to two days by flushing the organs with the University of Wisconsin (UW) organ preservation solution and storing them at hypothermia (0-5°C). The UW solution is effective because it uses a number of cell impermeant agents (lactobionic acid, raffinose, hydroxyethyl starch) that prevent the cells from swelling during cold ischemic storage. Additionally, the UW solution contains glutathione and adenosine, agents that may stimulate recovery of normal metabolism upon reperfusion by augmenting the antioxidant capacity of the organs (glutathione) or by stimulating high-energy phosphate generation (adenosine) upon reperfusion. Although this method of organ preservation is effective, some organs (5-15% of livers and 20-30% of kidneys) do not function well upon transplant. Injury may be preservation related but may also result from donor and recipient factors that render the organs more susceptible to preservation damage. Results with continuous perfusion of kidneys in the clinics show a reduction in preservation/reperfusion damage. This may be a more appropriate preservation method than cold storage. In this chapter we discuss the development and use of the UW solution and present clinical results.

Despite its long history in commerce, the biological mechanisms accounting for the production of sugar are rather recent discoveries. The reactions are remarkable. Sugar is produced by all green plants and photosynthetic bacteria in a reaction sequence capable of forming carbon-carbon bonds. The very first steps occur independently of solar energy input, but to sustain the reaction, the products of initial fixation are phosphorylated and undergo a reduction in oxidation state. These steps responsible for phosphorylation and reduction are driven by products generated in the chloroplast upon the absorption of light. At this point, after just a few reactions, the products of photosynthesis have already acquired the attributes characteristic of sugars. Once carbon is stabilized as simple sugars in the chloroplast, the products undergo a sequence of rearrangements to sustain a cycle leading to new carbon dioxide acceptor molecules, and with each turn of the cycle a new carbon atom is introduced into the pool. As the process continues some of the carbon is diverted to synthesize starch within the chloroplast. Sucrose is synthesized in the cytoplasm adjacent to the chloroplast from exported carbohydrate as a diversion from the formation of starch. Sucrose represents the principal transport substance in most plants. Storage starch, cellulose, and other complex cell wall polysaccharides are typically derived from the sugar monomers found in sucrose.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were allowed free access to one of three diets: a control diet containing 5% of energy as fat or one of two experimental diets that contained 30% triglyceride (by energy). The source of the triglyceride in the two experimental groups was either 100% LCT or 95% triacetin + 5% LCT. Within the experimental groups receiving 30% fat, the source of dietary triglyceride (LCT vs. triacetin) did not affect total energy consumption. There were no significant differences in body weight at the onset of the study; however, animals fed 100% LCT weighed significantly more than the other two groups at the end of the study. In all three fat pads studied, animals fed triacetin had significantly lower pad mass than did animals fed LCT. Mean fat cell size was smaller in fat depots of animals fed short-chain triglyceride. Provision of dietary energy as the short-chain triglyceride triacetin in lieu of LCT resulted in lower weight gain and fat deposition.

Three experiments investigated the relationships between food intake, metabolism, and body composition in this model. In vivo measurement of lipogenesis confirmed that loss of fat is associated with decreased fat deposition. When partners of overfed rats were compared with food-restricted single rats, proportional changes in body composition and metabolism were similar for the two treatments, although there was no significant change in the food intake of parabiotic rats, whereas restricted rats received only 60% of the intake of their controls. The final experiment demonstrated that changes in body composition of partners of overfed rats were independent of dietary composition. These results suggest that, when a rat is made obese by overfeeding, a circulatory factor is released that inhibits fat deposition and disrupts regulatory mechanisms that normally stimulate food intake during a period of negative energy balance.","body fat; lipogenesis; parabiosis","animal experiment; article; body composition; energy balance; energy metabolism; female; food intake; lipid storage; lipogenesis; nonhuman; obesity; overnutrition; parabiosis; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028934862

Thus, together these hormones mediate long-term energy balance. This study tested whether the stimulatory action of corticosteroids on food intake was mediated by association with high affinity mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) or lower affinity glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). Young male rats were adrenalectomized (ADX) and given vehicle (control) or streptozotocin (diabetic); subgroups of rats were infused with vehicle, aldosterone (Aldo, an MR agonist in vivo), dexamethasone (Dex, a GR agonist in vivo), or Aldo and Dex for the 5 days after ADX. Sham-ADX rats were included. Food intake, body weight gain, and epididymal white adipose and interscapular brown adipose tissue stores were weighed. ADX decreased food intake by approximately 24%, and food intake was not increased by diabetes as it was in sham-ADX rats. In control ADX rats, Dex, but not Aldo, stimulated insulin, and food intake was not significantly affected by either hormone; together, Aldo and Dex restored insulin and food intake to sham-ADX rats. Food intake in diabetic ADX rats was significantly increased by each treatment (ADX < Aldo < Dex < Aldo and Dex = sham). Aldo increased body weight through an increase in fluid volume (estimated by decreased plasma protein concentration); however, fat stores were not different from ADX. Dex reduced body weight in control rats but maintained fat stores; in diabetic rats, body weight and fat stores were less than or similar to ADX. We conclude that: 1) corticosteroids, acting through association with both MRs and GRs, stimulate food intake; 2) insulin counteracts the GR-mediated stimulation of food intake in control rats; and 3) Dex and insulin, which is stimulated by Dex, selectively maintain or increase body fat stores, probably at the expense of protein stores. © 1995 by The Endocrine Society.",,"aldosterone; dexamethasone; glucocorticoid; glucocorticoid receptor; insulin; mineralocorticoid; mineralocorticoid receptor; streptozocin; adrenalectomy; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; brown adipose tissue; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; energy balance; energy metabolism; food intake; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; weight gain; white adipose tissue; Non-programmatic; Adipose Tissue; Adrenalectomy; Aldosterone; Analysis of Variance; Animal; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Brown Fat; Comparative Study; Dexamethasone; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Energy Metabolism; Epididymis; Feeding Behavior; Insulin; Male; Organ Weight; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reference Values; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028930636

The quantum yield for the bleaching recovery of PYP, assumed to be identical to that for the phototransformation of PYP (pG), to the red-shifted intermediate, pR, was phi R = 0.35 +/- 0.05, much lower than the value of 0.64 reported in the literature. With this value and the LIOAS data, an energy content for pR of 120 kJ/mol was obtained, approximately 50% lower than for excited pG. Concomitant with the photochemical process, a volume contraction of 14 ml/photoconverted mol was observed, comparable with the contraction (11 ml/mol) determined for the bacteriorhodopsin monomer. The contraction in both cases is interpreted to arise from a protein reorganization around a phototransformed chromophore with a dipole moment different from that of the initial state. The deviations from linearity of the LIOAS data at photon densities > 0.3 photons per molecule are explained by absorption by pG and pR during the laser pulse duration (i.e., a four-level system, pG, pR, and their respective excited states). The data can be fitted either by a simple saturation process or by a photochromic equilibrium between pG and pR, similar to that established between the parent chromoprotein and the first intermediate(s) in other biological photoreceptors. This nonlinearity has important consequences for the interpretation of the data obtained from in vitro studies with powerful lasers. © 1995, The Biophysical Society.

A simulation study of compression of vertebral motion segments to failure was performed. Objectives. The aim of this study was to determine whether damage of the motion segment under axial compression can be predicted when the load is quantified by means of the elastic energy storage it causes in the segment. Summary of Background Data. Although in one-cycle loading, motion segment strength can be described by the relationship between the product of the bone density and cross-sectional area of the vertebrae and the maximum force, no single criterion has been found to describe strength in both one-cycle and cyclic compressional loading protocols. Methods. Input data were derived from in vitro studies by Hansson et al, Keller et al, and by Brinckmann et al. Elastic energy storage at failure was computed using a three-parameter model for a viscoelastic solid with a nonlinear initial response, and related to the product of the bone density and cross-sectional area. Results. The relationship of the product of density and area with the elastic energy appeared to be accurately described by a curvilinear equation. This relationship accounted for 65 -93% of the variance in maximum energy. Generalizability of the relationship from cyclic axial loading to one-cycle axial loading was successfully tested. Conclusion. The results of the present study have shown that one criterion suffices to describe the strength of the motion segment in different compressional loading modes. © 1995, J. B.

Design: Twelve premenopausal women, aged 19-50 years, undergoing adjustable silicone gastric banding (ASGB) for morbid obesity participated at the study. The patients were evaluated twice. The baseline evaluation was performed immediately before surgery. After surgery, a diet specifically developed for patients submitted to gastric restriction (2.5 MJ/day) was given to the patients. The second evaluation was performed 6 months after surgery. Measurements: Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was determined by indirect calorimetry. Total fat area (TFA), visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) were measured by abdominal computed tomography. Fat mass (FM) and fat free mass (FFM) were derived by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Results: At baseline, RMR was positively related to VFA (r = 0.60, P < 0.05). ASGB induced a highly significant weight loss of 24.4 ± 9.0 kg. This weight reduction was mainly due to a loss of FM (68.5 ± 10.8 vs 48.5 ± 9.2 kg, P < 0.001), whereas FFM was only slightly reduced (52.6 ± 4.0 vs 47.9 ± 4.6 kg, P < 0.05). The BMI reduction was positively related to the baseline BMI and FM values (r = 0.61, P < 0.05 and r = 0.55, P < 0.05, respectively). There was no significant correlation between the BMI reduction and the baseline variables of fat distribution, nor between the BMI reduction and the basal RMR. Weight loss was accompanied by modifications of fat distribution. In particular, the reduction of VFA after surgery was strictly related to the VFA values at baseline (r = 0.91, P < 0.001). Weight loss induced a significant reduction of RMR (7.96 r 1.77 vs 6.57 ± 6.90 MJ/day; P < 0.01). The reduction of the RMR observed with weight loss was significantly related to the FFM loss (r = 0.63, P < 0.05), whereas no correlations were found between the changes of RMR and the FM loss. Regarding to fat distribution, the reduction of the RMR was significantly related to the visceral fat loss (r = 0.57, P < 0.05), but not to the modifications of total or subcutaneous fat area. The independent contribution of the modifications of FFM, FM, and visceral fat to the changes of RMR was analyzed by multiple regression analysis. In this model, both FFM and visceral fat changes resulted independently related to the RMR. Conclusions: (1) visceral fat accumulation was a significant predictor of RMR in the very obese woman; (2) visceral obese women lost more visceral fat than subcutaneous ones; (3) the reduction of the RMR observed during weight loss could partly be explained by a reduction of visceral fat mass.","Energy expenditure; Fat distribution; Gastric banding; Visceral obesity; Weight loss","silicone; adult; article; body composition; body mass; calorimetry; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; energy expenditure; female; human; impedance; lipid storage; metabolic rate; morbid obesity; multiple regression; priority journal; subcutaneous fat; viscera; weight reduction; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Anthropometry; Basal Metabolism; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Calorimetry; Electric Impedance; Energy Metabolism; Female; Human; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lipids; Middle Age; Obesity, Morbid; Silicones; Stomach; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Viscera; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028907814

Although it has been known for some time that the size of these depots varies with sex, age, and physiologic state, it has only recently been suggested that adipose tissue partitioning, and therefore energy storage, may vary among ethnic groups. Indicators of ethnicity include race, place of birth, and culture and traditions. The literature describing energy storage in North American Indians, African Americans, Asian Americans, Mexican Americans, and Pacific Islanders is summarized and data are presented from studies comparing African American and Caucasian (Americans of Northern European descent) obese women.

Ferrous iron had an analogous effect on the degradation rate of benzoic acid, a transient metabolite of anaerobic toluene degradation in these cultures, when benzoic acid was used as a sole carbon and energy source. Two hypotheses were proposed to explain iron's effect: (a) Iron may have prevented sulfide toxicity via precipitation of sulfide as FeS, and (b) iron might have been a limiting nutrient required for degradation (i.e., amendments of iron could have compensated for iron removed from solution by precipitation as FeS). To test these hypotheses, substrate degradation rates were compared in the presence of FeSO4 (a sulfate source that both precipitates sulfide species and precludes iron limitation) versus ZnSO4 (a sulfate source that precipitates sulfide species but does not preclude iron limitation) versus MgSO4 (a sulfate source that neither precipitates sulfide nor precludes iron limitation). For both toluene and benzoic acid, FeSO4 and ZnSO4 were comparable in their enhancement of substrate degradation rates and were superior to MgSO4 in that respect. Thus, iron appears to ameliorate sulfide toxicity, not nutritional iron limitation, in these cultures. The observation that ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, a chelating agent capable of retaining iron in solution in the presence of sulfide, did not stimulate the cultures is consistent with this conclusion. The implications of these results for bioremediation of fuel-contaminated aquifers that contain sulfate-reducing bacteria are discussed. © 1995, Springer-Verlag New York Inc.

The patient, a 43-year-old male with increased serum CK, a heavy drinker and smoker, had been affected by generalized epilepsy since age 24, after a cranial injury. He had had a right hemiparesis 2 years before coming to our observation and a transient left hemiparesis the following year. CT and MRI of the brain showed multiple hemispheric lesions consistent with an ischemic process, as suggested by single photon emission tomography of the brain. Muscle biopsy showed a vacuolar myopathy, and myophosphorylase activity was 13% of the normal mean. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) performed on resting calf muscles showed increased PCr to ATP and decreased PCr to Pi ratios. During both aerobic and ischemic exercise 31P-MRS failed to show any cytosolic acidification and phosphomonoesters (PME) accumulation, two MRS findings in agreement with McArdle's syndrome diagnosis. Mitochondrial respiration was also affected as shown by a low PCr to Pi ratio at rest and by a low rate of PCr re-synthesis during recovery from aerobic exercise. This latter finding in McArdle's disease can be explained by decreased mitochondrial substrate availability, which in turn can contribute to the phenotypic manifestations of the disease. © 1995.","Encephalomalacia; Energy metabolism; Glycogen storage disease, type V; Glycolysis; McArdle's disease; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","adult; article; brain disease; case report; energy metabolism; glycogen storage disease; glycogen storage disease type 5; human; human tissue; male; mitochondrial respiration; muscle biopsy; nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; Adult; Aerobiosis; Brain Diseases; Case Report; DNA; Electrocardiography; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Glycogen; Human; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lactates; Lactic Acid; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mitochondria, Muscle; Muscles; Phosphorylases; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028888573

The land‐atmosphere system is substantially simplified and formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations that, with the addition of random noise, are suitable for analysis in the form of the multivariate Îto equation. The model treats the soil layer and the near‐surface atmosphere as reservoirs with storage capacities for heat and water. The transfers between these reservoirs are regulated by four states: soil saturation, soil temperature, air specific humidity, and air potential temperature. The atmospheric reservoir is treated as a turbulently mixed boundary layer of fixed depth. Heat and moisture advection, precipitation, and layer‐top air entrainment are parameterized. The system is forced externally by solar radiation and the lateral advection of air and water mass. The remaining energy and water mass exchanges are expressed in terms of the state variables. The model development and equilibrium solutions are presented. Although comparisons between observed data and steady state model results re inexact, the model appears to do a reasonable job of partitioning net radiation into sensible and latent heat flux in appropriate proportions for bare‐soil midlatitude summer conditions. Subsequent work will introduce randomness into the forcing terms to investigate the effect of water‐energy coupling and land‐atmosphere interaction on variability and persistence in the climatic system.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen radiologists read three sets of images from 44 patients: original computed radiographic images only, original computed radiographic images plus conventional bone-subtracted images, and original computed radiographic images plus iterative noise-reduced bone-subtracted images. Twenty-two patients had one or more (maximum, five) pulmonary nodules; 22 had no pulmonary nodules. Observer performance was evaluated by means of calculation of the average area under the alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic curves (A1). RESULTS: Compared with the original computed radiographic image only, detection of nodules was significantly better with both the original computed radiographic image plus iterative bone-subtracted image (A1 = 0.72 ± 0.02 and 0.66 ± 0.02, respectively; P = .01) and the original computed radiographic image plus conventional bone-subtracted image (A1 = 0.66 ± 0.02 and 0.61 ± 0.01, respectively; P = .03). CONCLUSION: The iterative noise-reduction algorithm is superior to conventional methods in detection of pulmonary nodules.","Lung, nodule; Radiography, computer-assisted; Radiography, digital; Radiography, storage phosphor; Subtraction, dual-energy","absorptiometry; adult; aged; algorithm; article; clinical article; clinical examination; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; female; human; image quality; image subtraction; lung nodule; male; noise reduction; priority journal; thorax radiography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028873150

The core melting point of the LDL determined with differential scanning calorimetry was 31.1°C. We have demonstrated that temperature exerts a clear effect in the Cu2+-mediated LDL oxidation, with a strong decrease in lag time and a notable increase in the rate of propagation. This temperature dependence of lag time and rate of propagation fully obeys the Arrhenius law, suggesting that the core melting point of the LDL has no or only a minor effect on these oxidation indices. The Arrhenius plot s of the binding of Cu2+ to LDL, measured by K, gave two breaks suggesting that this value is affected by the core transition of the LDL as well as by structural changes at around 15°C. The mean activation energy during rate of initiation was 13.5 kcal/mol and tended to decrease with increasing Cu2+ concentration. The activation energy in the propagation phase was 10.6 kcal/mol and was independent of Cu2+ concentration. In this work we have also shown that the CD method can be conducted with high reproducibility and that a sucrose-supplemented plasma frozen at -80°C can be used as a source of LDL with all unvarying vitamin E content and reproducible oxidation properties.","activation energy; conjugated dienes; copper binding sites; copper oxidation kinetics; lag phase; LDL storage; temperature","low density lipoprotein; article; atherosclerosis; binding site; cell membrane resistance; chemical modification; differential scanning calorimetry; human; human cell; kinetics; lipid peroxidation; oxidation; priority journal; protein content; protein denaturation; protein folding; reproducibility; temperature sensitivity; Blood Preservation; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Copper; Energy Metabolism; Human; Kinetics; Lipoproteins, LDL; Oxidation-Reduction; Regression Analysis; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028871630

ATPase activity was inhibited by nitrate and bafilomycin A1 but was insensitive to vanadate and azide. PPase hydrolytic activity was inhibited by NaF but was insensitive to nitrate, bafilomycin A1 vanadate and azide. Kimetic studies of PPase activity gave an apparent Km, for PP3 of 18 μM. Identical distributions of bafilomycin‐ and NO3‐sensitive ATPase activities within continuous sucrose density gradients, confirmed that bafilomycin‐sensitive ATPase activity is a suitable marker for the tonoplast. By comparing the distribution of bafilomycin‐sensitive ATPase activity with that of PPase activity, it was possible to locate the PPase enzyme exclusively at the tonoplast. The apparent density of the tonoplast did not change during fruit development. Measurements of tonoplast PPase and ATPase activities during fruit development over a 35‐day period revealed an 80% reduction in PPase specific activity and a small decrease in ATPase specific activity. ATP‐ and PP1‐dependent ΔpH generation was measured by the quenching of quinacrine fluorescence in tonoplast vesicles prepared on a discontinuous Dextran gradient. No H+ efflux was detected on the addition of sucrose to energized vesicles. Therefore a H+/sucrose antiport may not be the mechanism of sucrose uptake at the tomato fruit tonoplast. Similar results were obtained with glucose, fructose and sorbitol. The lack of ATP (or PP1) stimulation of [14C]‐sucrose uptake also suggested that an antiport was not involved. Initial uptake rates of radiolabelled glucose and fructose were almost double that for sucrose. The inhibition of hexose uptake by p‐chloromercuribenzene sulphonate (PCMBS) implicated the involvement of a carrier. Therefore storage of hexose in the tomato fruit vacuole and maintenance of a downhill sucrose concentration gradient into sink cells is likely to be regulated by the activity of sucrose metabolizing enzymes, rather than by energy‐requiring uptake mechanisms at the tonoplast.

The overall effect of these intermittent and extended effects on the balance between energy expenditure and food intake regulation can best be judged by the impact of exercise on the fat mass. Expansion of the adipose tissue mass promotes fat oxidation more than glucose oxidation, but excessive fat accumulation is often necessary to reach the state where fat oxidation becomes commensurate with fat intake. Since the steady-state of weight maintenance is achieved with less body fat in physically active individuals, exercise is a substitute for an enlarged fat mass in bringing about rates of fat oxidation commensurate with fat intake. The increases in energy expenditure induced by expansion of the adipose tissue mass or by physical activity are quantitatively very different. The fact that they are substitutes for each other in relation to body weight maintenance indicates that the critical issue, under conditions where food availability is not a limiting factor, is not overall energy turnover. It appears therefore that it is the effect of exercise on the 24-h RQ that allows the organism to operate with an average RQ as low as the diet's FQ in the presence of less body fat. This also explains why the diet's carbohydrate-to-fat ratio can be an important parameter in shaping the interactions between physical activity and body weight maintenance.","Body fat content; Dietary fat; Energy expenditure; Energy intake; Exercise; Food palatability/diversity/availability; Food quotient (FQ); Habitual glycogen levels; Obesity; Respiratory quotient (RQ); Substrate balances","glycogen; adipose tissue; body fat; body weight; caloric intake; conference paper; energy balance; energy expenditure; exercise; fat intake; food intake; glucose oxidation; human; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; metabolism; palatability; priority journal; respiratory quotient; Animal; Body Composition; Body Weight; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Human; Mice; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028866280

In Siberian hamsters, body weight and fat, and food intake peak in long, summer-like days and reach nadirs in short, winter-like days. The purpose of the present experiments was to test whether metabolic challenges that increase food intake in laboratory rats also increase feeding in Siberian hamsters. Specifically, we asked the questions: (a) Is food intake increased following a fast?; (b) Is food intake increased following treatments that block metabolic fuel utilization, such as the glucose utilization blocker 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2 DG), or that enhance storage of metabolic fuels such as short acting insulin (regular insulin)?; (c) Does the combination of food deprivation and decreased metabolic fuel utilization increase food intake?; and (d) Does the photoperiod affect the feeding and physiological responses to metabolic challenges? Food intake was measured in response to fasting, insulin or 2 DG treatment in adult female Siberian hamsters housed in long photoperiods. Following exposure to a short photoperiod, these hamsters were tested for their response to insulin and 2 DG, but not to fasting. Food intake did not increase following fasts of 12, 24, or 48 h. Food intake was increased in long day-housed hamsters given the lowest dose of 2 DG tested (125 mg/kg) 2, 4, and 6 h after treatment, but not in short days nor in long days with larger doses of the 2 DG. Similarly, food intake was increased by treatment with regular insulin in long days, but not short days. The most effective dose of insulin to stimulate food intake was 50 U/kg body weight. Combining fasts in long days with insulin or 2 DG treatment did not increase food intake. Instead the stimulatory effects of these treatments on food intake were negated. Finally, although insulin decreased plasma glucose and gastric contents in both photoperiods, it did so to greater relative degrees in long than in short days. Collectively, these data compliment our previous report that the effectiveness of some satiety peptides (i.e., cholecystokinin and bombesin) also are photoperiod dependent. These data suggest that the physiological and behavioral systems underlying these treatments that stimulate or inhibit food intake exhibit complementary responses to the naturally occurring, photoperiod-induced seasonal cycle of energy intake in Siberian hamsters. © 1994.","2-Deoxy-d-glucose; Body weight; Energy balance; Feeding; Glucoprivation; Insulin","deoxyglucose; insulin; adolescent; animal experiment; article; caloric restriction; controlled study; female; hamster; intraperitoneal drug administration; nonhuman; photoperiodicity; priority journal; Animal; Body Weight; Circadian Rhythm; Deoxyglucose; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food Deprivation; Hamsters; Insulin; Phodopus; Photoperiod; Species Specificity; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028859965

Floradade) fruit at 13–14 and 23–25 days after anthesis (DAA). These developmental stages are characterized by phloem-imported sugars being accumulated as starch and hexose, respectively. The symplasmic tracer, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, loaded into the storage parenchyma cells of pericarp discs, moved readily in the younger fruit but was immobile in fruit at 23–25 DAA. Symplasmic mobility of [14C]glucose was found to be identical to 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. For the older fruit, the pericarp apoplasm was shown to be freely permeable to the apoplasmic tracer, trisodium 3-hydroxy-5,8,10-pyrenetrisulfonate. Indeed, the transport capacity of the pericarp apoplasm was such that the steady-state rate of in-vitro glucose uptake by pericarp discs accounted fully for the estimated rate of in-vivo glucose accumulation. For fruit at 23–25 DAA, the inhibitory effects of the sulfhydryl group modifier, p-chloromer-curibenzenesulfonic acid (PCMBS), on [14C]glucose and [14C]fructose uptake by the pericarp discs depended on the osmolality of the external solution. The inhibition was most pronounced for pericarp discs enriched in storage parenchyma. Consistent with the PCMBS study, strong fluorescent signals were exhibited by the storage parenchyma cells of pericarp discs exposed to the membrane-impermeable thiol-binding fluorochrome, mono-bromotrimethylammoniobimane. The fluorescent weak acid, sulphorhodamine G, was accumulated preferentially by the storage parenchyma cells. Accumulation of sulphorhodamine G was halted by the ATPase inhibitor erythrosin B, suggesting the presence of a plasma-membrane-bound H+-ATPase. A linkage between the putative H+-ATPase activity and hexose transport was demonstrated by an erythrosin-B inhibition of [14C]glucose and [14C]fructose uptake. In contrast, comparable evidence for an energy-coupled hexose porter could not be found in the pericarp of younger fruit at 13–14 DAA. Overall, the data are interpreted to indicate that: (i) The postphloem cellular pathway in the outer fruit pericarp shifts from the symplasm during starch accumulation (13–14 DAA) to the apoplasm for rapid hexose accumulation (23–25 DAA). (ii) An energy-coupled plasma-membrane hexose carrier is expressed specifically in storage parenchyma cells at the latter stage of fruit development. © 1995, Springer-Verlag.

When HepG2 cells were fed serum-free media selectively deficient in each amino acid, the omission of any single classic essential amino acid as well as Arg or His (essential in some rapidly growing cells) resulted in FAS mRNA levels that were about half of those in complete medium. Control message levels were unaffected and omission of nonessential amino acids did not alter FAS expression. FAS mRNA levels peaked 12-16 h after feeding complete and Ser (nonessential)-deficient media but did not increase in cells fed Lys (essential)-deficient medium. With Lys, FAS mRNA increased over the physiologic concentration range of 15-150 μM, and low concentrations of lysine decreased FAS but not apoB protein mass. Transcription inhibitors mimicked treatment with Lys-deficient media, and nuclear run-off assays showed that Lys-deficient media abolished FAS but not apoB transcription. After treatment with Lys-deficient media, the intracellular Lys pool was rapidly depleted in association with an increase of uncharged (deacylated) tRNA(Lys) from < 1 to 64% of available tRNA(Lys). Even in the presence of the essential amino acid His, increasing the levels of uncharged tRNA(His) with histidinol, a competitive inhibitor of the histidinyl-tRNA synthetase, blocked FAS expression. Tyrosinol treatment did not alter FAS mRNA levels. These results suggest that essential amino acids regulate FAS expression by altering uncharged tRNA levels, a novel mechanism for nutrient control of gene expression in mammalian cells.",,"essential amino acid; fatty acid synthase; amino acid metabolism; article; enzyme regulation; enzyme synthesis; gene control; gene expression regulation; human; human cell; priority journal; Amino Acids, Essential; Fatty Acid Synthetase Complex; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Human; RNA, Transfer; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028856273

Interaction with both nucleic acids is mediated through nine C2H2 zinc fingers. In order to determine amino acid regions necessary for nucleic acid interaction, a series of substitution mutants of Xenopus laevis TFIIIA have been constructed and expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. The mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity and analyzed for 5S RNA gene and 5S RNA binding activities using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. All of the mutant TFIIIA proteins retained full 5S RNA binding activity. Substitution of fingers 2, 3, and 4-6 of TFIIIA with zinc finger sequences from other proteins significantly reduced the interaction of the protein with the 5S RNA gene. In contrast, substitution of finger 1 or finger 7 had little effect on the interaction of TFIIIA with the 5S RNA gene. The results of scanning substitution mutagenesis within the first three zinc fingers of TFIIIA suggested that DNA contacts made by the α-helical regions of finger 2 and particularly of finger 3 provide the majority of the free energy of the TFIIIA-DNA interaction. Basic amino acids found at the same position within the a-helices of fingers 2 and 3 of TFIIIA are required for high-affinity DNA binding activity. The identification of amino acid residues critical for the formation of a TFIIIA-DNA complex contributes to our understanding of zinc finger protein-nucleic acid interactions. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

The persistence of anorexia in wasting disorders, therefore, implies a failure of this adaptive feeding response. We describe a model for the normal hypothalamic response to starvation composed of the stimulation of neuronal pathways that promote energy intake and storage coupled with the inhibition of pathways that exert opposing effects. This model provides a framework for investigating disturbances of the normal hypothalamic response to weight loss and suggests a specific mechanism by which cytokines contribute to wasting in acquired immune deficiency syndrome and other cachexic disorders.","acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adipose tissue; body weight; cachexia; corticotropin-releasing hormone; fasting; hypothalamus; neuropeptide Y; weight loss","argipressin; cholecystokinin; corticotropin releasing factor; cytokine; insulin; interleukin 1; neuropeptide Y; adipose tissue; body weight; cachexia; caloric intake; energy expenditure; feedback system; human; hypothalamus; hypothalamus hypophysis system; hypothalamus nucleus; hypothalamus ventromedial nucleus; insulin blood level; priority journal; review; starvation; thalamus midline nucleus; weight reduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028845449

We report the effect of partially treated hypopituitarism and subsequent GH replacement (mean dose, 0.2 IU/kg.week) on putative cardiovascular risk factors in 22 nondiabetic hypopituitary subjects in a 6-month, double blind, controlled study (active/placebo ratio, 11:11). All patients were subsequently treated with GH for a further 6 months. Total fat, percent body fat, and central fat were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. The hypopituitary patients had increased percent fat (P = 0.03) and central fat (P < 0.01) compared with body mass index-matched controls. Before GH treatment, fasting (total) and specific insulin positively correlated with body mass index (P = 0.02 and P < 0.001, respectively), waist/hip ratio (P = 0.05 and P = 0.01), and central fat (P = 0.03 and P = 0.003). Specific insulin and insulin sensitivity (IS), calculated by homeostatic model of assessment, were related to total fat (P < 0.001 and P = 0.02). GH treatment for 6 months led to a reduction in total fat (P < 0.02), percent fat (P = 0.002), central fat (P = 0.012), waist/hip ratio (P < 0.05), total cholesterol (P = 0.03), and apolipoprotein-B (P = 00001), as well as a decrease in the IS from 36.9% (range, 12-100%) to 25% (range, 2.5-55%; P = 0.0002). This was paralleled by a rise in fasting (total) and specific insulin (P = 0.016 and P = 0.002). The degree of correlation among indices of IS, body composition, and fat distribution increased after GH treatment. Fasting plasma glucose rose significantly, but was within the reference range. During 12 months of GH therapy, a significant increase in serum lipoprotein-(a) was observed (P < 0.05). Although GH has beneficial effects on central adiposity and lipid fractions, it is also associated with a decrease in IS; these effects may vary between individuals. © 1995 by The Endocrine Society.",,"glucose; human growth hormone; recombinant growth hormone; adult; article; body composition; cardiovascular disease; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug screening; female; glucose blood level; growth hormone deficiency; hormone substitution; human; hypopituitarism; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; male; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment; subcutaneous drug administration; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Body Composition; Cardiovascular Diseases; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Growth Hormone; Humans; Hypopituitarism; Insulin Resistance; Lipoproteins; Male; Middle Aged; Recombinant Proteins; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028836576

The fall in fasting hyperglycemia induced by weight loss occurs despite a reduction in fasting hyperinsulinemia and appears to involve a more complex mechanism than depletion of hepatic glycogen. Weight loss also improves skeletal muscle insulin resistance by improving glucose transport and glucose storage, with these improvements occurring despite increased lipid oxidation. Weight loss can improve the capacity for insulin secretion in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, but these effects can be difficult to discern because weight loss reduces some of the stimuli for insulin secretion. In all of these parameters, there are data that indicate that relatively brief intervals of negative energy balance achieve a considerable portion of the overall effect of a large weight loss.",,"glucose; insulin; caloric restriction; diabetic obesity; energy balance; glucose homeostasis; glucose transport; human; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; insulin release; insulin resistance; lipid oxidation; metabolic regulation; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; priority journal; review; skeletal muscle; weight reduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028832693

While much is known on stimulus-secretion coupling, very little is understood about how the storage organelles move in the cytoplasm to the luminal plasma membrane and why and how they fuse with it to release the contents. It is assumed that nucleoside phosphatases are involved in these energy consuming processes. Pancreatic zymogen granule membranes contain one major glycoprotein, GP-2, and a few minor proteins all with unknown functions. In order to identify functions we have purified zymogen granule membranes from pig pancreas, solubilized the proteins under non-denaturing conditions with the detergent CHAPS and characterized the extracted proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, histochemistry and lectins. Three major protein bands, often fused in one broad band, revealed enzymatic activity for adenosine-, cytidine-, inositol- and guanidinedi- and triphosphates by the precipitation of liberated phosphate by Pb(NO3)2. This activity was sensitive to known ATP diphosphohydrolase inhibitors. The band with activity arises from a 92 kDa glycoprotein. A different narrow band showed monophosphatase activity for AMP, GMP, IMP and CMP. Some of the activities were inhibited by different lectins, indicating glycosyl groups near the active site. Electron microscopical cytochemistry confirmed a nucleoside phosphatase activity on granule membranes. Our results show for the first time that the nucleoside phosphatase activity of the zymogen granule membranes is carried by a 92 kDa glycoprotein, probably the known self-associating form of GP-2. The hydrolysis of tri- and diphosphate nucleotides could provide the energy required by exocytosis. © 1995.","Electron microscopy; Gel electrophoresis; Lectins GP-2; Nucleoside phosphatase; Pancreas; Zymogen granule membrane","nucleoside diphosphatase; nucleoside phosphotransferase; nucleoside triphosphatase; unclassified drug; zymogen granule; animal tissue; article; cytochemistry; electron microscopy; enzyme activity; exocytosis; gel electrophoresis; hydrolysis; nonhuman; pancreas; protein analysis; protein isolation; swine; Animal; Centrifugation, Density Gradient; Cholic Acids; Cytoplasmic Granules; Detergents; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Enzyme Inhibitors; Enzyme Precursors; Intracellular Membranes; Membrane Proteins; Nucleotidases; Nucleotides; Pancreas; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028825284

Patients suffering trauma and sepsis are insulin resistant, but no studies have specifically been made of patients suffering multiple organ failure. 2. We have studied exogenous glucose utilization in multiple organ failure using a combination of the hyperglycaemic glucose clamp and indirect calorimetry to quantify glucose utilization in multiple organ failure, partitioning it into oxidative and non-oxidative disposal (storage). 3. Fourteen septic patients with multiple organ were studied, APACHE II (Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation Mark II) scores on the day of the study ranged from 11 to 31 (median 16). Twenty percent D-glucose was infused and blood glucose was clamped at 12 mmol/l for 3 h. The results were compared with those obtained on seven healthy control subjects. 4. Glucose utilization and energy expenditure were similar in the two groups for the first 90 min of the clamp, after which glucose utilization and energy expenditure increased steadily in the control subjects but did not change in the patients. Respiratory exchange ratio rose in both groups; considered over the whole of the clamp period, respiratory exchange ratio was slightly lower in the patients than in the control subjects (P < 0.05) but not at any specific time point. Glucose oxidation rose in both groups but non-oxidative glucose disposal (storage) rose only in the control subjects. Glucose oxidation was slightly lower in the patients (P < 0.05) but not at any specific time point and there was no difference between the groups in the amount by which glucose oxidation increased. Non-oxidative disposal in the patients fell significantly (P < 0.01) over the course of the clamp and was significantly lower than in the control subjects (P < 0.01). 5. Growth hormone increased in response to glucose infusion in the patients but not in the control subjects. 6. Like patients suffering uncomplicated sepsis or trauma, patients with multiple organ failure are also insulin resistant. The defect appears to lie in an impairment of the ability to store glucose rather than oxidize it, and this may be due in part to the increase in growth hormone in patients with multiple organ failure.","Glucose oxidation; Glucose storage; Growth hormone; Hyperglycaemic glucose clamp; Indirect calorimetry; Multiple organ failure; Sepsis","glucagon; glucose; hydrocortisone; insulin; article; calorimetry; clinical article; controlled study; energy expenditure; female; glucagon blood level; glucose blood level; glucose clamp technique; glucose infusion; glucose oxidation; glucose utilization; growth hormone blood level; human; hydrocortisone blood level; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; lung gas exchange; male; multiple organ failure; nitrogen metabolism; priority journal; protein metabolism; sepsis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028823194

These energisations, found in the absence of substrates, are called ‘entatic states of groups’ [Vallee, B. L. & Williams, R. J. P. (1968) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 59, 498–505]. A group can be part of an amino acid or any bound metal ion or cofactor. In some particular cases the apoprotein, where the energised metal ion or cofactor has been removed, or the protein in which the energised amino acid has been replaced, has the same back‐bone structure as the holoprotein and even side‐chains are only slightly adjusted. This case is quite different from a condition of a group simultaneously energised with a protein fold, due to their combination, and which therefore involves conformational change in the protein and the group and which may adjust the group while the protein tightens. The final condition is again stable but removal of the group now must result in a reversed protein conformation change. This simultaneous energisation of both the adjustable protein and the group can be local, as in an induced fit or more extensive when it can be likened in some cases to a stretching by rack action, or may involve a change from an almost random to a structured protein when the group is energised in a very limited way. The various energisations must not be confused since they differ functionally. The first can give rise to optimal heightened catalytic (or other functional) potential of the local group but cannot be connected either to excitation of other parts of a protein as in induced fitting, or to a relay of energy (larger conformational change) in the protein. Clearly it restricts the rate of exchange of a group. Induced fit can also give rise to group activation, though to a somewhat reduced degree, while increasing exchange rate. A device such as a rack may rather give rise to a mechanical activity (message transmission), which is relayed a large distance into the protein, and can only give considerably lower activation of individual groups but exchange may now be fast. The final case involves very modest energisation of the group with gross rearrangement and energisation of the protein and may be associated with storage or carrier functions. The groups upon which I concentrate are metal ions since detailed electronic and structural knowledge of their ground states are well known, allowing energised states to be easily detected, but the ideas apply equally to organic side‐chains of proteins as will be shown. A further energisation can arise from the addition of a substrate to each kind of protein. In fact all the ideas of energisation applicable to groups having cyclic activity in permanent features of protein structure are equally well applied to substrate binding or conversion of substrates through excited stales to products.

Alglucerase has provided a breakthrough in treatment for patients with this relatively rare disease. With alglucerase infusions typical disease manifestations are ameliorated or normalised: hepatosplenomegaly is reduced, haematological parameters improve, and patients experience an increased quality of life usually within 4 to 6 months of treatment. Parameters of bone disease also respond, but generally over a longer period of treatment. Alglucerase is well tolerated by children and adults, with few adverse effects reported. Seroconversion occurs in approximately 15% of patients on high—dose therapy, but does not appear to affect the efficacy of treatment. Several dosage regimens have been used to deliver alglucerase, and the comparative benefits of these remain controversial. High-dose regimens of 60 IU/kg bodyweight administered every 2 weeks are clearly effective; however, smaller dosages given more frequently are also effective and incur a greatly reduced acquisition cost. Patient responses are variable, and the dosage regimen should be tailored to individual needs. Dosage regimens may be considerably reduced for the maintenance phase of treatment, but clinical experience is as yet insufficient to establish the minimum dosages required in the long term. Acquisition cost of alglucerase is $US3.70 per unit (1994 US dollars); thus, a dosage regimen of60 IU/kg bodyweight administered every 2 weeks for a patient weighing 70kg costs $US404 040 per year. The minimal costs per quality-adjusted life year saved (QALY) have been estimated for 3 dosage regimens over a 10-year periodo Cost per QALY was $US147 000 for 60 IU/kg bodyweight administered every 2 weeks, $US75 000 for 30 IU/kg every 2 weeks, and $US49 000 for 2.3 IU/kg administered 3 times per week. These costs were calculated assuming immediate death with no treatment, which suggests that the actual costs per QALY for most patients with type 1 or 3 disease are likely to be much higher. Drug administration costs may become a significant part of the cost during maintenance therapy; in addition, possible cost savings due to increased patient productivity and reduced palliative treatments remain unresolved. Although some patients may obtain increased benefit from high-dosage regimens, the very high cost may preclude general use of these regimens. Healthcare resources consumed by alglucerase therapy represent a large opportunity cost for other therapeutic areas. Savings in treatment costs may be achieved by frequent administration of smaller doses in a home environment (to decrease administration costs). Further research to develop less expensive means of manufacturing the enzyme is urgently required, as current acquisition costs may limit treatment to only the most severely affected patients. In conclusion, enzyme replacement therapy is the most effective and well tolerated treatment available for Gaucher’s disease. However, the cost effectiveness of this expensive treatment has not yet been established. Disease Considerations Gaucher’s disease resu1ts from an inherited inability to hydrolyse glucocerebroside, a byproduct of cell membrane metabolismo Excessive storage of glucocerebroside by macrophages results in hepatosplenomegaly (which may be massive), bleeding disorders and bone disease. The rate of splenic enlargement indicates the progression of the disease. Accumulation of glucocerebroside in the spleen contributes to the anaemia, thrombocytopenia and bleeding disorders commonly seen in patients with Gaucher’s disease. Bone disease is a major source of discomfort and disability. ‘Bone crises’ (periods of intense pain due to bone infarction) require intravenous narcotic analgesia. Failure of bone remodelling, growth retardation and spontaneous fractures may occur as a result of bony pathology. In addition, a number of other body systems may be affected by Gaucher’s disease. Pulmonary, cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal dysfunction have been reported, as well as lymphadenopathy and yellow-brown skin pigmentation. Fatigue is a common finding, possibly due to a raised resting metabolic rate caused by the accumulation of glucocerebroside. Three main types ofGaucher’s disease have been identified. Type 1 Gaucher’s disease is characterised by the lack of neurological involvement and a chronic time course. With a prevalence of 1 in 40 000 in the general population and a carrier rate of 1 in 31 in East European Jews (Ashkenazim) in the US, type 1 disease is the most common form, accounting for approximately 99% of cases. Type 2 disease is the most severe neuronopathic form, and generally results in death within the first 2 years of life. Type 3 disease typically begins in early childhood and shares characteristics of both types 1 and 2. Types 2 and 3 are universally rare (≤1 in 100 000 population), except for an isolated group of patients with type 3 disease in Norrbotten, Sweden. Estimates suggest 1780 to 11 200 patients with type 1 disease in the US may be candidates for enzyme replacement therapy. Therapeutic Efficacy and Tolerability Alglucerase reduces organ enlargement, improves haematological parameters, and in the long term may improve bone architecture. Typically, improvements in organomegaly are the first to occur, with 20% reduction in liver volume and 35% reduction in splenic volume expected within the first year of treatment. Significant changes are usually evident within the first 6 months of therapy. Haematological parameters are slower to respond, but in most anaemic patients an increase in haemoglobin levels of 15 g/L may be expected in the initial treatment year. Platelet counts in patients with severe thrombocytopenia may double or be expected to normalise in patients with mild thrombocytopenia over the same treatment period. Bone pain usually reduces in severity and frequency within the first year of treatment but radiographical changes in bony architecture are rarely evident within this time-frame. A preliminary report of a single comparative trial between alglucerase and a recombinant enzyme preparation (imiglucerase) indicated that there was no difference in efficacy between these agents. Alglucerase is generally well tolerated, with infrequent adverse effects usually related to the method of administration (e.g. inflammation at the intravenous catheter site) rather than to the drug itself. Seroconversion occurs in approximately 15% of patients but does not appear to alter the efficacy of alglucerase or necessitate treatment withdrawal. Episodes of pruritus or urticaria during infusion occur rarely and may be prevented with oral antihistamine agents. Although formal studies have not been performed, patients treated with alglucerase appear to experience improved quality of life. Energy levels rise, and patients are able to resume work or school. Improvements in symptomatology, for example epistaxis, bruising, fatigue and pain, typically precede changes in physical and laboratory parameters. Pharmacoeconomic Considerafions The severity of Gaucher’s disease is highly variable and is only partially correlated with the patient’s genotype. Nonetheless, genetic services form an indispensable part of the costs of the disease. Although no specific data are available for the cost of genetic services for patients with Gaucher’s disease, genetic counselling sessions in the US cost between $US45 and $US89 per outpatient visit in 1984. Other costs of illness may include splenectomy, blood transfusion, analgesia and orthopaedic procedures. Average direct and indirect costs for total hip joint replacement (a procedure frequent1y performed in patients with Gaucher’s disease) were estimated to be $Can9990 (1988 Canadian dollars). These costs are likely to be greater for patients with Gaucher’s disease as the risks of haemorrhage and infection are high in these patients. Charges for splenectomy in children with chronic immunothrombocytic purpura in the US ranged from $US5000 to $US30 000 in 1986. Pamidronic acid therapy has proved useful in alleviating bone disease in preliminary studies. However, cost data for this and other palliative treatments are unavailable. Bone marrow transplantation has been performed in a limited number of patients with type l and 3 disease. Most surviving patients had subsequent complications that included mild graft-versus-host disease, or cerebral or pulmonary dysfunction. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been estimated to cost between £40 000 and £60 000 in the UK. Alglucerase is clearly more expensive than other treatment options, as estimated acquisition costs of dosage regimens used in clinical trials vary between $US16 650 and $US133 200 for the initial 6-month treatment period in 1994 (assuming $US3.70 per unit of alglucerase and patient bodyweight of 50kg). These costs do not include administration or monitoring costs, which may add a significant cost to frequent1y-administered low-dosage regimens unless patients can be treated at home. Experience with maintenance therapy is lacking, but it is expected that high dosages will be able to be reduced to 25% of the initial regimen. Minimal costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for a 10-year treatment period were estimated as $US147 000 for high-dose regimen of alglucerase 60 IU/kg bodyweight administered once every 2 weeks, compared with $US49 000 for alglucerase 2.3 IU/kg administered 3 times per week. These costs included some administration costs but assumed that immediate death would result from no treatment, which suggests that actual costs per QALY for patients with type l disease (which is not usually fatal) would be considerably higher. © 1995, Adis International Limited.

The aromatic character of this compound and its breakdown products enabled direct visualization of their accumulation in the biofilm matrix. This accumulation could be inhibited by addition of a more labile carbon source to the culture medium or by inhibition of cell activity. The fluorescence of diclofop-grown biofilms remained constant after 14 to 21 days but decreased with time when diclofop was omitted from the irrigation solution. However, this decrease was inhibited by cyanide, indicating either utilization or release of accumulated diclofop when the cells were viable. Subsequent experiments with [14C]diclofop also indicated that decreased fluorescence in the absence of an exogenous carbon source resulted from degradation of adsorbed diclofop and its breakdown products by the biofilm bacteria. These results demonstrate that biofilm exopolymers can facilitate storage of nutrients for subsequent mineralization during periods of carbon limitation.",,"aromatic compound; carbon; cyanide; herbicide; organic solvent; polymer; article; bacterium; bioaccumulation; biofilm; fluorescence; ion exchange; nonhuman; starvation; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028821186

Their regulation and metabolism differ. After carbohydrate ingestion, glucose is rapidly oxidized or stored in muscles and liver. There is a constant alternance between glucose storage as glycogen after meals and glycogen mobilization in the postabsorptive state when plasma glucose has returned to the basal state. Impairment of this alternance, in particular when glycogen stores are not being used, may lead to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Ingestion of lipids is not followed by an immediate increase in lipid oxidation, but FFA are stored as triglycerides in different tissues. Lipolysis occurs in the fasting state from tissue triglycerides and favors lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation is typically increased in obesity. The preferential use of FFA from triglyceride store for energy expenditure in obesity is responsible for the decrease in glucose mobilization from glycogen stores. This leads to a negative feedback of muscle and liver glycogen on glycogen synthase activity and consequently on glucose storage. It results in glucose intolerance after carbohydrate ingestion. Diabetes develops in obesity, usually after a long period of glucose intolerance, when glycemia does not return to the basal state. In obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance can be prevented, or if already existing, can be decreased by stimulating glycogen mobilization by exercise, thermogenesis-stimulating drugs, and weight loss, which reduces fat stores and decreases lipid oxidation. © 1995.",,"conference paper; energy expenditure; fatty acid metabolism; glucose metabolism; human; lipid oxidation; metabolic regulation; nutrition; obesity; priority journal; weight reduction; Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent; Energy Metabolism; Food; Gluconeogenesis; Glucose; Human; Lipids; Obesity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028815418

Evidence suggests that eating behavior is triggered by a signal that is tied to hepatic ATP concentrations and is carried from the liver to brain via afferents in the vagus nerve. This metabolic control of eating behavior may link mechanisms of energy storage and expenditure to energy intake. Changes in energy intake associated with alterations in energy expenditure can be viewed as a response to a shift in the partitioning of fuels, which affects the oxidative metabolic pathways that generate the signal controlling eating behavior.","Appetite; ATP; body weight; food intake; fuel metabolism; liver; obesity","aerobic metabolism; appetite; body weight; caloric intake; conference paper; energy balance; feeding behavior; human; normal human; obesity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028807084

Such samples can be used to examine a variety of structural and functional characteristics of muscle, including fiber type and size, capillarization, enzymatic capacities, energy substrate or protein/mRNA concentrations, metabolic responses, and contractile properties. In conjunction with other methods, biopsy sampling can also be used to estimate total muscle mass and fiber number, and to determine rates of protein synthesis and degradation. Optimal handling and storage conditions vary widely, but in general, most of the above measurements can be made using frozen tissue, so that samples can be stored almost indefinitely. The procedure is also safe and generally well- tolerated, making it possible to perform longitudinal studies of the same person. The biopsy technique is therefore well suited for examining the underlying physiological mechanisms responsible for muscle wasting in the elderly, as well as for assessing the effects of nutritional, hormonal, and/or lifestyle (e.g., exercise) interventions intended to combat this problem. Although sample size limitations have been largely overcome by the development of microtechniques, more information is needed on how to minimize the variability introduced by studying only a small fraction of the whole muscle. Studies are also required to determine whether it is sufficient to biopsy only one muscle (and if so, which is optimal), or whether there are differential effects of aging in various muscle groups that would preclude extrapolating from one muscle to all muscles in the body. Despite the latter limitations, the biopsy technique has been and will continue to be an important tool in the study of the effects of aging on human skeletal muscle.",,"aged; aging; conference paper; enzyme activity; human; human tissue; lifestyle; muscle atrophy; muscle biopsy; muscle fiber membrane conductance; nutritional status; priority journal; protein degradation; protein synthesis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028805311

Since the energy change in the energy storage capacitor can be compensated in the next cycle and larger DC bus voltage ripple can be tolerated by using the sampling technique, a relatively smaller energy storage capacitor is required. The advantages of this APF circuit are simplicity of control circuits, low cost (a smaller energy storage capacitor) and good transient response.

Q/γ-Al2O3 and TOHP/γ-Al 2O3 represent promising materials for frequency domain optical data storage (FDOS) based on persistent spectral hole burning (PSHB), since it is possible to detect spectral holes at high temperatures (77 K). To find out whether differences in the electronic structure between the free and the adsorbed molecules account for the hole-burning properties, we performed calculations of Q-Al complexes with various coordination spheres. The calculated vertical excitation energies for the first electronically excited state of the investigated structures are in good agreement with experimental data. Analysis of the molecular orbitals shows that complexation of the investigated molecules with Al affects the electronic structure of the dyes only little. Furthermore, the character of the first excited state is conserved. The change of the dipole moment between the ground and the first excited states is about the same for the free and for the complexated systems. Therefore, it is concluded that hole burning of dye molecules chemisorbed on γ-Al2O3 at high temperatures is not due to a change of the electronic structure of the adsorbed dye molecules compared to the free dye molecules, but has to be attributed to the special interactions of Q with the γ-Al 2O3 surface. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010692309

A steady flow of monodisperse with respect to the molecular weight polymer melts is contained within the region of positive values of the second derivative of storage energy with respect to the shear rate. When the sign of this derivative is reversed the melt is affected by a uniform stress field, and, at a Poiseuille flow, an elastic turbulence phenomenon arises. 2. At some shear stress value in monodisperse fibre suspensions, there occurs a failure in the fibre structure, and a new high-organized clusterial one is formed. The process is accompanied by an abrupt decrease of the first normal stress difference, and even by a reverse of its sign in a local region of the shear rate. 3. One of the effective methods to investigate the nature of flow induced supramolecular structure of a polymer with flexible molecules and the textures of liquid-crystalline polymers arising at a shear flow, is the superposition of steady and oscillatory shear flows. © 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010663435

This paper introduces a framework for the analysis of organizations as knowledge systems (Holzner & Marx, 1979) composed of a collection of knowledge processes: constructing, organizing, storing, distributing, and applying. The knowledge system framework draws heavily on the sociology of knowledge and emphasizes the social nature of each of these constitutive processes. The paper uses the framework to analyze the case of a small engineering consulting company that implemented a new information system to automate one of its core business activities: energy audits of commercial buildings. Traditional approaches to organizational learning have emphasized the ways in which information systems can lower the costs and increase capacity for search, storage, and retrieval of information. The knowledge system framework suggests a deeper level of influence, whereby information systems can also affect the objects of knowledge and the criteria for knowledge construction. © 1995.","Knowledge systems; Organizational learning; Social epistemology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005155758

Changes in chemical composition result from differential growth of these tissues. Little is known about the relative changes in morphometric traits during development of carp or about their genetic basis, but it seems that valuable criteria for selection on suitability for processing could be found in the mechanisms of bone and muscle development. The development of fatty tissues associated with growth of carp is stimulated by the use of lipid-enriched or high-energy artificial diets. Fat is accumulated in specific adipose tissues and the analysis of the relative development of these tissues could give valuable information on the over-accumulation of fat and its distribution in the whole body. Accumulation of fat has either positive or negative consequences for sensory evaluation depending on the source and the composition of fat. The main characteristics of muscle and connective tissues are presented in this paper. Different muscle tissues comprising different fibre types are found in cyprinids. These tissues together with adipose tissues compose the edible part of carp and explain most of protein retention. Protein content and composition are stable during development. Furthermore, a wide variability in the characteristics of muscle and connective tissues persists in commercial-size fish related to their mode of development. It is especially true for the main contractile protein: myosin. This is illustrated on expression of isoform of myosin but in early stages. The changes in the characteristics of the tissues and of the flesh after death and during postmortem storage and processing are reviewed. The structural components and the organization of tissues are very specific in fish and more sensitive to destruction. Thus, the degradative processes that affect the flesh during storage and processing have important consequences for sensory evaluation of the flesh which in freshwater species is generally rather soft and with neutral odour and taste. In this paper the possible role of biological characteristics of the flesh and of its constitutive tissues in quality is analyzed for the effect of body weight and for the effect of acclimation temperature. Temperature induces specific compensation for the maintenance of basic processes and the consequences for quality are analysed as well. © 1995.","Cyprinus carpio; Growth - fish; Meat quality; Postmortem; Temperature; Tissues",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002248631

In these simulations, a high density (n e=1014-5×1015 cm-3) uniform plasma initially bridges a small section of the coaxial transmission line of an inductive energy storage generator. A short section of vacuum transmission line connects the POS to a short circuit load. The results presented here extend previous simulations in the ne=1012-1013 cm-3 density regime. The simulations show that a two-dimensional (2-D) sheath forms in the plasma near a cathode. This sheath is positively charged, and electrostatic sheath potentials that are large compared to the anode-cathode voltage develop. Initially, the 2-D sheath is located at the generator edge of the plasma. As ions are accelerated out of the sheath, it retains its original 2-D structure, but migrates axially toward the load creating a magnetically insulated gap in its wake. When the sheath reaches the load edge of the POS, the POS stops conducting current and the load current increases rapidly. At the end of the conduction phase a gap exists in the POS whose size is determined by the radial dimensions of the 2-D sheath.

They are applied to the case of the diode-pumped Nd3+-doped laser systems and, along with expressions allowing the calculation of excited-state-absorption (ESA) cross sections within the framework of the Judd-Ofelt theory, they provide a theoretical framework for the second part in which we present both experimental measurements and theoretical calibrations and an analysis of excited-state-absorption spectra in the stimulated emission as well as in the pumping domains of Nd3+-doped Y3Al5O12, YLiF4, and LaMgAl11O19 laser crystals. The results indicate that ESA in the infrared metastable state of Nd3+ in these materials is negligible at the main laser wavelengths but can be more significant if it takes place, following some energy-transfer induced-excitation process, in higher-lying excited states. The analysis of these ESA within the Judd-Ofelt formalism shows a general agreement better than 50% between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions. This is used to estimate the influence of ESA in the pumping domain on the laser performance of the materials. It is found that it contributes but that it does not significantly perturb this laser performance, and that this effect is much less than some upconversion energy transfers that limit the fluorescence excitation efficiencies and reduce the energy-storage capacities by the reduction of the effective fluorescence lifetimes of the laser metastable level. © 1995 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001229755

In contrast, the luminescence maximum is blue shifted, from 610 nm in aqueous media, to 580 nm when the metal complex was bound to BAZrP. Such a blue shift in the emission was observed when Ru(bpy)32+ was present in rigid matrices such as ice, or ethanol-methanol glasses at low temperature. Therefore, the microenvironment surrounding the metal complex in BAZrP is rigid and does not permit the relaxation of the initially produced metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) excited state even at room temperature. Upon binding to the zirconium phosphate, the emission yield of Ru(bpy)32+ is increased nearly 5-fold when compared to aqueous solutions. Such large increases in the emission were not observed with Ru(bpy)32+ in other heterogeneous media. The absorption and emission spectral maxima are independent of loading of the metal complex, strongly suggesting the formation of islands or pools of these metal complexes at the interlayer regions of BAZrP. The luminescence intensities decrease with loading of the metal complex indicating the strong self quenching of the luminescence within these pools. Stern-Volmer plots were constructed from the steady-state data and the estimated ATSV value was 1.1 × 106 m2/mol. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples indicate that intercalation of Ru(bpy)32+ into BAZrP increases the interlayer separation from 18.6 to 19.5 Å. Time-resolved emission studies indicate the presence of two distinct species, a major long-lived component of ∼1500 ns (&gt;90%) and a minor short-lived component of ∼400 ns (&lt; 10%). These excited-state lifetimes are much longer than what was observed in other heterogeneous media. The luminescence lifetimes decrease with loading. The self quenching rate constant estimated from the time-resolved emission data is 5.8 × 1010 m2/(mol s). The large self quenching rate constant and extremely slow diffusion in the interlayer regions suggest rapid migration of the excitation within these pools. However, no direct evidence was observed for the energy migration in the current studies. The binding of the metal complexes to BAZrP was found to be highly sensitive to the presence of salts. For example, addition of potassium chloride/iodide released the metal complex into the aqueous phase, causing a large decrease in the luminescence intensity. A similar effect with sodium iodide or sodium chloride was not observed. Such ion-sensitive emission can be useful in the design of luminescence sensors. The longer lifetime and the increased energy of the luminescent state of Ru(bpy)32+, when bound to BAZrP, are welcome changes for the application of these assemblies in solar energy conversion and storage. © 1995 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001183602

Accelerated and heated by solar wind energy, this matter expands in size and increases in mass density in response to the Sun's ultraviolet spectrum, heliospheric conditions, and the occurrence of severe space storms. Such storms regularly damage spacecraft, interfere with communications, and trigger power grid interruptions or failures. They occur within the geopause region, that is, the volume defined by the limits of the instantaneous boundary between plasmas that are primarily heliospheric and geospheric. The geopause is analogous in some ways to the heliopause but also resembles the terrestrial air‐sea interface. It is the boundary layer across which the supersonically expanding solar plasma delivers momentum and energy to the terrestrial plasma and gas, exciting them into motion, “evaporating” them into space, and dissipating considerable amounts of power in thermal forms, while generating energetic particles through repeated storage and explosive release of electromagnetic energy. The intensity of the solar wind and the orientation of its magnetic field jointly control the strength of the coupling between solar and terrestrial plasmas and hence the occurrence of severe storms in the geopause region.

This computational ability of oscillator neural networks is ensured by the fact that reduced dynamic equations for phase variables in general involve two terms that can be respectively responsible for the emergence of synchronization and cessation of oscillations. Thus the cessation occurs in memory retrieval if the corresponding term dominates in the dynamic equations. A bottomless feature of the energy function for such a system makes the retrieval states quasi-fixed points, which admit continual rotating motion to a small portion of oscillators, when an extensive number of memory patterns are embedded. An approximate theory based on the self-consistent signal-to-noise analysis enables one to study the equilibrium properties of the neural network of phase variables with the quasi-fixed-point attractors. As far as the memory retrieval by the quasi-fixed points is concerned, the equilibrium properties including the storage capacity of oscillator neural networks are proved to be similar to those of the Hopfield type neural networks. © 1995 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000630421

This is followed by the formation of a number of intermediates resulting from conformational changes of the protein around the retinal which leads to the deprotonation of the protonated Schiff base of the retinylidene system. This is the switch of the proton pump which leads to the last step in the storage of solar energy in the form of electric energy by this photosynthetic system. The removal of metal cations from bR is found to inhibit the deprotonation process. In the present paper we summarize the results of our studies and the others regarding two important questions in the conversion process: 1) what is(are) the molecular mechanism(s) of the protein catalysis of the photoisomerization process and 2) what is the role of metal cations in the deprotonation process of the protonated Schiff base (the switch of the proton pump)? In order to answer the first question, the results of the subpicosecond photoisomerization rate of retinal in bR and in a number of its relevant mutants are discussed in terms of the steric and electronic factors. In an effort to answer the second question, we discussed the results of the binding studies of Ca2+ to bR, to its mutants and to bR after its C-terminus is cleaved. From these results and the results of Roux et al. on the 31P NMR of Nd3+ regenerated bR, we concluded that one or two metal cations strongly bound to the protein but not on the surface, are functionally important. The model in which these metal cation(s) control the pK values of Aspartic acids in the 85 and 212 positions and that of the protonated Schiff base (PSB) during the photocycle is discussed. © 1995 IUPAC",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000598854

We present a simple classical ""reaction-zone"" model which essentially reproduces the data except in the region close to the threshold where the cross section is small. © 1995 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000315253

The applied electric energy inactivated microorganisms in apple juice and, because the pulse duration was only 2.5μs, energy remaining to heat the apple juice was minimized. The microbial inactivation was defined in terms of applied field intensity and treatment time. Less than 10% of the electrical energy for HTST was needed for achieving 6 log reduction in inactivation of S. cerevisiae in apple juice. The PEF-treated apple juice, at both 4°C and 25°C storage, had a shelf-life of more than 3 weeks. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000230122

To this end, sucrose in concentrations between 0 and 10% by weight was added to corn meal prior to extrusion at two levels of moisture (15 and 20%). The resulting data revealed the following significant features. (i) At the higher moisture level, sucrose progressively reduced the specific mechanical energy, while exhibiting little effect at the lower moisture level. (ii) At both moisture levels, sucrose increased the bulk density and reduced the cell size; this effect was progressive for high extrusion moisture samples and evident only at high sucrose contents for low extrusion moisture samples. (iii) In extrudate samples equilibrated to moisture contents between 12 and 17% wt, sucrose progressively plasticized the structures, as assessed by compression, dynamic mechanical spectrometry, and differential scanning calorimetry. In the aggregate, these results showed that the addition of sucrose requires a modification of the extrusion operating conditions to produce extrudates with optimal textural and storage properties. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000153615

By utilizing the f-sum rule, S(q,ω) could be brought on to an absolute scale, so that also the static structure factor S(q) could be obtained. The orientation-averaged features of the dynamic and the static structure factor, such as dispersion, width, and shape of the spectra, could be brought in reasonable agreement with jellium calculation, when we went beyond the random-phase approximation by taking into account both exchange corrections via a static local-field factor and momentum-dependent lifetime in an on-shell approximation of the self-energy. Results of fitting of the static local-field factor to the experiment are presented. The rich q-orientation-dependent fine structure found in the experimental S(q,ω) spectra either could be attributed to the enhanced density of states on zone boundaries in the extended zone scheme, or could be understood in terms of plasmon-Fano resonances, which are the result of a plasmon-band-induced coupling between the continuum of electron-hole excitations and the discrete plasmon resonances. This interpretation is supported by pseudopotential calculations within the limits of the two-plasmon-band model. © 1995 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000110903
