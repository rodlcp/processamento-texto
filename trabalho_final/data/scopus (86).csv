Both are evolution of the Zero Energy Building (ZEB) concept. RES innovations backed up by signal processing, simulation models and ICT tools were embedded into the building structures in order to implement a new predictive energy management concept. In addition, nano-coatings, produced by TiO2 and ITO nano-particles, were deposited on the IEB structural elements and especially on the window panes and the PV glass covers. They exhibited promising SSP values which lowered the cooling loads and increased the PV modules yield. Both pilot IEB units were equipped with an on-line dynamic hourly solar radiation prediction model, implemented by sensors and the related software to manage effectively the energy source, the loads and the storage or the backup system. The IEB energy sources covered the thermal loads via a south façade embedded in the wall and a solar roof which consists of a specially designed solar collector type, while a PV generator is part of the solar roof, like a compact BIPV in hybrid configuration to a small wind turbine. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.","Intelligent energy building; Nanocoatings; Solar radiation prediction; SSP; Stochastic sizing",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984537568

The most immediate challenges facing implantable devices include (1) a high desire that implantable devices are self-powered and (2) the power source that can drive implantable devices must not add much weight to the implantable device. Therefore, it is important to explore innovative nanotechnologies that harvest energy from the environment for self-powering these implantable devices. Little or no work has been done on the conversion of the chemical energy stored in aluminum (Al)-phosphate cell based on the activation of Al using ZnO nanociystal modifiers as a potential power source for implantable devices. In this work emphasis has been placed on the development Al-phosphate cell as a 'green' alternative to the traditional enzymatic biofuel cells for the conversion of the chemical energy stored in Al to power a light emitting diode (LED) via a capacitor energy storage circuit. The LED was powered by a capacitor based energy storage circuit using power generated by the Al-phosphate cell. Two Al-phosphate cells were connected in series and were used to charge the capacitors in parallel and then discharged the capacitors in series in order to amplify the voltage generated by the hybrid cells to power the LED. The optimal capacitance was observed to be 1000 μΡ for each hybrid cell. The use of capacitor charging system increase the power output from 210 μW to 4 mW compared to the two Al-phosphate hybrid cells connected in series without capacitors. This novel approach to energy generation has great potential to be utilized in powering implantable devices. © 2015 IEEE.","capacitor; hybrid cells; phosphate; ZnO modifier","Aluminum; Biological fuel cells; Capacitance; Capacitors; Charging (batteries); Electric network analysis; Energy storage; Enzymatic fuel cells; Glucose sensors; Implants (surgical); Phosphates; Reconfigurable hardware; Zinc oxide; Capacitor charging; Capacitor energy; Energy generations; Glucose biosensor; Hybrid cells; Implantable devices; Optimal capacitances; Potential power sources; Light emitting diodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963569089

Such events require a rapid surge of power from the ESS, but they occur only rarely. The high temperature tolerance of SiC MOSFETs and diodes presents an opportunity for innovative ESS inverter designs. Herein we investigate a SiC ESS inverter design such that the SiC device ratings are obeyed during mild frequency events but are exceeded during rare, major events, for a potentially more economical inverter design. In support of this proposal we present: 1. An analysis of four years of grid frequency events in the U.S. Western Interconnection. 2. A switch-level ESS inverter simulation using SiC devices with detailed loss estimates. 3. Thermal analysis of the SiC power modules during a worst-case frequency event, showing that the modules can likely withstand the brief overcurrent. This analysis supports the conclusion that it may be advantageous for economical designs (acknowledging the increased risks) to undersize the SiC switches when designing inverters to perform active power control for grid frequency support. Such a strategy may result in SiC-based designs being more competitive with less costly silicon IGBT-based designs. © 2015 IEEE.","energy storage; frequency support; inverter; Silicon carbide; thermal modeling","Design; Electric inverters; Electric power system control; Energy gap; Energy storage; MOSFET devices; Power control; Risk assessment; Silicon carbide; Thermoanalysis; Active power control; Economical design; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Frequency transients; High temperature; inverter; Thermal model; Western interconnections; Electric power system economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963626724

Apart from the features of low turn-off loss, low output capacitance and low drain-source on-state resistance, the most salient one in our bidirectional DC-DC converter application is the ultra-fast freewheeling ""body diode"" that GaN devices have when compared with Si devices.

Power intermittency and voltage swings of solar resource negatively affect the reliability of microgrids. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are incorporated in such microgrids to mitigate the power intermittency of photo-voltaic (PV) system. However, this power intermittency can adversely affect the battery performance that lead to lifetime reduction. Accordingly, this paper presents an integration of hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in stand-alone PV systems. In HESS, battery and super-capacitor are used. The influence of HESS on battery state of charge (SOC), charge/discharge current and load voltage are investigated. HESS substitutes the PV power intermitted without hard stress on battery. Also, the performance of HESS is tested for both static and dynamic loads. From simulation results, both voltage swings and power intermittency have been enhanced which would increase the reliability of microgrids and the battery lifetime. The time domain simulations are accomplished using PSCAD/EMTDC software package.

To ensure sustainability and reliability of electricity provision in the growing cities, a significant increase in energy generated from renewable sources (e.g., wind, solar) is required. However, renewable energy supply is much more variable and intermittent than traditional supply, as it depends on changing weather conditions. In order to optimize residential energy usage, demand response (DR) techniques are being investigated to shift device usage to the periods of low demand. Currently most DR approaches focus on traditional DR goals, e.g., reducing usage at peak times and increasing it at off-peak times. More flexible and adaptive techniques are needed that can not only meet traditional DR requirements, but enable just-in-time use of renewable energy, rather than requiring its curtailment or using expensive and inefficient storage options. This paper proposes the use of decentralized learning-based multi-agent residential DR to enable more efficient integration of renewable energy sources in the smart grid, in the presence of increased demand caused by high electric vehicle penetration. We evaluate the approach using real household usage data obtained from Irish smart meter trials and data on wind-generated energy from the Irish grid operator. We discuss advantages of the proposed decentralized approach and show that it is able to respond to multiple variable wind-generation patterns by shifting up to 35% of the overall energy usage to the periods of high wind availability. © 2015 IEEE.","decentralized learning; demand response; multi-agent systems; renewable energy",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969930826

Among the goals of technology management are cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency, and secure management of information technologies, which are expected to produce maximum utility value. Virtualization has been proposed as a promising solution to the challenges facing today's IT managers. From virtualized servers to virtualized networks to virtual data centers, various virtualized systems have been explored as means of easing IT operation challenges. One of the major benefits of virtualization is the possibility of building a network of virtual machines and storage infrastructure between the virtual data center and external physical networks. A data center involves a large number of networking devices such as switches, routers, and firewalls. With traditional networking, managing networks in data centers is a complex task due to the closed architecture and vertical integration among the networking devices. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new architectural paradigm, enabling flexible and dynamic management of networks and associated services.

We introduce a method stemming from consumer theory and cooperative game theory that uses CES to balance the load of an entire locality and manage household energy allocations respectively. Load balancing is derived as a geometric programming problem. Each households contribution to overall non-uniformity of the load profile is modeled using a characteristic function and Shapley values are used to allocate the amount and price of surplus energy stored in CES.

In this work, a real-time data collection and processing framework is developed to retrieve raw data from a milling machine tool and its sensors and convert them into relevant input features. The extracted input features are then used to construct the energy prediction model using Gaussian Process (GP) regression. To update the GP regression model with real-time streaming data, we investigate the use of sparse representation of the covariance matrix to reduce the computational and storage demands of the GP regression.

At a smaller scale, the use of straw for heat production has been a sound strategy for Norwegian farmers to utilize own resources and detach themselves from cost fluctuations on other energy commodities-this notion is supported by their willingness to make further investments in storage facilities. The total cost of straw firing was about 40-46% of the current cost of electric heating (∼90 Euro MWh-1).

This chapter provides a focused analysis of the impacts of forest harvesting on water supply. Although other parts of the forest bioenergy life cycle can affect water resource quantity and quality, harvesting produces the largest changes, and is the greatest focus of environmental concern. In some longrotation native forest regeneration systems, harvesting results in an initial water yield increase followed by declines that have been reported to last up to 100 years. Several syntheses have concluded that there is no evidence of forest harvesting producing a significant, long-term adverse impact on the quality of water supplies from dissolved inorganic ions in streamflow such as nitrates, phosphates, and cations. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Due to high costs, energy storage systems (ESS) typically require multiple use cases to justify their costs. ESS has shown promise for future economic and technical solutions due to potential benefits from energy storage arbitrage. Historically, ESSs with a directly connected photovoltaic (PV) system could not be placed in a Net Energy Metering (NEM) tariff, due to challenge of determining whether energy comes from a renewable PV source or fossil fuelled energy from a battery. Recent California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) rules have allowed PV paired energy storage systems to interconnect with NEM under very specific conditions.

In terms of technical analysis, DFIG which was equipped with the ESS can partly compensate the unstable active power output from the variable wind output power. In addition, this paper analyzed about the performance of Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) for different ESS options such as Super Capacitor ESS (SCESS), Battery ESS (BESS), Two Layer (TL) ESS in the DFIG as 1.5MW,60Hz under mean wind speed 12 m/s during the 12 second. From the simulation results, The average THD of Hybrid ESS as SC-B ESS, SC- TLESS is the best options to reduce the THD for power quality improvement compared to other ESS options. In terms of economical analysis, the payback time of Battery ESS and Super Capacitor ESS are 3.47 years and 15.76 years respectively. The pay back time of Hybrid ESS is between these two payback time, therefore the system can still be affordable.

The 1-Transistor-1-resistor (1T1R) ReRAM array has density comparable to that of a DRAM array and the advantages of lower programming energy and higher reliability compared to the ultrahigh density ReRAM cross-point array. In this paper, we show how circuit operation parameters, such as the pulse amplitude and pulse widths of word-line (WL) voltage, bit-line (BL) voltage, and source-line (SL) voltage can be used to lower latency, lower power and improve reliability. SPICE simulation results demonstrate that appropriate choice of voltage settings can be used to reduce the write latency of the 1T1R cell by 29.4% and reduce write energy by 46.7% over the DRAM cell. Next, we show how the endurance of ReRAM cell can be improved by increasing the ratio between OFF and ON resistances and reducing SL voltage. We find that of these, reducing the SL voltage results in significant improvement in endurance with smaller energy overhead. Next, we evaluate the system-level performance of a 1GB ReRAM and DRAM memory system using CACTI and GEM5.

An HMC module adopts separate receive and transmit lanes and thus may achieve the maximal memory bandwidth only if data can be driven at full speed in both directions. However, due to the natural read and write imbalance in modern applications, the effective memory bandwidth utilization is often low, leading to suboptimal system performance. In this paper, we propose DLB (dynamic lane borrowing) that dynamically tracks link utilization and partitions the lanes in one link between receive and transmit directions. DLB allocates more lanes to transmit if servicing read-intensive applications. With more lanes allocated to either direction, DLB reduces the lane contention along that direction and thus the average memory access latency. Our experimental results show that DLB improves the bandwidth utilization by 10.4% on average, reduces the average utilization gap in two directions from 35.6% to 12.8%, and saves execution time by as much as 22.3%. © 2015 IEEE.","Hybrid memory cube; Serial link","Bandwidth; Dynamic random access storage; Geometry; Three dimensional integrated circuits; Band-width utilization; Hybrid memory; Link utilization; Memory access latency; Memory bandwidths; Modern applications; Serial link; Two directions; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962345399

A maximum likelihood estimator delivers accurate parameters to the gamma CDF. To reduce intra-hour power variations, a generic ESS is incorporated with the wind farm.

This includes the consumption of energy across the plant as well as the inventory buildup. To reduce the cost of energy purchased from the electric utility, the plant operator may use the available on-site generation or reschedule the operation of one or more workstations so that the plant is less heavily operational during peak-load hours when the price of electricity is high. All this must be done while considering the interdependencies between various workstations as well as the target production level (and possible penalties in case it is not met). These factors turn the energy management problem into a constrained optimization one where the operational constraints of the workstations, the capacity limits of available energy resources, and the financial information are all taken into account. Developing such a solution is the focus of the current paper. A nonlinear mixed-integer optimization problem is formulated here that tries to optimize the performance of an industrial plant subject to the above operational and technical constraints.

Utility grid managers spend significant resources towards predicting and matching available power generation capacity to demand in real time. It is therefore essential for the success of the power industry that economic dispatch, energy efficiency, and grid security be maintained as power requirements change. This is especially challenging for microgrids during periods of peak demand due to limited available capacity. Data centers possess a unique requirement for short-term battery power supply where cost savings, emissions reduction, and reliability enhancement can be achieved through investment in additional battery capacity. To maximize these benefits, an optimization methodology is presented through a case study for an existing data center and microgrid.

Targeted at toe placement in the sagittal plane, the mechanism applies two direct-drive brushless dc motors to a symmetric five bar linkage arranged to power free tangential motion and compliant radial motion associated with running, leaping, and related agile locomotion behaviors. Whereas traditional leg design typically decouples the consideration of motor sizing, kinematics and compliance, we examine their conjoined influence on three key characteristics of the legged locomotion cycle: transducing battery energy to body energy during stance; mitigating collision losses upon toe touchdown; and storing and harvesting prior body energy in the spring during stance. This analysis leads to an unconventional design whose 'knee' joint rides above the 'hip' joint. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting mechanism can deliver more than half again as much kinetic energy to the body (or more than double the kinetic energy if the full workspace is used), and offers a five-fold increase in energy storage and collision efficiency relative to the conventional design. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Brushless DC motors; Compliant mechanisms; DC motors; Design; Intelligent robots; Joints (anatomy); Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Robots; Collision efficiency; Conventional design; Five-bar linkages; Key characteristics; Legged locomotion; Locomotion behavior; Parallel springs; Tangential motions; Machine design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958163414

Electrochemical characterization of the hierarchical NiO supercapacitor electrodes revealed a 25-fold increase in charge capacity compared to a planar NiO, and demonstrated excellent cycle stability over 1500 charge/discharge cycles at 2 mA/cm2. This study leverages the unique bio-nanoscaffolds for small scale energy storage devices through further optimization of the hierarchical structures and wetting techniques for significant improvements in micro/nano scale energy storage devices. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Capacitors; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytic capacitors; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Nanotechnology; Nickel oxide; Self assembly; Viruses; Charge/discharge cycle; Electrochemical characterizations; Electrode structure; Fabrication and characterizations; Hierarchical structures; Nickel oxides (NiO); Supercapacitor electrodes; Tobacco mosaic virus; Aspect ratio",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960172317

Here, we design multiple knapsack problems for each hour of a day to schedule different numbers of appliance. To avoid peak hours, load is shifted in low and mid peak hours. Different algorithms are used to schedule household appliances. We use ant colony optimization (ACO) that is one of the meta-heuristic techniques to solve multiple knapsack problems which enables fast convergence rate for scheduling of appliances.

Fundamental dielectric theory suggests that strongly dipolar polymers have the potential to realize a high dielectric constant. In order to achieve high thermal stability, these polymers should also possess a high glass transition temperature Tg. However, it has been observed in many dielectric polymers that the dielectric constant decreases markedly at temperatures below Tg due to dipole freezing. This study shows that a high energy density polymer with low loss and high operating temperature can be realized in a family of weakly-coupled strongly-dipolar polymers, such as aromatic urea and thiourea. Our experimental results uncover that disorder (or blending) in these polymers leads to a significantly larger free volume at temperatures far below Tg, thereby enabling easier reorientation of dipoles in response to an electric field. The net result is a substantial enhancement in the dielectric constant while preserving low dielectric loss and very high breakdown field. The results here pave the way for creating high energy density polymers with low loss and high operating temperature. © 2015 IEEE.","dielectrics; dipolar polymers; energy storage; free volume","Aromatic polymers; Blending; Dielectric devices; Dielectric losses; Electric fields; Energy storage; Free volume; Glass transition; Polymers; Temperature; Thermodynamic stability; Urea; Dielectric polymers; High breakdown fields; High dielectric constants; High energy densities; High operating temperature; High thermal stability; High-glass transition temperatures; Low dielectric loss; Dielectric materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959488099

Although many investigations have been concerned with aldehyde, the chemical basis for its effect in this system has remained obscure. The light-emitting reaction involves the transfer of electrons from reduced flavin mononucleotide to oxygen with the concomitant emission of light. The aldehyde has a role which, in effect, may best be described as being analogous to a coupling factor. It has an effect upon the relative ehemihimi-nescence quantum yield. If aldehyde is added to an in vitro reaction, the rate of electron flow through the system is not changed, but the light intensity is greatly increased. A number of different studies which lead to this conclusion are described.

The questions, then, are what and how accelerators should be designed, and what software support is required. Our accelerator design approach stems from the observation that many efficient and portable software implementations rely on high performance software libraries with well-established application programming interfaces (APIs). We propose the integration of hardware accelerators on 3D-stacked memory that explicitly targets the memory-bounded operations within high performance libraries. The fixed APIs with limited configurability simplify the design of the accelerators, while ensuring that the accelerators have wide applicability. With our software support that automatically converts library APIs to accelerator invocations, an additional advantage of our approach is that library-based legacy code automatically gains the benefit of memory-side accelerators without requiring a reimplementation. On average, the legacy code using our proposed MEmory Accelerated Library (MEALib) improves performance and energy efficiency for individual operations in Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) by 38x and 75x, respectively. For a real-world signal processing application that employs Intel MKL, MEALib attains more than 10x better energy efficiency. © 2015 ACM.","3D DRAM; accelerator; energy efficiency; library","Acceleration; Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer architecture; Dynamic random access storage; Hardware; Libraries; Particle accelerators; Reconfigurable hardware; Signal processing; Three dimensional integrated circuits; 3d drams; 3D-stacked memory; Accelerator design; Hardware accelerators; Heterogeneous systems; High-performance libraries; Signal processing applications; Software libraries; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959923571

In contrast, this work proposes utilizing cache compression to improve application throughput for manycore processors while potentially harming single-stream performance. The growing interest in throughput-oriented manycore architectures and widening disparity between on-chip resources and off-chip bandwidth motivate re-evaluation of utilizing costly compression to conserve off-chip memory bandwidth. This work proposes MORC, a Many-core ORiented Compressed Cache architecture that compresses hundreds of cache lines together to maximize compression ratio. By looking across cache lines, MORC is able to achieve compression ratios beyond compression schemes which only compress within a single cache line. MORC utilizes a novel log-based cache organization which selects cache lines that are filled into the cache close in time as candidates to compress together. The proposed design not only compresses cache data, but also cache tags together to further save storage. Future manycore processors will likely have reduced cache sizes and less bandwidth per core than current multicore processors.

Depending on the layout of the data structure in physical address space, some access patterns result in non-unit strides. In existing systems, which are optimized to store and access cache lines, non-unit strided accesses exhibit low spatial locality. Therefore, they incur high latency, and waste memory bandwidth and cache space. We propose the Gather-Scatter DRAM (GS-DRAM) to address this problem. We observe that a commodity DRAM module contains many chips. Each chip stores a part of every cache line mapped to the module. Our idea is to enable the memory controller to access multiple values that belong to a strided pattern from different chips using a single read/write command. To realize this idea, GS-DRAM first maps the data of each cache line to different chips such that multiple values of a strided access pattern are mapped to different chips. Second, instead of sending a separate address to each chip, GS-DRAM maps each strided pattern to a small pattern ID that is communicated to the module. Based on the pattern ID, each chip independently computes the address of the value to be accessed. The cache line returned by the module contains different values of the strided pattern gathered from different chips. We show that this approach enables GS-DRAM to achieve near-ideal memory bandwidth and cache utilization for many common access patterns. We design an end-to-end system to exploit GS-DRAM. Our evaluations show that 1) for in-memory databases, GS-DRAM obtains the best of the row store and the column store layouts, in terms of both performance and energy, and 2) for matrix-matrix multiplication, GS-DRAM seamlessly enables SIMD optimizations and outperforms the best tiled layout. Our framework is general, and can benefit many modern data-intensive applications. © 2015 ACM.","caches; DRAM; energy; in-memory databases; memory bandwidth; performance; SIMD; strided accesses","Bandwidth; Computer architecture; Data structures; Dynamic random access storage; Integrated circuit layout; Matrix algebra; Physical addresses; caches; energy; Memory bandwidths; Memory database; performance; SIMD; strided accesses; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959901187

Whether it be on large-scale GPUs, future thousand-core chips, or across million-core warehouse scale computers, having shared memory, even to a limited extent, improves programmability. This work sidesteps the traditional challenges of creating massively scalable cache coherence by restricting coherence to flexible subsets (domains) of a system's total cores and home nodes. This paper proposes Coherence Domain Restriction (CDR), a novel coherence framework that enables the creation of thousand to million core systems that use shared memory while maintaining low storage and energy overhead. Inspired by the observation that the majority of cache lines are only shared by a subset of cores either due to limited application parallelism or limited page sharing, CDR restricts the coherence domain from global cache coherence to VM-level, application-level, or page-level. We explore two types of restriction, one which limits the total number of sharers that can access a coherence domain and one which limits the number and location of home nodes that partake in a coherence domain. Each independent coherence domain only tracks the cores in its domain instead of the whole system, thereby removing the need for a coherence scheme built on top of CDR to scale. Sharer Restriction achieves constant storage overhead as core count increases while Home Restriction provides localized communication enabling higher performance. Unlike previous systems, CDR is flexible and does not restrict the location of the home nodes or sharers within a domain. We evaluate CDR in the context of a 1024-core chip and in the novel application of shared memory to a 1,000,000-core warehouse scale computer. Sharer Restriction results in significant area savings, while Home Restriction in the 1024-core chip and 1,000,000-core system increases performance by 29% and 23.04x respectively when comparing with global home placement. We implemented the entire CDR framework in a 25-core processor taped out in IBM's 32nm SOI process and present a detailed area characterization. © 2015 ACM.","cache coherence; home placement; shared memory","Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Computer architecture; Large scale systems; Memory architecture; Occupational risks; Program processors; Warehouses; Application level; Cache Coherence; Energy overheads; home placement; Novel applications; Programmability; Shared memory; Storage overhead; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959886551

Unfortunately, runahead has the disadvantage of requiring the front-end to remain active to supply instructions. We propose a new structure (the Runahead Buffer) for supplying these instructions. We note that cache misses are often caused by repetitive, short dependence chains. We store these dependence chains in the runahead buffer. During runahead, the runahead buffer is used to supply instructions. This generates 2x more MLP than traditional runahead on average because the core can run further ahead. It also saves energy since the front-end can be clock-gated, reducing dynamic energy consumption. Over a no-prefetching/prefetching baseline, the result is a performance benefit of 17.2%/7.8% and an energy reduction of 6.7%/4.5% respectively. Traditional runahead with additional energy optimizations results in a performance benefit of 12.1%/5.9% but an energy increase of 9.5%/5.4%. Finally, we propose a hybrid policy that switches between the runahead buffer and traditional runahead, maximizing performance. © 2015 ACM.","energy efficiency; memory wall; runahead execution","Chains; Computer architecture; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Dynamic energy consumption; Energy optimization; Instruction windows; Memory level parallelisms; Memory wall; Out-of-order processors; Performance benefits; Runahead execution; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959873686

Evaluation on realistic workloads shows that UAP implements all models efficiently, achieving line rates 94.5% of ideal. A single UAP lane delivers line rates 50x greater than software approaches on CPUs and GPUs. Scaling UAP to 64 lanes achieves FA transition throughputs as high as 295 Gbps, more than 100x higher than CPUs and GPUs, and even exceeding ASIC approaches such as IBM's RegX by 6x. With efficient support for multiple input streams, UAP achieves throughputs that saturate even high speed stacked DRAM memory systems. The UAP design and implementation is efficient in instructions executed, memory references, and energy. UAP achieves a 1.2 Ghz clock rate (32nm TSMC CMOS), and a 64-lane UAP requires only 2.2 mm2 and 563 mW.

DDRx, the most broadly adopted family of DRAM interfaces, contributes significantly to the overall system energy in a wide range of computer systems. To reduce the energy cost of data transfers, DDR4 adopts a pseudo open-drain IO circuit that consumes power only when transmitting or receiving a 0, which makes the IO energy proportional to the number of 0s transferred over the data bus. A data bus invert (DBI) coding technique is therefore supported by the DDR4 standard to encode each byte using a small number of 0s. Although sparse coding techniques that are more advanced than DBI can reduce the IO power further, the relatively high bandwidth overhead of these codes has heretofore prevented their application to the DDRx bus. This paper presents MiL (More is Less), a novel data communication framework built on top of DDR4, which exploits the data bus under-utilization caused by DRAM timing constraints to selectively apply sparse codes, thereby reducing the IO energy without compromising system performance. Evaluation results on a set of eleven parallel applications show that MiL can reduce the average IO interface energy by 49%, and the average DRAM system energy by 8% when added on top of a conventional DDR4 system, with less than 2% performance degradation on average. © 2015 ACM.","energy-efficient design; memory interfaces; sparse representation","Buses; Codes (symbols); Computer architecture; Cost reduction; Data transfer; Dynamic random access storage; Program processors; System buses; Timing circuits; Data-communication; Energy-efficient design; Evaluation results; Memory interface; Parallel application; Performance degradation; Sparse representation; Timing constraints; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959860282

One solution to storage and transmission of data is compression using specialized compression algorithms. The existing specialized algorithms suffer from poor scalability with increasing size of the datasets and best available solutions can take hours to compress gigabytes of data. Compression and decompression using these techniques for peta-scale data sets is prohibitively expensive in terms of time and energy. In this paper we introduce paraDSRC, a parallel implementation of the DNA Sequence Reads Compression (DSRC) application using a message passing model that presents reduction of the compression time complexity by a factor of O(1/p) (where p is the number of processing units). Our experimental results show that paraDSRC achieves compression times that are 43% to 99% faster than DSRC and compression throughputs of up to 8.4GB/s on a moderate size cluster. For many of the datasets used in our experiments super-linear speedups have been registered making the implementation strongly scalable. We also show that paraDSRC is more than 25.6x faster than comparable parallel compression algorithms.

Further, as renewables enjoy broadening commercial implementation, power electronics professionals are interested to learn of the challenges and strategies particular to applications in alternative energy.

AMI is an enabling technology for Smart Grid (SG) and hence represents a privileged target for security attacks with potentially great damage against infrastructures and privacy. For this reason, security has been identified as one of the most challenging topics in AMI development, and designing an efficient Key Management Scheme (KMS) is one of first important steps. In this paper, we propose a new scalable and efficient key management scheme that we call Efficient and Scalable multi-group Key Management for AMI (eSKAMI) to secure data communications in an Advanced Metering Infrastructure. It is a key management scheme that can support unicast, multicast and broadcast communications based on an efficient Multi-group Key graph technique. An analysis of security and performance, and a comparision of our scheme with recently proposed schemes show that our KMS induces low storage overhead compared to existing solutions (reduction reaches 83%) without increasing the communication overhead. © 2015 IEEE.","Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI); Key Management Scheme (KMS); Security; Smart Grid (SG)","Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Smart power grids; Communication overheads; Enabling technologies; Key management schemes; Multicast and broadcast communications; Security; Security and performance; Security attacks; Smart grid; Advanced metering infrastructures",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84967019264

The 1-transistor-1-resistor (1T1R) ReRAM array has density comparable to that of a DRAM array and the advantages of lower programming energy and higher reliability compared to the ultra-high density ReRAM cross-point array. In this paper, we propose several novel write strategies for 1T1R ReRAM aiming at high performance, low power and high reliability. We reduce the write latency significantly compared to the baseline scheme by using the same WL voltages and improve energy consumption and endurance by choosing proper set line, bit line and word line settings. The SPICE simulation results demonstrate that appropriate choice of circuit operation parameters can help obtain 10× improvement in lifetime with 33.6% reduction in energy compared to the baseline. Also, among all proposed systems, configurations which consume higher write energy also have higher endurance. We evaluate the system-level parameters of a 1GB ReRAM memory using CACTI and GEM5. We show that all the proposed ReRAM systems can achieve a lifetime of 30 years by employing error control coding (ECC). Finally, we show that the ReRAM based main memory can outperform DRAM main memory with respect to IPC (5.5% higher) and energy consumption (39.4% lower) through proper choice of write scheme configurations. © 2015 IEEE.","1T1R ReRAM; energy; IPC; latency; main memory; reliability","Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Random access storage; Reliability; Signal processing; SPICE; Efficiency and reliability; energy; Error control coding; latency; Low stand-by power; Main memory; Resistive rams (ReRAM); Ultrahigh density; RRAM",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958212264

This book First presents a review of recently developed models for solving prediction, analysis or fault detection/diagnosis of building energy consumption, including detailed and simplified engineering methods, statistical methods and artificial intelligence methods. Then, the methodology to simulate energy consumption profiles for single and multiple buildings is presented. Based on these datasets, support vector machine (SVM) models are trained and tested to do the prediction. The results from extensive experiments demonstrate high-prediction accuracy and robustness of these models. A recursive deterministic perceptron (RDP) neural network model is then used to detect and diagnose faulty building energy consumption. In the experiment, the RDP model shows a very high-detection ability. A new approach, based on the evaluation of RDP models, is also proposed here to diagnose faults. Since the selection of subsets of features significantly infiuences the performance of the model, the optimal features are selected based on the feasibility of obtaining them and on the scores they provide under the evaluation of two filter methods. Experimental results confirm the validity of the selected subsets and show that the proposed feature selection method guarantees the model accuracy and reduces the computational time. One challenge of predicting building energy consumption is to accelerate the model training when amounts of data are very large. To address this issue, this book proposes an efficient parallel implementation of SVMs based on the decomposition method. The parallelization is performed on the most time-consuming part of the training. The underlying parallelism is conducted with a shared memory Map-Reduce paradigm, making the system particularly suitable for multicore and multiprocessor systems. Experimental results show that our original implementation offers a high speedup compared to Libsvm, and it is superior to the state-of-the-art message passing interface (MPI) implementation of Pisvm in both computational time and storage requirement. © 2014 by The Chartered Institute of Building.

However, the benefit of utilizing RE is limited by its highly intermittent and unreliable nature leading to mismatch between generation and base station (BS) needs, resulting in low savings in grid power. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel base station time resource allocation technique using data storage at user equipments (UEs) to optimally utilize renewable energy to reduce grid power consumption. The proposed approach transforms the surplus RE (in excess of the BS power requirements) to excess data delivered to the users and stored in UE data storages, to draw from in deficit periods (when RE generation is lesser than BS requirements) to reduce grid power. Though the proposed approach is applicable to any application that utilizes UE data buffer, we formulate the problem for mobile video and propose a algorithm for RE aware BS resource allocation during mobile video download, as the latter will dominate wireless traffic and hence BS power consumption. Our experimental results using sample solar and BS utilization traces demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to reduce grid power consumption by increasing solar power utilization while satisfying user QoS requirements. © 2015 IEEE.","Base station power consumption; Grid power consumption; Mobile video; Renewable energy; UE data buffer","Base stations; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Electric power utilization; Global warming; Internet; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Radio communication; Resource allocation; Solar energy; Wireless networks; Base station power; Carbon dioxide emissions; Data buffers; Mobile video; Power requirement; Renewable energies; Resource allocation techniques; Use of renewable energies; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958044887

Energy supply based on renewable energy source is one of the promising solutions for now or in the future to deal with the limited fossil fuel resources as well as the emission of harmful waste. Out of various renewable resources the sun, wind and biomass associated with energy storage are considered to hold one of the most promising alternative to the electricity crisis in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Using renewable energy generators at the location of high harvest potential, appropriate rating and location of storage and transmission system between different regions, a cost efficient system can be achieved. This study facilitates the best storage system associated with the integration of renewable energy technology into the multiple DRC power plant systems.

Thus energy efficient IT (or Green IT), is an area that should grab their interest. Most schools in the U.S. use IT as a tool with their instruction. The student will need to understand the basics on data centers since data centers house the servers that students access when they use Google, Facebook, or any of the many Internet applications used by all users, young and old. This paper provides an overview on how Green IT is an excellent topic for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). An important aspect of the STEM project would be data centers. Data centers are found in nearly every sector of the economy including financial services, media, high-tech, universities, and government institutions. Dramatic server growth at data centers is indicated by well known web services such as Google, Amazon, and eBay. Estimates indicate that Google maintains over 450,000 servers, arranged in racks located in clusters in cities around the world. Google has major data centers in California, Virginia, Georgia, Ireland, and new facilities in Oregon and Belgium. In 2009 Google opened one of its first sites in the upper Midwest in Council Bluffs, Iowa, close to abundant wind power resources for fulfilling green energy objectives and proximate to fiber optic communications links. There are also thousands of servers for Amazon.com and eBay. It is estimated that the Second Life Internet-based virtual world launched in 2003 has over 9,000 servers. Even with these large numbers of current servers, IBM Consulting estimates that in the next decade server shipments will grow by six times and data storage by an amazing 69-fold. Green energy efficient data centers will help us reduce greenhouse gases - which in turn will help reduce global warming. The ongoing UN and White House sessions on climate change emphasize the environmental importance of green projects. Although the extent of the Global Warming danger may continue to be open to debate, implementing Green Data Centers presents a significant opportunity for all of us to help reduce greenhouse gasses.

This paper presents our work on the design and detailed energy efficiency analysis of three types of 32- and 64-bit RQL multi-ported pipelined local storage structures (13 total), namely 1) random access memory (RAM) and register files, 2) direct-mapped write-through and write-back caches, and 3) first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffers. Our layout-aware cell-level design process uses a VHDL RQL cell library developed at the Ultra High Speed Computing Laboratory at Stony Brook University (SBU). The SBU VHDL RQL cell library specifies the dynamic and standby energy consumption, gate delays, a number of Josephson junctions (JJs) per cell, and approximate sizes of individual cells based on the parameters of the 248 nm 100 μA/μm2 10 Nb metal layer SFQ fabrication process currently under development at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Gate and wire delays as well as clock skew are taken into account during digital circuit simulation done with Mentor Graphics CAD tools. After completing a physical chip layout, the circuit models need to be updated and re-simulated to include the effects of parasitic inductances and actual wire lengths on signal propagation delays. To meet both performance and energy efficiency targets, the RQL storage structures were designed with RQL non-destructive read-out single-bit storage cells. We chose a relatively moderate clock frequency of 8.5 GHz for all storage units to keep their read latencies in the range of 1- 3 cycles. The most complex design in terms of JJs is a tripleported 4 Kbit 64x64-bit register file with 253,918 JJs and its read access latency of 338 ps. The highest energy consumption in terms of energy/operation/bit (∼9.5 aJ at 4.2 K) is for a write hit in a 2 Kbit 32-bit wide write-back cache. The average energy consumption of the RQL storage designs varies from ∼1.6 aJ/operation/bit for a small 4x32-bit FIFO to 7.3 aJ/operation/bit for the 2 Kbit write-back cache at 4.2 K. Given the cryocooler efficiency of 0.1%, this means the energy consumption of ∼1.6-7.3 fJ/operation/bit at room temperature. The physical implementation of the RQL storage units will become feasible upon the development of the target MIT fabrication process and CAD tools for VLSI RQL chip design in 2015-2016. © 2015 IEEE.","energy efficiency; high performance computing; high-speed memory; Josephson junctions; superconductor processors","Cache memory; Circuit simulation; Clocks; Computation theory; Computer aided design; Delay circuits; Design; Energy utilization; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuit layout; Josephson junction devices; Niobium; Quantum theory; Random access storage; Reconfigurable hardware; Structural design; Superconducting materials; VLSI circuits; Energy efficiency analysis; Energy efficient computing; High performance computing; High-speed memory; Josephson; Nondestructive read-out; Signal propagation delays; Single flux quantum technologies; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958817359

In such shared environments, cluster schedulers typically utilize preemption by simply killing jobs in order to achieve resource priority and fairness during peak utilization. This can cause significant resource waste and delay job response time. In this paper, we propose using suspend-resume mechanisms to mitigate the overhead of preemption in cluster scheduling. Instead of killing preempted jobs or tasks, our approach uses a system level, application-transparent checkpointing mechanism to save the progress of jobs for resumption at a later time when resources are available. To reduce the preemption overhead and improve job response times, our approach uses adaptive preemption to dynamically select appropriate preemption mechanisms (e.g., kill vs. suspend, local vs. remote restore) according to the progress of a task and its suspend-resume overhead. By leveraging fast storage technologies, such as non-volatile memory (NVM), our approach can further reduce the preemption penalty to provide better QoS and resource efficiency. We implement the proposed approach and conduct extensive experiments via Google cluster trace-driven simulations and applications on a Hadoop cluster. The results demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce the resource and power usage and improve application performance over existing approaches. In particular, our implementation on the next generation Hadoop YARN platform achieves up to a 67% reduction in resource wastage, 30% improvement in overall job response time times and 34% reduction in energy consumption over the current YARN scheduler. © 2015 ACM.","Cloud computing; Cluster resource management; Scheduling","Cloud computing; Cluster computing; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Energy utilization; Middleware; Scheduling; Wool; Yarn; Application performance; Non-volatile memory; Pre-emptive scheduling; Preemption penalties; Resource efficiencies; Resource management; Storage technology; Trace driven simulation; Reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966800347

This problem has stimulated a great deal of interest to research alternative technologies, which may overcome the constraints inherent to complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-based circuitry and provide a route to more functional and less power-consuming logic devices. Spintronics is one of the possible directions [2]. The utilization of spin opened a new horizon for the development of non-volatile memory and logic elements. It also offers novel approaches to data transfer. The integration of the spin-based components will require new architecture solutions. In this work, we discuss the possibility of building Magnonic Holographic Co-Processor (MHcP) aimed to complement CMOS in special task data processing. The main advantage of MHcP is combination of memory and logic in one unit. This idea is illustrated in Figure 1. On the left side, it is shown the Von Neumann architecture scheme.

In contemporary implementations, as illustrated in Figure 1a, optical transceivers (such as SFP and QSFP modules and AOCs) are located at the card edge. In such an architecture increasing data rates aggravate electrical signal integrity issues due to reflections at optical connectors and losses (dielectric and skin-effect) in the relatively long traces on the card PCBA connecting the electrical pads of the switch chip with the fingers of the transceiver module. To overcome those challenges, advanced (power hungry) electrical I/Os (re-timers, equalizers,) on the ASIC and the optical transceivers are required. Also advanced (costly) PCB materials may be needed. An approach to reduce those signal integrity problems is to reduce the distance between the optical transceivers and the ASIC by moving the transceivers from the board edge to the inside of the shelf as illustrated in Figure 1b. Here the optical signals are routed to the front panel by means of optical fibers. As an additional benefit, embedding the transceivers in the card may increase the achievable density at the card edge. However, it also adds more stringent reliability and thermal management requirements for the optical transceivers. An example is the IBM Power 775 System where transceivers are located around a HUB ASIC [1]. The most ideal solution has the ASIC and the optical transceivers integrated or co-packaged as shown in Figure.2c. This approach virtually eliminates the signal integrity challenges and enables the highest interconnect density. © 2015 IEEE.","Application specific integrated circuits; Biomedical optical imaging; High-speed optical techniques; Optical fibers; Optical interconnections; Transceivers","Application specific integrated circuits; Busbars; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Optical fibers; Optical interconnects; Optical switches; Transceivers; Biomedical optical imaging; High speed optical techniques; High-speed interfaces; Interconnect densities; Optical interconnect; Optoelectronic integration; Signal-integrity problems; Transceiver modules; Optical transceivers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962069223

They are also concerned about the potential end of 'Moore's law'. This has led to an increased interest in artificial neural networks, and neuromorphic hardware that can support these systems. It is well known that the brain is power efficient and naturally fault tolerant. Therefore, much research is being done on how silicon can support neural architectures to achieve greater power efficiency and greater storage density. I will make two main arguments. 1) Neuron models need to support active dendrites and thousands of synapses Biological neurons have thousands of synapses which are arranged along dendrites. Dendrites are themselves active processing elements. However, lacking a theory of why neurons have active dendrites, almost all artificial neural networks, such as those used in deep learning, use artificial neurons without active dendrites and with unrealistically few synapses. We now know that active dendrites combined with sparse activations allow individual neurons to recognize hundreds of unique patterns [1], [2]. This enables neurons to learn sequences of patterns which is necessary sensory inference and behavior. Neuromorphic HW needs to accommodate these more complex neuron models. 2) Learning in neural tissue is achieved via rewiring, not synaptic weight change Almost all artificial neural networks are built upon the assumption that learning is achieved via changes in the strength of synapses. However, we now know that most of learning in the cortex occurs via the growth of new synapses [3]. Memory is a rewiring problem, not a storage problem. This has important consequences in the design of neuromorphic systems at the level of the synapse and at the systems level. I will present a theory of how biological neurons with active dendrites work together in large networks to do inference and prediction in sensory data streams [4], [5]. Such networks are naturally fault tolerant due to the mathematics of sparse representations [6]. I will argue that these networks will form the basis of machine intelligence. To build systems that are as capable as biological brains will require the creation of new HW architectures that support neurons with active dendrites and large-scale rewiring. © 2015 IEEE.","Artificial neural networks; Brain models; Computer architecture; Neuromorphics; Neurons","Artificial intelligence; Brain models; Complex networks; Computer architecture; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Fault tolerance; Network architecture; Neurons; Semiconductor growth; Growth opportunities; Machine intelligence; Neumann architecture; Neuromorphic hardwares; Neuromorphic systems; Neuromorphics; Semiconductor manufacturers; Sparse representation; Neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962068710

For the first 25 years of the computer industry, this was very sound advice because there was virtually no relationship between the operating temperature of enterprise computing servers and their energy efficiency. But for the most recent several years, this is no longer the case. Extensive Oracle research has demonstrated that with the latest generations of enterprise computing servers there are now strongly-coupled temperature-accelerated wastage mechanisms in IT server and storage systems that not only waste significant energy in warm data centers, but also degrade compute performance. This presentation shows novel Oracle temperature-aware algorithms that enable intelligent optimization of data center ambient temperatures to minimize or avoid these heretofore non-observable energy wastage mechanisms in IT systems. Oracle's suite of 'Intelligent Energy Aware Data Center' (iEADC) algorithms predict an optimal ambient temperature set point, eliminating energy wastage throughout the data center, significantly increasing overall compute performance, decreasing the carbon footprint, while increasing return-on-assets for data center owners. © 2015 IEEE.","Air conditioning; Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Optimization; Servers; Temperature distribution; Vibrations","Air conditioning; Artificial intelligence; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Digital storage; Energy conservation; Optimization; Power management; Servers; Temperature; Temperature distribution; Computer industry; Enterprise computing; Enterprise servers; Intelligent energies; Intelligent optimization; Operating temperature; Temperature optimization; Vibrations; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962053206

The raw compute power of these heterogeneous systems greatly exceeds the current prevailing homogenous systems, motivating their rapid adoption. These heterogeneous systems do however increase the complexity of developing parallel applications and there is a need to investigate the compute performances and associated power consumption of common benchmarks and scientific computing applications.

The high performance Linpack (HPL) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulators including NAMD, LAMMPS and GROMACS are tested. Through comparing 4-K80 and 2-Xeon E5-2690 v3 systems, we show that: (1) for HPL tests, the 4- GPU server delivers up to 7 TFLOPS that is 9 times faster than the 2-CPU system and its power efficiency is 4 GFLOPS per Watt, (2) for MD tests, NAMD on 4-GPU server achieves 7.8 times speedup and it uses 2.3 times power consumption compared to 2-CPU system, and LAMMPS achieves 16 times speedup and it uses 2.6 times power consumption, and GROMACS achieves 3.3 times speed up and it uses 2.6 times power consumption.

While mechanisms are in place to correct or at least detect soft errors, a percentage of those errors pass unnoticed by the system. Such silent errors are extremely damaging because they can make applications produce wrong results.

Through extensively investigating plenty of productions in the market, Oracle database is a leading solution for business critical application. As a cost effective solution, it could reduce business risk and achieve data availability, performance, and Return on Investment (ROI). On the other aspect, high-end storage solution, Storage Area Network (SAN) based on Fibre Channel protocol can be easy to deploy with Oracle database and match end-user's requirements. In this paper, we will present a design of high available database on a new reference architecture. The implementation of design is based on Oracle database with Dell Acceleration Appliances for Databases (DAAD), which introduces flash technology by Fusion-IO. To demonstrate practical performances, we built a proof-ofconcept platform and compared the platform with a traditional 96-SAS-drive platform. The results show that our approach can deliver more than 1-million random Input/output Operations per Second (IOPS) that is 27 times faster than the traditional platform and it can also achieve a 96% reduction in the latencies, thus showing the scalability of the approach with massive database nodes. Therefore, our approach provides not only an ultra-fast storage solution to boost database performances but it also offers a flexible and high available design to achieve zero-downtime database. © 2015 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Database; Flash technology; High availability; Storage","Availability; Cloud computing; Computers; Cost effectiveness; Database systems; Design; Digital storage; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Energy storage; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Safety engineering; Security of data; Cost-effective solutions; Critical applications; Database performance; Fibre channel protocols; Flash technology; High availability; Reference architecture; Storage area networks; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961710676

The models used in these analyses have been developed based on an integrated state-space equation set for the converters and the battery.

The proposed control scheme utilizes day-Ahead forecasts of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power output obtained from hybrid intelligent methods. Once the forecasts are obtained, unit commitment (UC) is executed using forecasted data of load as well as wind and PV power in order to schedule optimal generation. The operational decisions are then fed into the economic dispatch (ED) problem, which has the control scheme embedded. As the actual power output of wind-PV deviates from the desired value due to forecast error, the adaptive control scheme developed in this paper assists the ESS to compensate the difference by charging or discharging. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, this paper considers a case study of a sixteen-bus test system and the results indicate that the ESS can reduce the deviation of the wind-PV power output between 1-5%. © 2015 IEEE.","Distribution system planning; economic dispatch; energy storage; renewable energy forecasting; unit commitment","Adaptive control systems; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power distribution; Electric power system control; Energy storage; Forecasting; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Thermoelectric power; Adaptive control schemes; Distribution system planning; Economic Dispatch; Economic dispatch problems; Hybrid intelligent method; Renewable energies; Smart distribution networks; Unit-commitment; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961777758

Renewable and sustainable energy sources such as wind generation offer a solution to this problem and are thus gaining more importance. The wind power tends to be fluctuating due to intermittency of wind speed which varies in unpredictable ways. Wind energy fluctuates, which can result in frequency and voltage deviations in the grid. In this paper, a design of energy storage, which can be utilized in the energy market, is described. The objective of the energy storage is to reduce the effects of intermittent power generated from wind farms. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem in which the objective function measures the annual revenue gained from utilizing the storage in the energy market. The result of the optimization gives the optimal size of energy storage that maximizes the annual revenue.

We propose AYUSH, a technique for improving lifetime of SRAM-NVM hybrid caches. AYUSH uses data-migration approach to preferentially utilize SRAM for storing write-intensive data. Microarchitectural simulations have shown that AYUSH provides larger improvement in lifetime than three previous techniques. For single, dual and quad-core system configurations, the average increase in cache lifetime with AYUSH is 6.90×, 24.06× and 47.62×, respectively.

It has been exploited to work in concert or alone inside various memory systems to meet the growing bandwidth needs of massive parallelism. PCM memory cells, however, have a common problem of limited write endurance. Various wear-leaving techniques have been employed for uniform distribution of memory writes, typically through address transformation schemes such as randomization to avoid hot writes. Unfortunately, such address transformation can have the undesirable consequence of disrupting the row buffer locality in sequential memory accesses, resulting in the loss of memory performance. Our analysis reveals that this situation is particularly severe under massive parallelism of manycore processors such as GPUs. In this paper, we introduce a combination of two techniques, matrix-based partial randomization and rowbuffer locality-aware rotation, to alleviate the locality disruption of address transformation and preserve the row buffer locality of PCM-based global memory in GPU.

Combining DRAM and non-volatile memory (NVM) has been proposed to increase capacity and reliability, and to decrease energy consumption. Software-managed hybrid memory is a promising way to incorporate NVM in main memory due to its architectural simplicity. However, there are significant performance issues caused by interference due to data migration between DRAM and NVM and a lack of effective migration policies. To aid in the development of migration policies and hardware mechanisms for incorporating NVM in main memory, we propose new analysis and simulation techniques to understand the behavior of software-managed hybrid memory. These techniques allow us to characterize the overhead experienced by requests in the memory hierarchy and identify the factors that limit performance in software-managed hybrid memory. Using our techniques, we show that queuing delays at the NVM banks and NVM bus are the main limiting factors, and that there is significant potential to improve performance with better migration policies. © 2015 IEEE.","Analytical models; Hardware; Interference; Limiting; Memory management; Nonvolatile memory; Random access memory","Analytical models; Computer hardware; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage; Energy utilization; Hardware; Nonvolatile storage; Random access storage; Reconfigurable hardware; Wave interference; Analysis and simulation; Hybrid main memory; Improve performance; Limiting; Memory management; Non-volatile memory; Performance issues; Random access memory; Computer software",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962239488

However, employing them efficiently, given system and application characteristics, is often a daunting task. A goal of this work is to propose a general model that predicts performance and power requirements for an application, computational portions of which are offloaded to an accelerator. Intel Xeon Phi is the only accelerator type investigated here, and only in offload execution mode. This mode is also employed by other accelerator types, such as GPU; thus the proposed model is applicable directly. The predictive capabilities of the model are demonstrated by determining the best hardware-software configuration instances with respect to the minimum energy consumption for the CoMD proxy application executed on single or multiple nodes. For the CoMD problem sizes investigated here, the best modeled configuration was relatively close to the best measured configuration with relative error under 5% of the energy consumed for most configurations. Initial model validation also confirmed the model accuracy for a variety of model parameters, such as host computation time and power consumption on the host and accelerator. The model also provides estimates of the total data movement and computational throughput as well as of some key metrics, such as FLOPs-per-joule and bytes-per-joule, which are commonly used to study the energy-performance trade-offs.

Whether large amounts of data transfer occur before, during or after an application is executed, this cost must be considered. Not just in terms of performance (e.g. time to completion), but also in terms of power consumed to complete these necessary tasks. At the system level, scheduling and resource management tools are capable of recording performance metrics and other constraints, and making performance aware decisions. These tools are a natural choice for making power aware decisions, as well. More specifically, power aware decisions about data transfer costs for the entire application workow. This research focuses on developing data motion power cost models and integrating these models into a task scheduler framework to enable complete power aware scheduling of an entire HPC workow. We have taken an incremental approach to developing a hierarchical, system wide power model for data motion that starts with core data motion and will eventually encompass data motion across facilities.

Although such runtimes are typically used to run a single application at a time, a common HPC scenario involves running a producer simulation application co-located with a consumer analytics application, to reduce data movement costs. The potentially diverse requirements of such co-located applications present challenges to the ability of the runtime to efficiently manage underlying resources, maintain application performance, and minimize sharing effects on application progress. To address this, we implement and study techniques based on application task characterization to improve resource utilization in shared task-based runtimes. We demonstrate that, by maintaining tasks characteristics, such as their compute, cache or memory intensity, using offline and/or online methods, we can improve task-based runtimes' ability to schedule and place tasks to minimize resource contention for co-running applications. Results are obtained via experimentation with the Open Community Runtime (OCR) on two distinct platforms - an x86-based machine and a research platform based on the experimental Traleika Glacier (TG) architecture. On the x86, we see a performance improvement of 15% and on TG, we observe a reduction of energy usage by more than 50%, illustrating the potential benefits of the approach for next generation exascale platforms. © 2015 ACM.",,"Digital storage; Middleware; Application performance; Application progress; Fine-grained parallelism; Multiple applications; Resource contention; Resource utilizations; Running applications; Simulation applications; Multitasking",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009083961

The total cost of ownership is difficult to determine with these options as each has a different impact on the data center. Considering retrofit, over a new data center, introduces unforeseen variables that make cost analysis a challenge. Besides the added costs of additional infrastructure, and the cost to remove old, the upfront costs could be daunting. Therefore a cost analysis would be a study of its own. This study however hopes to reveal the resulting tradeoffs in temperature, performance, and power usage presented in the case between classical airflow based heat sink mechanisms to water provided directly at the heat sink.

Recent advances in the ARM architecture, including the introduction of 64-bit support, have only fueled more interest in ARM. While ARM-based clusters have proven to be useful for data server applications, their viability for HPC applications requires an in-depth analysis of on-node and inter-node performance. To that end, as a co-design exercise, the viability of a commercially available 64-bit ARM cluster is investigated in terms of performance and energy efficiency with the widely used quantum chemistry package GAMESS. The performance and energy efficiency metrics are also compared to a conventional x86 Intel Ivy Bridge system. A 2:1 Moonshot core to Ivy Bridge core performance ratio is observed for the GAMESS calculation types considered. Doubling the number of cores to complete the execution faster on the 64-bit ARM cluster leads to better energy efficiency compared to the Ivy Bridge system; i.e., a 32-core execution of GAMESS calculation has approximately the same performance and better energy-to-solution than a 16-core execution of the same calculation on the Ivy Bridge system.

An in-house FPGA emulator has been used to obtain memory traces for a small collection of data-centric benchmarks. Our FPGA emulator is based on a 32-bit ARM processor and non-intrusively captures complete memory access traces at only 20X slowdown from real time. We have developed tools to run combined trace fragments from multiple benchmarks on the HMC board, giving a unique capability to characterize HMC performance and power usage under a data parallel workload.

Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the de facto communication interface used as the back-end for designing applications, programming models and runtime for these systems. Slack - - the time spent by an MPI process in a single MPI call - -provides a potential for energy and power savings, if an appropriate power reduction technique such as core-idling/Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) can be applied without affecting the application's performance. Existing techniques that exploit slack for power savings assume that application behavior repeats across iterations/executions. However, an increasing use of adaptive and data-dependent workloads combined with system factors (OS noise, congestion) negates this assumption. This paper proposes and implements Energy Aware MPI (EAM) - - an application-oblivious energy-efficient MPI runtime. EAM uses a combination of communication models for common MPI primitives (point-to-point, collective, progress, blocking/non-blocking) and an online observation of slack to maximize energy efficiency and to honor performance degradation limits. Each power lever incurs time overhead, which must be amortized over slack to minimize degradation. When predicted communication time exceeds a lever overhead, the lever is used as soon as possible - - to maximize energy efficiency. When a misprediction occurs, the lever(s) are used automatically at specific intervals for amortization.

While Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) offers massive parallelism, achieving high-performance BFS on GPUs entails efficient scheduling of a large number of GPU threads and effective utilization of GPU memory hierarchy. In this paper, we present Enterprise, a new GPU-based BFS system that combines three techniques to remove potential performance bottlenecks: (1) streamlined GPU threads scheduling through constructing a frontier queue without contention from concurrent threads, yet containing no duplicated frontiers and optimized for both top-down and bottom-up BFS. (2) GPU workload balancing that classifies the frontiers based on different out-degrees to utilize the full spectrum of GPU parallel granularity, which significantly increases thread-level parallelism; and (3) GPU based BFS direction optimization quantifies the effect of hub vertices on direction-switching and selectively caches a small set of critical hub vertices in the limited GPU shared memory to reduce expensive random data accesses. We have evaluated Enterprise on a large variety of graphs with different GPU devices. Enterprise achieves up to 76 billion traversed edges per second (TEPS) on a single NVIDIA Kepler K40, and up to 122 billion TEPS on two GPUs that ranks No. 45 in the Graph 500 on November 2014.

Parallel I/O systems on large-scale HPC systems typically use several I/O servers attached to a number of hard disk drives to read and write data concurrently. As a result, the response time of individual I/O servers affects the overall I/O performance and modeling the response time distribution holds the key to estimate I/O time. Existing studies have generally considered that the response time follows a Uniform or a Normal distribution. However, none of these studies considered supercomputing environments that are actively used by a number of users to verify the existence of Uniform or Normal distributions. In this study, we collected ≈ 2,500,000 measurements on two peta-scale class supercomputers that are actively used by ≈5000 users. These two systems, Hopper and Edison at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), typically support hundreds of concurrent jobs. Our performance measurements include the overheads introduced by the entire parallel I/O stack (I/O library, network, parallel file system software, cache and hardware). Our study shows that the response time of parallel I/O system follows a heavy-tailed property, in contrary to the widely accepted Normal or Uniform distributions.

Due to the forgiving nature of these error-resilient applications, highly precise input data is not always necessary for them to produce outputs of acceptable quality. This makes memory, the place where data is stored, a suitable component for introducing errors or approximations in return for considerable energy savings. Towards this end, this paper proposes, for the first time, a systematic way for constructing a quality-aware approximate DRAM system. Our design is based upon an extensive experimental characterization of memory errors as a function of the DRAM refresh rate. Leveraging the insights gathered from this characterization, we propose four novel strategies for partitioning the DRAM into a number of quality bins based on the frequency, location, and nature of bit errors in each of the physical pages. During allocation, critical data is placed in the highest quality bin containing only accurate pages and approximate data is allocated to bins sorted in descending order of quality. We validate our proposed scheme on several error-resilient applications implemented using an Altera Stratix IV GX FPGA based Terasic TR4-230 development board containing a 1GB DDR3 DRAM module. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in the energy-quality trade-off compared to previous work and show a reduction in DRAM refresh power of up to 73% with minimal loss in output quality. © 2015 IEEE.","Approximate Computing; DRAM Power Management; Intrinsic Application Resilience; Low Power Design","Bins; Dynamic random access storage; Economic and social effects; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Errors; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Memory architecture; Program compilers; Approximate Computing; Data allocation; Design paradigm; Error-resilient; Experimental characterization; Intrinsic Application Resilience; Low-power design; Novel strategies; Integrated circuit design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962297091

Normally, principal component analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction technique, has been used for data aggregation in WSNs. However, PCA yields to data errors when the sensing data are not related. The PCA processing time is also an issue in an urgent situation that the sensing data are required to be transmitted to the base station instantly. This paper proposes a novel data aggregation mechanism for WSNs, called Adaptive-PCA. In Adaptive-PCA, PCA is performed dynamically based on the sensing data. In a normal situation, PCA is performed for data aggregation to reduce the number of transmitted packets. On the other hand, in an urgent situation, sensing data change dramatically, PCA is not performed; the sensing data are transmitted to the base station instantly. Adaptive-PCA consists of two schemes which are 1) event checker and 2) PCA data accuracy checker. These two schemes drive each sensor node whether perform PCA or instantly transmit the sensing data. The simulation results show that Adaptive-PCA adjusts the number of transmitted packets to the environmental changes. Using Adaptive-PCA, the total battery energy consumption is less than that of a traditional WSN. Also, the data accuracy of Adaptive-PCA is higher than that of Non-adaptive-PCA. © 2015 IEEE.","Adaptive-PCA; Data Aggregation; Dimensionality Reduction; Principal Component Analysis; Wireless Sensor Network","Base stations; Data reduction; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Smart sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Adaptive PCA; Battery energy; Data accuracy; Data aggregation; Dimensionality reduction; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Environmental change; Processing time; Principal component analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009165982

Our work is done in the context of synchronous data-flow models in which applications are implemented as a graph of components that exchange data at fixed and known rates over FIFO channels. In this paper, we show that it is feasible to leverage the restricted semantics of synchronous data-flow models to optimize memory management. Our memory optimization approach includes two components: (1) We use abstract interpretation to analyze the complete memory behavior of a mobile sensing application and identify data sharing opportunities across components according to the live ranges of exchanged samples. Experiments indicate that the static analysis is precise for a majority of considered stream applications whose control logic does not depend on input data. (2) We propose novel heuristics for memory allocation that leverage the graph structure of applications to optimize data exchanges between application components to achieve not only significantly lower memory footprints but also increased stream processing throughput. We incorporate code generation techniques that transform a stream program into efficient C code. The memory optimizations are implemented as a new compiler for the StreamIt programming language. Experiments show that our memory optimizations reduce memory footprint by as much as 96% while matching or improving the performance of the StreamIt compiler with cache optimizations enabled.

Decentralized renewable energy (RE) minigrids, particularly solar photovoltaic (PV) minigrids, can cost-effectively electrify a large share of currently unelectrified rural populations. But the cost of using appliances with this electricity is still much higher than what the poor can afford without deep subsidies. This affordability gap stunts the sustainability and growth of RE minigrids. Significant improvements in the economics of supplying electricity with minigrids, combined with higher-efficiency appliances, are needed to reduce the effective cost of using electricity in decentralized RE minigrids. These would bridge the affordability gap and improve business opportunities and value to users, investors, and service providers and thus create market-driven expansion to overcome the acute lack of funding that they currently face.

Numerous management practices such as irrigation, minimum tillage, and proper harvest and storage may drastically reduce losses from pests. Of the various methods of crop protection, genetic resistance is the only one that is built into the crop itself. Many effective and safe crop protection chemicals are available that serve as profitable tools in modern farming. As the energy required for manufacture and application of chemical insecticides becomes increasingly dear, biological control through conservation of natural enemies and through importation of new enemies will be increasingly attractive. © 1979 by the American Society of Agronomy, Inc., and the Crop Science Society of America, Inc.","Biological control; Crop production; Crop protection chemicals; Cultural practices; Genetic resistance; Management practices",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102326403

The overall vibrational motion of any atom can be decomposed into fundamental modes and effectively described using a linear combination of plane waves, called phonons, each with a given frequency and wavelength. The chapter considers these thermal phonons as the origin of the fluctuations that cause light scattering, that is, the scattering events that are based on interactions between photons and phonons. Next, it introduces the statistical-mechanical formalism, called dynamic structure factor, that relates the density fluctuations in the scattering medium to the governing principles.

The gap between power supply and demand is increasing day after day. Moreover, most of the power plants are based on fossil fuel and have the risk of being phased out in future. This paper aims to solve these problems by balancing the power supply and demand in a smart environment, focusing mainly on distributed energy resources (DER). The main DER components of the system are power plants based on renewable energy sources (RES). Since RES are intermittent, back up from fossil fuel based plants are also integrated in the final model to increase the system reliability. During off-peak hours residual energy from RES will be stored in the proposed storage arrangement. The proactive consumers (prosumer) in the demand side will have the scope to sell this stored energy to the national grid during peak hours in a proposed smart bilateral network. Finally, grid monitoring and metering interface with an advanced control mechanism has been developed, which is expected to increase the flexibility of the prosumer to handle their energy usage and costs. © 2015 IEEE.","biomass; smart-grid; smart-meter; solar; wind","Biomass; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Energy resources; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Renewable energy resources; Smart meters; Wind; Distributed energy resource; Distributed Energy Resources; Economic growths; Renewable energy source; Smart environment; Smart grid; solar; System reliability; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964582701

This uncertainty must also be taken into account during operational planning for the short term period, i.e. up to five days ahead. Therefore the system operators must take into account how low-voltage load as well as generation change at each node in the near future. This requires appropriate short-term forecast load and distributed generation (DG) methods. In the past, standard profiles for nodes were used to approximately forecast the expected load in the absence of smart metering and historical time-series storage. With increased number of smart meters in the grid, it is possible to use more complex methods to more accurately forecast system load and generation and therefore ensure secure system operation. In this paper, we present the forecasting approach used for load and distributed generation nodes equipped with smart meters. The presented approach was designed at SIEMENS as one part of the Austrian nationally founded research project ProAktivNetz. The forecasts represent aggregated load and distributed generation nodal injection values. The approach was tested for a small node with 100 households and a 34 kWp photovoltaic power plant. The results show that the grouped forecast results using the fuzzy weighting procedure give better forecasting results than individual methods and significantly better results than using standard profiles for the nodes. © 2015 IEEE.","artificial neural networks; distributed generation; fuzzy grouping; Short-term forecasts; smart meters; time series","Aggregates; Complex networks; Distributed power generation; Fuzzy neural networks; Neural networks; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Smart meters; Time series; Voltage distribution measurement; Fuzzy grouping; Low-voltage distributions; Operational planning; Photovoltaic power plant; Renewable energy source; Short-term forecasts; Standard profiles; Weighting procedure; Forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964499405

While harvesting free energy from the environment has enabled many applications, it has also spawned new problems, and new paradigms. Notably, making decisions on when to use high power sensors and external components when energy is scarce, and future supply is unpredictable. Because sensor nodes generally share a single, centralized energy store, seemingly atomic, or unrelated sensing tasks can hamper each other by drawing the supply voltage too low, and draining the energy reservoir. This demonstration presents the United Federation of Peripherals (UFoP), a novel method of separating energy concerns in hardware by allocating dedicated energy storage (in the form of small capacitors) to specific sensor components, and charging them in a prioritized fashion with an analog front end.

When designing batteryless sensors that are powered by harvested energy, this traditional approach results in devices that charge slowly and that are more error prone, inflexible, and inefficient than they could be. This paper presents a novel federated approach to energy storage, called UFoP, that partitions and prioritizes harvested energy automatically into multiple isolated smaller energy stores (capacitors). UFoP simplifies task scheduling, enables efficient use of components with differing voltage requirements, and produces devices that charge more quickly under identical harvesting conditions than a traditional centralized approach. We have implemented a UFoP reference design and conducted extensive experimental evaluation, including a short deployment. Our experimental results using an MSP430-based prototype show that UFoP provides as much as 10% more computational availability, and as much as four times more radio availability than the centralized approach. For all applications and energy environments evaluated, UFoP harvested 0.7-10.2% more energy than the centralized equivalent; meaning UFoP adds zero energy overhead.","Capacitor; Embedded system; Energy harvesting; Federated energy; Task coupling","Capacitors; Energy harvesting; Energy storage; Centralized approaches; Experimental evaluation; Federated energy; Reference designs; System components; Task-scheduling; Traditional approaches; Voltage requirement; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962800245

Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has existed for mobile device CPUs for some time, and provides a trade off between energy and performance. Dynamic frequency scaling is beginning to be applied to memory as well to make more energy-performance tradeoffs possible. We present the first characterization of the behavior of the optimal frequency settings of workloads running both, under energy constraints and on systems capable of CPU DVFS and memory DFS, an environment representative of next-generation mobile devices. Our results show that continuously using the optimal frequency settings results in a large number of frequency transitions which end up hurting performance. However, by permitting a small loss in performance, transition overhead can be reduced and end-to-end performance and energy consumption improved. We introduce the idea of inefficiency as a way of constraining task energy consumption relative to the most energy-efficient settings, and characterize the performance of multiple workloads running under different inefficiency settings. Overall our results have multiple implications for next-generation mobile devices exposing multiple energy-performance tradeoffs. © 2015 IEEE.","CPU DVFS; Cross-component energy management; DRAM; Frequency Scaling; Performance optimization","Characterization; Dynamic frequency scaling; Dynamic random access storage; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Program processors; Smartphones; Voltage scaling; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; End-to-end performance; Energy performance; Energy performance tradeoffs; Energy-constrained; Frequency transition; Frequency-scaling; Performance optimizations; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962232115

During the high penetration of wind power into the power grid, wind turbines can affect power quality substantially. Voltage fluctuations or flicker, Harmonics and Inter-harmonics, and Voltage drops are all present in this environment. Subsequent affects on active and reactive power, can lead to degrading of grid protection and increased reconnection time.

To properly capture the generation primary response, three classes of generation are used: slow, medium, and fast. The slow group responds with a time constant of 27 seconds, the medium group with a time constant of 19 seconds, and the fast group with a time constant of 0.5 seconds.

To overcome the control problems involving coordination control schemes of multi-BESSs in real-time as well as optimized operation strategies of dc grids in long-term, this paper presents the adaptive coordinated droop control of multi-distributed battery energy storage systems in DC distribution grids. The adaptive coordinated droop is proposed to force real-time state of charge of BESS to track on the optimized scheduled state of charge (SOC) in long-term. Furthermore, in this approach, the energy storage units (ESUs) with higher SOC dispatch more power, while the ones with lower SOC dispatch less power. The SOC difference among ESUs exponentially reduces and finally the exchange power is equally shared between the distributed ESUs. Meanwhile, the exchange power share speed can be adjusted by changing the exponent of SOC in the adaptive coordinated droop control. © 2015 IEEE.","Battery; DC grid; Droop control; SOC","Adaptive control systems; Battery electric vehicles; Charging (batteries); Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Photovoltaic cells; Real time systems; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; System-on-chip; Attractive solutions; Battery; Battery energy storage systems; Coordination control; DC grid; Droop control; Integrate renewable energies; Optimized operations; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961696404

It is expected that they will replace traditional SRAM as FPGA reconfigurable blocks. While NVMs promise FPGAs with more reconfigurable resources, lower power consumption, and higher resilience to power interruptions, they also impose two new design challenges: the slow write performance of NVMs may degrade FPGA reconfiguration speed, while their limited write endurance constrains FPGA programming cycles. To overcome these challenges, we propose a similarity driven approach to reduce reconfiguration cost in NVM-based FPGAs. When synthesizing a new design, its similarity to the design currently on the FPGA is characterized by taking both LUT contents and CLB-level topology into consideration. The reconfiguration cost minimization problem is formulated as a bipartite graph matching problem and solved optimally. Experiments on standard circuit benchmarks show that the proposed algorithms eliminate more than 57.4% of NVM writes during the reconfiguration process, thus effectively improving performance and endurance of NVM-based FPGAs. © 2015 IEEE.","FPGA; logic similarity; non-volatile memory; reconfiguration","Benchmarking; Computer circuits; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Nonvolatile storage; Pattern matching; Static random access storage; Bi-Partite graph matching; logic similarity; Lower-power consumption; Non-volatile memory; Non-volatile memory technology; Reconfigurable resources; reconfiguration; Reconfiguration process; Reconfigurable hardware",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960127659

Key-Value Store (KVS) is a critical service that associates values with keys and allows machines to share these associations over a network. Mostexisting KVS systems run in software and scale out by running parallel processes on multiple microprocessor cores to increase throughput. In this paper, we take an alternate approach by implementing an ultra-low-latency KVS in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) logic. As with a software-based KVS, lookup transactions are sent over Ethernet to the machine that stores the value associated with that key. We find that the implementation in logic, however, scales up to provide much higher search throughput with much lower latency and power consumption than other implementations in software. As with other KVS systems like redis, memcached, and Aerospike, high-level applications store, replace, delete, and search keys using a standard Application Programming Interface (API). Our API hashes long keys into statistically unique identifiers and maps variable-length messages into a finite set of fixed-size values. These keys and values are then formatted into a compact, binary Open Compute Storage Message (OCSM) format and transported in User Data Protocol (UDP)/Internet Protocol (IP) Ethernet frames over 10 Gigabit/second Ethernet (10GE) or faster network links. When transporting OCSM over 10 GE and by processing theperforming the key/value search in FPGA logic, a fiber-to-fiber lookup latency of under a half microsecond (0.5 μS) was achieved. Using four 10 GE interfaces, a single instance of the FPGA-accelerated search core achieves a throughput of 150 Million Searches Per Second1 (MSPS). Compared to traditional software, the FPGA KVS is 88 times faster while using 21x less power than socket I/O. Compared to software optimized with DPDK kernel bypass, the FPGA KVS was measured to process messages 10x faster while using 13x less energy. © 2015 IEEE.","datacenter; DPDK; Ethernet; FPGA; GDN; Key Value Store; KVS; latency; NoSQL; power; SDN; throughput","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer circuits; Computer systems programming; Digital storage; Ethernet; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Internet protocols; Throughput; Datacenter; DPDK; Key-value stores; latency; NoSQL; power; Reconfigurable hardware",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962224533

Despite of their undeniable potential, many third world countries are reluctant to implement them due to their instability. RPG technology requires serious efforts to be utilized effectively. Up to the time being, frameworks and regulations for RPG development are not wholly ready due to lack of understanding, public criticism and politics. A novel technique known as Hydro Road Power generation (HRPG), has been proposed in this research. The technique has been presented by merging the current existing techniques in power generation sector known as back storage pumping and over topping wave energy converter deployed in hydro power generation and tidal energy respectively.

The knowledge of spent fuel activity and decay heat is essential for designing the spent fuel storage, its shielding, transportation and heat load analysis. The decay heat and activity of spent fuel dictate the requirements for reprocessing and disposal of generated radioactive waste.

The core inventory calculations were carried out using depletion computer code ORIGEN2. The decay heat and activity profiles show that the fission products dominate for initial period of decay as fuel is removed from the core.

The majority of sources are not suitable for direct connection to the electrical network due to the characteristics of the energy produced, such as low voltage DC power from fuel cells and PV arrays or high frequency AC power from microturbines. Therefore, voltage source converters (VSCs) are required to interface them with the network.

At the distribution system level, testing a 13 kV power electronic device without first validating its controls is cost prohibitive. RTDS provides a cost effective way to study smart grids at not only the system level but also at the device level. The difficulty of modeling the distribution system using RTDS lies in the power electronic devices in the system such as single-phase three-stage solid state transformers (SST) and distributed energy storage devices (DESD) due to their fast transients. This paper investigates the low-loss two-level VSC bridge (LEV2) switching model in RTDS and solves the artificial loss problem for single phase systems. Then, the modeling method is applied to a controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) setup with an SST and DESD, showing promising results. Finally, with the actual DSP+FPGA board for control and an ARM TS7800 for communication, the SST modeled in RTDS is controlled over Ethernet. © 2015 IEEE.","CHIL; RTDS; Simulation; Smart grid; SST; VSC LEV2","Controllers; Cost effectiveness; Digital signal processing; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Electron devices; Electronic equipment; Energy conversion; Grid computing; Hardware; Local area networks; Power electronics; Real time systems; Reconfigurable hardware; Smart power grids; Synthetic apertures; Thermoelectric equipment; CHIL; RTDS; Simulation; Smart grid; VSC LEV2; Electric fault currents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963548508

Historically this challenge has been addressed by the use of large electrolytic capacitors. However reliability constraints and the need for improved system performance have motivated designers to seek other capacitor technologies such as ceramic and metal film which are frequently used in conjunction with active filtering converters to reduce the volume of required capacitance. Active filtering converters cycle the capacitor voltage over a wide voltage range while maintaining a constant DC bus voltage. This large-swing operation is very different from that of most other filtering applications, and the data sheet parameters available for commercial capacitors may be ineffective or require special care for calculating characteristics such as efficiency and energy storage capability. This work presents an experimental setup for evaluating capacitor performance under a large voltage swing. Energy storage data for several capacitors in the 50 V to 450 V range from several manufacturers is included. The approach and findings of this paper can serve as an aid to power electronics designers for the selection and evaluation of capacitors in energy buffering applications. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Digital storage; Electric rectifiers; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Monolithic microwave integrated circuits; Power converters; Rectifying circuits; Capacitor voltages; Experimental evaluation; Filtering applications; Reliability constraints; Selection and evaluations; Single-phase inverters; Single-phase power; Storage capability; Electrolytic capacitors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963548168

In doing so, grid power is shown to be substantially more constant, reducing the need for fast grid resources or dedicated energy storage. The concept is equivalent to using building thermal energy as virtual dynamic storage in support of power grid operation. Two years of solar data have been collected on sub-millisecond time scales to test the results. Here a three-day sample is used to evaluate efficacy, determine solar frequency-domain content, and test a low-pass filtering concept introduced to model ideal power compensation. A more practical band-pass filter is realized that provides 1) lower frequency bounds such that the building maintains consistent room temperature via the HVAC system as demonstrated by a thermal modeling study, and 2) upper frequency bounds that ensure commanded HVAC fan speeds do not update arbitrarily fast. The latter primarily avoids acoustic discomfort to users. The combination is illustrated by experimental results based on various update rates of a variable frequency fan drive over a sample of actual stochastic solar data. © 2015 IEEE.","Energy efficient buildings; frequency domain analysis; grid-level energy storage; HVAC systems; power electronic drives; solar energy; thermal storage","Air conditioning; Bandpass filters; Bandwidth; Climate control; Digital storage; Electric drives; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Heat storage; Low pass filters; Power electronics; Solar energy; Stochastic systems; Variable speed drives; Energy efficient building; Grid levels; HVAC system; Power electronic drive; Thermal storage; Frequency domain analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963547290

PV systems suffer from intermittency and partial shading problems, which could lead to power fluctuations and reduce grid stability. Utilities' inability to service the contracted load might lead to hefty penalties by the regulators. To reduce the effects of intermittency on PV output, a utility scale BESS is proposed for a multilevel inverter with medium frequency transformer link. This also enables PV plants to participate in short-term energy markets. The BESS power is rated at 10% of the PV plant rating. The battery is interfaced to the PV system dc bus through a bidirectional 3-level boost-buck dc-dc converter, which is controlled to regulate power flow. Analysis shows that a 10% BESS rating is capable of providing real power support to mitigate insolation intermittencies by 80%.

Because buildings can participate in intelligent social-like activities through which energy tokens/budgets can be exchanged, the tools provides collective optimization opportunities beyond the usual techniques applied at building level. The paper introduces SmartBuilds' architecture and demonstrates its usefulness in scenarios where multiple buildings are simulated concurrently to asses and seek operating schedules for battery energy storage systems that minimize the overall energy consumption at the district level. © 2015 IEEE.","battery energy storage system; distributed generation; Energy Plus; ESS; multiple buildings energy simulation; open source software; peak shaving; renewable energy; scheduling; smart grid","Buildings; Computer software; Distributed power generation; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Open source software; Open systems; Photovoltaic cells; Scheduling; Software engineering; Wind turbines; Battery energy storage systems; Energy plus; Energy simulation; Peak shaving; Renewable energies; Smart grid; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963517230

The proposed model includes all possible motor drive losses without ignoring, approximating or assuming any of the inverter or machine losses, which are usually done for other efficiency models, hence the model is comprehensive. The input (DC electrical) and the output (mechanical) power of the motor drive system were measured and recorded for different drive operating points. These data were used to build the behavioral model through surface fitting using MATLAB. Different kinds of surface fits were used and discussed, and their effectiveness was evaluated. Moreover, a mathematical expression extracted from polynomial surface fit was used to derive the maximum efficiency point. The accuracy of this approach was verified with an additional experimental dataset not used for surface fitting. The proposed model can be easily integrated when designing, manufacturing and commissioning electric drives using rapid prototyping tools, and when designing maximum efficiency or minimum power loss control algorithms. © 2015 IEEE.","AC machine; intelligent drive; motor drive; optimal control; robust control","Algorithms; Digital storage; Electric drives; Electric losses; Electric motors; Electric tools; Energy conversion; Fiber optic sensors; Risk management; Robust control; AC machine; Comprehensive efficiencies; Electric motor drives; Intelligent drive; Mathematical expressions; Motor drive; Optimal controls; Rapid prototyping tool; Electric machine control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963491103

The proposed interface contains controlled unidirectional and bidirectional floating interleaved converters (FIC), in addition to a smart grid-tied inverter (GTI) to optimize the overall performance of the DG from different perspectives and provide compatible AC voltage to the grid and local loads during islanding mode, GT operating mode and transition mode. FIC has been applied in order to address the low gain issue in photovoltaic (PV) based DGs, and bidirectional FIC is used in order to add the Energy Storage Unit (ESU) to the system. A comprehensive study on bidirectional FIC operating modes indicates that a single-controller scheme can be applied to control the overall operation of this converter in the buck and boost modes. By using this method, the transient response caused by changing controllers between the boost and buck modes will be recovered. Finally, a battery lifetime management algorithm is proposed for increasing the storage system reliability.

While such device-level benefits have been widely explored, the circuit and layout-level implications of vertical transistors require further analysis. In this work, we carry out a systematic layout and circuit analysis for 20nm vertical transistors, namely symmetrical vertical MOSFET and asymmetrical hetero junction tunnel FET (HTFET), and present a detailed comparison with 20nm Fin FETs. Our analysis clearly outlines the differences from the perspective of layouts and the performance/power of standard cells. The absence of width quantization in vertical FETs and steep switching characteristics in HTFETs result in larger drive strengths compared to Fin FETs. However, for high fan-in cells, vertical transistors show area overheads due to infeasibility of contact sharing in parallel and series transistors. For each type of device, we synthesized a 32-bit carry look ahead adder and compared energy, delay and area, taking into account layout differences due to the device structures. Our analysis shows that in spite of area overhead for some cells, high drive-strength in HTFET cells brings advantages in both area and energy over both Fin FETs and vertical MOSFETs at VDD < 0.6V. © 2015 IEEE.","Area; Asymmetric vertical TFET; Cell design; Delay; Energy; Fin FET; Layout; Standard cell library; Symmetric vertical MOSFETs; Tradeoff; Tunnel FET; Vertical FETs","Cells; Field effect transistors; Fins (heat exchange); Integrated circuit layout; MOSFET devices; Reconfigurable hardware; Static random access storage; Transistors; VLSI circuits; Area; Asymmetric vertical TFET; Cell design; Delay; Energy; Fin FET; Layout; Standard cell; Tradeoff; Tunnel FET; Vertical FETs; Vertical MOSFETs; Cytology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956982695

More light penetrates to the lower part of the alfalfa canopy when leaves are displayed at steep vertical angles. Photosynthetic capacity of individual leaves plays a large part in determining the productivity of the stand. It appears that a practical method of increasing dry matter production is to select strains with high photosynthetic capacities and incorporate this characteristic into otherwise-desirable cultivars through plant breeding. The tendency for alfalfa to use more of its photosynthate for top growth in spring and more for root growth in autumn possibly may be enhanced or reduced to increase the range of adaptation or to increase total or seasonal yields. © 1972 by the American Society of Agronomy, Inc.

Except during the most extreme storms, all the precipitation falling on well-vegetated slopes infiltrates and while some reappears in the channel as stormflow, a major portion of the rain remains in the basin as dynamic storage. During a storm, the stormflow source area expands out from the stream channel as slopes contribute primarily unsaturated subsurface flow and the channel system lengthens. After the storm ceases, source areas may continue to expand as subsurface flow feeds the lower slopes near the channel, often leading to a second hydrograph peak several hours or days after the rain ceases. As the channel system and source areas recede, unsaturated subsurface flow continues to sustain baseflow. Basin parameters that affect the soil water regime and associated soil water energy conditions, and therefore the distribution of source areas, are slope length from channel to ridge, angle of slope, regolith depth, and regolith physical properties. Physical models of hillslope segments have provided some insight into the interrelations among the basin parameters as well as the flow pathways and source areas of subsurface flow. © 1973 by the Soil Science Society of America, Inc.","Antecedent soil water conditions; Hydrologic behavior; Meteorologic parameters; Physical parameters; Slope water movement; Storm characteristics; Streamflow hydrograph; Upland basins",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102327673

Typically, these scientific applications are running on a cluster where the storage system of each node is composed of an array of hard disk drives (HDDs). Although HDDs are economical, they become increasingly incompetent to meet the high I/O performance requirements imposed by these applications. Flash memory based solid-state-drives (SSDs), on the other hand, can provide a high performance and energy-efficiency. Still, they are relatively expensive than HDDs. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective yet high-performance storage architecture called SOHO (SSD-Workshop-HDD-Warehouse) for these write-once-read-once scientific applications like seismic wave analysis. Its basic idea is to process raw data in the workshop (i.e., SSD), and then, the processed data is moved to the warehouse (i.e., HDD) later. Experiments using both real-world scientific applications and synthetic traces demonstrate that on average SOHO outperforms a pure HDD storage system in mean response time by 78.25%. Compared to a pure SSD system, it only degrades mean response time by less than 3.11%. © 2015 IEEE.","Cluster; Hybrid storage architecture; Scientific applications; Solid-state-drive; Write-once-read-once","Bioinformatics; Cluster computing; Computer architecture; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Flash memory; Memory architecture; Response time (computer systems); Warehouses; Cluster; Hybrid storages; Scientific applications; Solid state drives; Write once; Hard disk storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959285702

However, it is difficult to control and optimize memory power and performance because these effects depend upon activity across multiple layers of the vertical execution stack. To address this challenge, we construct a novel and collaborative framework that employs object placement, cross-layer communication, and page-level management to effectively distribute application objects in the DRAM hardware to achieve desired power/performance goals. In this work, we describe the design and implementation of our framework, which is the first to integrate automatic object profiling and analysis at the application layer with fine-grained management of memory hardware resources in the operating system. We demonstrate the utility of our framework by employing it to more effectively control memory power consumption. We design a custom memory-intensive workload to show the potential of our approach. Next, we develop sampling and profiling-based analyses and modify the code generator in the HotSpot VM to understand object usage patterns and automatically determine and control the placement of hot and cold objects in a partitioned VM heap. This information is communicated to the operating system, which uses it to map the logical application pages to the appropriate DRAM ranks according to user-defined provisioning goals.We evaluate our framework and find that it achieves our test goal of significant DRAM energy savings across a variety of workloads, without any source code modifications or recompilations. © 2015 ACM.","Cross-layer; DRAM; Efficiency; HotSpot; Power","Computational linguistics; Computer systems programming; Dynamic random access storage; Efficiency; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Power control; Reconfigurable hardware; Application objects; Collaborative framework; Cross layer; Cross-layer communications; Design and implementations; Hot spot; Power; Source code modification; Object oriented programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958640999

Next to the typical scaling of width and thickness of the copper layers, barriers further reduce the cross-section of the actual copper. Moreover, at these small sizes, the resistivity of copper degrades compared to bulk copper. This paper presents a novel STT-MRAM cell design with partial source line planes, which improves the tradeoff between area and source line resistance. A single source line is shared among multiple bit line rows of the embedded memory array, resulting in a smaller cell area at the same source line resistance or a reduced resistance at the same area. The design with a partial source line plane shared among 4 bit line rows results in an area reduction of 11% at the same source line resistance. Alternatively, at the same area, the source line resistance is reduced by more than a factor of 4. The reduced series resistance of the cell results in a performance gain and a reduction of energy consumption. © 2015 IEEE.","10 nm finFET; area; partial source line plane; series resistance; STT-MRAM","Cells; Copper; Cytology; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Electric resistance; Energy utilization; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Memory architecture; Nonvolatile storage; 10 nm finFET; area; partial source line plane; Series resistances; STT-MRAM; MRAM devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962124688

Researchers have proposed combining DRAM and non-volatile memory (NVM) in main memory to increase capacity and reduce energy consumption. Due to its architectural simplicity, software-managed hybrid memory is a promising way to incorporate NVM. However, there are significant performance issues caused by increased memory traffic due to data migration and a lack of effective migration policies. These issues can be addressed by carefully co-designing hardware-software mechanisms and migration policies. To aid in the development of new mechanisms and policies to incorporate NVM in main memory, we present HMMSim, a trace-driven simulator that allows for fast and flexible exploration of the hardware-software co-design space of hybrid main memory. HMMSim has a simple interface to connect memory hierarchy components that can be configured to simulate several memory architectures, including DRAM only, NVM only, DRAM hardware cache, and software-managed hybrid memory. We present two case studies that use HMMSim, and show that HMMSim is fast, flexible and scalable. © 2015 IEEE.","Engines; Hardware; Hidden Markov models; Memory management; Nonvolatile memory; Radiation detectors; Random access memory","Computer hardware; Computer software; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage; Energy utilization; Engines; Hardware; Hardware-software codesign; Hidden Markov models; Integrated circuit design; Markov processes; Memory architecture; Nonvolatile storage; Radiation detectors; Random access storage; Reconfigurable hardware; Software design; Hybrid main memory; Memory management; Migration policy; Non-volatile memory; Performance issues; Random access memory; Reduce energy consumption; Software mechanisms; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962110267

In the case of a mobile or small platform, this limitation can be particularly crippling because of energy storage constraints. In addition, a single platform, especially one equipped with an omni-directional antenna, can be limited in its ability to control where its signal is broadcast spatially. The former challenge motivates the use of a repeater to boost or null the signal power at a target; the latter prompts the concept of having that repeater act as a cooperative platform in order to provide spatial diversity as well as additional power on target. Some cooperative distributed communication methods have been demonstrated (D. Brown, P. Bidigare, and U. Madhow, ICASSP 2012), but these rely on feedback from a receiver. In a noncooperative setting, repeaters can be used to sample a transmitted signal and noncoherently retransmit a modified version of it to degrade the performance of a receiver (D. Torrieri, IEEE J.

These systems often consist of thousands or millions of cores, storage disks, interconnection devices and other power-hungry components. To address this power consumption problem, we propose two energy-aware scheduling algorithms, namely, Energy-Efficiency with Duplication (EED) and Energy-Efficiency with Non Duplication (EEND). Both algorithms, in contrast to their counterparts in the literature, strive to make a balance across the energy consumption, the schedule length, and the number of processors used. Synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications are used to evaluate the performance of our algorithms. A comparison is made with the Traditional Duplication-based Scheduling algorithm (TDS), the Energy Aware Duplication algorithm (EAD), and the Performance-Energy Balanced Duplication algorithm (PEBD). We have also devised a novel objective function that aids in assessing the performance of different algorithms in terms of various performance metrics. Extensive experimental results conducted as a part of this work show that the performance of our algorithms is promising in terms of energy consumption, processing elements used and the schedule length for communication intensive parallel applications. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Benchmarking; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management; Signal processing; Communication-intensive parallel applications; Duplication based scheduling; Energy-aware scheduling; High performance computing; Interconnection devices; Objective functions; Parallel application; Synthetic benchmark; Scheduling algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959056759

However heat removal is a serious challenge in 3D ICs. A promising solution is micro-fluidic (MF) cooling. In this paper we argue that aggressive cooling methods are necessary to unlock the true potential of 3D ICs. We simulate a spectrum of 3D CPU architectures which offer vast improvements to performance, but are inefficient and thermally infeasible with air cooling alone. Our results show that integrating micro-fluidic cooling can increase average performance by 2.62x and energy efficiency by 1.78x by unlocking new architectural configurations. © 2014 ACM.","3D-IC; liquid cooling; memory controller; stacked DRAM","Cooling; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Low power electronics; Power electronics; Program processors; 3-D integration; Cooling methods; CPU architecture; Liquid cooling; Memory controller; Technology scaling; Transistor density; True potentials; Three dimensional integrated circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953402878

Existing wear-leveling techniques overcome this challenge through constantly remapping hot virtual pages, engendering a fair amount of extra write operations to PCM and imposing considerable energy overhead. Our observation is that it is unnecessary to fully balance the accesses to different physical pages during the execution of each process. Instead, since endurance is a lifetime factor, the hot virtual pages of different processes can be mapped to different physical pages in the PCM. Leveraging this property, we develop a wear-resistant page allocation algorithm, which exploits the diverse write characteristics of different program segments to improve PCM write endurance within almost no extra remapping cost. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can prolong PCM lifetime by hundreds of times with nearly zero searching and remapping overhead. © 2014 ACM.","Benchmark testing; Memory management; Phase change materials; Phase change memory; Radiation detectors; Random access memory; Resource management","Energy efficiency; Low power electronics; Materials testing; Phase change materials; Power electronics; Radiation detectors; Random access storage; Storage allocation (computer); Wear resistance; Benchmark testing; Energy efficient; Energy overheads; Memory management; Phase change memory (pcm); Random access memory; Resource management; Write operations; Phase change memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953401355

However, racetrack memory accesses require frequent magnetic domain shifting, introducing overheads in access latency and energy consumption. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several different physical layout strategies and array organizations. From this evaluation, a workload-oriented racetrack LLC architecture is proposed that combines different array types, each of which is tailored to a specific data access pattern. Further, a resizable cache access strategy is applied to reduce shifting overheads at runtime.

Emerging non-volatile memory such as magnetoresistive memory (MRAM) offers a DRAM alternative and can potentially lead to a more energy-efficient memory system. The MRAM technology is already mature, but considering the memory industry is highly standardized, we are still unable to see any MRAM used in mainstream products. To tackle this problem, we design an LPDDRx-compatible MRAM interface by considering both MRAM pros and cons. Our design solves the pin-compatibility and the performance issues caused by MRAM small page size, and it optimizes the interface protocol by leveraging the MRAM unique feature of non-destructive reads. Combining our techniques, we boost the MRAM performance by 14% and provide a DRAM-swappable MRAM solution with 20% less energy. © 2014 ACM.","LPDDR; MRAM; spin-transfer torque","Data storage equipment; Design; Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Integrated circuit design; Low power electronics; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Power electronics; Emerging non-volatile memory; Interface protocol; LPDDR; Magnetoresistive memory; Mobile computing devices; MRAM; Performance issues; Spin transfer torque; MRAM devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953381765

Further, many of them will have stringent size constraints. With no cord for power and limited space for a battery, powering these devices (to achieve several months to possibly years of unattended operation) becomes a daunting challenge. This paper highlights some promising directions for addressing this challenge, focusing on three main building blocks: (a) the design of ultra-low power hardware platforms that integrate computing, sensing, storage, and wireless connectivity in a tiny form factor, (b) the development of intelligent system-level power management techniques, and (c) the use of environmental energy harvesting to make IoT devices self-powered, thus decreasing-in some cases, even eliminating-their dependence on batteries. We discuss these building blocks in detail and illustrate case-studies of systems that use them judiciously, including the QUBE wireless embedded platform, which exploits the characteristics of emerging non-volatile memory technologies to seamlessly and efficiently enable long-running computations in systems that experience frequent power loss (i.e., intermittently powered systems). © 2014 ACM.","Energy Harvesting; Internet of Things; Low Power; Perpetual Systems; Power Management; Wearable Computing","Conservation; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Embedded systems; Energy harvesting; Energy management; Energy management systems; Intelligent systems; Internet; Low power electronics; Power electronics; Power management; Embedded platforms; Emerging Non-volatile memory technology; Environmental energy; Internet of thing (IOT); Low Power; System-level power management; Wearable computing; Wireless connectivities; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953377805

The high computation and storage requirements of DLNs have led to the exploration of various avenues for their efficient realization. Concurrently, the ability of emerging post-CMOS devices to efficiently mimic neurons and synapses has led to great interest in their use for neuromorphic computing. We describe SPINDLE, a programmable processor for deep learning based on spintronic devices. SPINDLE exploits the unique ability of spintronic devices to realize highly dense and energy-efficient neurons and memory, which form the fundamental building blocks of DLNs. SPINDLE consists of a three-tier hierarchy of processing elements to capture the nested parallelism present in DLNs, and a two-level memory hierarchy to facilitate data reuse. It can be programmed to execute DLNs with widely varying topologies for different applications. SPINDLE employs techniques to limit the overheads of spin-to-charge conversion, and utilizes output and weight quantization to enhance the efficiency of spin-neurons. We evaluate SPINDLE using a device-to-architecture modeling framework and a set of widely used DLN applications (handwriting recognition, face detection, and object recognition). Our results indicate that SPINDLE achieves 14.4X reduction in energy consumption and 20.4X reduction in EDP over the CMOS baseline under iso-area conditions. © 2014 ACM.","Emerging Devices; Nanoelectronics; Neural Networks; Neuromorphic Computing; Post-CMOS; Spintronics","Character recognition; CMOS integrated circuits; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Face recognition; Learning systems; Low power electronics; Magnetoelectronics; Memory architecture; Nanoelectronics; Neurons; Object recognition; Power electronics; Architecture modeling; Emerging Devices; Fundamental building blocks; Handwriting recognition; Neuromorphic computing; Post-CMOS; Programmable processors; Reduction in energy consumption; Neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953374123

Domain wall memory (DWM) is one possible candidate due to its ability to store multiple bits per cell in order to break the density barrier. Additionally, it provides low standby power, fast access time, good endurance and retention. However, it suffers from poor write latency, shift latency, shift power and write power. DWM is sequential in nature and latency of read/write operations depends on the offset of the bit from the read/write head. This paper investigates the circuit design challenges such as bitcell layout, head positioning, utilization factor of the nanowire, shift power, shift latency and provides solutions to deal with these issues. A synergistic system is proposed by combining circuit techniques such as merged read/write heads (for compact layout), flipped-bitcell and shift gating (for shift power optimization), wordline (WL) strapping (for access latency), shift circuit design with micro-architectural techniques such as segmented cache to realize energy-efficient and robust DWM cache.

Broad St., Philadelphia, PA  19112, United States","As the U.S. Navy moves towards the fielding of all electric ships (AES), there will be a unique shift in the electrical load profile seen by its generation sources [1,2]. In addition to the electrical propulsion system, unique high pulsed power loads, which have high peak to average power requirements, will be deployed. Traditionally, fossil fuel generators have been used to power ships, but the transient power demands induced by pulsed power loads can impart extreme stress on generators, resulting in a loss in both fuel efficiency and power quality. One solution to this problem involves buffering the generator's power demand with an energy storage device (ESD). Normally the go-To solution for implementing an ESD might be to utilize lead acid batteries however with recent developments in lithium-ion batteries (LIB), it is desirable to use them instead due to their high combined power and energy density [3-6]. In order to further preserve the lifetime of the LIBs and maintain their safe operation, many have proposed to augment them with electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs). Such a configuration is known as a hybrid energy storage module (HESM) since it incorporates both energy dense LIBs and power dense EDLCs into a single power supply topology [7-9]. A HESM is used to augment the generator in providing power to pulsed loads when they are energized while also acting as a sink to the generator when the pulsed loads are in an idle state. This enables the generator to maintain a nearly constant output, increasing its efficiency and power quality considerably. A few different HESM topologies have been previously presented [8-9]. In the work presented here, an actively controlled LIB as well as an actively controlled EDLC are deployed. This unique configuration is aimed at maximizing the energy density of the LIB while also maximizing the power and energy density of the EDLC.

Especially in rep rated laser systems the advantage of low capital cost per lamp is outweighed by many disadvantages, such as low pump efficiency, heating of the gain medium, frequent maintenance requirement, significant capital cost for its pulsed power system, and laser performance stability. Diode Pumped Solid State Laser (DPSSL) systems represent a viable alternative. In this paper we will present an efficient, integrated power conditioning system developed for the High-Repetition-Rate Advanced Petawatt Laser System (HAPLS) that is being developed by LLNL for deployment in the international user facility Extreme Light Infrastructure Beamlines (ELI-Beamlines) in Czech Republic [1]. The High Energy Pump Laser of HAPLS is energized by 4 High Peak Power Laser Diode Arrays with total peak power of 3.2 MW that were developed by Lasertel and LLNL. The diode arrays deliver ∼1kJ at repetition rate 10Hz. Each diode array is comprised of 40 individual diode tiles where every tile generates >20 kilowatts of peak power. Each tile is driven by a single pulser that contains its own energy storage, control and high current drive circuitry. As part of the HAPLS laser the pulsers are operated at approximately 520A, a pulse width of 300μs at 10Hz. In another LLNL laser system basically identical pulsers are operated at 315A, 300us at 120Hz. The pulsers were designed to be operated in a support frame called a pulser crate. Each crate is designed to hold up to 45 pulsers in a volume similar to a desktop computer. Communication with the pulsers is by means of a one-way digital optical link which greatly simplifies the internal wiring. Each crate contains a 'Brain Box' which in turn contains the front end processor (FEP), machine safety system (MSS) and energy storage dump subsystems. Providing flexibility and system balancing capability each pulser can be tailored to the diode tile: it has an internal Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) on board that controls the shape of the diode current pulse. The AWG can vary the pulse shape in any combination of programmable increments with resolutions 1A and 1μs up to maximums of 1kA and 350μs. Under command of the crate controller each pulser can create its own distinct waveform and deliver that waveform when triggered. © 2015 IEEE.","Capacitors; Diode lasers; Energy storage; Monitoring; Optical fiber communication; Optical transmitters; Semiconductor lasers","Capacitors; Diodes; Electric power systems; Energy storage; High energy lasers; Monitoring; Optical communication; Optical fiber communication; Optical fibers; Optical links; Optical pumping; Optical transmitters; Pumping (laser); Semiconductor diodes; Semiconductor lasers; Solid state lasers; Arbitrary waveform generator; Diode pumped lasers; Diode pumped solid state laser; High repetition rate; High-energy laser systems; Maintenance requirement; Petawatt laser systems; Pulsed power systems; Pulsed lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953439596

The pulse trigger generator is capable of operating at pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) > 1 kHz for short bursts with variable pulse magnitudes and risetimes. The trigger generator utilizes a transformer, magnetic switch and an IGBT primary switch. It has been successfully used to trigger a trigatron-driven 10-stage, Marx generator driving a high power load. For portability and noise immunity, the trigger generator is optically isolated from its low voltage control and powered via a lithium ion polymer battery pack. A constant current dc-dc power supply charges the high voltage circuitry of the trigger generator and enables continuous operation with two modules. For operation, a large capacitor is initially charged and used as a buffer energy source. The intermediate charge storage in conjunction with a command-Triggered MOSFET, provides the ability to quickly re-charge a trigger capacitor between each pulse of the burst.

Each module locates probes along its length in an identical fashion so that by comparing the timing of similar probes on each line, a measure of the power flow time symmetry can be obtained. The probes from each line are recorded in scope groupings, each containing 36 channels. In numerous cases, the archived group time bases were not correctly quantified with respect to the other scope groupings. This was problematic when comparing signals from different scope groupings. The source of the errors was found to be how the scope groupings were triggered as well as a software error associated with two models of digitizers. We have implemented changes so that all scope groupings are time tied to a common reference. © 2015 IEEE.","Birds; Data acquisition; Delays; Monitoring; Probes; Switches","Birds; Digital storage; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Hardware; Monitoring; Planets; Probes; Program diagnostics; Reconfigurable hardware; Switches; Control program; Current probe; Delays; Hardware and software; Power flows; Pulsed-power; Sandia National Laboratories; Software errors; Data acquisition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953438847

They are of special interest for use aboard future naval vessels on which high rate pulsed power loads will be fielded. EES devices traditionally operate at low voltages and modest current levels. Operating them at higher voltages and/or higher power rates often requires multiple cells to be interconnected in a series and/or parallel manner. The most common battery chemistries being considered for use in future pulsed power applications are valve regulated lead acid (VRLA), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), and lithium-ion (LI). At the University of Texas at Arlington's (UTAs) Pulsed Power and Energy Laboratory (PPEL), each of these chemistries has been evaluated at the cell or low voltage module level under a 5 second on/ 5 second off pulsed profile, as they may be used to drive future pulsed power applications. Metrics evaluated and presented here include power density, energy density, usable capacity, rate of capacity fade, and thermal evolution when operated at these high rates typically required of a directed energy system's prime power supply. Conclusions will be drawn to provide the reader with a better understanding of the role of each of these technologies in future pulsed power systems as well as design practices which can be followed based upon the lessons learned here. © 2015 IEEE.","Batteries; Chemistry; Cooling; Discharges (electric); Temperature measurement; Time measurement","Chemistry; Cooling; Corrosion; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electric power systems; Hydrides; Lead acid batteries; Lithium alloys; Lithium-ion batteries; Military applications; Naval vessels; Nickel; Solar cells; Temperature measurement; Time measurement; Battery chemistries; Directed Energy Systems; Electrochemical energy storage; Nickel metal hydride; Pulsed power applications; Pulsed power systems; University of Texas; Valve regulated lead acids; Nickel metal hydride batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953426261

However, the high ORR overpotentials resulting from very slow kinetics require catalysts containing large amount of precious metals, such as Pt, to enhance the reaction activity and durability. Unfortunately, the high cost and limited supply of Pt have become a grand challenge for widespread application of these clean energy technologies. The development of nonprecious-metal catalysts (NPMCs) for ORRs has become a hot topic for electrochemical energy technologies. In the meantime, exploring the advanced catalyst design and synthesis from Earth-abundant elements will be scientifically important areas and able to provide fundamental knowledge and understanding to materials chemistry. Among the catalyst formulations studied so far, carbon-based catalysts have received considerable attention owing to the balance between cost, activity, and durability. However, the mechanisms of ORR in various media (e.g., acidic, alkaline, and nonaqueous) are different and not fully understood, making it challenging to develop universal ORR electrocatalysts. In this chapter, we will account the recent progress of nanocarbon-based NPMCs for the ORR in three different electrolytes, potentially for Nafion®-based polymer electrolyte fuel cells, alkaline fuel cells and metal-air batteries, and nonaqueous Li-air batteries, respectively. Various carbon materials, including metal-free nitrogen-doped nanocarbons, transition metal-derived M-N-C catalysts, and nanocarbon/transition metal compound hybrids, are discussed in terms of their synthesis, structure/morphology, and catalytic activity and durability. The synthesis-structure-activity correlations of these NPMCs are established, aiming to provide guidance for rational design of advanced catalysts. In addition, perspectives of nanocarbon-based catalysts for energy storage and conversion are also outlined, and the possible pathways to address current challenges of these systems are discussed. © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This research focuses on the accelerators' scalability problem due to resource under-utilization in FPGA-based accelerator-coupled platforms. By recognizing that static memory allocation the de-facto memory management mechanism supported by modern design techniques and synthesis tools forms the main source of memory-induced under-utilization, i.e. leading up to 75% of dark silicon, we propose the development of a) a Single-Chip Many-Accelerator (SCMA) architecture that reduces energy budget by providing high-throughput processing nodes hooked under the same low-latency FPGA die and b) a novel design framework that extends conventional RTL and High Level Synthesis (HLS) design flows with dynamic memory management (DMM) features to leverage scalability by enabling accelerators to dynamically adapt their allocated memory to the runtime memory requirements, thus maximizing the overall accelerator count through effective sharing of FPGA's memories resources. By applying these novel techniques in the state-of-art Vivado-HLS tool, we managed to increase accelerator density up to 3.8× for a Xilinx Ultrascale device and deliver architecture solutions that trade-off per-accelerator latency overhead (1.2×- 19.9×) with overall system's throughput (2.6×- 23.1×) and performance-per-watt (0.09×- 21.7×). © 2015 Imperial College.",,"Acceleration; Budget control; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Economic and social effects; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Memory architecture; Scalability; Storage allocation (computer); Design technique; Dynamic memory management; General-purpose computing; Memory management; Memory requirements; Novel techniques; Processing nodes; Scalability problems; High level synthesis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962360143

The EMS is responsible for optimally scheduling end-user smart appliances, heating systems and local generation devices at the residential level, based on end-user preferences, weather-dependent generation and demand forecasts, electric pricing, technical and operative constraints. The core of the proposed framework is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model aiming at minimizing the overall costs of each residential microgrid. At each time step, the computed optimal decision is adjusted according to the actual values of weather-dependent local generation and heating requirements; then, corrective actions and their corresponding costs are accounted for in order to cope with imbalances. At the next time step, the optimization problem is re-computed based on updated forecasts and initial conditions. The proposed method is evaluated in a virtual testing environment that integrates accurate simulators of the energy systems forming the residential microgrids, including electric and thermal generation units, energy storage devices and flexible loads.

It is a well understood commodity technology that strikes an ideal balance between cost, performance, capacity and energy. Yet, as DRAM scales to the extremes of deep submicron technology, it faces a critical challenge with the impact of process variation (PV) on chip yield: PV in the transistor and capacitor used to hold a bit of information, along with other components, can cause critical requirements to be violated, including retention capability, cell reliability and operational timing. The challenges of retention and reliability are well known. However, the latter challenge has received significantly less attention-the impact of operational timing violations due to PV on DRAM yield. This challenge stands as an equal to the others in achieving sufficient yield for continued commodity production of DRAM. In this paper, we argue that timing requirements must be relaxed and exposed on a per-location basis for management by the memory sub-system architecture to overcome the challenge to yield from timing. This ""soft yield"" approach trades exposed timing variability for enhanced yield, without harming chip density. Because relaxing and exposing variable timing can lead to application performance loss, a suite of techniques must be developed by the architecture community to mitigate the loss. We raise awareness of this problem and suggest directions where solutions may be found. ©2015 ACM.","Dram; Performance; Yield","Memory architecture; Application performance; Architecture community; Critical challenges; Deep sub-micron technology; Performance; Process Variation; Timing requirements; Yield; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959351880

Unlike other proposed processing-in- memory architectures, the rearrangement hardware performs data reduction, not compute offload. Using a custom FPGA emulator, we quantitatively evaluate performance and en- ergy benefits of near-memory hardware structures that dy- namically restructure in-memory data to cache-friendly lay- out, minimizing wasted memory bandwidth.

In this paper we present low overhead schemes for improving the reliability of commodity DRAM systems with better power and IPC performance compared to Chipkill- Correct solutions. Specifically, we propose two erasure and error correction (E-ECC) schemes for x8 memory systems that have 12.5% storage overhead and do not require any change in the existing memory architecture. Both schemes have superior error performance due to the use of a strong ECC code, namely, RS(36,32) over GF(28). Scheme 1 activates 18 chips per access and has stronger reliability com- pared to Chipkill-Correct solutions. If the location of the faulty chip is known, Scheme 1 can correct an additional random error in a second chip. Scheme 2 trades of reliabil- ity for higher energy efficiency by activating only 9 chips per access. It cannot correct random errors due to a chip failure but can detect them with 99.9986% probability, and once a chip is marked faulty due to persistent errors, it can correct all errors due to that chip. Synthesis results in 28nm node show that the RS (36,32) code results in a very low decod- ing latency that can be well-hidden in commodity memory systems and, therefore, it has minimal effect on the DRAM access latency. Evaluations based on SPEC CPU 2006 se- quential and multi-programmed workloads show that com- pared to Chipkill-Correct, the proposed Schemes 1 and 2 improve IPC by an average of 3.2% (maximum of 13.8%) and 4.8% (maximum of 31.8%) and reduce the power con- sumption by an average of 16.2% (maximum of 25%) and 26.8% (maximum of 36%), respectively. © 2015 ACM.","Chipkill- correct; Dramerrors; Drammemory system; Erasure and error correction; Reliability","Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Error correction; Errors; Random errors; Reliability; Chipkill; Correct solution; Dramerrors; Drammemory system; Error performance; Error-correction schemes; Persistent errors; Storage overhead; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959325256

An attempt of synthesis of the main results found from research and development work in the last time by using carbon nanomaterials in supercapacitors is performed in this chapter. Specific capacitance values (related to specific energy) as key performance material indicator, reaching 150-200 F/g for nonaqueous electrolytes and up to 450-500 F/g in aqueous electrolytes, have been reported. Corresponding specific energy values up to 35-40 Wh/kg in organic electrolyte, 50-60 Wh/kg in ionic electrolyte, and 10-15 Wh/kg in aqueous electrolyte have been also reported. These capacitance and specific energy values take into account only the carbon nanomaterial from a supercapacitor cell. For practical cells where other materials are included, the above values have to be divided by a factor at least of 4. In many cases, charge storage is provided by pseudocapacitance (fast faradaic reactions, associated with functional groups from the carbon surface) in addition to the electric double layer. The shape of cyclic voltammograms and of galvanostatic charge-discharge curves at low scan rate or current density can indicate if there is pseudocapacitance contribution. Sometimes, the pseudocapacitance contribution to the specific capacitance is attributed to the electric double layer. Discharge voltage record with the time of a supercapacitor cell on a load resistance can also reveal the contribution of electric double layer and pseudocapacitance to the total exhibited capacitance. Better understanding of charge storage mechanisms in the experimental supercapacitor cells can lead to better utilization of carbon nanomaterials for further advance in performance. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Optimality is defined as minimizing the amount of power lost through the boost converters that connect the N sources to the DC bus. The optimal power apportionment strategy is part of an overall grid management system that also includes control laws that manage bus voltage and boost currents using distributed energy storage. The performance of an optimal power apportionment strategy is compared to an existing, alternate approach using a three source simulation for both source and load step transients. The optimal power apportionment strategy is shown to use less power while maintaining bus voltage in the presence of both load and source transients. Since the optimal solution requires information exchange between all the sources, there is an opportunity for malicious attack. The ability of the strategy to maintain the desired bus voltage in the presence of an uncommunicated source failure is also presented. © 2015 IEEE.","Computational modeling; Energy storage; Feedforward neural networks; Microgrids; Steady-state; Transient analysis; Voltage control","DC-DC converters; Energy storage; Feedforward neural networks; Power quality; Transient analysis; Transients; Voltage control; Alternate approaches; Computational model; Distributed energy storages; Information exchanges; Micro grid; Optimal management; Optimal solutions; Steady state; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961653837

Such group information helps to collectively respond to any load change; an optimal response with the least energy extract from individual buffers.

As a class of highly porous material, Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF) holds great potential with its tunable structure. However, little is known about the effect of metal cluster to its hydrogen storage capability. Investigation on this matter has been carried out carefully on small cluster of Zn and Cu-based MOF using first principles method. The calculation of two distinct building units of MOFs, namely octahedral and paddle-wheel models, have been done with B3LYP density functional method using 6-31G(d,p) and LANL2DZ basis sets. From geometry optimization of Zn-based MOF linked by benzene-dicarboxylate (MOF-5), it is found that hydrogen tends to keep distance from metal cluster group and stays above benzene ring. In the other hand, hydrogen molecule prefers to stay atop of the exposed Cu atom in Cu-based MOF system linked by the same linker group (Cu-bdc). Calculated hydrogen binding enthalpies for Zn and Cu octahedral cages at ZnO3 sites are 1.64kJ/mol and 2.73kJ/mol respectively, while hydrogen binding enthalpies for Zn and Cu paddle-wheel cages calculated on top of metal atoms are found to be at 6.05kJ/mol and 6.10kJ/mol respectively. Major difference between Zn-MOF-5 and Cu-bdc hydrogen uptake performance might be caused by unsaturated metal sites present in Cu-bdc system and the influence of their geometric structures, although a small difference on binding energy in the type of transition metal used is also observed. The comparison between Zn and Cu-based MOF may contribute to a comprehensive understanding of metal clusters and the importance of selecting best transition metal for design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006187822

With proper scheduling, the storage devices can capture the energy when the renewable generation is high and utility energy price is low, and release it when the demand is high or utility energy price is expensive. This scheduling is a multi-step optimization problem where different time-steps are dependent on each other. Conventionally, this problem is solved centrally. The central controller should have access to the real-time states of the system as well as the predicted load and renewable generation information. It should also have the capability to send dispatch commands to each storage device. However, as the number of devices increases, the centralized approach would not be scalable and will be vulnerable to single point of failure. Combining the idea of dynamic KKT multipliers with consensus networks, this paper introduces a novel algorithm that can optimally schedule the storage devices in a microgrid solely through peer-to-peer coordination of devices with their neighbors without using a central controller. © 2015 IEEE.","Distributed Algorithms; Microgrids; Optimal Control; Optimal Scheduling","Algorithms; Energy resources; Optimization; Parallel algorithms; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Virtual storage; Centralized approaches; Distributed scheduling; Micro grid; Optimal controls; Optimal scheduling; Optimization problems; Peer-to-peer coordination; Renewable generation; Peer to peer networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956869479

Due to the oscillating motion of ocean waves, the wave energy generator profiles are highly non-periodic and stochastic. Currently there are no IEEE or IEC standards for these types of oscillating machines, and thus critical questions remain unanswered such as the nameplate ratings and efficiencies that should be targeted for cost effective operation. Oscillating operation in an ocean environment is presented in the paper including real-world speed, torque, and output power testing data from an ocean wave energy generator. Related standards are discussed to illustrate that the duty types are not suitable to describe and represent the oscillating motion of wave energy generators. The paper concludes with an example utility-scale wave energy converter (WEC) design including the demanding cyclic operating conditions, and then presents required standards. © 2015 IEEE.","Generators; IEC Standards; IEEE Standards; Ocean waves; Renewable energy sources; Torque","Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Gas generators; Hydroelectric generators; Oceanography; Renewable energy resources; Standards; Stochastic systems; Torque; Water waves; Critical questions; IEC standards; IEEE standards; Ocean environment; Operating condition; Oscillating motion; Renewable energy source; Wave energy converters; Wave energy conversion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956867663

Potted plants of Leucospermum 'Memory' (L. cordifolium selection) and Leucospermum 'Rigoletto' (L. cordifolium × L. glabrum) were subjected to LED lighting (treatments included 'full', 'half' and 'no light' levels) and growth regulator treatments (500 mg L-1 Promalin® and MaxCel™ respectively) to evaluate their efficacy for alleviating cold-induced injuries after a three week cold storage period. The plants subjected to a 'full light' LED treatment showed a significant reduction in chilling injury and leaf yellowing in comparison to plants subjected to the 'no light' treatment. Promalin® and MaxCel™ showed no or little ability to reduce the associated postharvest cold storage disorders. It was concluded that LED at a light energy level of 25.03 ± 2.09 μmol m-1 s-1 was effective at reducing leaf yellowing and chilling injury. A range of Leucospermum cultivars should also be evaluated for its suitability to be placed in cold-storage with supplemented LED lighting.","Leaf yellowing; Long-term cold storage; Pin-cushions; Proteaceae; Sea freight",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951024144

However, changes to the system architecture for high-performance computing (HPC), dictated by the exascale goal, have limited the applicability of post-processing visualization. As an alternative, in-situ pipelines are proposed in order to enhance the knowledge discovery process via ""real-time"" visualization. Quantitative studies have already shown how in-situ visualization can improve performance and reduce storage needs at the cost of scientific exploration capabilities. However, to fully understand the trade-off space, a head-to-head comparison of power and energy (between the two types of visualization pipelines) is necessary. Thus, in this work, we study the greenness (i.e., Power, energy, and energy efficiency) of the in-situ and the post-processing visualization pipelines, using a proxy heat-transfer simulation as an example. For a realistic I/O load, the in-situ pipeline consumes 43% less energy than the post-processing pipeline. Contrary to expectations, our findings also show that only 9% of the total energy is saved by reducing off-chip data movement, while the rest of the savings comes from reducing the system idle time. This suggests an alternative set of optimization techniques for reducing the power consumption of the traditional post-processing pipeline. © 2015 IEEE.","Accelerated Processing Unit (APU); access methods; characterization; data transfer; GPU; Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA)","Auxiliary power systems; Characterization; Computer architecture; Data reduction; Data transfer; Data visualization; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Heat transfer; In situ processing; Pipelines; Visualization; Access methods; Heat transfer simulation; Heterogeneous systems; High performance computing (HPC); Knowledge discovery process; Optimization techniques; Processing units; Visualization pipeline; Pipeline processing systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962259481

South Africa experienced load shedding during 2007/2008 and again in 2014 due to a supply shortfall. Demand Side Management (DSM) is a short-term solution to stabilise the national grid by managing the electricity demand on the consumer's side. DSM aims to reduce the electricity consumption with immediate results in the short-term. Cement factories are ideal for the implementation of DSM projects for the following reasons: cement factories are energy intensive; have adequate reserve production capacity; sufficient storage capacity and interruptible production schedules. A set of five distinctive parameters was derived to quantify the possible effects of DSM projects at cement factories. The parameters are: demand reduction and electricity cost; production targets; infrastructure; product quality; and sustainability. One cement factory was selected as a primary case study for the analysis model. DSM projects were implemented at various factories in South Africa and the results from nine sites validated the aim of this study. The study concluded that most DSM projects at South African cement factories were sustainable. Both the electricity supplier and the factories benefitted from the projects. The funding received from Eskom to implement DSM projects is a short-term initiative.

Primary data were collected using structured questionnaire, detailed audits of records, physical instrumentation measurements, interviews and direct observation. Results indicate that thermal energy share is on average 85% while electrical and manual energy is on average of 14.97% and 0.03%, respectively. The specific electrical and thermal energy consumption was found to be 0.64 kWh/kg and 13.41 kWh/kg of made tea, respectively, which is consistent with the data (0.4-0.7 kWh/kg and 4-18 kWh/kg) reported in the literature. Average specific fuel consumption was calculated to be 3.55 kg wood/kg of produced tea compared to 1.7 kg wood/kg of made tea quoted for tea factories in other producing countries. In addition, results of this study show that sizeable amounts of energy can be saved using a variety of interventions such as variable speed drives, waste heat recovery, improving combustion efficiency, use of energy efficient motors, use of flat belts, and alternative energy sources.

Underground cooling demand also increases significantly with deeper mining activities due to high virgin rock temperatures (VRT). This study therefore focuses on the electricity usage of an ice storage system versus a chilled water system for underground cooling. A savings approach of converting an ice storage system to a chilled water system and varying the water flow through the system was thus implemented. The water flow was controlled by installing variable speed drives (VSDs) on the evaporator and condenser water pumps. The feasibility of the energy-efficiency approach was then simulated with a verified model. Simulation results indicated the feasibility of converting the thermal ice storage to a chilled water system and implementing the energy-efficiency approach on Mine M. An electricity saving of 9% when using a chilled water system was indicated by the simulation. Various problems encountered by the mine with the thermal ice storage system were also a motivation. Further, converting the glycol plant to a chilled water plant gave the mine an additional chiller to sufficiently meet underground demand. An annual summer power saving of 1.5 MW was achieved through the conversion and control strategy. © 2015 CPUT.","deep level gold mine; energy management; ice storage; refrigeration system","Cooling water; Economic geology; Energy management; Energy utilization; Flow of water; Gold; Gold mines; Hydraulics; Ice; Ice problems; Refrigeration; Variable speed drives; Water cooling systems; Water piping systems; Waterworks; Chilled water systems; Control strategies; Electricity saving; Evaporator and condensers; Ice storage; Ice-storage system; Refrigeration system; Rock temperatures; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962681997

The conventional bidirectional converter was derived with auxiliary resonant cell to obtain ZCS turn-on/turn-off condition of the main switches. The proposed converter was operated in boost and buck modes with soft-switching operations in order to minimize the current stresses and switching losses, because the resonating current for the zero current switching does not flow through the main switches. The converter has an improved overall efficiency than the hard-switching converter, for high power energy storage applications.

The purpose is to integrate the interactive visualisation with natural human gesture controls and the back-end cloud enabled by the IEEE1888 data storage component and IEEE1888 FETCH/WRITE methods. The IDaaS architecture utilises Processing language as the interactive visualisation software platform and Microsoft Kinect as the gesture sensor. Measures of IDaaS effectiveness have been defined, namely, the number of hand swipes made by control users, the canvas numbers selected by control users, and the accumulated number of users waking up the IDaaS display. As an example proof of concept, IDaaS system has been deployed for the building energy management system scenario. Five canvases have been developed for the IDaaS display, namely, EE health pad, energy game, EE information and alarm & alert as well as a photo collection display implemented as a screen saver. Reported results herein highlight possible usage of IDaaS effectiveness measures to compare installation locations and displaying canvases quantitatively. And hence IDaaS is expectedly useful for interactive public data dissemination hot spots to raise people awareness on common issues of societal concern or for information advertising purposes. © 2015 IEEE.","Building energy management system; Gesture sensor; IEEE1888; Interactive Display as a Service","Application programs; Computer software; Digital storage; Energy management; Information dissemination; Visualization; Application components; Building energy management systems; Effectiveness measure; IEEE1888; Installation locations; Interactive display; Interactive visualisation; Software platforms; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962073225

However, the high static power of an HMC device compromises power efficiency when the device is lightly utilized. Activating a sleeping HMC takes over 2μs, which makes it challenging to manage HMC power without a substantial degradation in system performance. We introduce a new technique that alleviates the long wakeup penalty of an HMC by employing erasure codes. Inaccessible data stored in a sleeping HMC module can be reconstructed by decoding related data retrieved from other active HMCs, rather than waiting for the sleeping HMC module to become active. This approach makes it possible to tolerate the latency penalty incurred when switching an HMC between active and sleep modes, thereby enabling a power-capped HMC system. Simulations show that the proposed architecture outperforms a current HMC-based multicore system by 6.2×, and reduces the system energy by 5.3× under the same power budget as the multicore baseline. © 2015 IEEE.","Bandwidth; Decoding; Encoding; Hardware; Random access memory; Standards; Switches","Bandwidth; Budget control; Computer hardware; Decoding; Encoding (symbols); Energy efficiency; Forward error correction; Low power electronics; Sleep research; Standards; Switches; Energy efficient; Hybrid memory; Multi-core systems; Power budgets; Power efficiency; Proposed architectures; Random access memory; System energy; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958534465

To improve thermal efficiency, Phase Change Materials (PCMs) have recently been used as passive cooling solutions. PCMs store large amount of heat at near-constant temperature during phase change, allowing strategies such as computational sprinting. While existing sprinting methods allow short performance boosts, there is significant unexplored potential in improving performance on systems with PCM-enhanced cooling. To this end, this paper proposes a novel runtime management policy driven by observations that are not captured by prior techniques: (i) PCM melts non-uniformly due to spatially heterogeneous on-chip heat distribution; (ii) power consumption during sprinting is highly application dependent and assuming a fixed sprinting power leads to lower thermal efficiency; (iii) if we monitor the remaining PCM energy at various locations, we can utilize the PCM heat storage capability much more efficiently. The proposed Adaptive Sprinting policy exploits these observations to extend sprinting duration for increased performance gains. Our policy monitors the remaining PCM energy corresponding to each core at runtime, and using this information, it decides on the number, the location and the voltage-frequency (V/f) setting of the sprinting cores. Experimental evaluation including a detailed phase change thermal model demonstrates 29% performance improvement, 22% energy savings, and 43% energy delay product (EDP) reduction on average, compared to prior strategies. © 2015 IEEE.","Monitoring; Nickel; Temperature measurement; Temperature sensors","Cooling; Cooling systems; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Low power electronics; Monitoring; Nickel; Temperature measurement; Temperature sensors; Constant temperature; Energy delay product; Experimental evaluation; Improving performance; On-chip temperature; Runtime management; Storage capability; Thermal efficiency; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958532871

Glucose is an essential nutrient of exceptional importance. It is the only energy source for many cell types, which are dependent on a steady glucose supply. Uptake and storage of glucose via glycogenesis, its release via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and its catabolism via glycolysis are complex strictly regulated mechanisms. Specialized carrier proteins mediate cellular uptake of glucose and transport across cell membranes, specifically facilitative glucose transporters, and the sodium-glucose linked transporters. The various transporters exhibit different substrate specificities, kinetic properties, and tissue expression profiles. Glucose homeostasis is maintained by the action of several hormones and a complex network composed of the pancreas, intestine, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and brain. Knowledge of these, and related signaling mechanisms and trafficking pathways, is essential to better understand a wide range of metabolic disorders. Conditions such as diabetes are characterized by an imbalance in glucose regulation, causing chronic hyperglycemia, leading to complications in many organs and, ultimately, death. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The key advantage of the sol-gel process is that different precursors can be mixed on the molecular scale, giving rise to uniform composition in the gel. Because the three sol-gel methods (alkoxide, metal complex, and Pechini) are so closely related, it is relatively easy to combine them to generate novel synthesis routes. Along with control of particle size and morphology, the ability to make doped materials with high purity is a chief advantage of sol-gel processing. The works discussed in this chapter mainly focus on the synthesis of discrete nanosized particles. However, sol-gel techniques are also widely applied to the formation of materials where the morphology of both the particles and the voids are effectively controlled to give the desired density, porosity, and surface area. © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Refresh operations for main memory account for a significant fraction of the overall energy consumption, especially during idle periods, when processor can be switched off quickly, however, memory contents continue to get refreshed to avoid data loss. Given that mobile devices are idle most of the times, reducing refresh power in idle mode is critical to maximize the duration for which the device remains usable. The frequency of refresh operations in memory can be reduced significantly by using strong multi-bit error correction codes (ECC). Unfortunately, strong ECC codes incur high latency, which causes significant performance degradation (as high as 21%, and on average 10%). To obtain both low refresh power in idle periods and high performance in active periods, this paper proposes Morphable ECC (MECC). During idle periods, MECC keeps the memory protected with 6-bit ECC (ECC-6) and employs a refresh period of 1 second, instead of the typical refresh period of 64ms. During active operation, MECC reduces the refresh interval to 64ms, and converts memory from ECC-6 to weaker ECC (single-bit error correction) on a demand-basis, thus avoiding the high latency of ECC-6, except for the first access during the active mode. Our proposal reduces refresh operations during idle mode by 16x, memory power in idle mode by 2X, while retaining performance within 2% of a system that does not use any ECC. © 2015 IEEE.","DRAM Power Consumption; DRAM Refresh Rate; Error Correction Code; Memory Reliability; Mobile DRAM; Mobile Mem- ory System","Codes (symbols); Energy utilization; Error correction; Errors; Mobile devices; Program processors; DRAM refresh; Error correction codes; Memory reliability; Mobile dram; Mobile Mem- ory System; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950131924

The benefits lie in importing and storing more energy at low price periods while decreasing the imported power from the grid at high price periods and dispatching the stored energy for load demands.

We propose a lossless zero-voltage switching realization for the VIC using a switched power converter and capacitors.

There are two controllers needed to operate a VIC: the voltage controller acts fast to maintain the desired terminal voltage, while the charge controller acts more slowly and maintains the charge Q in the desired operating range by influencing the incoming current. The VIC is useful as a filter capacitor for various applications, for example power factor compensators (PFC), as we describe.

The objective of the controller is to minimize energy consumption and the associated cost, and to maintain the quality of fine coal output from the DMC circuit to set level. The former is achieved largely by introducing a pump-storage system and the latter is reached by manipulating the density of the dense medium used in the DMC. The medium circulation, including magnetite recycling and water and make-up magnetite addition are modelled mathematically, according to which the control problem under consideration is formulated. A controller is designed to adjust the positions of two valves responsible for water and magnetite addition, respectively, according to sampled measurements on the composition percentages in the run-of-mine feed coal to the DMC circuit. Using operating data from a real mine, the effectiveness of the presented system is investigated and verified. It is shown that the designed system is able to maintain fine coal quality to a set level while remarkably reducing energy consumption of the coal preparation plant. In the studied case, an energy saving of 62.4%, which translates to 52.78GWh per annum is obtained.

One of the key activities of nodes in a WSN is communication and the routing of their data to a centralized base-station or sink. Routing using the shortest path to the sink is not the best solution since it will cause nodes along this path to fail prematurely. We propose a cross-layer energy efficient routing protocol Optrix that utilizes a convex formulation to maximize the lifetime of the network as a whole. We further propose, Optrix-BW, a novel convex formulation with bandwidth constraint that allows the channel conditions to be accounted for in routing. By considering this key channel parameter we demonstrate that Optrix-BW is capable of congestion control. Optrix is implemented in TinyOS, and we demonstrate that a relatively large topology of 40 nodes can converge to within 91 % of the optimal routing solution. We describe the pitfalls and issues related with utilizing a continuous form technique such as convex optimization with discrete packet based communication systems as found in WSNs.

The new features offered by fog computing (e.g., distributed analytics and edge intelligence), if successfully applied for pervasive health monitoring applications, has great potential to accelerate the discovery of early predictors and novel biomarkers to support smart care decision making in a connected health scenarios. While promising, how to design and develop real-word fog computing-based pervasive health monitoring system is still an open question. As a first step to answer this question, in this paper, we employ pervasive fall detection for stroke mitigation as a case in study. There are four major contributions in this paper: (1) to investigate and develop a set of new fall detection algorithms, including new fall detection algorithms based on acceleration magnitude values and non-linear time series analysis techniques, as well as new filtering techniques to facilitate fall detection process; (2) to design and employ a real-time fall detection system employing fog computing paradigm, which distribute the analytics throughout the network by splitting the detection task between the edge devices (e.g., smartphones attached to the user) and the server (e.g., servers in the cloud); (3) we carefully exam the special needs and constraints of stroke patients and propose patient-centered design that is minimal intrusive to patients. This type of patient-centered design is currently lacking in most of the existing work; and (4) our experiments with real-word data show that our proposed system achieves the high sensitivity (low missing rate) while it also achieves the high specificity (low false alarm rate).

To this end, the problem of limited wind energy integration becomes even more severe in isolated island regions, owed to the weak character of local electricity grids. For this purpose, the current study emphasizes on the need for the production of adequately reliable forecasting wind speed signals that can, in turn, inform the development of appropriate energy, and especially demand side management strategies. In this context, we use artificial neural networks (ANN) and provide prediction of wind speed for three different island locations of the Aegean Sea, evaluating the wind speed signals for 1-10 h ahead.

Considering their high acquisition, operation, and maintenance costs, ESSs are likely to serve a large number of users. Hence, optimal sizing of energy ESSs plays a critical role as over-provisioning ESS size leads to under-utilizing costly assets and under-provisioning it taxes operation lifetime. This paper proposes a stochastic framework for analyzing the optimal size of energy storage systems. In this framework the demand of each customer is modeled stochastically and the aggregate demand is accommodated by a combination of power drawn from the grid and the storage unit when the demand exceeds grid capacity. In this framework an analytical method is developed, which provides tractable solution to the ESS sizing problem of interest.

The scheduling of volume requests in physical storage nodes or virtualized storage pools is usually based on a single criterion, such as the available capacity or the number of volumes per backend. Those properties are exposed to the cloud block storage scheduler through drivers, and may vary based on the workload. Hence, most cloud storage providers refrain from describing Service Level Objectives (SLOs). In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a new scheduling algorithm for block storage systems that has the following advantages over the currently implemented scheduler in OpenStack. It provides guaranteed SLOs even in a dynamic workload, it increases the I/O throughput of the volumes that have been already provisioned in the backend systems, it can be scalable to a higher arrival rate for the volume requests, and finally it can minimize the number of active hosts (or else the energy consumption). The volume placement process is based on an APX-hard multi-dimensional Vector Bin Packing (VBPd) algorithm. In order to reduce the complexity we propose a heuristic named Modified Vector Best Fit Decreasing (MVBFD). Our scheduler design for block storage systems is based on the principles of the OpenStack's Cinder scheduler; hence it can be deployed with only minor modifications to an OpenStack block storage deployment. © 2015 IEEE.","Cloud Storage; Infrastructure as a Service; Resource Scheduling; Vector Bin Packing",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953731535

However, due to uncertainties in harvested energy, it is necessary to adopt energy efficient power control schemes to reduce an SBSs' energy consumption and thus ensure quality-of-service (QoS) for users. Such energy-efficient design can also be done via the use of content caching which reduces the usage of the capacity-limited SBS backhaul. of popular content at SBS can also prove beneficial in this regard by reducing the backhaul usage. In this paper, an online energy efficient power control scheme is developed for an energy harvesting SBS equipped with a wireless backhaul and local storage. In our model, energy arrivals are assumed to be Poisson distributed and the popularity distribution of requested content is modeled using Zipf's law. The power control problem is formulated as a (discounted) infinite horizon dynamic programming problem and solved numerically using the value iteration algorithm. Using simulations, we provide valuable insights on the impact of energy harvesting and caching on the energy and sum-throughput performance of the SBS as the network size is varied. Our results also show that the size of cache and energy harvesting equipment at the SBS can be traded off, while still meeting the desired system performance. © 2015 IEEE.","Edge caching; Energy harvesting; Green communications; Small cells","Dynamic programming; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Iterative methods; Poisson distribution; Power control; Quality control; Quality of service; Wireless networks; Dynamic programming problems; Edge caching; Energy-efficient design; Green communications; Next-generation wireless network; Popularity distribution; Small cells; Value iteration algorithm; Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947813555

In particular, a noncooperative game is formulated between customers equipped with distributed storage units who seek to decide on their optimal charging strategy so as to optimize a utility that reflects both the monetary benefit from the charging/ discharging operation and the associated penalty from power regulation. In contrast to the traditional game-theoretic models that are often based on rational and objective decisions, we introduce the behavioral framework of prospect theory (PT) so as to explicitly incorporate how the customers estimate their utilities with respect to their real-world considerations of gains and losses.

Hence, in this paper we propose a 2-stage multibranch linear MOE (minimum output energy) receiver which collects symbols from different paths to deal with frequency selective fading environment. Due to the big number of antennas, we are using sample covariance matrix other than estimating all channels. To avoid collecting large number of samples (which requires additional storage resources and may cause significant system delay), we are focusing on detection methods which use less samples. With the aid of a new method of singular matrix preconditioning and efficient series expansion, we are able to show that this implementation not only achieves lower computational complexity but also outperforms the conventional reduced-rank receiver and the single branch MOE receiver as well. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Covariance matrix; MIMO systems; Detection methods; Low-complexity detections; Minimum output energy; Number of samples; Reduced rank receivers; Sample covariance matrix; Singular matrices; Storage resources; Frequency selective fading",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947730286

Charging times for electric vehicles (EV) can be shifted into overnight hours, which are usually off-peak. EVs can also be used as energy storage devices, available during certain peak hours to power a house with electricity stored during off-peak hours. Studies suggest both techniques are practical, but were based on simulated demand patterns or large commercial fleets. To investigate feasibility on a per home basis, we collected data from 15 EV homes using the Lab of Things sensing infrastructure. We evaluate a scheme that powers homes with their car battery during expensive electricity periods and then charges the battery during cheaper periods.

To improve the overall reliability of the Li-ion batteries, the Battery Management Systems (BMS) should have the capabilities to detect different types of faults. Some of these faults can lead to catastrophic scenarios if they are not diagnosed early. In this paper, a stochastic approach of quantized systems is proposed for fault detection in Li-ion batteries. The scheme uses a quantized stochastic model derived from the equivalent circuit model of the battery to predict the most probable future states/outputs from the measured inputs and quantized outputs. Fault detection is achieved via comparison of the expected event and the actual event. To illustrate the effectiveness of the approach the model parameters for commercial Li-ion battery cell have been extracted from experiments, and then faults are injected in simulation studies. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

One of the principle benefits of hydraulic over electric hybrids is the higher power density offered by their energy storage media. This enables hydraulic hybrids to capture virtually all of the available kinetic energy from braking. In contrast electric hybrids are often forced to dissipate part of this energy through friction brakes due to the lower power density inherent in their energy storage media. To date various hydraulic hybrid architectures have been investigated and put into production. However as is typically true there always exists room for improvement. This paper details the integration of a novel blended hydraulic hybrid transmission with improved performance and efficiency into a demonstration vehicle.

The PCM to store thermal energy is packed in many small hollow cylinders and placed in a larger cylinder tank. Heat transfer fluid (HTF) which flows parallel to the PCM cylinder is used to distribute heat from the solar collector to the PCM storage unit and vice versa. A mathematical model describing the behaviour of temperature in the PCM and HTF is used. Numerical solutions are obtained by transforming heat conduction equations of the PCM and HTF into enthalpy equation and solving it by using the Godunov method. Thermal performance during charging and discharging process of several selected PCMs is investigated. The simulation results showed that magnesium nitrate hexahydrate has the highest capacity to store solar thermal energy whereas erythritol can achieve the highest temperature history during charging time and at the first 54 minutes of discharging time.

Due to the unconventional flux path distribution of this machine, a 3-D finite element (Maxwell 12) method was used to analyses the design, of course including its electromagnetic torque and axial force performances. The effects of the rotor permanent magnet (PM) and slots skew angles on the cogging torque and the axial force have been studied. It is found that an optimum skew angle is effective in reducing the overall cogging torque with negligible effect on the static axial force.

A PV-hydro system was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink to analyze the transient stability problems due to PV fluctuations and/or load or generation changes. Virtual synchronous machine was added which reduced the frequency deviations and the high rate of change of frequency. The results indicate that the transient stability of photovoltaic-hydro microgrid systems can be improved by using virtual synchronous machines using a minimum amount of energy storage.

The model is especially suited to analyze the interactions of energy storage systems (ESS) with conventional generation sources, in the framework of reliable operation (n - 1). One of the most important consequences of high levels of RES in the network is the variability induced on the existing generation fleet, and the wear-and-tear derived from ramping conventional units to counteract the changes in RES output. Our Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SC-OPF) optimizes the injection into the network, including the cost of changes between periods for a given horizon. The results show that the main benefits derived from ESS are the reduction in the provision of ancillary services from conventional generation sources. These services are instead provided by ESS units.

One approach is to address these issues by utilizing the increased flexibility offered by energy storage devices (utility and customer owned), distributed responsive load and thermally controlled loads. The flexible resources come with their own set of physical and customer convenience constraints to their flexibility. In this paper, the flexible power system operation problem is cast as a multi-step OPF problem which includes transition constraints of flexible dynamic resources and customer requirements. The flexible resource constraints are derived from their physically-based model and imposing the 'no customer inconvenience' requirement. Model, objectives and constraints are expressed with quadratized models (objects) leading to an object-oriented quadratic flexible OPF.

Using the United States as a benchmark, the author tests the hypothesis that EU energy security is at risk primarily because of a lack of market integration and cooperation between member states. This lack of integration still prohibits natural gas to flow freely throughout the continent, which makes parts of Europe vulnerable in case of supply disruptions. The book demonstrates that the EU gas market has been developing at different speeds, leaving the Northwest of the continent reasonably well integrated, with sufficient trade and liquidity and different supplies, whereas other parts are less developed. In these parts of Europe there is a structural lack of investments in infrastructure, interconnectors, reverse flow options and storage facilities. Thus, even though substantial progress has been made in parts of the EU, single source dependency often prevails, leaving the relevant member states vulnerable to market power abuse. Detailed comparisons are made of the situations in the Netherlands and Poland, and of energy policy in the USA.

The device integrates a low-voltage (13.2V) Li-ion battery pack, an embedded bidirectional DC-DC converter and wireless communication system. The three parts are packaged together, thus it can be directly connected to high-voltage (380V) DC grid, enabling a modular approach for battery energy storage systems. Two 650V enhancement mode GaN transistors are used at the high voltage side. Compared with Si device, three improvements can be achieved in the application: expanding the operation range to light load, reducing switching loss and EMI, increasing the total efficiency of charging and discharging operation. The power stage design as well as a loss analysis of GaN is based on a steady state analysis and PSpice simulation. A 400V to 12V DC, 1kW converter for 1kWh DESD prototype is designed, fabricated, and tested.

However, issues such as cloud-induced intermittency in PV generation forces equipment on the electrical grid to cycle excessively, preventing PV generation from being a reliable or dispatchable source of power, particularly for utilities. To mitigate this intermittency, the PV must be coordinated with either dispatchable generation, energy storage, or demand response. In order to do so economically, it is necessary to develop a model of PV power that can be included in design and control problems. A semi-Markov process model is proposed for PV power. Unlike existing models of PV power, the proposed model has a wide range of applicability across both small and large timescales. These applications include simulating PV power, short-term forecasting of PV power, design of rule-based controllers for energy storage units (ESU), and stochastic scheduling of ESU in conjunction with other resources. This paper investigates the suitability of the model implemented in algorithms in real-time. To this end, the complexity of four algorithms involving the model is analyzed in terms of the number of operations required vs. number of samples processed. This is validated by implementing the algorithms on a representative target platform, demonstrating that they can complete within reasonable deadlines. © 2015 IEEE.","Coordinated control; energy storage sizing; high penetration PV; microgrids; power distribution; semi-Markov process; smart grids; solar intermittency; solar radiation; statistical modeling","Computational complexity; Distributed power generation; Electric load dispatching; Electric power distribution; Electric power system control; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Markov processes; Photovoltaic cells; Power electronics; Solar radiation; Statistical process control; Stochastic systems; Co-ordinated control; high penetration PV; Intermittency; Micro grid; Power distributions; Semi markov process; Smart grid; Statistical modeling; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954155558

However, the control and management of such systems require keen attention, as stability issues in microgrids have proven to be an important topic of research. It is a point of emphasis, that microgrids operating as stand-alone systems are particularly unforgiving in the sense that the combined inertia of local synchronous generators may not be significant enough to ensure good stability margins. Therefore, energy storage may be prescribed as a mitigation option for achieving frequency and voltage stability in low-inertia systems. This paper considers the electrical frequency dynamics of low-inertia microgrids as well as the voltage regulation implications of associated power electronic interfaces.

It is based on the fact that though numerous important therapeutic protein products have been developed for life threatening and chronic diseases that possess acceptable safety and efficacy profiles, these products have generally not been reexamined and modified for an improved clinical performance, with enhancements both to safety and efficacy profiles. Advances in protein engineering, coupled with greatly enhanced understanding of critical product quality attributes for efficacy and safety, make it possible to optimize predecessor products for clinical performance, thereby enhancing patient quality of life and with the potential for great savings in health care costs. Yet despite such knowledge, there is little movement towards such modifications. This book examines engineering protein therapeutic products such that they exhibit an optimal, not just an adequate, clinical performance profile. Two product classes, therapeutic enzymes for lysosomal storage diseases (enzyme replacement therapies, ERT) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), are used as examples of what modifications to such proteins could be made to enhance clinical performance, closer to a cure as it were. For ERT, the key to optimizing clinical performance is to ensure the ERT is endowed with moieties that target the protein to the relevant target tissue. Thus, for Gaucher Disease, our best example of how to optimize an ERT to address a disease that manifests in specific target tissues (macrophages and monocytes), the enzyme has been extensively modified to target macrophages. For diseases such as Pompe Disease, largely a disorder of muscle, optimal performance of ERT will depend on endowing the enzyme with the ability to be taken up via the Mannose 6 Phosphate Receptor, and so one of the chapters in the book will discuss such approaches. Moreover, a major failure of biotechnology based products is to gain access to the CNS, a key target tissue in numerous diseases. Thus, a chapter has been devoted to strategies to access the CNS. Additionally, immune responses to therapeutic proteins can be highly problematic, eliminating the efficacy of life saving or highly effective protein therapeutics. This is especially poignant in the case of Pompe Disease wherein great improvement in muscle strength and functionality is lost following development of an immune response to the ERT with consequent patient deterioration and death. Thus, a chapter regarding protein engineering, as well as other non-clinical approaches to diminishing immunogenicity is a valuable part of the book. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be engineered to bind targets relevant to a wide variety of diseases; binding affinity, however, is only part of the equation and one of the chapters will present a molecular assessment approach that balances affinity with pharmacokinetics and manufacturability. As with other proteins immunogenicity can be problematic, being responsible for loss of efficacy of anti-TNF mAbs, often after prolonged successful treatment. The authors will also share their perspective on the consequences of physico-chemical modifications occurring to mAbs once they reach the circulation or their target, a research area open to further development from a protein engineering as well as analytical perspective. This book will also discuss novel platforms for protein therapeutics, technologies that exceed mAbs with respect to potency, and hence, potentially efficacy. These platforms consist largely of repeat domain proteins with very high affinity for their target ligands, but while potentially more efficacious, immunogenicity may be a major problem limiting use.

However, despite the diversified correlation-aware designs proposed up to date, they commonly suffer from a shortcoming where link correlation is inaccurately measured, which leads them to sub-optimal performance. In this work we propose a general framework for accurate capturing of link correlation, enabling better utilization of the phenomenon for protocols lying on top of it. Our framework uses SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio) to detect correlations, followed by modeling the correlations for in-network use. We show that our design is light-weight, both computation and storage-wise.

A rich library of polymers can be used as the skin layers for specific separations, whereas the membrane substrates act merely as a mechanical support for the thin films. Membrane separation processes are particularly susceptible to the fouling problem because it leads to blockage of selective pores, formation of a thick biofilm on top of the membrane, contamination of the permeate stream, and degradation of the membrane material. © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This paper considers stochastic allocation schedules in networks that admit bulk file requests, across three drive blocking models. We consider a block-based code and a stochastic scheduling algorithm which is beneficial in the case of continuous chunk read patterns. In particular, we demonstrate that in systems with continuous chunk reading patterns, when drive blocking is either independent or from traffic congestion, block coded storage can reduce average download time by 10 - 66%, given modern system parameters. However, a distinction should be made between systems with continuous and those with interrupted chunk read patterns. For interrupted chunk read systems, given our allocation algorithm that performs well for continuous reads, block coded storage performance can be worse than replication, numerical illustrations show relative losses over 66%. These illustrations demonstrate that to harness the full benefits of coded storage and to avoid pitfalls, careful attention must be paid to continuous vs. Interrupted chunk reading patterns, codes other than block codes should be considered, as could joint code-scheduling design. © 2015 IEEE.","Blocking probability; Bulk requests; Cloud computing architectures; Coded storage; Design patterns; Download time; File chunks; Reading patterns; Storage","Blocking probability; Cloud computing; Codes (symbols); Computer architecture; Continuous time systems; Energy storage; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Switching circuits; Traffic congestion; Bulk requests; Cloud computing architectures; Design Patterns; Download time; File chunks; Reading patterns; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960106830

An optimization framework that covers the request dispatch, server resource allocation, and battery charging management is proposed. Instead of controlling the input/output power of the batteries after knowing the power profile of all other components of the data center as in a set of prior work, an optimal management policy is proposed which adjusts the power consumption (or supply) of servers and the battery banks at the same time. A response time dependent revenue model is adopted based on the delay estimation using the generalized processor sharing model. The rate capacity effect and the state of health degradation of the batteries, as well as the conversion and transmission loss in the power delivery network, are considered for the purpose of accurate power modeling and utility cost estimation. It is shown that the problem can be transformed into a series of convex optimization problems and then solved using standard solvers. © 2015 IEEE.","Battery model; Cloud computing; Data center; State of health degradation","Cloud computing; Convex optimization; Cost estimating; Digital storage; Economics; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission; Embedded systems; Information management; Optimization; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Storage management; Battery modeling; Convex optimization problems; Data centers; Generalized processor sharing; Optimization framework; Power delivery network; Rate-capacity effects; State of health; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960105987

However, the prior work does not use a realistic power delivery architecture of the data center with hierarchical ESD structure, and fails to account for some key characteristics such as rate capacity effect of batteries and power losses in various AC/DC and DC/DC converters in the power delivery architecture. This paper aims to overcome these shortcomings by (i) adopting a realistic power delivery architecture (from Intel) for centralized ESD structure as the starting point, (ii) presenting a novel power delivery architecture for data centers with hierarchical ESD structure, borrowing the best features of the centralized ESD structure from Intel and the distributed single-level ESD structures from Google and Microsoft, (iii) providing a mathematical framework for the optimal design (i.e., ESD provisioning) and control (i.e., Scheduling the charging and discharging of various ESDs) of the hierarchical ESD structure to minimize overall energy cost under dynamic energy pricing functions. This framework accounts for constraints on ESD volume (for each level) and the overall (annually amortized) capital cost, and power losses due to the rate capacity effect and conversion circuitry. The ESD design problem is solved by using a search-based algorithm, whereas the ESD control problem is formulated and solved as a hierarchical convex optimization algorithm. Experiments have been conducted using real Google cluster workload based on realistic data center specifications, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimal design and control framework. © 2015 IEEE.","Data centers; Energy storage devices (ESDs); Hierarchical ESD structure","Algorithms; Cloud computing; Convex optimization; Cost reduction; Costs; DC-DC converters; Electric power transmission; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatic discharge; Energy storage; Functions; Memory architecture; Optimal systems; Optimization; Rectifying circuits; Control of energies; Convex optimization algorithms; Data centers; Dynamic energy pricing; Energy cost reduction; Mathematical frameworks; Rate-capacity effects; Search-based algorithms; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960098719

Liquid product yield from biomass can be as much as 80% of starting dry weight and contains up to 75% of the biomass energy content. Other products are gases, primarily carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane, as well as solid char and ash. Residence time in the reactor is only 0.5-2s so that relatively small, low-capital-cost reactors can be used. The low capital cost combined with greenhouse gas emission reductions relative to petroleum fuels of 50-95% makes pyrolysis an attractive process. The pyrolysis liquids have been investigated as a refinery feedstock and as stand-alone fuels. Utilization of raw pyrolysis oil has proven challenging. The organic fraction is highly corrosive because of its high organic acid content. High water content lowers the net heating value and can increase corrosivity. It can be poorly soluble in petroleum or petroleum products and can readily absorb water. Distillation residues can be as high as 50%, viscosity can be high, oils can exhibit poor stability in storage, and they can contain suspended solids. The ignition quality of raw pyrolysis oils is poor, with cetane number estimates ranging from 0 to 35, but more likely to be in the lower end of that range. While the use of raw pyrolysis oils in certain specific applications with specialized combustion equipment may be possible, raw oils must be significantly upgraded for use in on-highway spark-ignition (SI) and compression-ignition (CI) engines. Upgrading approaches most often involve catalytic hydrodeoxygenation, one of a class of reactions known as hydrotreating or hydroprocessing. This chapter discusses the properties of raw and upgraded pyrolysis oils, as well as the potential for integrating biomass pyrolysis with a petroleum refinery to significantly reduce the hydroprocessing cost. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We model the dynamic packet forwarding problem as a modified Rubinstein-Ståhl bargaining game. In our model, a mobile node (player) negotiates with the other mobile node to obtain an agreeable and respectable sharing rule of packet forwarding based on its own resource available, such that a node should not agree to forward packets without the energy or storage capacity to do so. We investigate and solve this bargaining by finding the Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) strategies of the game. We consider finite horizon of the bargaining game and examine its SPNE. The solution obtained from bargaining ensures that a mobile device always finds a peer to help forward packets in order to keep the network at flow. Extensive simulations using OMNET++ simulation frameworks are conducted to evaluate how the level of participation of each mobile node impact the network overall performance. Simulation results show that our proposed bargaining game scheme performs better than other resource shared algorithms, namely the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and the bargaining game based access network selection for heterogeneous network. © 2015 IEEE.","bargaining game; MANET; multi-hop wireless network","Ad hoc networks; Artificial intelligence; Digital storage; Game theory; Heterogeneous networks; Mobile devices; Telecommunication networks; Wireless ad hoc networks; Access network selections; Autonomous ad hoc networks; Bargaining game; Extensive simulations; MANET; Multihop wireless network; Simulation framework; Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions; Mobile ad hoc networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953260936

The exponential improvement path of Moore's Law has been the driver behind the computing approach of Turing, von Neumann, and FORTRAN-like languages. Performance growth is slowing at the system level, even though further exponential growth should be possible. We propose two technology shifts as a remedy, the first being the formulation of a scaling rule for scaling into the third dimension. This involves use of circuit-level energy efficiency increases using adiabatic circuits to avoid overheating. However, this scaling rule is incompatible with the von Neumann architecture. The second technology shift is a computer architecture and programming change to an extremely aggressive form of Processor-In-Memory (PIM) architecture, which we call Processor-In-Memory-and-Storage (PIMS). Theoretical analysis shows that the PIMS architecture is compatible with the 3D scaling rule, suggesting both immediate benefit and a long-term improvement path. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Computer programming; Energy efficiency; Memory architecture; Nanotechnology; Adiabatic circuits; Efficiency increase; Exponential growth; Neumann architecture; Processor-in-memory; Processor-in-memory architectures; Storage architectures; Technology shift; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949599852

In this paper, we describe MFNW, a Flip-N-Write encoding solution that effectively reduces the average write energy and improves endurance of MLC NVMs. Two MFNW modes are proposed and analyzed: cell Hamming distance (CHD) mode and energy Hamming distance (EHD) mode. For both modes, we derive a probabilistic model to approximate the statistical behavior of MFNW. For negligible error, the probabilistic model predicts the average number of cell writes per memory word, which is proportional to energy consumption. This enables word length optimization to maximize energy reduction subject to memory overhead constraints. We also estimate the hardware and delay overheads to integrate MFNW into a phase change memory prototype. MFNW is compared to two state-of-the-art techniques in the literature using traces of SPEC2006 benchmarks. Simulation results show an average energy reduction of 19% over the state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity of MFNW to the choice of word length, and our findings suggest a tradeoff between word length and energy reduction. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Cells; Cytology; Data storage equipment; Energy utilization; Hamming distance; Nanotechnology; Phase change memory; Emerging non-volatile memory; Energy reduction; Multi level cell (MLC); Non-volatile memory; Probabilistic modeling; State-of-the-art techniques; Statistical behavior; Word-length optimizations; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949560269

The economic crisis and global warming have rewritten the rules so far. The need for cheap and environmentally friendly energy is growing nowadays as well. The gas prices have increased to a level, where with the current electricity prices the operation of gas fired power plants is not profitable anymore. That's why Hungarian gas fired plants, like Gönyü or Tisza 2 had to shut down temporary or permanently. These effects and the European Union's renewable target led Hungary to tend to the direction of a nuclear-green energy mix. This means that with Paks and Paks 2 we will have a big nuclear base load, and a biomass, wind and solar based renewable producing system. The problem of this system is the coproduction of the two nuclear power plants, since there will be a huge uncontrollable capacity, and on top of that, the intermittent nature of solar and wind power plants will causea lot of problems. The Hungarian electricity system is not prepared for these challenges. That's why Hungary will need regulating capacity, which can help to compensate the fluctuation of supply and demand. An energy storage power plant can provide the utility needed for the system. All of the neighboring countries have some kind of storage facility, and Hungary will need some as well.

Most of the electric cars are designed for daily urban use, thus in the near future, bigger cities might have some ten percentage of electric cars running on their streets during the day. And these vehicles need to be recharged in the evening or during night, so the electric vehicles, including the high performance electric cars, will interact with the power grid in this period. The impact of the charging process is predicted to be apparent on the distribution system, mostly on the low voltage grid, by influencing the network voltage profiles and the loading of the grid elements. As a practical issue we have chosen parts of the LV grid of Budapest, a city with almost two million inhabitants. If 20% of the cars is electric powered, then every fifth household has a car that has to be charged. In this paper we present the results of simulations conducted on the aforementioned grids with chargers placed at different places, using the DIgSILENT Power Factory software package. To get a better view of how electric cars' charging would affect the LV grid, we have run several load flow simulations on a large number of power grids. By statistically analyzing the obtained results, an overall picture can be acquired about the possible issues that electric car charging might have on the electric network of a large city. © 2015 IEEE.","battery chargers; DIgSILENT; electric cars; electric vehicles; energy storage; power demand; power quality; power system simulation","Charging (batteries); Circuit theory; Crashworthiness; Electric automobiles; Electric load flow; Electric network analysis; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Power quality; Vehicles; Battery chargers; DIgSILENT; Electric cars; Power demands; Power system simulations; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946221467

For this purpose a calculation method for the estimation of energy production of solar collector system is introduced. The method uses the Reindl et al model to determine the incoming solar energy on the solar collector surface. The monthly performance of the solar collector was modeled according to Klein et al. The monthly performance of the solar collector system greatly depends on the amount of heat required for the DHW production and the system losses (distribution, circulation and storage). The estimation of these demands is also described in the model. The main objective of the work is a comparison of potential solar energy production, energy demand and energy losses in this particular building type. Typically for this building type the potential energy collecting surface is relatively low compared to the high DHW energy demand and the distribution losses, which are high due to the building characteristics. In the parametric study the solar fraction and the system efficiency are the main indicators of the system as a whole.

However, these advantages are not always guaranteed since the power profiles of DERs have high variability and the number of DERs is too many to control on an individual basis. In a hybrid energy system, these problems are counteracted through the aggregation and balancing of the variability of each distributed energy resource. This paper discusses optimal dispatch control mechanisms for 200 V, 500 Ah battery energy storage systems that support a 10 MW hybrid energy system, composed of distributed energy sources such as 1 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) generation and a 9 MW wind turbine based generation. The proposed mechanisms focus on the dispatch control of energy storage systems using forward and backward induction. For that purpose, the interdependence of frequency, state of charge (SOC), undercharge and reversible effects in the battery energy systems were used to identify the optimal operating margin for the dispatch of the energy storage systems. The hybrid energy system was implemented using Matlab-Simulink and the dispatch control mechanism was programmed using IBM CPLEX studio. With such setup, the hybrid system was able to maintain 85 % capacity factor per day while the system interruption and unavailability were reduced by 65 %. The results demonstrate that the functionality of DERs increases significantly while being supported by optimally dispatched energy storage systems. © 2015 IEEE.","Distributed Energy Resource (DER); Energy Storage; Forward-Backward Induction; Optimization; Power Grids","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Hybrid systems; MATLAB; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Backward induction; Battery energy storage systems; Distributed energy resource; Distributed Energy Resources; Distributed energy sources; Energy storage systems; Hybrid energy system; Power grids; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946606064

To solve these issues the use of energy buffer elements such as Supercapacitors has been proposed, which can provide energy to ride through short term generation reduction due to passing clouds or panel shading and can release energy during load transients, thus improving panel characteristics. In this paper analysis of different possible connection points of Supercapacitor banks to a power conditioning system for PV applications has been done. It is shown analytically that the use of an additional DC-DC Converter to connect the supercapacitors to the power conditioner DC-link is the most advantageous option in terms of system performance.

Also, most recommended compensation strategies based on the theory require the supply voltage to be approximately sinusoidal and symmetrical to avoid erroneous compensation. Under these conditions, the compensation strategies produce the desired results.

In this work, the value of energy storage for reducing such costs is studied. In particular, profit maximization is considered for a WPP who participates in a two-settlement (forward and real time) market and utilizes energy storage by charging/discharging it strategically. An infinite horizon discounted cost minimization problem for the optimal use of energy storage is formulated as a dynamic programming (DP) problem that includes the past unfulfilled forward contracts in the state space. The optimal storage operation policy is shown to have a structure with two thresholds: after delivering its contracted power, if a WPP's energy falls below a lower threshold, it buys energy and charges its storage up to this threshold; if its energy exceeds a higher threshold, it sells the excess energy and maintains its storage level at this threshold. Several heuristics for solving the DP are derived based on approximating the problem model: a) a discrete policy based on discretizing the state and action space, and b) affine and look ahead policies derived by solving a Linear Quadratic (LQ) controller whose parameters are fit from the DP. The heuristics are tested both with simulated and real world wind and price data. It is observed that while the discrete optimal policy performs better on simulated data than either the look ahead or the affine policies (except with a very high battery capacity), the look ahead policy performs much better with real world data. This suggests that the performance of look ahead approximate optimal policy is more robust to the modeling errors and mismatch between analytic models and real data traces. The appropriate heuristic to use thus depends on modeling fidelity, available computational resources and variability of wind and price forecasts. © 2015 American Automatic Control Council.",,"Dynamic programming; Energy storage; Operating costs; Power markets; Wind power; Charging/discharging; Computational resources; Generation uncertainty; Infinite horizon discounted costs; Linear quadratic controller; Profit maximization; Storage operations; Value of storages; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940943882

The optimization makes both discrete on/off and continuous load decisions for equipment while determining utilization of thermal energy storage systems. This formulation allows simultaneous optimization of heating and cooling subsystems, which interact directly when heatrecovery chillers are present. Nonlinear equipment models are approximated as piecewise-linear to balance modeling accuracy with the computational constraints imposed by online implementation and to ensure global optimality for the computed solutions. The chief benefits of this formulation are its ability to tightly control on/off switching of equipment, its consideration of cost contributions from auxiliary equipment such as pumps, and its applicability to large systems with multiple heating and cooling units in which a combinatorial problem must be solved to pick the optimal mix of equipment. These features result in improved performance over heuristic scheduling rules or other formulations that do not consider discrete decision variables. We show optimization results for a system with four conventional chillers, two heat-recovery chillers, and one hot water boiler.

A microgrid fulfills local demand using local generation (conventional and renewable) and storage, along with the electric grid (macrogrid). Demand and renewables such as Photovoltaic (PV) generation are uncertain throughout the day. Optimal management of the resources in a microgrid is necessary to integrate the uncertain renewable energy, serve the uncertain demand and provide the highest returns in terms of cost or emissions. The approach developed in this paper requires minimal modeling effort with regards to uncertainties and emphasizes battery pricing using realized profiles of demand and PV generation. We show that the optimal decision at each time instant is an economic dispatch that takes a rigorously-defined shadow-price for the battery power as input. Furthermore, we show that the calculation of this shadow-price can be simplified to avoid state-constraints in the computation of the optimal control solution. Finally, the results highlight the practical utility of this approach and the developed quasi-optimal solution is comparable to the deterministic optimum cost. © 2015 American Automatic Control Council.",,"Costs; Economics; Electric batteries; Microgrids; Photovoltaic cells; Scheduling; Uncertainty analysis; Economic Dispatch; Optimal control solution; Optimal decisions; Optimal management; Photovoltaic generation; Renewable energies; State constraints; Uncertain demand; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940940511

Our framework consists of a single user and a single provider (a regulated utility). The provider sets prices for the user, who pays for both total energy consumed ($/kWh, including peak and off-peak rates) and the peak rate of consumption in a month (a demand charge) ($/kW). The cost of electricity for the provider is based on a combination of capacity costs ($/kW) and fuel costs ($/kWh). In the optimal thermostat programming problem, the user minimizes the amount paid for electricity while staying within a pre-defined temperature range. The user has access to energy storage in the form of thermal capacitance of the interior structure of the building. The provider sets prices designed to minimize the total cost of producing electricity while meeting the needs of the user. To solve the user-problem, we use a variant of dynamic programming. To solve the provider-problem, we use a descent algorithm coupled with our dynamic programming code - yielding optimal on-peak, off-peak and demand prices. We show that thermal storage and optimal thermostat programming can reduce electricity bills using current utility prices from utilities Arizona Public Service (APS) and Salt River Project (SRP). Moreover, we obtain optimal utility prices which lead to significant reductions in the cost of generating electricity and electricity bills. © 2015 American Automatic Control Council.",,"Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Heat storage; Optimal systems; Storage as a service (STaaS); Thermostats; Arizona public services; Cost of electricity; Interior structure; Programming problem; Rate of consumption; Regulated utilities; Salt river projects; Thermal capacitance; Dynamic programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940934071

Ice or chilled water is produced when electricity prices are low and stored to provide cooling when prices are high. While this price-based load shifting has value for power system operators, buildings with thermal storage could provide more direct grid services by reacting to demand charges and demand response calls. In this paper, we consider the problem of cooling a building under these incentives. The context is a New York City office building with passive and active thermal storage, subject to Consolidated Edison's (ConEd's) default rate plan for large commercial buildings. This rate plan includes a three-tiered demand charge and hourly energy prices determined by the system operator's day-ahead dispatch. We also model a ConEd demand response program, and consider the thermal comfort of building occupants. The problem is formulated in the language of stochastic optimal control and solved approximately using model predictive control (MPC).

With this information, a one-step ahead model predictive optimization approach is developed for scheduling the hybrid system power output for the next 30min. Compared to conventional multi-step-ahead model predictive optimizations, the proposed one-step ahead optimization with offline-obtained desired SOC obviates calculations with inaccurate multi-step-ahead wind predictions, hence it is more reliable and computational efficient. Second, a real-time controller is developed to make the actual hybrid system power output match the scheduled target. It determines the reference power set point for wind turbine by a steady state optimization approach and subsequently applies an active power controller to track this set point.

The model framework consists of trial functions that are statistically regressed to Li-ion cell life datasets wherein the cells have been aged under different levels of stress. Degradation mechanisms and rate laws dependent on temperature, storage, and cycling condition are regressed to the data, with multiple model hypotheses evaluated and the best model down-selected based on statistics.

The CCC process has a fast response time to load changes to allow higher utilization of intermittent renewable power sources to be used at a grid-scale level in the power sector. The impact of the CCC process on the performance and operating profit of a single fossil-fueled power generation unit is studied in this paper.

A major aspect is the operational lifetime of the system which is determined by the finite energy source supplied by the battery. In WSNs, the higher power incurred due to added system functionality and the increase leakage as a result of technology scaling have high impact on the battery lifetime. In this work, memory was used to further exploit the energy efficiency at the sensor node system-level. A detailed analysis using Semi-Markov model to investigate different operational modes of WSN with the present SRAM shows an improvement of 4x at 90% duty cycle in the node's lifetime. In addition, an emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technology, Memristor, is also explored to further improve the WSN energy efficiency. Its non-volatility nature will suppress the power wasted as leakage in SRAM during idle periods which is typical for low duty-cycle WSNs. The results show that utilizing an on-chip NVM can further improve WSN lifetime by 1x for low activity μW range sensor nodes. © 2015 IEEE.","local data storage; low-power; Memory; Semi-Markov; wireless sensor node","Data storage equipment; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Markov processes; Sensor nodes; Emerging non-volatile memory; Local data; Low Power; Operational lifetime; Semi-Markov; System functionality; Technology scaling; Wireless sensor node; Static random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946226224

The computational aspects of these emerging communities are coming into focus and being addressed through the deployment of several new XSEDE resources that feature easy on-ramps, customizable software environments through virtualization, and interconnects optimized for jobs that only use hundreds or thousands of cores; however, the data storage requirements for these emerging communities remains much less well characterized. To this end, we examined the distribution of file sizes on two of the Lustre file systems within the Data Oasis storage system at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC). We found that there is a very strong preference for small files among SDSC's users, with 90% of all files being less than 2 MB in size. Furthermore, 50% of all file system capacity is consumed by files under 2 GB in size, and these distributions are consistent on both scratch and projects storage file systems. Because parallel file systems like Lustre and GPFS are optimized for parallel IO to large, widestripe files, these findings suggest that parallel file systems may not be the most suitable storage solutions when designing cyberinfrastructure to meet the needs of emerging communities.

While emerging memories have been considered for many architectural components such as caches, the asymmetric access properties and relatively small size of network-FIFOs compared to the required perIPheral circuitry has led to few such replacements proposed for NoCs. In this paper, we propose control schemes that leverage the 'shift-register' nature of spintronic domain-wall memory (DWM) to replace conventional memory buffers for the NoC. Our results indicate that the best shift-based scheme utilizes a dual-nanowire approach to ensure that reads and writes can be more effectively aligned with access ports for simultaneous access in the same cycle. Our approach provides a 2.93X speedup over a DWM buffer using a traditional FIFO memory control scheme with a 1.16X savings in energy.

With specific hardware implementation, accelerators can improve performance and reduce energy consumption by orders of magnitude compared to general purpose cores. However, hardware accelerators cannot tolerate memory and communication latency through extensive multi-threading; this increases the demand for efficient memory interface and network-on-chIP (NoC) designs. In this paper we explore the global management of NoCs in accelerator-rich architectures to provide predictable performance and energy efficiency. Accelerator memory accesses exhibit predictable patterns, creating highly utilized network paths. Leveraging these observations we propose reserving NoC paths based on the timing information from the global manager. We further maximize the benefit of paths reservation by regularizing the communication traffic through TLB buffering and hybrid-switching. The combined effect of these optimizations reduces the total execution time by 11.3% over a packet-switched mesh NoC and 8.5% over the EVC [18] and a previous hybrid-switched NoC [29]. © 2015 ACM.",,"Acceleration; Buffer storage; Computer aided design; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Integrated circuit interconnects; Interconnection networks (circuit switching); Memory architecture; Network architecture; Packet switching; Hardware; Packet networks; Program processors; Routers; VLSI circuits; Communication latency; Hardware accelerators; Improve performance; Low energy consumption; Network-on-chip design; On-chip interconnection network; Orders of magnitude; Reduce energy consumption; Modern processors; Timing information; Network-on-chip",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944088584

However, the energy consumed by read and write operations presents a major challenge to their use as energy-efficient on-chIP memory. Leveraging the ability of many applications to tolerate impreciseness in their underlying computations and data, we explore approximate storage as a new approach to improving the energy-efficiency of spintronic memories. We identify and characterize mechanisms in STT-MRAM bit-cells that provide favorable energy-quality trade-o?s, i.e., disproportionate energy improvements at the cost of small probabilities of read/write failures. Based on these mechanisms, we design a quality-configurable memory array in which data can be stored to varying levels of accuracy based on application requirements. We integrate the quality-configurable array as a scratchpad in the memory hierarchy of a programmable vector processor and expose it to software by introducing quality-aware load/store instructions within the ISA. We evaluate the energy benefits of our proposal using a device-to-architecture modeling framework and demonstrate 40% and 19.5% improvement in memory energy and overall application energy respectively, for negligible (< 0.5%) quality loss across a suite of recognition and vision applications. © 2015 ACM.","Approximate Memories; Energy Efficiency; Spintronics","Computer aided design; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Memory architecture; Spintronics; Spintronics; Economic and social effects; Magnetoelectronics; Microprocessor chips; MRAM devices; Application requirements; Architecture modeling; Energy benefits; Energy efficient; Memory hierarchy; Vector processors; Vision applications; Write operations; On-chip storage; MRAM devices; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944088582

While custom smart memories have been successfully constructed for various applications, a fully automated LiM synthesis flow enables architectural exploration that has heretofore not been possible.

Before deploying STT-RAM and PCM into functional systems, a number of challenges still remain. Specifically, both require relatively high write energy, STT-RAM suffers from high bit error rates and PCM suffers from low endurance. A common solution to overcome those challenges is to minimize the number of bits changed per write. In this work, we introduce Pseudo-Random Encoding Scheme (PRES) to minimize the number of bit changes during memory writes. PRES maps the write data vector into an intermediate highly random set of data vectors. Subsequently, the intermediate data vector that yields the least number of differences when compared to the currently stored data is selected. Our evaluation shows that PRES reduces bit flIPs by up to 25% over a baseline differential writing scheme. Further, PRES reduces bit flIPs by 15% over the leading bit-flIP minimization scheme, while decreasing encoding and decoding complexities by more than 90%. © 2015 ACM.","Endurance; Memory; Pseudo-Random Encoding","Computer aided design; Data storage equipment; Durability; Dynamic random access storage; Encoding (symbols); Fault tolerant computer systems; Signal encoding; Phase change memory; Encoding and decoding; Encoding schemes; Functional systems; High bit error rates; Non-volatile memory technology; Phase change memory (pcm); Pseudo random; Spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM); Phase change memory; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944088558

Braking strategies can be formulated to dictate the manner in which the braking effort is shared between the electrical and mechanical brakes. Electrical braking capability is identified by regions in the braking quadrants of an electric machine's torque-speed plane, and these capability regions may be further subdivided into regenerative and non-regenerative braking regions. Regenerative electrical braking adds energy to the energy storage system, whereas non-regenerative electrical braking subtracts energy from the energy storage system.

These capacitors are used to reduce the voltage ripple in the dc bus. These electrolytic capacitors occupy significant volume and suffer from reliability issues. The required capacitance can be greatly reduced by rejecting the ripple current in the dc bus. The ripple current in the dc bus is rejected at the cost of an additional half-bridge inverter. The half-bridge inverter injects a current out of phase in reference to the dc bus ripple current. The current is injected by applying a voltage across an energy storage element (Inductor). The voltage across the energy storage element is controlled by the dutycyle of the half-bridge. A mathematical relationship between the voltage applied across the energy storage element and the ripple current in the dc bus is derived. Analysis of the ripple current rejection is performed on a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) based SiC single phase AC-DC converter capable of sinking or sourcing real and reactive power. Simulation results are presented verifying ripple current rejection in the dc bus for various operating conditions.

We provide a new method that reduces energy consumption of an application on many-core processors by identifying unique segments to apply dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). Our method, phase-based voltage and frequency scaling (PVFS), hinges on the identification of phases, i.e., Segments of code with unique performance and power attributes, using hidden Markov Models. In particular, we demonstrate the use of this method to target hardware components on many-core processors such as Network-on-Chip (NoC). PVFS uses these phases to construct a static power schedule that uses DVFS to reduce energy with minimal performance penalty. This general scheme can be used with a variety of performance and power metrics to match the needs of the system and application. More importantly, the flexibility in the general scheme allows for targeting of the unique hardware components of future many-core processors. We provide an in-depth analysis of PVFS applied to five threaded benchmark applications, and demonstrate the advantage of using PVFS for 4 to 32 cores in a single socket. Empirical results of PVFS show a reduction of up to 10.1% of total energy while only impacting total time by at most 2.7% across all core counts. Furthermore, PVFS outperforms standard coarse-grain time-driven DVFS, while scaling better in terms of energy savings with increasing core counts. © 2015 IEEE.","DVFS; Phases; Statistical Models","Benchmarking; Buffer storage; Dynamic frequency scaling; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Network-on-chip; Signal detection; Voltage scaling; Benchmark applications; DVFS; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Hardware components; Many-core processors; Network-on-chip(NoC); Performance penalties; Phases; Hidden Markov models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944319336

Recent studies have proposed Computational Sprinting, which allows a chip to temporarily exceed its power and thermal limits by turning on all its cores for a short time period, such that its computing performance is boosted for bursty computation demands. However, conducting sprinting in a data center faces new challenges due to power and thermal constraints at the data center level, which are exacerbated by recently proposed power infrastructure under-provisioning and reliance on renewable energy, as well as the increasing server density. In this paper, we propose Data Center Sprinting, a methodology that enables a data center to temporarily boost its computing performance by turning on more cores in the era of dark silicon, in order to handle occasional workload bursts. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by analyzing the tripping characteristics of data center circuit breakers and the discharging characteristics of energy storage devices, in order to realize safe sprinting without causing undesired server overheating or shutdown. We evaluate a prototype of Data Center Sprinting on a hardware testbed and in data enter-level simulations.

Random variables are predicted by using an algorithm based on artificial neural networks. For computing within the operational planning, the task is divided into three parts. First, middle-term planning is used to solve the water resources distribution task.

This practice leads to significant load balance variation in vessel's autonomous power system compared to sea trials, frequently requiring an additional Diesel Generator (D/G) to work in parallel at low load to satisfy the limits set by power management system. To improve D/G operating profile and Specific Fuel Oil Consumption (SFOC), a data-driven control topology is proposed, involving speed adjustment of motors related to engine room ventilation and central cooling water processes that exhibit varying flow requirements according to ship's operating profile. A power saving margin that allows use of only one D/G at sea-going is created, optimizing D/G fuel consumption for M/E slow steaming operation. The proposed system is applied as retrofit installation in a typical tanker vessel's power system, where experimental results are compared to the previous operating condition to show the impact of D/G optimized operation on fuel consumption. A method is proposed to calculate economic and environmental benefits depending on type of fuel used, D/G SFOC and vessel's trading pattern.

For each time period, distributor negotiate amounts and prices with each microgrid separately, in rounds. Although both sides are modeled, we focus our research on the microgrid's bidding algorithm for monetary gain from sold surplus energy. Presented algorithm is simple and produces good results from microgrid perspective. Due to model simplicity, produced results aren't always optimal, and convergence had to be additionally helped.

The design conducts real-time fingerprinting with short latencies, and can be tuned for optimized clock rate with 'split fresh' technique. A pipelined sampling logic selects fingerprints based on the Minwise theory and adds only a few clock cycles of latency before returning the final results. The design can be replicated to work in parallel for higher throughput data traffic. This architecture is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA, and is tested on a storage prototyping platform. The implementation shows that the design can achieve clock rates above 300 MHz with an order of magnitude improvement in latency over prior software implementations, while consuming little hardware resource.

These costs are determined, not only by the aggregate energy generated, but also by the maximum instantaneous peak power demand required over time. Prior work proposes using energy storage devices to reduce these costs by periodically releasing energy to lower the electric grid's peak demand. However, prior work generally considers only a single storage technology employed at a single level of the electric grid's hierarchy. In this paper, we examine the efficacy of employing different combinations of storage technologies at different levels of the grid's distribution hierarchy. We present an optimization framework for modeling the primary characteristics that dictate the lifetime cost of many prominent energy storage technologies. Our framework captures the important tradeoffs in placing different technologies at different levels of the distribution hierarchy with the goal of minimizing a utility's operating costs. We evaluate our framework using real smart meter data from 5000 customers of a local electric utility. We show that by employing hybrid storage technologies at multiple levels of the distribution hierarchy, utilities can reduce their daily operating costs due to distributing electricity by up to 12%. © 2015 ACM.","Battery; Electricity; Energy; Grid; Peak shaving","Cost reduction; Costs; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electricity; Energy storage; Operating costs; Smart meters; Battery; Electricity distribution networks; Energy; Energy storage technologies; Grid; Optimization framework; Peak shaving; Transmission and distribution; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961238486

At present, one of the renewable sources of energy is wind energy, which has the advantage of being pollution free and inexhaustible. However, the use of wind energy is strongly influenced by wind speed, which is not constant. Such varying wind speeds lead to the creation of fluctuated wind power. Consequently, there is a need for modeling and the accurate prediction of wind speed to help optimize the design of the turbine and control system in a wind energy conversion system to maintain system stability. This paper presents the modeling of very short-term wind speed using Stochastic Petri Nets (SPN) that is based on the measurement results of wind speed in Nganjuk. In this study, Stochastic Petri Nets was designed by using 7 places and 7 transitions. Transition to the SPN is defined as a function that generates random values using a uniform function. Wind speed data that was generated during a 500 seconds interval, was compared with the observed wind speeds. The comparison of the generated wind speed and observed ones shows that both its statistical characteristic have similar value. © 2015 IEEE.","Modeling; Stochastic Petri Net; Wind Speed","Energy conversion; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent computing; Models; Petri nets; Random access storage; Speed; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; System stability; Wind power; Accurate prediction; Renewable sources; Statistical characteristics; Stochastic Petri net; Stochastic Petri Nets; Use of renewable energies; Wind energy conversion system; Wind speed; Wind",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943194566

This is particular true under dynamic energy prices, where consumers can use PV-based generation and controllable storage modules for peak shaving on their power demand profile from the grid. In general, accurate PV power generation and load power consumption predictions and accurate system modeling are required for the storage control algorithm in most previous works. In this work, the reinforcement learning technique is adopted for deriving the optimal control policy for the residential energy storage module, which does not depend on accurate predictions of future PV power generation and/or load power consumption results and only requires partial knowledge of system modeling. In order to achieve higher convergence rate and higher performance in non-Markovian environment, we employ the TD(Λ)-learning algorithm to derive the optimal energy storage system control policy, and carefully define the state and action spaces, and reward function in the TD(Λ)-learning algorithm such that the objective of the reinforcement learning algorithm coincides with our goal of electric bill minimization for the residential consumer.

However, the long switching time of magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) limits the write speed of the STT-RAM. In order to improve the write performance, a Spin-Hall Effect (SHE) assisted STT-RAM structure (SHE-RAM) has recently been proposed [1]. SHE effect eliminates the incubation delay existing in conventional STT-RAM switching and consequently, reduces the switching time and write energy. The corresponding read and write schemes have been also proposed [2][4]. However, the schemes in [2] suffer from a sharp writing pulse and require an external magnetic field created by a permanent magnet, introducing very high power consumption. In the design in [4], a single bit needs to be represented by two MTJs and four transistors. Such a design largely sacrifices the storage density as well as the power consumption. Nonetheless, a design that can maximize the benefits of SHE effects is still highly desired. In this work, we proposed two new memory cell designs to improve the density and power consumption of SHE-RAM while still maintaining its speed advantage. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Electric power utilization; Permanent magnets; Spin Hall effect; Cell structure; External magnetic field; High power consumption; Magnetic tunneling junctions; Memory cell design; Spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM); Storage densities; Switching time; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942474642

Recently using electroless deposition, we have established a method to prepare continuous nanotubes 20 μm in length with external diameter of 400 nm and uniform wall thickness of 100 nm [2]. The electroless process requires the use of a reducing agent, which favors the incorporation of an alloying element. In this study, we use dimethylamineborane (DMAB) as a reducing agent, resulting in the co-deposition of Ni and B, thereby forming Ni-B alloys [3]. As the deposits contain boron, the specific magnetization is lower compared to pure Ni. Here, we investigate the dependence of magnetic properties of Ni-B nanotubes on deposition bath pH and annealing temperature. We show that the specific magnetization of Ni-B nanotubes increases after annealing due to crystallization of amorphous nanotubes, while the nanotube structure is still preserved at high temperatures.

Among the emerging new memory technologies, including phase change memory, resistive random access memory, and conductive bridging random access memory, Spin Transfer Torque MRAM is the only candidate with the potential for unlimited endurance, since no atoms are moved during writing. This makes it the only potential candidate to replace dynamic random access memory (DRAM), when DRAM scaling comes to an end. DRAM is the ubiquitous working memory found in large quantities in nearly all computing systems. As DRAM is scaled below the 20 nm node, the capacitor on which the charge is stored needs to be made ever-taller, in order to maintain enough capacitance to store sufficient charge until the next refresh cycle. In addition to introducing significant process integration challenges, this also results in shorter charge storage time at advanced nodes, thus increasing the rate at which the DRAM needs to be refreshed. For a 64 Gb DRAM, it is predicted that the capacitor will leak so much that more than 40% of the time and almost half of the DRAM power will be spent on refreshing.[1] If the switching current for Spin Transfer Torque MRAM can be reduced below 10 uA, Spin Transfer Torque MRAM could replace DRAM below the 20 nm node. Write current largely determines the cost of Spin Transfer Torque MRAM, since the transistor and hence cell area must be sized large enough to source the write current. It is important to distinguish between several related switching currents. Physicists often speak of the switching current threshold, Ic0. The switching current is measured with slow pulses and extrapolated back to 1 ns. Theoretically, Ic0 corresponds to the switching threshold at zero temperature. A more technologically relevant parameter is Ic10ns, the array-average switching current for a 10 ns pulse. Since these measurements are usually single-shot measurements, this corresponds to a switching probability of about 0.5. However, this is not the write current, Iwrite, for which the transistor needs to be sized, since it does not take into account the additional current required to obtain reliable writing or the bit-to-bit distribution in switching current. For a 1-bit error correction code, a typical requirement for the probability of not switching is Pns = 1e-12 (this depends slightly on the size of the memory, the retention requirement, and the bit-to-bit distribution of activation energy). Measured data showed that the switching voltage increased from ∼ 0.35 V to ∼ 0.5 V in order to decrease the probability of not switching from Pns = 0.5 to Pns = 1e-12.[2] Furthermore, measurements on 500 junctions gave a standard deviation of about 4.5% of the mean switching voltage.[3] Keeping in mind that the above data was measured on large ∼ 100 nm junctions, we can use this data to make a rough estimate of Iwrite = (0.5/0.35)(1+6<4.5%)Ic10ns, which takes into account writing 6 sigma junctions from a Gaussian distribution. Hence we can expect Iwrite to be roughly twice Ic10ns. If a minimum feature size FinFet can source roughly 20 uA, then the requirement on switching current is Ic10ns < 10 uA. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Activation energy; Capacitance; Error correction; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; MRAM devices; Nanotechnology; Phase change memory; Probability distributions; Switching; Torque; Ubiquitous computing; Dynamic random access memory; Error correction codes; Magnetic random access memory; Minimum feature sizes; Random access memory; Resistive random access memory; Single-shot measurements; Switching probability; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942436704

Due to limited bandwidth available at both top-of-the-rack and aggregation switches, network bandwidth must be apportioned among different intra-and inter-rack data flows in line with their traffic statistics. We formulate this problem as weighted queuing and employ a class of probabilistic request scheduling policies to derive a closed-form outer-bound of service latency for erasure-coded storage with arbitrary file access patterns and service time distributions. The result enables us to propose a joint latency optimization over three entangled 'control knobs': the bandwidth allocation at top-of-the-rack and aggregation switches, the probabilities for scheduling file requests, and the placement of encoded file chunks, which affects data locality. The joint optimization is shown to be a mixed-integer problem. We develop an iterative algorithm which decouples and solves the joint optimization as three sub-problems, which are either convex or solvable via bipartite matching in polynomial time. The proposed algorithm is prototyped in an open-source, distributed file system, Tahoe, and evaluated on a cloud tested with 16 separate physical hosts in an Open Stack cluster. Experiments validate our theoretical latency analysis and show significant latency reduction for diverse file access patterns.

For a generalized SCALDO configuration, end-to-end efficiency is given by (1 + k)(Vreg/Vp) where k equals n or 1/n, and n is the number of supercapacitors required to step-down an input voltage of Vp, to an output regulated voltage of Vreg. For SCALDO-based converters, (1 + k) is the efficiency improvement factor of a Vp-to-Vreg standard linear regulator. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Electric current regulators; Energy storage; Microgrids; Supercapacitor; Transient analysis; Voltage regulators; Dc micro-grid; Efficiency improvement; End to end; Fast transient response; Input voltages; Linear regulators; Low dropout regulator; Renewable sources; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941072246

Such proposed system is capable of serving low voltage residential and commercial loads, where there would be an availability of renewable energy sources and possible DC loads (heaters, LED lights, electronics, etc...). Bidirectional power transmission is achieved between AC and DC buses through a three phase bi-directional converter whose primary objective is to maintain a constant DC bus voltage with respect to DC sources or loads change. A proportional integral controller is utilized to stabilize the reference DC bus voltage by varying the reference AC grid side current that is controlled by a hysteresis controller.

The phase-separated morphology provides multiple relaxation processes which lead to a rate-dependent stress-strain behavior with a transition in rate sensitivity. In addition to the viscoelastic-viscoplastic dissipation pathways, stretch-induced softening due to microstructural breakdown provides a significant source of dissipation as evident in the hysteresis observed during cyclic loading. Extensive shape recovery is observed upon unloading, showing a highly resilient behavior in tandem with extensive dissipation. Here a microstructurally informed three-dimensional constitutive model is developed to capture the remarkable features of the large strain behavior of the segmented copolymers. The model employs multiple microrheological mechanisms to capture the time-dependent nonlinear constitutive responses of both hard and soft domains as well as the stretch-induced softening of the hard domains. In direct comparison to experimental data, the model is found to successfully capture the behavior of an exemplar polyurea copolymer over least six orders of magnitude in strain rate (10-3- 103 s-1). The model is also shown to be predictive of the highly dissipative yet resilient stress-strain behavior under a variety of cyclic loading conditions. The microstructurally informed nature of the model provides insights into tailoring copolymeric microstructures to provide tunable energy storage and dissipation mechanisms in this important class of material.This chapter reviews the literature on long-term performance of emerging polymer materials and introduces environmental test methodology to predict their life cycle behavior. A multifunctional weathering system has been designed and developed to create extreme environments for materials testing and to reproduce service environments for development and validation of emerging defense structural components as well as to conduct accelerated tests for their life cycle performance. The environmental chamber will apply not only to characterization of common polymer materials, but to the development of a wide range of applications of advanced materials and components in defense applications, such as smart helmets and body armors, protective coatings, structural adhesives, and building envelope materials. The accelerated performance test mechanisms and dimensional analysis of structural model testing are introduced for multiscale characterization of polymer materials and structures using the environmental chamber. A case study of long-term performance of an adhesive anchor system demonstrates the environmental test methodology of polymers. The present test methodology and instrument will provide comprehensive tool for design and development of novel advanced organic matrix composites using polyuria, epoxy, polyethylene, and asphalt among others.The deviation of the description of viscoelastic solids from linear behavior is examined. It is demonstrated that the incorporation of dilatational effects into the time-scale reduction of the physical properties through a multiplying factor similar to and including the typical time-temperature reduction process (dilatation clock model) leads to physically observed nonlinear behavior for the example of poly(methyl)methacrylate. On the other hand, for situation where shear deformations dominate, a molecular mechanics model following Eyring ""reaction rate"" principles is developed that also leads to a stress or strain dominated time multiplying factor to develop ""yield-like"" characteristics of an otherwise linearly viscoelastic solid under sufficiently large deformations or octahedral shear. It is held that under highly compressive deformation scenarios typical of explosive environments these concepts elucidate the description of elastomeric solids being driven into the glassy domain under very short time scales, commensurate with the behavior of the glassy poly(methyl)methacrylate. No account has been taken of temperature increase derived from the energy dissipation associated with such extreme loading scenarios, but there is reasonable support that such an inclusion is accomplished through the standard time-temperature reduction process once the dissipation characterization is understood more clearly. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

There are a lot of approaches on the management of regenerative braking energy, most of them based on energy storage systems or the concept of reversible substation. Few references refer to the addition of complementary functions, such as harmonic filtering, and involve the adoption of specific structures without further argumentation. In this paper, the intention is to analyze and find argumentations on the possibilities of coupling a three-phase active power filter based on voltage source inverter topology in the power structure of a DC traction substation. The most used types of uncontrolled rectifiers, i.e. the three-phase bridge scheme and both 12-pulse parallel and series structures are taken into consideration. Based on correlation between the DC-line and AC-line voltages, it is shown that the active power filter can be connected directly in the secondary of the existing traction transformer only in the case of 12-pulse series rectifier. A dedicated recovery transformer is required for the other two schemes of rectifiers and some considerations and results on the compensating power and correlation between the active filtering performance and the voltage in the recovery transformer primary are presented. © 2015 IEEE.","active filtering; active substation; DC traction; energy recovery","DC transformers; Electric inverters; Electric rectifiers; Recovery; Rectifying circuits; Regenerative braking; Active filtering; Active filtering functions; active substation; Braking energy recoveries; Dc tractions; Energy recovery; Regenerative braking energies; Uncontrolled rectifiers; Rectifier substations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939528023

Peanut drying is an essential task for safe peanut storage. The rate at which peanuts are dried can also affect the flavor and milling qualities. Current peanut drying processes require substantial human interaction and often lack efficiency. Therefore, a quarter-scale peanut drying system was developed to study automation of the drying process. This development led to the implementation of a portable peanut-drying monitoring system, capable of measuring drying parameters in real-Time on 45-ft semi-Trailers. The monitoring system uses a sensor network containing five sensors, one of which is a microwave moisture sensor, capable of in-shell kernel moisture content determination, to monitor drying parameters. These parameters include temperature and relative humidity of the ambient air, temperature and kernel moisture content of the peanut bed, and the temperature of the inlet air. Appropriate signal conditioning was applied to each sensor output so that all voltages would be suitable for the analog to digital converter of the microcontroller. Such implementation would reduce overdrying and underdrying, preserve peanut quality, and provide more efficient control of the heater, minimizing energy consumption and labor requirements. © 2015 IEEE.","circuits; in-shell kernel moisture content; microcontroller; microwave sensing; peanut drying; sensor network; signal conditioning","Energy utilization; Grading; Microcontrollers; Microwave sensors; Moisture control; Moisture determination; Monitoring; Networks (circuits); Oilseeds; Sensor networks; Signal conditioning circuits; Signal processing; Strain measurement; Timing circuits; Analog to digital converters; Content determination; Human interactions; In-shell; Labor requirements; Microwave moisture sensors; Microwave sensing; Temperature and relative humidity; Drying",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938150921

With this insight, we study the self-organization and decentralized energy management of a microgrid cluster islanded from main grid after a disruptive event. In the self-organization stage, depending on the available generation resources, each microgrid decides on whether to connect to the cluster; and the microgrid energy management systems then 'negotiate' on the optimal power exchange with each other in the cluster. Once the power exchange is determined, the generation and storage resources of each microgrid are managed to guarantee the energy reliability of critical loads and overall energy efficiency, through a scheduling procedure followed by a dispatch procedure.

Discharge and charge models are created where the normalized parameters are used, in conjunction with the published capacity of the battery (in Ah), to obtain the charging and discharging currents. Particular focus is placed on the nonlinear characteristics present in the constant voltage and float charging regions where a 3rd order polynomial model is used.

In addition both, energy and information is exchanged bidirectionally among participating parties. Therefore heterogeneous systems have to cooperate effectively in order to achieve a common high-level use case, such as smart metering for billing or demand response for load curtailment. Furthermore, a substantial amount of personal data is often needed for achieving that goal. Capturing and processing personal data in the smart grid increases customer concerns about privacy and in addition, certain statutory and operational requirements regarding privacy aware data processing and storage have to be met. An increase of privacy constraints, however, often limits the operational capabilities of the system. In this paper, we present an approach that automates the process of finding an optimal balance between privacy requirements and operational requirements in a smart grid use case and application scenario. This is achieved by formally describing use cases in an abstract model and by finding an algorithm that determines the optimum balance by forward mapping privacy and operational impacts. For this optimal balancing algorithm both, a numeric approximation and-if feasible-an analytic assessment are presented and investigated. The system is evaluated by applying the tool to a real-world use case from the University of Southern California (USC) microgrid. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Approximation algorithms; Data privacy; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Microgrids; Balancing algorithms; Energy and information; Heterogeneous systems; High level use-cases; Operational capabilities; Operational requirements; Privacy requirements; University of Southern California; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939200228

However, state-of-the-art multi-view coding architectures require relatively complex predictive encoders, thus resulting in high processing complexity and power requirements. To address these challenges, we consider a wireless video surveillance scenario and propose a new encoding and decoding architecture for multi-view video systems based on Compressed Sensing (CS) principles, composed of cooperative sparsity-aware block-level rate-adaptive encoders, feedback channels and independent decoders. The proposed architecture leverages the properties of CS to overcome many limitations of traditional encoding techniques, specifically massive storage requirements and high computational complexity. It also uses estimates of image sparsity to perform efficient rate adaptation and effectively exploit inter-view correlation at the encoder side. Based on the proposed encoding/decoding architecture, we further develop a CS-based end-to-end rate distortion model by considering the effect of packet losses on the perceived video quality. We then introduce a modeling framework to design network optimization problems in a multi-hop wireless sensor network. Extensive performance evaluation results show that the proposed coding framework and power-minimizing delivery scheme are able to transmit multi-view streams with guaranteed video quality at low power consumption.

Many existing research has proposed to offload computation tasks from mobile devices to clouds in order to reduce energy consumption, where the offloading service model is usually one-to-one. Due to the development of mobile sensing and location-based mobile cloud services, the cloud edge has been extended to the mobile devices and sensors. As a result, the one-to-one model is not sufficient to model the dynamic changes of mobile cloud-based services. Thus, a many-to-many (or multi-site) mobile cloud service composition is highly desired. In this research, MoSeC is presented to model the many-to-many mobile cloud service composition, where there are multiple surrogates, such as cloud computing nodes, mobile devices, or sensors, and their services (i.e., computation, storage, sensing, etc.) can be composed to fulfill functions required by a mobile service requestor. MoSeC takes into considerations the surrogates' changes due to their mobility and resource constraints. Moreover, MoSeC takes into considerations several service metrics for service mapping (or allocation) through a mobile cloud service topology reconfiguration process.

Solar cookers using both sensible-heat thermal energy storage and latent-heat thermal energy storage are reviewed and discussed. Advantages and disadvantages of the different types of solar cookers with TES are also highlighted. Methods of characterizing solar cookers are presented, and it is concluded that more research efforts are needed to develop methods of characterizing solar cookers with TES systems. The most viable options for solar cookers with TES for developing countries are oven solar cookers and direct-focusing solar cookers, because they are relatively cheap to fabricate and maintain. On the other hand, when issues of efficiency and safety are concerned, indirect solar cookers with TES are more viable; these can be implemented for community-scale cooking because they are relatively expensive to construct.

At the same time, in many of these regions one may encounter significant solar potential that encourages installation of photovoltaic (PV) generators. However, due to the variable nature of solar energy, PV systems may be combined with appropriate energy storage systems (ESSs) in order to support either the energy autonomy of an area (e.g., an island) or to substitute the expensive operation of conventional power stations during predefined load demand periods.Based on this, this chapter is dedicated to investigating several commercially established or emerging ESS configurations that may interact with the primary renewable energy source (the sun) and provide a reliable and secure electric power supply into a remote island grid. In addition, special emphasis is given on the methodology applied for determining the optimum PV-ESS combination, based on several technical criteria and economic indexes. Finally, a representative case study is evaluated comprising a PV plant-able to satisfy a significant amount of the electricity demand of a remote small-island network-as well as an appropriate ESS facility that guarantees great levels of autonomy of the local community's electricity requirements. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the problem of intermittent solar energy and the inability to ensure a continuous energy supply to customers throughout the year, this chapter analyzes the integration of solar (photovoltaic or solar thermal) and hydro energy. With all known technologies of storage, only hydro energy can balance seasonal surpluses and shortages of solar energy, and in this way ensure continuous energy supply to consumers throughout the year with low environmental impact. The disadvantages of the site-specific construction of this system can be avoided by using geosynthetics for the construction of reservoirs of PSH in virtually all places where there are height differences. A very important polymer material, geomembranes, which belong to the group of geosynthetics (e.g., geotextiles, geogrids, geonets, geosynthetic clay liners, geopipe, geofoam, geocomposites), can significantly contribute to the further development of PSH technology.

The queuing model is solved for each node using an approximate mean value analysis technique (AMVA). The solver computes resource utilizations, response times, throughputs and delays and identifies bottlenecks. It is very fast, parametric and scalable to suit the analysis of large scale cloud infrastructures and data centers or server farms. An interactive and batch model solver and simulator have been developed to simulate job assignment and consolidation for energy efficiency, by solving the proposed model for up to 500.000 cloud nodes and several millions of jobs in a few minutes. SLAs and virtual memory restrictions are optionally considered, too.

Although these operations simply relocate the data in the memory, they are costly on conventional systems mainly due to inefficient access patterns, limited data reuse and roundtrip data traversal throughout the memory hierarchy. This paper presents a two pronged approach for efficient data reorganization, which combines (i) a proposed DRAM-aware reshape accelerator integrated within 3D-stacked DRAM, and (ii) a mathematical framework that is used to represent and optimize the reorganization operations. We evaluate our proposed system through two major use cases. First, we demonstrate the reshape accelerator in performing a physical address remapping via data layout transform to utilize the internal parallelism/locality of the 3D-stacked DRAM structure more efficiently for general purpose workloads. Then, we focus on offloading and accelerating commonly used data reorganization routines selected from the Intel Math Kernel Library package. We evaluate the energy and performance benefits of our approach by comparing it against existing optimized implementations on state-of-the-art GPUs and CPUs.

In JEDEC DDRx devices, a refresh operation is performed via an auto-refresh command, which refreshes multiple rows in multiple banks simultaneously. The internal implementation of auto-refresh is completely opaque outside the DRAM - - all the memory controller can do is to instruct the DRAM to refresh itself - - the DRAM handles all else, in particular determining which rows in which banks are to be refreshed. This is in conflict with a large body of research on reducing the refresh overhead, in which the memory controller needs fine-grained control over which regions of the memory are refreshed. For example, prior works exploit the fact that a subset of DRAM rows can be refreshed at a slower rate than other rows due to access rate or retention period variations. However, such row-granularity approaches cannot use the standard auto-refresh command, which refreshes an entire batch of rows at once and does not permit skipping of rows. Consequently, prior schemes are forced to use explicit sequences of activate (ACT) and precharge (PRE) operations to mimic row-level refreshing. The drawback is that, compared to using JEDEC's auto-refresh mechanism, using explicit ACT and PRE commands is inefficient, both in terms of performance and power. In this paper, we show that even when skipping a high percentage of refresh operations, existing row-granurality refresh techniques are mostly ineffective due to the inherent efficiency disparity between ACT/PRE and the JEDEC auto-refresh mechanism. We propose a modification to the DRAM that extends its existing control-register access protocol to include the DRAM's internal refresh counter. We also introduce a new ""dummy refresh"" command that skips refresh operations and simply increments the internal counter. We show that these modifications allow a memory controller to reduce as many refreshes as in prior work, while achieving significant energy and performance advantages by using auto-refresh most of the time. © 2015 ACM.",,"Access control; Computer architecture; Controllers; Energy efficiency; Memory architecture; Access rates; Control registers; DRAM refresh; Energy efficient; Fine-grained control; Memory controller; Multiple rows; Refresh mechanism; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959326720

First, we consider the PRAM model with asymmetric write cost, and show that sorting can be performed in O(n) writes, O(n log n) reads, and logarithmic depth (parallel time). Next, we consider a variant of the External Memory (EM) model that charges k > 1 for writing a block of size B to the secondary memory, and present variants of three EM sorting algorithms (multi-way mergesort, sample sort, and heapsort using buffer trees) that asymptotically reduce the number of writes over the original algorithms, and perform roughly k block reads for every block write. Finally, we define a variant of the Ideal-Cache model with asymmetric write costs, and present write-efficient, cache-oblivious parallel algorithms for sorting, FFTs, and matrix multiplication. Adapting prior bounds for work-stealing and parallel-depth-first schedulers to the asymmetric setting, these yield parallel cache complexity bounds for machines with private caches or with a shared cache, respectively.

Because smartphones made by different manufacturers do not have a common data interface, many ubiquitous sensing applications use the 3.5mm audio interface for communications so that they can work with different types of smartphones. The 3.5mm audio interface cannot provide DC power to external sensors. Thus, power needs to be harvested from an earphone channel. The existing technology uses one earphone channel to transfer data from a smartphone to external sensors and harvest power from the other earphone channel. Consequently, for many smartphones the technology cannot harvest enough power to support external sensors. In this paper, based on frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation scheme, we have proposed a joint power harvesting and communication technology that can simultaneously harvest power and transfer data with the same earphone channels. Circuit measurements show that by coherently harvesting power from both earphone channels, the proposed technology can extract more than two times of power as from one earphone channel. Meanwhile, demodulation tests show that our newly developed timer-based FSK demodulator can reliably recover the data transferred from a smartphone to external sensors without any error. © 2015 IEEE.","3.5mm Audio Interface; Frequency Shift Keying; Power Harvester; Smartphone; Ubiquitous Sensing","Data acquisition; Data handling; Digital storage; Earphones; Energy harvesting; Harvesting; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Audio interfaces; Communication technologies; External sensors; Frequency shift keying(FSK); Fsk demodulators; Modulation schemes; Sensing applications; Ubiquitous Sensing; Frequency shift keying",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975740614

WSNs are essentially constrained by motes' limited battery power and networks bandwidth. The author focuses on data compression algorithm which effectively supports data compression for data gathering in WSNs. Data reduction before transmission such as by compression will significantly decrease the resource usage. Therefore, the main idea of this paper is to show how a data compression application such as collection tree protocol (CTP) is used for data collection from different sensor nodes into the root node in order to increase the network lifetime. LTC algorithm is used to minimize the amount of error in each reading. In the context of the use of wireless sensor network technology for environmental monitoring, the two main elementary activities of wireless sensor network are data acquisition and transmission. However, transmitting/receiving data are power consuming task in order to reduce transmission associated power consumption; we explore data compression by processing information locally. The inception of sensor networks, in-network processing has been touted as enabling technology for long-lived deployments. Radio communication is the overriding consumer of energy in such networks. Therefore, data reduction before transmission, either by compression or feature extraction, will directly & significantly increase network lifetime. In many applications where all data must transport out of network, data may be compressed before transport, so chosen compression technique can operate under stringent resource constraints of low-power nodes and induces tolerable errors. This paper evaluates temporal compression scheme designed specially to be used by mica motes. By using LTC, it is possible to compress data up to -20 to -1. Furthermore this algorithm is simple and requires little storage as compared to other compression techniques.

L1 data caches (L1 D-caches) are critical resources for providing high-bandwidth and low-latency data accesses. However, the high number of simultaneous requests from singleinstruction multiple-thread (SIMT) cores makes the limited capacity of L1 D-caches a performance and energy bottleneck, especially for memory-intensive applications. We observe that the memory access streams to L1 D-caches for many applications contain a significant amount of requests with low reuse, which greatly reduce the cache efficacy. Existing GPU cache management schemes are either based on conditional/reactive solutions or hit-rate based designs specifically developed for CPU last level caches, which can limit overall performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient locality monitoring mechanism to dynamically filter the access stream on cache insertion such that only the data with high reuse and short reuse distances are stored in the L1 D-cache. Specifically, we present a design that integrates locality filtering based on reuse characteristics of GPU workloads into the decoupled tag store of the existing L1 D-cache through simple and cost-effective hardware extensions. Results show that our proposed design can dramatically reduce cache contention and achieve up to 56.8% and an average of 30.3% performance improvement over the baseline architecture, for a range of highly-optimized cache-unfriendly applications with minor area overhead and better energy efficiency. Our design also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU and GPU bypassing schemes (especially for irregular applications), without generating extra L2 and DRAM level contention. © 2015 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cache bypassing; GPU architecture optimization; Locality","Computer hardware; Cost effectiveness; Design; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Memory architecture; Program processors; Architecture optimization; Base-line architecture; Cache bypassing; Cache management schemes; Irregular applications; Locality; Massively parallels; Monitoring mechanisms; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957538591

The circuit is instrumental for electrical energy storage whenever all the batteries (accumulators) within the network are charged, and a constant energy surplus exists in the network. The generated surplus energy is then converted to hydrogen, which is stored in a metal hydride storage case. At times of low energy status in the network, namely when the batteries are discharged and the applied generators (such as photovoltaic, wind, or microhydro power plants) cannot supply energy, a fuel cell is activated. The cell's operation principle is basically the reverse of that for an electrolytic cell (electrolyser), meaning that the cell consumes the hydrogen from the metal hydride storage to produce electric energy; this energy is subsequently stored in batteries (accumulators) connected to the smart grid. In the given context, the article aims to describe the relevant experiment and to present the algorithm to calculate energy efficiency, a most significant parameter of the entire hydrogen circuit. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.","Efficiency; Energy storage; Experimental energy network; Hydrogen circuit; Smart grid","Efficiency; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Fuel cell power plants; Fuel cells; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Low power electronics; Timing circuits; Constant energy; Electric energies; Electrical energy storages; Energy networks; Metal hydride storage; Microhydro power plants; Smart grid; Surplus energy; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992521982

Although much is known about these components in literature, the importance of their stability is often underestimated. However, it has already been shown that storage of microalgal biomass can pose different stability problems, the most important ones being microbiological problems and lipolysis and oxidation of lipids. A crucial step during processing is the drying step, since this reduces the water activity and thus improves the stability of the lipids. However, the drying technique and process parameters being used have a great influence on the stability of the dry product. It has been shown that endogenic antioxidants in microalgae protect the lipids against oxidation, but it also has to be taken into account that this protection can get lost during processing, for example, during biomass drying and oil purification. Further research on stability of valuable components is thus necessary before high quality microalgal products can be produced and applied in different industries. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Virtually all of these intermediates require some form of chemical transformation before they are ready to be used as infrastructure-compatible transportation fuels. The route that has been examined in this work is the conversion of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) to propene that would be an intermediate to hydrocarbon fuels. This route appears promising, because there are several microorganisms that can be grown on sugars or even biomass that incorporate high levels of PHB (up to 80% of dry cell mass) as a form of energy storage molecule. Thermal breakdown of PHB proceeds via an intermediate carboxylic acid, which can then be decarboxylated to an alkene. Oligomerization of the alkene by well-known patented technologies would permit production of a range of hydrocarbon fuels from a carbohydrate derived intermediate. 2-Butenoic acid (crotonic acid (CA)), the depolymerization product from PHB, can be effectively decarboxylated to propene at molar yields approaching 80% using a relatively simple thermal treatment at 400°C for 15min. This objective has been accomplished by direct treatment of solid CA, without use of water or another solvent and without use of a catalyst. The pressures generated (about 180psi at the reaction temperature) are just due to the formation of the product gases, propene and CO2. Furthermore, PHB can be directly converted under the same conditions to propene in similar yields. In addition, Cupriavidus necator-containing PHB has been produced and used to test the direct conversion of PHB in bacterial cells. The yields (60-70molar%) of propene from whole cells were slightly lower than from CA or pure PHB, but still acceptable. Importantly, propene was obtained from whole cells, demonstrating that an expensive process step to isolate PHB from the cells was unnecessary for this process. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

They provide storage for local generation and a buffer against the inconsistent output from renewables such as rooftop solar. In addition, they can independently provide a medium for buying and selling retail energy. The growing deployment of reversepower- operation systems provides residences with the ability to buy and sell energy at the retail time-of-use rate. While the nonlinear models of chemical batteries have been extensively studied, they have not been applied to strategies for residential battery use. In this work, we develop a formulation for battery usage based on more realistic battery models, optimizing the benefit of discharging the battery. We design the scheme for the actual use of batteries in an energy-trading environment, considering the total cost of ownership and return on investment.

SIMD execution, or having a single instruction drive execution of an identical operation on multiple data items, was already well established as a technique to efficiently exploit data parallelism. Furthermore, support for it was already included in many commodity processors. However, in the past decade, SIMD execution has seen a dramatic increase in the set of applications using it, which has motivated big improvements in hardware support in mainstream microprocessors. The easiest way to provide a big performance boost to SIMD hardware is to make it wider -i.e., increase the number of data items hardware operates on simultaneously. Indeed, microprocessor vendors have done this. However, as we exploit more data parallelism in applications, certain challenges can negatively impact performance. In particular, conditional execution, non-contiguous memory accesses, and the presence of some dependences across data items are key roadblocks to achieving peak performance with SIMD execution. This book first describes data parallelism, and why it is so common in popular applications. We then describe SIMD execution, and explain where its performance and energy benefits come from compared to other techniques to exploit parallelism. Finally, we describe SIMD hardware support in current commodity microprocessors. This includes both expected design tradeoffs, as well as unexpected ones, as we work to overcome challenges encountered when trying to map real software to SIMD execution.","Autovectorization; Conflict detection; Control divergence; Data parallelism; Gather/scatter; Horizontal operations; Non-contiguous accesses; Permute; Shuffle; SIMD; Unaligned accesses; Vector masks; Vector processor; Vector reductions","Parallel processing systems; Hardware; Reconfigurable hardware; Autovectorization; Conflict detection; Control divergences; Data parallelism; Gather/scatter; Horizontal operations; Non-contiguous accesses; Permute; Shuffle; SIMD; Unaligned accesses; Vector processors; autovectorization; gather/scatter; horizontal operations; non-contiguous accesses; permute; shuffle; unaligned accesses; Digital storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930359917

Richer sensing such as image capture would enable many new applications to take advantage of energy scavenging. Richer sensing faces two key challenges: efficiently retaining the necessary amount of harvested energy, and storing and communicating large units of sensor data. This paper presents the WISPCam, a passive UHF RFID camera tag based on the Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform that overcomes these two challenges to support reliable image capture and transmission while powered by an RFID reader. The WISPCam uses a novel charge-storage scheme designed specifically to match the image sensor's needs. This scheme optimally balances capacitance and leakage to improve the sensitivity and efficiency of the power harvester. The WISPCam also uses a novel data storage and communication scheme to reliably support the transfer of complete images to an RFID reader application. The WISPCam makes battery-free image capture practical for applications such as mechanical gauge reading and surveillance, both demonstrated in this paper, and opens the door to richer sensing applications on battery-free devices. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Cameras; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Energy harvesting; Communication schemes; Energy limitations; Energy scavenging; Energy scavenging devices; New applications; Passive UHF RFID; Sensing applications; Wireless identification and sensing platforms; Radio frequency identification (RFID)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936797849

We develop a wearable temperature sensor, which harvests energy from Wi-Fi transmissions and transmits data back to an access point. We enable this application by designing an efficient 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi harvesting front-end to power an ANT radio platform with a smartphone as the Wi-Fi source. We study and analyze the effect of OFDM modulation, wide bandwidth (72 MHz) and the bursty nature of 802.11 Wi-Fi signals on the sensitivity, efficiency and the output power of the RF harvester.

Commercialization of bio-methane under atmospheric conditions is limited due to its requirement of higher storage capacity. Compressed bio-methane systems have been currently commercialized in Europe in order to increase its low energy density however the process requires higher capital and maintenance costs. Thus, adsorbed bio-methane is suggested as a better alternative to store methane under low pressure conditions & activated carbon (AC) has shown promise as a methane adsorbent. This study is based on identifying the potential absorptivity of bio-methane into commercially available AC in Sri Lanka. The paper presents the pathway envisage in this task. Two types of commercial AC samples as granular & pelletize forms have been used from supplier HAYCARB for the analysis. In this paper, characterization data from the principals is used to investigate the methane uptake potential into commercial AC. Further, the study has been continued in evaluating several developed correlations in literature on linear behaviour of micropore volume of AC to methane uptake & concluded that the linear parameters of micropore volume to methane uptake would vary according to AC properties. Thus a correlation for local AC is important to be developed. Hence, an experimental setup is developed to carry out detailed studies on bio-methane adsorption on commercial AC available in Sri Lanka. © 2015 IEEE.","Activated Carbon; Adsorption; Bio-methane; Biogas; Characterization","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Biogas; Digital storage; Engineering research; Microporosity; Atmospheric conditions; Linear parameters; Low-pressure conditions; Maintenance cost; Methane adsorbent; Methane adsorption; Micropore volumes; Storage capacity; Methane",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936775341

RNW is an intra-word wear leveling scheme that operates at cache line granularity. The proposed FMR architecture is integrated with frequent pattern compression (FPC) to simultaneously reduce bit-writes and wear in NVMs. Trace-based simulations of the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks show that for the same memory overhead and < 1% loss in memory bandwidth, FMR reduces bit-writes (dynamic energy) by 48% (29%) in comparison to classical read-modify-write (DCW), 39% (13%) in comparison to Flip-N-Write (FNW), and 21% (14%) in comparison to FPC.

This paper proposes Space Oblivious COmpression (SOCO), an in-place lightweight compression mechanism particularly designed for reducing NVMbased main-memory energy rather than saving space. SOCO can significantly reduce the number of bits written to save considerable energy for NVM-based main memories. By relaxing the goal of a conventional compression, the proposed approach practically eliminates memory addressing and management overheads incurred by compression techniques designed to save space. Our experiments show that SOCO provides more than 50% reduction in bits written, resulting in 23% and 34% energy savings for Spin-transfer Torque (STT)-MRAM and Phase Change Memory (PCM), respectively.

Cache locking is a popular cache optimization that loads and retains/locks selected memory contents from an executing application into the cache to increase the cache's predictability. Previous work has shown that cache locking also has the potential to improve cache performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we introduce phase-based cache locking, which leverages an application's varying runtime characteristics to dynamically select the locked memory contents to optimize cache performance and energy consumption. Experimental results show that our phase-based cache locking methodology can improve the data cache's miss rates and energy consumption by an average of 24% and 20%, respectively.

Some waste must be controlled. Some waste can be utilized. Like the organic fertilizer plant, it leaves waste from chicken manure digestion of bacteria. The air pollution has ammonia gas and heat. The gas has to be deodorized by deodorizer tank. On the other hand, the heat can be harvested for electrical energy. The plant needs to monitor ammonia gas level in the waste out air. We propose a design the energy harvest appliance to produce electrical power from a temperature difference which is caused by heat energy on surface of the deodorizer tank.

This is largely attributed to the lack of adequate energy infrastructure and the high capital costs associated with the deployment of requisite infrastructure. In order to attract and justify investment in this area, there is need for sustainable demand with sufficient loads able to sink the generated power. However, this is not the case in the region as many communities are poor especially those in rural and remote areas. It is also worth noting that lack of electricity is closely correlated with poverty and thus the need to avail these communities with affordable electricity as to attain long-term mutual benefits. Since most of the RES in the region are wide spread and populations live in clusters, generation is expected to be distributed. This justifies the use of standalone autonomous systems., i.e. Microgrids that are able to connect to the grid. Microgrids offer an affordable and reliable solution as compared to grid extension to areas that are located far from the grid. They also allow for renewable and fossil fuel incorporation thus serving as the most ideal solution to addressing SSA's source, storage and load interconnection needs. In this paper, the effects of lack of electricity in SSA are investigated, the challenges facing rural electrification in the region are analyzed and some feasible technical and financial solutions needed to avert these shortcomings are proposed.

However, SEV are still facing important technical obstacles to overcome. They include batteries energy storage capacity, charging times, efficiency of the solar panels and electrical propulsion systems. Solving any of those problems and electric vehicles will compete - complement the internal combustion engines vehicles. In the present work, we propose an electrical propulsion system based on three phase induction motor in order to obtain the desired speed and torque with less power loss. Because of the need to lightweight nature, small volume, low cost, less maintenance and high efficiency system, a three phase squirrel cage induction motor (IM) is selected in the electrical propulsion system. The IM is fed from three phase inverter operated by a constant V/F control method and Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) algorithm. The proposed control strategy has been implemented on the Texas Instruments TM320F2812 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to generate SVPWM signal needed to trigger the gates of IGBT-based inverter.

At the other extreme, solar powered cellular installations have gained prominence but have faced their own adoption challenges including inability to provide adequate and reliable 24x7 power supply, need for large land footprints and lack of eficient power storage. In this paper, we perform a detailed economic cost analysis comparing diesel powered cellular networks with solar powered cellular networks. The key goal of this paper is to establish the cross-over boundary beyond which solar powered installations are better than diesel powered alternatives. We perform a detailed analysis based on actual diesel consumption data from a large telecom operator in a developing region. Using our model, we can also easily perform an extended analysis based on future projections on solar eficiencies and future cellular network designs.","Cellular Networks; Diesel; Economic Modelling; Solar","Digital storage; Mobile telecommunication systems; Solar energy; Wireless networks; Cellular network; Diesel; Economic modelling; Economic viability; Future cellular networks; Future projections; Long-term sustainability; Solar; Electric power system economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955268407

Over the next 63 years, we will meet world needs for cheap and clean energy by building the Enernet.' The Internet has resulted from revolutionary advances in electronics, telecommunications and information technologies, devices and applications. While it began as an Internet connecting people, by 2008 it connected more things than people. Its exponential growth has been primarily as an Internet of Things. Cisco has predicted that 50 billion new connections will be made in this Internet of Things (IoT) by 2020. The U.S. electric utility grid has until now been a patchwork of monolithic, weakly interconnected, synchronous AC grids powered by a few thousand or so very large power plants that are centrally monitored and controlled. For a variety of reasons this legacy grid approach is proving to be non-viable for the present and the future. It is being supplemented and may ultimately be supplanted by many, smaller networks with literally millions of distributed generation, storage, and energy management nodes. The grid is literally exploding into a network of things. Many consider it to be the largest example of an Internet of Things. The Enernet will be the inevitable convergence of the smart grid with the Internet of Things. Utilities, their customers and non-utility will find it necessary to plan, engineer and operate in the presence of orders of magnitude more devices and systems (e.g., smart nodes on the utility systems and, for consumers, smart thermostats, appliances, PHEVs/EVs, distributed generation / storage, premises monitoring, automation, and EMS, even transactive energy markets)fiultimately leading to billions of new points that require monitoring, analysis and management. Meanwhile, the Internet of Things steadily grows more ubiquitous, powerful, economical and secure. It is an obviously attractive platform for the smart grid or, as Metcalfe has said, the control plane for the smart grid. The purpose of this paper is to discuss why and how the production and utilization of electric energy will become inseparable, even indistinguishable from the Internet of Things. © 2015 IEEE.","Enernet; Internet of Things; Kurzweils Law; Microgrid; Singularity; Smart Grid; Smart Meters; Smart Node","Distributed power generation; Electric power plants; Electric power system control; Energy management systems; Internet of things; Microgrids; Smart meters; Smart power grids; Enernet; Kurzweils Law; Micro grid; Singularity; Smart grid; Smart nodes; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946196860

The method estimates the total energy available in each ESS from a small number of discrete measurements at different states-of-charge. This considerably reduces experiment time, when compared to slowly depleting the ESS over the course of several hours. To illustrate the use of this method, experiments are performed for nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries and lithium-iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries as well as their corresponding battery-ultracapacitor paralleled systems, under various pulse-load profiles and with different ratios of capacitor rating to battery energy. The results show accuracy of the method on the order of 0.5% and the improvements in total energy by incorporating ultracapacitors range from 3% to 47%, depending upon load profiles, experimental conditions and battery-ultracapacitor combinations. © 2015 IEEE.","battery; energy measurement; Li-ion; LiFePO4; NiMH; Pulse load applications; ultracapacitor","Capacitor storage; Electric power measurement; Hydrides; Iron compounds; Land vehicle propulsion; Lithium compounds; Nickel compounds; Nickel metal hydride batteries; Power electronics; Supercapacitor; battery; Energy storage systems; Experimental conditions; LiFePO4; Lithium iron phosphates; Nickel metal hydride; NiMH; Pulse loads; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937917445

To support these applications, designers of high-end computing (HEC) systems have greatly increased the capacity of storage systems in recent years. However, because hard disk drives (HDDs) are still the dominant storage device used in HEC storage systems, and because HDD performance has not improved as quickly as the capacity, it can be challenging to deploy a storage system that provides both extreme capacity and extreme performance at a reasonable cost. Solid State Drives (SSDs) are a promising high-bandwidth and low-latency alternative to HDDs for HEC storage systems, but they too have deficiencies: small capacity, limited write cycles, and high cost when compared to HDDs. Because of their complementary characteristics, storage system designers are beginning to consider heterogeneous storage system designs that include both HDDs and SSDs. However, managing the workload so as to take advantage of the strengths of each type of storage device while controlling overhead is a major challenge. In this study, we propose a novel approach for managing a heterogeneous storage system called the Working Set-based Reorganization Scheme (WS-ROS). With WS-ROS, applications write to both HDDs and SSDs using all the available storage system bandwidth. Later, a background process reorganizes the data so as to place the data most likely to be read on SSDs while relegating the data most likely to be written and the data not likely to be accessed onto the slower but higher-capacity HDDs. For our evaluation workloads, the WS-ROS approach provided a 3× to 10× performance improvement compared to a heterogeneous storage system without a working set-based data reorganization scheme, suggesting the value of lazy reorganization of data based on data access working sets. © 2014 IEEE.","data-intensive computing; High-end computing; parallel file systems; Solid State Drives; storage","Bandwidth; Drives; Energy storage; Storage management; Systems analysis; Virtual storage; Complementary characteristics; Data reorganization; Data-intensive computing; High end computing; Parallel file system; Scientific applications; Solid state disks; Solid state drives; Hard disk storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946550514

During the production of sustainable electricity there is degradation and pollution of the immediate environment. Hydro-power (HP) is one available source that is clean and renewable and which can be used to manage power supply/demand options. A pumped storage hydropower (PSH) system allows water reuse while eliminating environmental pollution. Apart from PSH being used as a huge battery, storing energy in the water of an upper reservoir until its release for instant power generation on demand, it may also be also engaged in reducing greenhouse gas emissions-a major threat to humanity. To fully explore the world of PSH this paper sought to identify potential distribution, possible capacity and current technologies involved in Africa's five regions. This approach is common for large hydropower plants, but for this study, PSH was used with a small hydropower unit to model a hybrid power plant using a reversible turbine. Flowcode V5 and Proteus were used to design the study's control aspect. Two floaters were installed in a PHS upper reservoir, one at its lowest level to halt generation, another at the top of the reservoir to avoid spill during pumping activity.

In efforts to meet this target, electricity generating companies have tried to exploit available resources of energy, including the combustion of fossil fuels even though they have been recognized to cause environmental problems such as climate change and acid rain. Moreover, these resources occur in limited quantities and therefore pose energy insecurity. It is believed that the addition of renewable energy (RE) resources in the general energy mix can assist in mitigating climate change and in augmenting energy security. This paper investigates the possible renewable energy that can be exploited in hybrid gas turbines (GTs) in South Africa (SA). In this study, data was collected through a desktop approach. It is found that there is potential for use of biodiesel, biogas, and concentrated solar power in GTs.

Frequent discharge will contribute to a reduced life cycle; conversely minimal usage will prolong its life cycle. This paper investigates the possibilities of controlling and optimising the daily operation of a standalone hybrid renewable energy system by maximising the usage of the renewable resources whilst minimising the utilisation of the battery bank for supplying the required energy at an electric Tuk-Tuk charging station without any load rejection. The main objective is to develop an optimisation algorithm which will be employed to ensure that the energy stored in the battery banks is therefore utilised as a last resort when all means of supplying energy have been exhausted. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control strategy is performed and simulated using fmincon in a Matlab environment. The results for different scenarios are presented and analysed for different potential sites in South Africa where the charging stations can be implemented. © 2015 Cape Peninsula University of Technology.","Battery storage system; Control and Optimisation; Energy management; Hybrid renewable energy system; Matlab/fmincon","Charging (batteries); Electric discharges; Energy management; Life cycle; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Battery storage system; Charging/discharging; Control strategies; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Hybrid renewable energy systems; MATLAB environment; Optimisations; Renewable resource; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933556617

It is capable of supplying sanitary hot water with 30 to 40% of the total thermal energy generated from electrical energy; the rest emanates from ambient aero-thermal energy. Sanitary hot water is set at a threshold temperature of 55°C to prevent growth of legionella (bacteria).Therefore, employing this technology could result in a substantial reduction in Eskom peak demand and global warming hazards. This research focused on designing and building (DAS housing) various temperature sensors, power meters, flow meters, relative humidity and ambient temperature sensors, to determine electrical consumption and useful thermal energy gained by the hot water in the geyser and the storage tank of the ASHP water heater. In addition, an empirical calculation of the co-efficient of performance of the ASHP water heater was reached. Furthermore, the amount of aero-thermal energy extracted was evaluated based on the temperature difference between the warm air in the vicinity of the evaporator and the cold, dehumidified air expelled from the duct space of the ASHP unit.

For decades, processing tomatoes have been direct seeded in many parts of the world, however, over the past ten years the use of transplants has increased the success rate and yield of the crop. Likewise, the use drip rather than furrow irrigation has improved the grower's control over production. Breeding of multi-use and extended field storage (EFS) cultivars has dominated in California and other locations. On the processing side, higher value whole peel and diced tomato products have benefited from innovations in the peeling process. Advanced technologies which utilize less energy, and result in a higher quality product, are being studied and to some extent commercialized. These include electric field process such as ohmic, pulsed electric fields, microwave and radiofrequency as well as high pressure processing.

The applications of WSN involve remote medical monitoring system, disaster management, security surveillance, and emergency response system. Most of these applications are used in harsh environments where the sensor nodes are operated in an unattended manner. The tiny nodes used for sensing in WSN are battery operated and have limited resources in terms of energy, storage and power. One of the ways to efficiently utilize the energy is to use clustering. Clustering is the way to gather data from group of similar or different items. In this paper we propose an energy efficient scheme, ECMS (Energy-Efficient Clustering scheme for Multihop wireless Sensor networks) for both cluster heads and senor nodes. The proposed scheme works in two phases. In first phase efficient cluster formation is done by using the energy factor and computation of distance between nodes to base station.

In particular, we consider the two-way and two-way relay channels with finite data storage. We solve the throughput maximization problem with finite batteries and finite data buffers. This entails iteratively solving an energy problem, which distributes the available energy over the course of the communication session, and a data problem, which schedules how much data to send at each node over the course of the communication session. We provide a directional waterfilling interpretation to the energy problem with the addition of water pumps and overflow protection bins. The data problem turns out to be a linear program which we solve by forward induction. We provide numerical results demonstrating the impact of the battery and buffer sizes on the achieved throughput. We observe, for communication scenarios of interest, that a relatively modest size of data storage is sufficient to harness the performance benefits of data buffering, i.e., to achieve the throughput values without buffer size limitations. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Buffer storage; Electric batteries; Energy gap; Linear programming; Communication sessions; Forward induction; Limited energies; Numerical results; Performance benefits; Throughput maximization problem; Two way communications; Two-way relay channels; Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940560924

GPUs usually support thousands of parallel threads and require a sizable register file. Such large register file is highly susceptible to soft errors and power-hungry. Although ECC has been adopted to register file in modern GPUs, it causes considerable power overhead, which further increases the power stress. Thus, an energy-efficient soft-error protection mechanism is more desirable. Besides its extremely low leakage power consumption, resistive memory (e.g. spin-transfer torque RAM) is also immune to the radiation induced soft errors due to its magnetic field based storage. In this paper, we propose to LEverage reSistive memory to enhance the Soft-error robustness and reduce the power consumption (LESS) of registers in the General-Purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPUs). Since resistive memory experiences longer write latency compared to SRAM, we explore the unique characteristics of GPGPU applications to obtain the win-win gains: achieving the near-full soft-error protection for the register file, and meanwhile substantially reducing the energy consumption with negligible performance loss. Our experimental results show that LESS is able to mitigate the registers soft-error vulnerability by 86% and achieve 60% energy savings with negligible (e.g. 4%) performance loss. © 2015 EDAA.","Energy Efficiency; GPGPU; Register File; Reliability; Resistive Memory; Soft Error","Computer graphics; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Error correction; Graphics processing unit; Green computing; Magnetic leakage; Magnetic storage; Radiation hardening; Reliability; Static random access storage; General-purpose computing; GPGPU; High performance computing; Register files; Resistive memory; Soft error; Soft error protection; Spin transfer torque; Program processors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945971074

In this work, we explore approximate computing for a key computation pattern, Reduce-and-Rank (RnR), which is prevalent in a wide range of workloads including video processing, recognition, search and data mining. An RnR kernel performs a reduction operation (e.g., distance computation, dot product, L1-norm) between an input vector and each of a set of reference vectors, and ranks the reduction outputs to select the top reference vectors for the current input. We propose two complementary approximation strategies for the RnR computation pattern. The first is interleaved reduction-and-ranking, wherein the vector reductions are decomposed into multiple partial reductions and interleaved with the rank computation. Leveraging this transformation, we propose the use of intermediate reduction results and ranks to identify future computations that are likely to have low impact on the output, and can hence be approximated. The second strategy, input similarity based approximation, exploits the spatial or temporal correlation of inputs (e.g., pixels of an image or frames of a video) to identify computations that are amenable to approximation. These strategies address a key challenge in approximate computing - identification of which computations to approximate - and may be used to drive any approximation mechanism such as computation skipping and precision scaling to realize performance or energy improvements. A second key challenge in approximate computing is that the extent to which computations can be approximated varies significantly from application to application, and across inputs for even a single application. Hence, quality configurability, or the ability to automatically modulate the degree of approximation at runtime is essential. To enable quality configurability in RnR kernels, we propose a kernel-level quality metric that correlates well to application-level quality, and identify key parameters that can be used to tune the proposed approximation strategies dynamically. We develop a runtime framework that modulates the identified parameters during execution of RnR kernels to minimize their energy while meeting a given target quality. To evaluate the proposed concepts, we designed quality-configurable hardware implementations of 6 RnR-based applications from the recognition, mining, search and video processing application domains in 45nm technology. Our experiments demonstrate 1.06X-2.18X reduction in energy consumption with virtually no loss in output quality (<0.5%) at the application-level. The energy benefits further improve up to 2.38X and 2.5X when the quality constraints are relaxed to 2.5% and 5% respectively. © 2015 EDAA.",,"Data mining; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Vectors; Configurable hardware; Degree of approximation; Distance computation; Identified parameter; Quality constraints; Reduction in energy consumption; Temporal correlations; Video processing applications; Video signal processing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945918459

However, process variations may significantly impact the achievable yield in STT-MRAM. To this end, several yield enhancement techniques that improve STT-MRAM failures at the bit-cell, and at the architecture level of design abstraction have been proposed in the literature. However, these techniques may lead to a suboptimal design because they do not consider the impact of design choices at every level of design abstraction. In this paper, we propose a unified device-circuit-architecture co-design framework to optimize and enhance the yield of STT-MRAM. We studied the interaction between device parameters (viz. energy barrier height) and bit-cell level parameters (viz. transistor width), together with different Error Correcting Codes (ECC) to optimize the robustness and energy efficiency of STT-MRAM cache. The advantages of our proposed approach to STT-MRAM design are explored at the 32nm technology node.

One limitation is their inability of selecting a memory cell without the interference caused by the sneak-path currents from other partially selected cells, as it results not only in unnecessary waste of energy but also in larger current requirements. The complementary resistive switch (CRS), consisting in two anti-serially connected memristors, is considered a potential solution to the sneak-path problem. However, the destructive read operation and reduced endurance of the CRS render it unattractive for the otherwise excellent candidate for next-generation crossbar-based non-volatile memories. In this paper we explore the feasibility and tradeoffs of configuring part of the CRS memory into a memristive mode to mitigate these limitations. The inherent locality of memory accesses for most computer programs offers an opportunity for designing a cache-like adaptive CRS-based crossbar memory with hybrid configurations of CRS and memristive modes, enabling optimization for both endurance and energy consumption. Our simulation results validate that the proposed hybrid system achieves 1.5-7x reduction in energy consumption in comparison with a memristive-only memory system and significantly improves the endurance of the CRS-based memory. © 2015 EDAA.",,"Cache memory; Energy utilization; Green computing; Hybrid systems; Memristors; Complementary resistive switches; Cross-bar memory; Crossbar arrays; Hybrid configurations; Non-volatile memory; Random access memory; Reduction in energy consumption; Resistive random access memory; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926494508

Spinel lithium manganates have attracted attention due to their electrochemical properties and also as promising cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The current study focused on the effects of high temperatures on the materials, in order to understand the sustainability in cases where the battery heats up to high temperature and analysis of lithium diffusion aids in terms of intercalation host compatibility. It is also essential to understand the high temperature behaviour and lithium ion host capability of these materials in order to perform the armorphization and recrystalization of spinel nano-architectures. Molecular dynamics simulations carried out to predict high temperature behaviour of the spinel systems. The NVE ensemble was employed, in the range 300 - 3000K. The melting temperature, lithium-ion diffusion and structural behaviour were monitored in both supercell systems. LiMn2O4 indicated a diffusion rate that increased rapidly above 1500K, just before melting (∼1700K) and reached its maximum diffusion at 2.756 10-7 cm2s-1 before it decreased. Li4Mn5O12 indicated an exponential increase above 700K reaching 8.303 10-7 cm2s-1 at 2000K and allowing lithium intercalation even above its melting point of around 1300K. This indicated better structural stability of Li4Mn5O12 and capability to host lithium ions at very high temperatures (up to 3000 K) compared to LiMn2O4. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cathodes; Defects; Diffusion; Electric batteries; Insulating materials; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Melting point; Molecular dynamics; Stability; Energy storage technologies; Exponential increase; Intercalation hosts; Lithium Intercalation; Lithium ion diffusion; Molecular dynamics simulations; Structural behaviour; Structural stabilities; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964822563

A single receiver measures the channel states of two or more independent transmit nodes and provides feedback to the transmitters to facilitate beamforming and passband signal alignment at the receiver. The receive node is equipped with energy harvesting and storage devices which can harvest and store the beamforming energy for future utilization. Since feedback improves the beamforming gain but requires the receiver to expend energy, there is an inherent tradeoff between the feedback rate and the efficiency of the energy harvesting at the receiver. This paper analyzes the optimal feedback rate to maximize the amount of energy harvested by the receive node per unit of time. Analysis shows that there always exists a unique optimal feedback rate for the system. Numerical results are also provided to confirm the analysis and demonstrate the effect of the feedback rate on the mean energy harvesting rate. © 2015 IEEE.","channel state feedback; distributed beamforming; synchronization; wireless power transfer","Communication channels (information theory); Energy harvesting; Energy transfer; Inductive power transmission; Signal receivers; State feedback; Synchronization; Virtual storage; Wireless telecommunication systems; Channel state feedbacks; Distributed beam-forming; Distributed transmit beamforming; Feedback rates; Narrowband wireless communications; Numerical results; Optimal Feedback; Wireless power transfer; Beamforming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929179895

Thus, researchers propose different techniques to flatten peak demand in individual residential buildings. However, if each home in the grid flattens peak demand only with its own power consumption information, it is possible that peak demand of the microgrid would not be flattened but only shifted to another period. Therefore, it is critical for homes to cooperate with each other to flatten peak demand. In this paper, we utilize the power-voltage relationship in individual homes to enable that each home can infer the information of power consumption in the community by locally monitoring the voltage value on the common power line. The inferred information is then used for homes to flatten peak demand of the microgrids in a distributed manner. Furthermore, we leverage existing thermal appliances (e.g., water heaters) as thermal ""batteries"" in individual homes instead of purchasing batteries to flatten peak demand. We evaluate our system's performance by conducting experiments and extensive empirical data driven simulations. Evaluation results indicate that our design enables homes to effectively flatten peak demand by more than 29% without affecting homeowners' behaviors.",,"Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Embedded systems; Empirical data; Evaluation results; Limited energies; Peak demand; Power lines; Power voltage; Residential building; System's performance; Electric power distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954125977

In this work, we propose an adaptive quality-aware energy management middleware framework for energy harvesting embedded systems. Our hybrid energy storage model takes into consideration the battery life cycle, supercapacitor self-leakage, and power loss in the harvesting circuit. The framework has an offline planning phase and a runtime adaptation phase. By incorporating abstract models for battery state of health (SoH) and supercapacitor self-leakage, the offline stage determines the budget for charging and discharging distribution of each storage component and accordingly adapts the application quality of service (QoS). The runtime adaptation phase dynamically adjusts the charging and discharging distribution to the dynamic changes in energy harvesting profile. In comparison with related work, our proposed framework is able to capture the lifetime and characteristics of the energy storage components more accurately during adaptation and hence, resulting in a more sustainable system with realistic QoS. © 2015 IEEE.","battery lifetime; Energy harvesting; hybrid energy storage; Quality of Service","Battery management systems; Budget control; Charging (batteries); Embedded systems; Energy harvesting; Energy storage; Life cycle; Middleware; Quality of service; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Storage as a service (STaaS); Storage management; Supercapacitor; Application quality; Battery lifetime; Energy harvesting systems; Energy storage components; Hybrid energy storage; Middleware frameworks; Runtime adaptation; Sustainable systems; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944315344

We thus propose an all-digital write driver to bias the selected source and bit lines (SL/BL) properly in order to guarantee a successful write operation while avoiding the above drawbacks. The proposed driver can be programmed per die to track die-to-die variations for maximum dynamic and leakage write energy reduction.

This paper is a step toward addressing this gap. We present the architecture of a novel programmable logic array, referred to as Field Programmable Threshold-Logic Array (FPTLA), in which the basic cells are differential mode threshold-logic gates (DTGs). Each individual DTG cell is a clock edge-triggered circuit that computes a threshold-logic function. A DTG can be programmed to implement different threshold logic functions by routing appropriate signals to their inputs. This reduces the number of SRAMs inside the logic blocks by about 60% compared to conventional CLBs, without adding any significant overhead in the routing infrastructure. Since a DTG is essentially a multi-input, edge-triggered flipflop that computes a threshold function, a network of DTGs forms a nano-pipelined circuit. The advantages of such a network are demonstrated on a set of deeply pipelined datapath circuits implemented on FPTLAs and conventional FPGAs using the well established FPGA design framework VTR (Verilog To Routing) and VPR (Versatile Place and Route) [2]. The results indicate that an FPTLA can achieve up to 2X improvement in delay for nearly the same energy and logic area compared to the conventional LUT based FPGA. Although differential mode circuits can potentially be more sensitive to process variations, FPTLAs can be made robust to such variations without sacrificing their improved energy efficiency and performance over FPGAs. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Application specific integrated circuits; Design; Energy efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Logic gates; Logic Synthesis; Networks (circuits); Static random access storage; Threshold logic; Automated synthesis; Design technologies; Differential-mode circuits; Efficiency and performance; Field programmables; Programmable logic array; Routing infrastructure; Threshold functions; Logic circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928729995

In this chapter, a brief introduction to the different microalgae cell recovery processes, as well as a more specific description of the triad coagulation-flocculationsedimentation, will be presented and discussed. Finally, the importance of characterizing the produced microalgal pastes through rheology studies will be discussed also. Recovery of biomass can become a bottleneck of the entire process, due to the small size of algal cells, besides the fact that microalga culture broths are, in general, very diluted and for many processes this concentration must be increased by 200 fold. This increment in microalgae concentration can contribute with 20 to 30% of the total cost of producing biomass. Among the most suitable methods for microalgae harvesting, are centrifugation, filtration, flotation, and coagulation-flocculation. These methods present advantages and disadvantages, but it is a priority to analyze the energetic cost involved in each of these methods. Coagulation-flocculation (CF) of microalgae can be achieved in several ways and a wide range of approaches have been explored in recent years. These approaches range from traditional CF to novel ideas based on the biology of microalgae, the use of walldeficient cells and the use of emerging technologies. After CF it is very common to add a sedimentation step. The simplest equipment to carry out the sedimentation process is the sedimenter or sedimentation device. It is generally a round or square tank designed in such way that the microalgae suspension goes through the device at a speed lower than the particle`s sedimentation rate, so the residence time allows sedimentation of most of the particles. Sludge is accumulated in the base of the sedimenter. Once the microalgae recovery process has been applied, the resulting product can be a concentrated suspension of cells or rather a humid cell paste. Using some specific procedures, a more concentrated cell dry paste can be obtained. It is necessary to characterize the concentrated pastes through rheological measurements. This step can be carried out by determining viscosity vs. shear rate profiles, as well as the storage and loss modulus and complex viscosities, which, in turn, define the paste's viscoelastic behavior. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Biodiesel is a mixture of fatty acid alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids obtained by alcoholysis or transesterification of triacylglycerols. The economically significant production of biodiesel from microalgae has been hailed as the ultimate alternative to depleting resources of petro-diesel due to its high cellular concentration of lipids. Microalgae present high solar energy yields, which leads to a superior lipid productivity, they present rapid growth rates and short generation times. In addition, the lipids produced are generally neutral. There are technological, economical, supply, storage and safety related, as well as policy barriers linked to the development of biofuel production. Several conditions affect simultaneously the microalgae cultivation, such as light avaiability and intensity, land topography, climatic conditions, water supply and access to the carbon source and other nutrients. Furthermore, biomass yield also depends on the mode of cultivation (photoautotrophic, mixotrophic and heterotrophic production), types of culture (open or closed systems), culture strategies (batch or continuous culture), inhibitors concentration, mixing, dilution rate, depth and harvest frequency. In this text, we present an overview of the factors that affect the production of the microalgal biomass yield and lipid production, both important factors to potentiate the feasibility of using microalgae as a source of oils to produce biodiesel. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Their conversion additionally contributes to reduce environmental pollution. The present chapter examines thermochemical conversion of the wastes generated from industrialization of an agricultural product into biofuels and/or products potentially applicable for environmental remediation. The selected wastes arise from industrial processing of whole branches (leaves and twigs) from a native evergreen tree Ilex paraguariensis, belonging to the Aquifoliaceae family, for the manufacture of yerba mate. It is a widespread product massively consumed in Southern Latin America countries to prepare a popular herbal tea-like beverage. The commercial final product generally contains less than ~ 35% twigs, since they provide an unpleasantly bitter taste to the infusion, and therefore huge quantities of unused twigs emerge as a by-product. Kinetics for the pyrolysis of the twigs is characterized by non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis from room temperature up to 900 °C to obtain information for the proper design of full-scale pyrolyzers. A deactivation model which assumes an overall first-order process and considers the physicochemical changes taking place in the biomass with the pyrolysis course through variations of the reaction rate constant with the temperature and solid conversion enables a proper representation of the experimental data over the whole temperature range, with estimated energy activation values between 49 and 137 kJ mol-1. Likewise, yield and characteristics of the three kinds of pyrolysis products, comprising bio-char, bio-oil, and gases, are examined from experiments conducted in a bench-scale fixed-bed installation at temperatures in the range 400 - 700 °C. Gas yield increases with increasing temperature, attaining 43% at 700 °C, while the biochar yield decreases from 30% to 20% with temperature rise. Yield of the bio-oil attains a maximum (53%) at 500 °C, likely arising from the competition between primary formation of volatiles, at relatively low temperatures, and secondary degradation of the condensable vapors at the higher temperatures. All the pyrolysis products could be used in energy applications. The obtained biochars with higher heating value (HHV) of 23 - 24 MJ kg-1 have potential as environmentally friendly solid biofuel and could be employed for the manufacture of briquettes mainly for domestic use. Accounting for their high stability, as judged from the molar O:C ratio, another possible application could be incorporation of the biochars into the soil for the storage of atmospheric carbon. In turn, the bio-oils show organic fractions with HHV between 28 and 33 MJ kg-1. Density values of the as-produced liquids (~1 kg dm-3) are rather higher than those for conventional hydrocarbon fuels due to their higher contents of oxygen and water. The crude bio-oils could be directly burnt or subjected to further upgrading to attain characteristics similar to those of fuel-oil. Pyrolysis of the twigs yields low to medium heating value-gases (5 - 11 MJ m-3), mostly composed by CO2, CO, CH4 and H2. Gas composition depends on the temperature, even though CO2 is the major generated species, followed by CO. Proportion of CO2 decreases with temperature, particularly at 700 °C, accompanied by enhancements in the HHV of the gaseous mixtures, as a consequence of compositional variations, attaining a maximum value of 11 MJ m-3. They might contribute to the energy sustainability of the process. Besides, phosphoric acid activation of the yerba mate twigs at pre-established moderate conditions leads to good quality activated carbons with well-developed porous structures characterized by textural parameters (BET surface area of ~ 1000 m2 g-1; total pore volume of 1cm3 g-1) comparable to those of commercially available samples. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","activated carbons; agro-industrial waste; bio-char; bio-oil; bioenergy; kinetics; pyrolysis; yerba mate twigs",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956820226

Batteries are known for their large effect on the environment. This chapter focuses on the environmental impacts of two lithium battery chemistries used in electric vehicles. How to evaluate the environmental performance of two different lithium batteries? A full life cycle perspective is important in order to avoid burden shifts from one life cycle stage to another. A good manner to implement an environmental assessment of a product is with a life cycle approach; that is to say that all the life cycle stages of the product are considered. This chapter focuses first on the availability and demand of lithium. Is it possible to meet the future demand for lithium? It is concluded from an extensive literature review that lithium availability will probably not pose an obstacle. However, certain conditions have to be met in order to guarantee this situation. Second, a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed, comparing a lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery. The LCA covers all life stages of a traction battery, including the extraction of raw materials, the manufacturing of the battery, the usage, and the final disposal and recycling of the materials contained in the battery. The overall environmental performance of the battery is strongly dependent on its efficiency and directly tied to the energy mixes associated with its use. Lifetime durability and efficiency are the key environmental performance indicators. The differences between the two batteries are during the manufacturing and recycling stages.

Many different types of analyses have been called benchmarking, but standard practice has evolved based on statistical comparison of actual operating data, not estimates. Much can be learned, for instance, in comparing high-level parameters such as inventory-to-sales ratio, delivery time, or customer satisfaction in very different businesses. Another use of benchmarking has been to describe the use of estimates and public assessments of operating company details. Some benchmark assessments use public data with widely varying base years and very high-level comparisons. Several for-profit providers have established well-respected and heavily subscribed benchmarking services for different industries around the world.

Since it is in reality impractical for system operators to control large numbers of customers with deferrable demand directly, aggregators will in all likelihood be responsible for managing the individual sources of deferrable demand using instructions provided by a system operator. The objective of this paper is to compare the performance of deferrable demand when 1) the aggregators act as clients to the system operator and receive physical charge/discharge instructions for managing deferrable demand (i.e. Centralized control), with 2) the aggregators follow their own interests and submit bids for purchasing energy into the wholesale auction using projected prices provided by the system operator (i.e. Hierarchical control). The analysis uses a stochastic form of multi-period Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SCOPF) in a simulation using a reduction of the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) network for representative days. This model treats potential wind generation and load as stochastic inputs and determines the optimum daily profiles of dispatch and demand for different realizations of hourly wind generation and load. Ramping capacity is acquired to ensure that transitions from the realizations in one hour to the next hour, as well as contingencies, can be supported. The results show that if aggregators receive stochastic forecasts of energy prices for the next 24 hours, their optimum strategy for minimizing the expected cost of their purchases from the grid is to determine a high threshold price for discharging and a low threshold price for charging, and as a result, they provide ramping services as well as benefitting from day/night price arbitrage. However, the results are sensitive to the form of the price forecasts. © 2015 IEEE.","Centralized dispatch; Hierarchical dispatch; Security constrained","Costs; Electric load flow; Sales; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Storage as a service (STaaS); Centralized control; Centralized dispatch; Distributed storage; Hierarchical control; Hierarchical dispatch; Northeast power coordinating councils; Security constrained; Security-constrained optimal power flow; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944273455

Flexible loads have been proposed as a low-cost provider of frequency regulation. For example, the flexibility of loads with inherent thermal energy storage resides in their ability to vary their electricity consumption without compromising their end function. In this context, the aggregate flexibility of a collection of diverse residential air-conditioning loads has previously been shown to be well modeled as a virtual battery using first principles load models. This analytical method will not scale to more complex flexible loads such as commercial HVAC systems. This paper presents a method to identify virtual battery model parameters for these more complex flexible loads.

However, innovative and flexible hardware platforms give developers better means of optimising the energy consumption of their software. For example, the Tegra K1 System-on-Chip (SoC) offers two CPU clusters, GPU offloading, frequency scaling and other mechanisms to control the power and performance of applications. In this demonstration, the scenario is live video encoding, and participants can experiment with power usage and performance using the Tegra K1's hardware capabilities.

Ring-oscillator (RO) based injection-locked (IL) clocking has been used in the past [1] to provide a low-power, low-area and low-jitter solution. Ring-based injection-locked oscillators (ILO) can also be used to generate quadrature phases from a reference clock [2] without frequency division, which is desirable for half-rate and quarter-rate CDR. However, ILO inherently has a small locking range [3] making it less suitable for wideband applications. In addition, drift in the free-running frequency due to PVT variations may lead to poor jitter performance and locking failures [4]. Adding a PLL to an ILO provides frequency tracking. However, PLL-aided techniques have second-order characteristics that lead to jitter peaking. They also add design complexity and power consumption [5]. We present a frequency-tracking method that exploits the dynamics of IL in a quadrature RO to increase the effective locking range. This quadrature locked loop (QLL) is used to generate accurate clock phases for a 4-channel optical receiver using a forwarded clock at quarter-rate (Fig. 22.3.1). The QLL drives an ILO at each channel without any repeaters for local quadrature clock generation. Each local ILO has deskew capability for phase alignment. The receiver maintains per-bit energy consumption across wide data-rates (16 to 32Gb/s) by adaptive body biasing (BB) in a 28nm FDSOI technology. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Clocks; CMOS integrated circuits; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Jitter; Oscillistors; Phase locked loops; Programmable logic controllers; System-on-chip; Adaptive body biasing; Free running frequency; Frequency division; Injection locked oscillators; On-Chip Clock Generation; Quadrature clock generation; Stringent requirement; Wideband applications; Oscillators (electronic)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940754372

There is a diesel power plant located in Khasab, one of the four wilayyats of Musandam Peninsula which serves the required electricity for the region as it is an off-grid area. Renewable energies offer an alternative solution for fossil fuels. Oman is looking forward for green energies evidently along with rest of the world due to obvious reasons like increase in carbon deposits, global warming and pollution etc. An effort has been made to investigate whether the power generated by renewable energies especially by solar & wind energies available in Musandam Peninsula can replace the situation of power generation by fossil fuels. Tidal power is not considered in comparison with wind energy and solar energy, as it is not a big sustainable resource due to environment impacts & exergy availability etc. at present. Three options and their comparison have been provided with the help of 'Homer software' simulation results. Simulation results based on Energy-Economic Optimization show, case studies and their comparison for three models: First model (Diesel power system), second model (Solar PV power system) and the third model (PV-wind hybrid power system). Cycle charging strategy is considered in all models. Simulation results are showing that cost of energy (COE) is lowest for PV-Wind hybrid power system. We conclude that a properly planned hybrid system combining renewable energies solar energy & wind energy (i.e. PV-wind hybrid power system) joined with conventional energy system will reduce the overall cost along with many benefits like carbon reduction etc. It is suggested in this paper to connect PV-wind hybrid power system with the existing diesel power station at Khasab and utilize the existing distribution system to meet the growing energy demand.

However, due to its limited endurance and slow write performance, state-of-the-art solutions tend to construct a DRAM-PCM hybrid memory instead of using PCM exclusively. While existing optimizations to this hybrid architecture focus on tuning DRAM configurations to further reduce writes to PCM, we aim at developing a proactive solution. Specifically, we exploit the flexibility of mapping virtual pages to physical pages, and propose a page allocation algorithm that considers both segment information and conflict misses in DRAM to distribute heavily written pages across different DRAM sets.

The main advantage of RM is an improved density and like other non-volatile memory structures, the static power of RM is dramatically lower than conventional CMOS memories. However, a major challenge of employing RM in universal memory components is the added access latency and dynamic energy consumption caused by shifts to align the data of interest with an access port. We propose multilane Racetrack caches (MRC), a RM last level cache design utilizing lightweight compression combined with independent shifting. MRC allows cache lines mapped to the same Racetrack structure to be accessed in parallel when compressed, mitigating potential shifting stalls in the RM cache. Our results demonstrate that unlike previously proposed RM caches, an isocapacity MRC cache replacement can outperform SRAM caches while providing energy improvement over STT-MRAM caches. In particular, MRC improves performance by 5% and reduces energy by 19% compared to an isocapacity baseline RM cache resulting in an energy delay product improvement of 25%. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Computer aided design; Domain walls; Energy utilization; MRAM devices; Nonvolatile storage; Static random access storage; Cache replacement; Dynamic energy consumption; Energy delay product; Improving efficiency; Last-level caches; Non-volatile memory; Secondary storage; Universal memory; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926475474

In particular, 7nm FinFET devices are designed and simulated by using Synopsys TCAD tool suite, Sentaurus. Next, 6T and 8T SRAM cells, which are composed of these devices, are designed and optimized. To enhance the cell stability and reduce leakage energy consumption, the dual (i.e., front and back) gate control feature of FinFETs is exploited. This is, however, done without requiring any external signal to drive the back gates of the FinFET devices. Subsequently, the effect of process variations on the aforesaid SRAMs is investigated and steps are presented to protect the cells against these variations. More precisely, the SRAM cells are first designed to minimize the expected energy consumption (per clock cycle) subject to the non-destructive read and successful write requirements under worst-case process corner conditions. These SRAM cells, which are overly pessimistic, are then refined by selectively adjusting some transistor sizes, which in turn reduces the expected energy consumption while ensuring that the parametric yield of the cells remains above some prespecified threshold. To do this efficiently, an analytical method for estimating the yield of SRAM cells under process variations is also presented and integrated in the refinement procedure. A dual-gate controlled 6T SRAM cell operating at 324mV (in the near-threshold supply regime) is finally presented as a high-yield and energy-efficient memory cell in the 7nm FinFET technology. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Cells; Computer aided design; Cytology; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; FinFET; Integrated circuit design; Analytical method; Cross-layer framework; Energy efficient; External signals; Leakage energies; Non destructive; Parametric yield; Process Variation; Static random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926461749

Energy consumers are incentivized to shape their power demands, or more specifically, schedule their electricity-consuming applications (tasks) more prudently to minimize their electric bills. This has become a particularly interesting problem with the availability of residential photovoltaic (PV) power generation facilities and controllable energy storage systems. This paper addresses the problem of joint task scheduling and energy storage control for energy consumers with PV and energy storage facilities, in order to minimize the electricity bill. A general type of dynamic pricing scenario is assumed where the energy price is both time-of-use and power-dependent, and various energy loss components are considered including power dissipation in the power conversion circuitries as well as the rate capacity effect in the storage system. A negotiation-based iterative approach has been proposed for joint residential task scheduling and energy storage control that is inspired by the state-of-the-art Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) routing algorithms. In each iteration, it rips-up and re-schedules all tasks under a fixed storage control scheme, and then derives a new charging/discharging scheme for the energy storage based on the latest task scheduling. The concept of congestion is introduced to dynamically adjust the schedule of each task based on the historical results as well as the current scheduling status, and a near-optimal storage control algorithm is effectively implemented by solving convex optimization problem(s) with polynomial time complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm achieves up to 64.22% in the total energy cost reduction compared with the baseline methods. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Computer aided design; Convex optimization; Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Energy dissipation; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Housing; Iterative methods; Multitasking; Photovoltaic cells; Polynomial approximation; Charging/discharging; Convex optimization problems; Dynamic energy pricing; Electricity generation; Energy storage systems; Polynomial time complexity; Rate-capacity effects; Residential photovoltaic; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926454848

Due to process variation effects, a small subset of SRAM cells will be more sensitive to voltage reduction, requiring increased margins and limiting energy savings. Since large arrays like caches are most vulnerable to cell failures, recent proposals suggest disabling failing portions of the cache to enable low voltage operation. Although such approaches save power, energy reduction is limited because reducing the effective cache size increases program runtimes. In this paper, we present iPatch, a solution to regain this lost performance and enable energy savings by exploiting the redundancy inherent in superscalar processors. By relying on existing microarchitectural structures and mechanisms to 'patch' the faulty parts of caches, we enable further energy reduction with minimal overhead and complexity. Furthermore, because no critical paths or circuits are affected by our implementation, there is no impact on normal-voltage operation. For high cell failure rates, our results show significant energy savings with iPatch as well as an 18% reduction in energy-delay product compared to prior work. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Cells; Computer architecture; Cytology; Dynamic frequency scaling; Energy efficiency; Failure analysis; Static random access storage; Voltage scaling; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Energy delay product; Low voltage operation; Process Variation; Substantial energy; Superscalar Processor; Voltage operations; Voltage reduction; Energy conservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934325716

The balance of energy consumption for transportation between petroleum fuels and electric energy, and the related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced consuming either, is of particular interest to government administrations, vehicle OEMs, and energy suppliers. The market adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) appears to be inhibited by many factors relating to the energy storage system (ESS) and charging infrastructure. Wireless power transfer (WPT) technologies have been identified as a key enabling technology to increase the acceptance of EVs. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has been involved in many research areas related to understanding the impacts, opportunities, challenges and costs related to various deployments of WPT technology for transportation use. Though the initial outlook for WPT deployment looks promising, many other emerging technologies have met unfavorable market launches due to unforeseen technology limitations, sometimes due to the complex system in which the new technology was placed. This paper will summarize research and development (R&D) performed at ORNL in the area of Wireless Power Transfer (WPT).

A strong error correction mechanism can be used to tolerate the increasing memory cell failure rate as supply voltage is reduced. However, strong error correction often incurs a high latency relative to the on-chip memory access time. We propose correction prediction where a fast mechanism predicts the result of strong error correction to hide the long latency of correction. Subsequent pipeline stages execute using the predicted values while the long latency strong error correction attempts to verify the correctness of the predicted values in parallel. We present a simple correction prediction implementation, CP, which uses a fast, but weak error correction mechanism as the correction predictor. Our evaluations for a 32KB 4-way set associative SRAM LI cache show that the proposed implementation, CP, reduces the average cache access latency by 38%-52% compared to using a strong error correction scheme alone.

Consequently, emerging memory technologies including Phase Change Memory (PCM), Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM), and Resistive RAM (ReRAM) are being actively pursued as replacements for DRAM memory. Among these candidates, ReRAM has superior characteristics such as high density, low write energy, and high endurance, making it a very attractive cost-efficient alternative to DRAM. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of ReRAM-based memory systems. ReRAM's high density comes from its unique crossbar architecture where some peripheral circuits are laid below multiple layers of ReRAM cells. A crossbar architecture introduces special constraints on operating voltages, write latency, and array size. The access latency of a crossbar is a function of the data patterns involved in a write operation. These combined with ReRAM's exponential relationship between its write voltage and switching latency provide opportunities for architectural optimizations. This paper makes several key contributions. First, we study the crossbar architecture and describe trade-offs involving voltage drop, write latency, and data pattern. We then analyze microarchitectural enhancements such as double-sided ground biasing and multiphase reset operations to improve write performance. At the architecture level, a simple compression based data encoding scheme is proposed to further bring down the latency. As the compressibility of a block varies based on its content, write latency is not uniform across blocks. To mitigate the impact of slow writes on performance, we propose and evaluate a novel scheduling policy that makes writing decisions based on latency and activity of a bank. The experimental results show that our architecture improves the performance of a system using ReRAM-based main memory by about 44% over a conservative baseline and 14% over an aggressive baseline on average, and has less than 10% performance degradation compared to an ideal DRAM-only system. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Aspect ratio; Dynamic random access storage; Economic and social effects; Phase change memory; RRAM; Crossbar architecture; Emerging memory technologies; Performance degradation; Peripheral circuits; Phase change memory (pcm); Resistive rams (ReRAM); Scheduling policies; Spin transfer torque; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934298890

Physically, the optical cache is implemented externally in a separate chip located next to the CPU die. The cache interconnection system is realized through WDM optical interfaces that connect the shared cache module with the processing cores and the Main Memory via spatial-multiplexed optical waveguides; hence, the CPU-DRAM communication completely takes place in the optical domain. To evaluate the shared optical cache approach, we carry out system-level simulations of 6 realistic processor parallel workloads via the Gem5 platform. The optical cache architecture is compared against the conventional electronic Chip Multiprocessor topology that uses dedicated on-chip L1 electronic caches and a shared L2 cache.

Traditional shielding is composed of guard rings surrounding the signal TSVs or if the signal is differential in nature, a careful arrangement of TSVs carrying the differential signals can aid in noise reduction. In the guard ring scenario, the guard rings are typically tied to ground. This paper proposes a technique for energy scavenging utilizing the guard rings for shielding TSVs. Energy absorbed by the guard rings can be stored for later use by the system. This paper examines the feasibility of configuring the guard rings to charge a decoupling capacitor instead of shunting energy to ground.

In this paper, we propose an energy and memory efficient mapping methodology for implementing bitonic sorting network on FPGA. Using this methodology, the proposed sorting architecture can be built for a given data parallelism while supporting continuous data streams. We propose a streaming permutation network (SPN) by ""folding"" the classic Clos network. We prove that the SPN is programmable to realize all the interconnection patterns in the bitonic sorting network. A low cost design for sorting with minimal resource usage is obtained by reusing one SPN. We also demonstrate a high throughput design by trading off area for performance. With a data parallelism of p (2≤ p≤ N= log2 N), the high throughput design sorts an N-key sequence with latency O(N=p), throughput (# of keys sorted per cycle) O(p) and uses O(N) memory. This achieves optimal memory efficiency (defined as the ratio of throughput to the amount of on-chip memory used by the design) of O(p=N). Another noteworthy feature of the high throughput design is that only single-port memory rather than dual-port memory is required for processing continu- ous data streams. This results in 50% reduction in memory consumption. Post place-and-route results show that our architecture demonstrates 1.3x∼1.6x improvment in energy efficiency and 1.5x∼5.3x better memory efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art designs. © Copyright ACM.","Bitonic sorting network; Clos network; Energy efficiency; FPGA acceleration; Memory efficiency; Sorting","Data communication systems; Data handling; Design; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Logic gates; Mapping; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Random access storage; Reconfigurable hardware; Sorting; Switching networks; Throughput; Bitonic sorting; Clos networks; Hardware implementations; Interconnection patterns; Mapping methodology; Memory consumption; Memory efficiency; Permutation network; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962915313

However, designing a one-size-fits-all memory architecture causes an inherent mismatch between the needs of the application and the memory sizes and placement on the architecture. Nonetheless, we show that an energy-balanced design for FPGA memory architecture (memory block size(s), memory banking, and spacing between memory banks) can guarantee that the energy is always within a factor of 2 of the optimally-matched architecture. On a combination of the VTR 7 benchmarks and a set of tunable benchmarks, we show that an architecture with internally-banked 8Kb and 256Kb memory blocks has a 31% worstcase energy overhead (8% geomean). In contrast, monolithic 16Kb memories (comparable to 18Kb and 20Kb memories used in commercial FPGAs) have a 147% worst-case energy overhead (24% geomean). Furthermore, on benchmarks where we can tune the parallelism in the implementation to improve energy (FFT, Matrix-Multiply, GMM, Sort, Window Filter), we show that we can reduce the energy overhead by another 13% (25% for the geomean).","Architecture; Banking; Energy; FPGA; Memory; Power","Architecture; Data storage equipment; Energy utilization; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Logic gates; Reconfigurable hardware; Banking; Energy; Energy overheads; Energy-balanced; Matrix multiply; Post-fabrication; Power; Single components; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962815700

The development of the new design was necessary, because the operating range of speed and torque are different from commercial machines for industrial applications. In addition, to deal with the unique requirements of an electric drive for use in a maritime high speed vessel, features like high power density, compact construction volume, light weighted structure, water cooling and high overload capacity were implemented. Because testing the drive system and measuring reliable data on water is very problematic, a Test Bench was established.

In the past, home networks typically consisted of a simple router and maybe a couple of computers. Now, Gigabit and high speed wireless networks are commonplace in homes with many devices: TVs, Blu-ray players, game consoles, home theater receivers, and even home automation systems. This is in addition to standard computing devices such as desktops, laptops, e-book readers, smart phones and network attached storage. Smart homes with many wireless sensors to improve quality of life are also emerging. However, home network devices such as routers, switches, and broadband modems have been designed for maximum performance with limited consideration of energy optimizations when the devices are idle or serving low bandwidth traffic. The goal of this paper is to analyze the network activity of wireless home routers, investigate energy optimization opportunities, and present mechanisms for improving the energy efficiency of wireless home routers. We analyzed five week-long traces of home network traffic and identified a number of energy saving opportunities. Through detailed trace-based simulation and implementation measurements we are able to reduce the wireless energy consumption of the home router by 12-59% while incurring only minor delay of the initial packet delivery after leaving the low energy state. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Automation; Carrier communication; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Green computing; Intelligent buildings; Personal communication systems; Smartphones; Computing devices; Energy optimization; High speed wireless networks; Home automation systems; Network activities; Network attached storage; Networked devices; Trace-based simulation; Home networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924371255

RS providers dynamically supply electricity to the grid or consume electricity from it, in response to regulation signals, in return for economic compensation. This capability is commonly realized through large-scale electrical energy storage (EES) systems based on batteries. However, the highly transient nature of the regulation signals implies that the batteries used for RS are subject to frequent charge and discharge cycles, leading to shortened battery life and thereby impacting the profitability of RS. In this work, we explore the use of hybrid EES (HEES) systems, which combine batteries and supercapacitors, to improve the profitability of RS. HEES systems have the potential to reduce the cost of providing RS by utilizing supercapacitors to respond to the high-frequency components of the regulation signal, prolonging battery life. However, realizing this potential presents several challenges. First, the benefits of HEES systems are profoundly impacted by the allocation of capacity to batteries and supercapacitors. This is because the reduction in battery replacement cost due to the use of supercapacitors must be traded off against the increased upfront cost for supercapacitors. Second, HEES systems introduce the problem of how to manage the power flows to the batteries and supercapacitors so as to realize maximum benefits. To address these challenges, we present a framework for the design and management of a HEES system, so as to maximize profit from the perspective of an RS provider. At design time, we propose a capacity optimization framework that determines the best allocation of capacity to batteries and supercapacitors. During system operation, the proposed management scheme selects how the different storage devices are orchestrated considering their characteristics, as well as the incoming regulation signal. Our experiments suggest that, with the proposed capacity optimization and management framework, the use of HEES systems can improve the profit of RS providers by 79%-196%. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Green computing; Profitability; Secondary batteries; Storage management; Virtual storage; Capacity optimization; Charge and discharge; Economic compensation; Electrical energy storages; Electricity generation; High frequency components; Hybrid electrical energy storage systems; Management frameworks; Supercapacitor",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924359604

The incorporation of renewable generations at customer premises is a viable method to increase the renewable component of generation in Smart Grid. However, the random and intermittent nature of power generation is an inherent challenge for the operation of power grids with high penetration of renewable generation. Coordinating the operation of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) that includes controllable loads and storage too to achieve Virtual Power Plant (VPP) functionality has yielded amicable results in mitigating these fluctuations. This, in turn, could enable effective market participation by domestic consumers through an aggregator who can estimate the day's renewable generation pattern and coordinate the operation of DER to meet utility's Demand Response (DR) needs effectively. Such operation requires the exchange of significant volume of information between aggregator and consumers. By utilizing public data networks to exchange control and system information, the cost of implementing such operation could be reduced significantly. This paper reports the results of a co-simulation study that analyzed the feasibility of implementing VPP functionality through a coordinated control scheme implemented using a LTE network Successful such implementations enable an aggregator to participate in a DR program that demands the control of active power flow in the distribution feeder.

We address a key issue of designing architectures and algorithms which generate optimal demand response over a time window in a decentralized manner, for a smarter grid consisting of several stochastic renewables and dynamic loads. By optimal demand response, we refer to the demand response which maximizes the sum of the utilities of the agents, i.e., generators, loads, load serving entities, storage services, prosumers, etc., connected to the smart-grid. By decentralized we refer to the desirable case where neither the independent system operator (ISO) needs to know the dynamics/utilities/states of the agents, nor do the agents need to know the dynamics/utilities/states of each other. The communication between the ISO and agents is restricted to the ISO announcing prices, and the agents responding with their energy generation/consumption bids. We begin with the deterministic case for which there is a complete solution. It features a price iteration scheme that results in optimality of social welfare. We also provide an optimal solution for the case where there is a common randomness affecting and observed by all agents. This solution can be computationally complex, though we provide approximations. For the more general partially observed randomness case, we exhibit a relaxation that significantly reduces complexity. We also provide an approximation strategy that leads to a model predictive control (MPC) approach. Simulation results illustrate the increase in social welfare utility compared to some alternative architectures. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Dynamic loads; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Iterative methods; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Random processes; Stochastic systems; Common randomness; Complete solutions; Economic operations; Energy generations; Independent system operators; Iteration schemes; Load serving entities; Optimal solutions; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962010728

We propose and investigate smart control techniques in order to cope with the power constraints either introduced as a result of increasing node density in the storage arrays (consumable power constraints) or introduced when a mix of renewable (green) and conventional (brown) energy sources are used to power the data enter. The key component in the proposed storage framework is the policy engine which is a software layer that provides interfaces to define performance requirements of the applications (and also energy related policies). The policy engine enforces those policies in the storage system by adjusting the allocation of storage resources. The experimental results demonstrate the ability of the framework to dynamically adapt to the changes in workload and power constraints and minimize performance impacts.

However, one lesser known facet of NAND flash design is that there is no material difference between cells that store one, two, or three bits per cell - it is merely a logical interpretation of the cells contents. Therefore, in this work we leverage this interesting property to explore how resurrecting dead flash cells to create 'Zombie-NAND' flash can improve an SSD's lifetime, and what, if any, impact on latency results in doing such. Specifically, we analyze the impact of switching a TLC or MLC cell down one bit upon death, this allows the voltage thresholds to rise and life, though at a lower capacity, to continue for that cell. Finding that traditional wear-leveling techniques actually inhibit the benefits of this scheme, we propose and explore how controlled 'wear-unleveling' can work in tandem with Zombie-NAND cells to provide vastly increased life and decreased latencies for the drive. In this exploration, we perform rigorous performance measurement over a number of parameters representative of a variety of commodity and commercial SSDs. © 2014 IEEE.","Longevity Evaluation; NAND Flash; Storage","Cells; Cytology; Energy storage; Memory architecture; NAND circuits; Wear of materials; Feature sizes; Logical interpretation; Longevity Evaluation; NAND Flash; Performance measurements; Program/erase; Single level cells; Solid state disks (SSD); Flash-based SSDs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937894022

What the mathematical modeling of time-dependent system behavior offers is a venue in which students can be taught that physical analogies exist between what they likely perceive as distinct areas of study in the physical sciences. We introduce a storyline whose characters are superheroes that store and dissipate energy in dynamic systems. Introducing students to the overarching conservation laws helps develop the analogy that ties the different disciplines together under a common umbrella of system energy. In this book, we use the superhero cast to present the effort-flow analogy and its relationship to the conservation principles of mass, momentum, energy, and electrical charge. We use a superhero movie script common to mechanical, electrical, fluid, and thermal engineering systems to illustrate how to apply the analogy to arrive at governing differential equations describing the systems' behavior in time. Ultimately, we show how only two types of differential equation, and therefore, two types of system response are possible. This novel approach of storytelling and a movie script is used to help make the mathematics of lumped system modeling more approachable for students.

The only way to do that is to reach out to all the other innovators in the energy business, which comes from the clean energy side. Van Lierop's optimism comes as renewable energy and energy storage are becoming priorities for the industry. EOR using solar is an interesting example of the amalgamation shaping up between the old and new energy industry. In the Middle East, solar is fast replacing natural gas as the fuel to generate steam for injection into semi-depleted oil wells.

For this reason, hydrostatic drives are a well-established concept, in particular in the field of mobile working machines such as lift trucks or excavators. In this work, a mathematical model for a hydrostatic drive train of a passenger vehicle is developed. The main focus of the contribution lies on the mathematical modeling of the self-supplied variable displacement axial piston units of the hydraulic system since they basically determine the performance of the overall torque control. Starting from a complex high-order dynamic model, a systematic order reduction of the nonlinear model is accomplished by means of singular perturbation theory.

They mediate the degradation of extracellular particles from endocytosis and of intracellular components from autophagy. The digested products are transported out of the lysosome via specific catabolite exporters or via vesicular membrane trafficking. Lysosomes also contain more than 50 membrane proteins and are equipped with the machinery to sense nutrient availability, which determines the distribution, number, size, and activity of lysosomes to control the specificity of cargo flux and timing (the initiation and termination) of degradation. Defects in degradation, export, or trafficking result in lysosomal dysfunction and lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). Lysosomal channels and transporters mediate ion flux across perimeter membranes to regulate lysosomal ion homeostasis, membrane potential, catabolite export, membrane trafficking, and nutrient sensing.

However, the side effects of DR control could cause various issues that could eventually hinder its deployment. Therefore the impact of DR needs to be properly understood and modelled. A potentially significant source of DR may be found in control of electro-thermal technologies (ETT, i.e. electric heat pump and micro combined heat and power units) installed in the domestic sector, which could help to alleviate low voltage network congestion. In this respect, this paper introduces a detailed physical model which is used to simulate, with high resolution, the load shapes of different ETT in different buildings with different thermal inertia characteristics. Simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the changes in load patterns in the different cases and the impact of possible DR control strategies, also taking into account the thermal comfort level of occupants. The high resolution model developed aims at giving insights on the expected load pattern changes when applying different DR control schemes to different ETT and in different types of houses. © 2014 IEEE.","combined heat and power; demand response; electric heat pump; thermal inertia; thermal storage","Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Smart power grids; Combined heat and power; Demand response; Electro thermal technologies; High-resolution models; Micro-combined heat and power; Thermal inertia; Thermal storage; Wholesale electricity markets; Electric heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936980934

The considered unit is part of an autonomous power system with high wind penetration. Two different configurations are studied: (a) a small-scale air chamber injecting compressed air into the combustion chamber in case of system disturbances, and (b) a conventional gasturbine unit combined with a large-scale air chamber for energy storage using a separate compressor driven by an electric motor. In the latter case, power is generated when required by expanding the stored air through a separate turbine, while the gas-turbine unit operates independently. In both cases, the autonomous system is simulated for the loss of a generating unit. It is found that the small air chamber significantly improves primary frequency control by providing increased spinning reserve, while configuration (b) exhibits improved post-disturbance response both in generation and in storage mode, while reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. © 2014 IEEE.","Autonomous System; Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES); Frequency Stability; Gas Turbine; Wind Penetration","Compressed air; Electric power transmission networks; Frequency stability; Fuel storage; Gas turbines; Pressure vessels; Smart power grids; Autonomous power system; Autonomous systems; Compressed air energy storages (CAES); Control capabilities; Dynamic performance; Primary frequency control; System disturbances; Wind penetration; Compressed air energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936980690

Saturated island systems have already exploited considerable amounts of the available renewable energy potential.

The paper develops an optimization model for the day-ahead scheduling of isolated power systems, according to the recently established regulatory framework for the non-interconnected island systems of Greece.

The pressurized air is stored in an underground facility and used as a continuous energy source for a combustion turbine generator system. This proposed system is a departure from the conventional approach of Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) where the air compressor is driven by grid power during off-peak periods and compressed air is discharged to drive the combustion turbine during high-peak demand periods. As part of the technical evaluation, a set of system requirements is established based on the Alabama Electric Cooperative (AEC) McIntosh CAES plant that has been in successful operation since early 1990's. The technical analysis leads to the sizing of the CAES reservoir and the total wind turbine power requirement to produce 110 MW for 20-hr/day generation. A preliminary economic evaluation compares the levelized annual cost of the total plant against the potential annual revenue using an average locational marginal price (LMP) for the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) region.

Each of these have their corresponding type of operating reserves. Similarly, energy storage systems (ESS) may be integrated as energy, load following, or regulation resources. A review of the existing literature shows that most ESS integration studies are focused on a single control function. In contrast, recent work on renewable energy integration has employed the concept of enterprise control where the multiple layers of balancing operations have been integrated into a single model to capture and potentially control the interactions between timescales. This paper now uses such an enterprise control model to demonstrate the multiple timescale effects as a consequence of ESS integration into a single control action. It also proposes a novel scheduling technique which beneficially exploits this coupling in two timescales. As a result, the ESS scheduling technique shows peak-loading shaving and operating costs reductions in the SCUC and load following reserve requirements in the SCED. © 2014 IEEE.","Energy storage systems; enterprise control","Electric load dispatching; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Operating costs; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Automatic generation control; Energy storage systems; Enterprise controls; Renewable energy integrations; Reserve requirements; Scheduling techniques; Security-constrained economic dispatch; Security-constrained unit commitment; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936976804

Potential candidates able to provide such flexibility are demand response and storage. However, capacity and energy constraints usually restrict their use to exceptional and rare events. Recently, some interesting studies have looked at the integration of energy constraints in power system operations. One solution is discussed here: short-term frequency-band allocation (SFBA). Periodically, the system operator will change dead-band zones and saturation levels of the resources' proportional controllers and thereby manage the energy constraints in a dynamic way. The paper presents a model for SFBA and highlights its interest: the integration of capacity and energy constraints as well as storage profile preferences. Finally, some limitations to the approach and ways to deal with them are discussed: the inability to recover previously delivered energy. © 2014 IEEE.","Automatic Frequency Control; Demand Response; Energy Storage; Power System Control","Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Smart power grids; Automatic frequency control; Demand response; Large power systems; Power system controls; Power system operations; Primary frequency control; Proportional controller; Short-term frequency; Power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936972729

However, its integration into the power systems has posed many challenges due to its uncertain and variable nature. To deal with these challenges, the coordinated operation of a pumped storage plant and a wind farm in order to yield a dispatchable generating unit has been widely proposed lately in the literature. In this paper, a stochastic bi-level optimization model for the development of optimal bidding strategies for a mixed RES portfolio comprising wind and hydro resources is proposed. This bi-level optimization problem is converted into a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions and the strong duality theory.

Consequently, as distribution networks continue to develop, network management systems will become a crucial element of future distribution system architecture.

Depending on their physical properties, they can be used as novel biodegradable materials, environmental sensors, adsorbents (i.e., membranes and other porous structures), materials to reduce energy consumption, materials for storage or production of energy (light emitting diodes (LEDs), photovoltaic (PV) cells), and catalysts for advanced oxidation methods (AOMs) or ""green"" processing technologies. Semiconducting metal oxide nanomaterials such as TiO2, ZnO, CeO2, CuO, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, among others, have found specific environmental applications due mainly to their photocatalytic (PC) activity. Also, Fe3O4 and Fe2O3, supported or not, are of interest due to their capability to form highly oxidant species in solution such as Fe(IV) or to adsorb heavy metals (Cu2+, Cr6+,Ni2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Hg2+) and other toxic ions such as As5+ and As3+. However, other metal oxides such as SnO2 and PbO2 have been used for long as electrode materials for the electrochemical oxidation of persistent pollutant molecules in wastewater. The chemical and physical properties of these materials can be tailored by carefully controlling or selecting the preparation methods as well as the precursors and synthetic conditions. In this chapter, we discuss development and use of selected nanostructured metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO, CeO2, Fe3O4, Fe2O3, doped and undoped TiO2 nanoparticles and nanotubes) that have been found to possess excellent properties for environmental remediation, in particular their application for ensuring proper water and wastewater quality through pathogenic microorganism disinfection. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Advanced oxidation methods; Metal oxides; Nanomaterials; Treatment; Wastewater","Adsorbents; Cerium oxide; Copper oxides; Disinfection; Electrochemical oxidation; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Heavy metals; Hematite; II-VI semiconductors; Lead oxide; Magnetic semiconductors; Magnetite; Membranes; Metal nanoparticles; Microorganisms; Nanostructured materials; Physical properties; Titanium dioxide; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Wide band gap semiconductors; Yarn; Zinc oxide; Advanced oxidation; Chemical and physical properties; Environmental applications; Light emitting diode (LEDs); Metal oxides; Reduce energy consumption; Semi-conducting metal oxides; Treatment; Chemicals removal (water treatment)",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927570256

Many other new phenomena are being investigated for nanoelectronic memory, as described in Part Two of this book. It seems natural to ask whether these advances in memory devices could also translate into a new class of logic devices. What makes logic devices different from memory is the need for one device to drive another and this calls for gain, directionality, and input-output isolation as exemplified by the transistor. With this in mind we will try to present our perspective on how W and R devices in general, spintronic or otherwise, could be integrated into transistor-like switches that can be interconnected to build complex circuits without external amplifiers or clocks. We start with a very brief and oversimplified discussion of the most common switch used to implement digital logic based on complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors. We will argue that a CMOS switch can be viewed as an integrated W-R unit having an input-output asymmetry that give it gain and directionality. Such a viewpoint uses the word 'Write' in an unconventional sense, and is not intended to provide any insight into the operation of CMOS switches, but rather as an aid to understanding how W and R units based on spins and magnets can be combined to build transistor-like switches. Next we will discuss the standard W and R units used for magnetic memory devices and present one way to integrate them into a single unit with the input electrically isolated from the output. But we argue that this integrated W-R unit would not provide the key property of gain. We will then show that the recently discovered giant spin Hall effect (GSHE) could be used to construct a W-R unit with gain and suggest other possibilities for spin switches with gain. We end with a brief evaluation of these alternative switches in terms of possible applications. A key metric is the energy-delay product and it appears that new materials and phenomena for W and R units will be needed to provide any improvement over standard CMOS switches. On the other hand the non-volatility and reconfigurability of switches based on magnets is a novel feature that could enable a new class of circuits very different from those currently possible. © 2015 John Wiley and Sons Ltd.","All-spin logic (ASL); Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS); Giant spin Hall effect; Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs); NMOS transistor; PMOS transistor; Transistor-like switch","CMOS integrated circuits; Computer circuits; Crystal symmetry; Dielectric devices; Logic devices; Magnetic storage; Magnets; Metallic compounds; Metals; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Semiconductor junctions; Semiconductor switches; Spin Hall effect; Spintronics; Tunnel junctions; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors; Magnetic tunnel junction; NMOS transistors; pMOS transistors; Spin logic; Transistors",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926483797

This is based on simultaneous requirements to control the location and flow of charge while maintaining minimum energy dissipation. Anticipating these eventual limits on effective scaling of transistors, the semiconductor manufacturing industry, acting through the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductor's (ITRS's) governing body, the International Roadmap Committee (IRC), created the Emerging Research Device (ERD) International Technical Working Group (ITWG). The IRC charged this group to identify, evaluate, and track research and development of new devices proposed to extend and/or eventually replace CMOS information processing technology. This chapter first discusses the fundamental basis for anticipating scaling limits facing charge-based devices and then introduces the Emerging Research Device's International Technical Working Group's task. This is followed by a brief introduction of six guiding principles the ERD ITWG considers to be fundamental to successful development of new nanoelectronic information processing devices.

Resource limitations can become serious obstacles to performing research on the most advanced cosmological simulations. The Portal for Data Analysis services for Cosmological Simulations (PDACS) is a web-based workflow service and scientific gateway for cosmology. The PDACS platform provides access to shared repositories for datasets, analytical tools, cosmological workflows, and the infrastructure required to perform a wide variety of analyses. PDACS is a repurposed implementation of the Galaxy workflow engine and supports a rich collection of cosmology-specific datatypes and tools. The platform leverages high-performance computing infrastructure at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), enabling researchers to deploy computationally intensive workflows. In this paper we present PDACS and discuss the process and challenges of developing a research platform for cosmological research. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Computer circuits; Data handling; Digital storage; Information analysis; Reconfigurable hardware; Argonne National Laboratory; High performance computing; Large-scale analysis; Research platforms; Resource limitations; Scientific gateways; Shared repositories; Workflow services; Cosmology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963574993

In CHP plants, generation of heat and power follows a joint characteristic, which means that production planning of both commodities must be done in coordination. The hourly produced power can be sold to the grid at market price, but heat must be produced to meet the local demand of district heating or heat for specific industrial processes. Typically, the most profitable operation of a CHP system can be planned by using an optimization model. The high efficiency and profitability of CHP plants can be further improved by utilization of energy storage units. Heat storages make it possible to relax the constraint to produce heat each hour to exactly match the local demand. This allows satisfying the variable heat demand more cheaply by storing heat during low demand and discharging heat when demand is high. By relaxing the connection between heat and power production, heat storages also allow producing more electricity to the power market when the spot price is high and reducing the power generation when spot price is low. The aim of this study is to develop a model for optimizing the operation of a CHP plant together with a heat storage. The model is a linear programming (LP) model consisting of hourly models connected together with dynamic storage constraints. The objective is to minimize the production (fuel) costs subtracted by revenue from selling power to the market. The model is demonstrated using modified reallife data of a Finnish city. The results are useful for planning efficient operation of the plant. The model can also be adapted for determining the optimal size of the storage. © 2014 IEEE.","Combined heat and power (CHP); economic optimization; energy efficiency; heat storage; linear programming (LP)","Commerce; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Linear programming; Power markets; Production control; Profitability; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power production; Economic optimization; Energy storage unit; Industrial processs; Linear programming models; Optimization modeling; Production Planning; Cogeneration plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923228105

This has led to the development of several compression algorithms designed for sensor networks. Many of these methods exploit the correlation often present between the data on different sensors in the network. Most of these algorithms require collecting a great deal of data before compressing which introduces an increase in latency that cannot be tolerated in real-time systems. We propose a distributed method for collaborative compression of correlated sensor data. The compression can be lossless or lossy with a parameter for maximum tolerable error. Error rate can be adjusted dynamically to increase compression under heavy load. Performance evaluations show comparable compression ratios to centralized methods and a decrease in latency and network bandwidth compared to some recent approaches. © 2014 IEEE.","collaborative; compression; real-time; wireless sensor network","Bandwidth; Bandwidth compression; Compaction; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Interactive computer systems; Real time systems; Wireless sensor networks; collaborative; Compression algorithms; Distributed methods; Energy efficient; Heavy loads; Network bandwidth; Real time; Sensor data; Data compression",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983119336

We will describe a power-aware scheduler that monitors power consumption, distributes the power budget to each job, and implements a 'uniform frequency' mechanism to limit power. We will compare three implementations of uniform frequency. We will show that power monitoring improves the probability of launching a job earlier, allows a job to run faster, and reduces stranded power.

We validate this approach using 255 traces collected from 13 high-performance computing workloads on 4 different hardware platforms. First, we use both feature-based and time-series-based distance metrics to cluster our traces, and we quantitatively show that feature-based clusterings segregate traces by workload just as effectively as the more compute-and space-intensive time-series-based clusterings.

In pulsed power, an energy storage device is charged to a specific voltage over a long time period. To achieve high peak power, the energy storage device is discharged over a small time duration, ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds, depending on the application. As the field matures from single-shot machines that fire only a few times a day to rep-rated operation with several shots per minute, the ability for operators to determine the operational state of the system on the fly is extremely limited. This paper discusses the application of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to real-time data output from Rogowski coils on a capacitor bank to determine the state of health between shots. The SVD pattern recognition system can be used to rapidly ascertain if the system should continue to operate, or if there is a potential problem developing somewhere in the system.

However, not all branches in the long branch history provide useful context. Biased branches resolve as either taken or not-taken virtually every time. Including them in the branch predictor's history does not directly contribute any useful information, but all existing history-based predictors include them anyway. In this work, we propose Bias-Free branch predictors theatre structured to learn correlations only with non-biased conditional branches, aka. Branches whose dynamic behaviorvaries during a program's execution. This, combined with arecency-stack-like management policy for the global history register, opens up the opportunity for a modest history length to include much older and much richer context to predict future branches more accurately. With a 64KB storage budget, the Bias-Free predictor delivers 2.49 MPKI (mispredictions per1000 instructions), improves by 5.32% over the most accurate neural predictor and achieves comparable accuracy to that of the TAGE predictor with fewer predictor tables or better accuracy with same number of tables.

Scalable coherence protocols often leverage imprecise tracking to lower the overhead of directory storage, in turn leading to more collective communications on-chip. Routers with support for message forking/aggregation have been previously demonstrated, supporting such protocols. However, even with the fastest possible designs today (1-cycle routers), collective flows on a k×k mesh still incur delays proportional to k since all communication is across the entire chip. As k increases across technology generations, the latency of these flows will also go up. However, the pure wire delay to cross the chip is just 1-2 cycles today, and is expected to remain roughly invariant. The dependence of message delays on k arises due to the requirement to latch messages at every router. In this work, we remove this requirement.We design a network fabric that enables messages to (1) dynamically create virtual 1-to-Many (multicast) and Many-to-1 (reduction) tree routes over a physical mesh, (2) get forked/aggregated at nodes on the tree, and (3) traverse the tree-all within a single-cycle across each dimension. For synthetic 1-to-Many/Many-to-1 flows, we demonstrate 76/82% reduction in latency, and 1.6/2X improvement in throughput over a state-of-the-art NoC with 1-cycle routers and support for collective communication. Across a suite of SPLASH-2 and PARSEC benchmarks, full-system runtime and energy is reduced by 14% and 50% for a limited-directory protocol. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Forestry; Mesh generation; Routers; Coherence protocol; Collective communications; Collective flow; Directory protocol; Network fabric; On-chip networks; Shared network; State of the art; Network-on-chip; Communication; Fabric; Networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922525869

The real-time charging and discharging operation of the battery, is considered in the middle layer. With average number of customers arriving determined by the price set at the top layer, the middle layer determines the optimal amounts of energy to buy from the grid and to use for charging.

Given that generation from renewable sources is highly volatile and does not perfectly match the daily demand pattern of households, electricity storage has been proposed for balancing energy generation and demand. In this work, we suggest that, due to the high cost of Energy Storage Systems (ESS), prosumers should deploy and share ESSs in a collaborative fashion. This will allow them to leverage the temporal diversity in their energy generation and consumption patterns, so as to reduce the cost paid to the main grid and even to cover the deployment cost of ESSs. We address the question 'How much storage capacity should be placed and in which locations in the distribution network?'. In order to answer this question, we need also to consider how much each prosumer should charge and discharge each deployed ESS. The solution of this joint ESS placement-dimensioning and utilization problem depends on the energy distribution losses, expected electricity prices, and the diversity of prosumers' profiles. Accordingly, we employ the Nash bargaining framework to determine how this cost should be shared in a fair, and hence self-enforcing, fashion among prosumers. Based on realistic demand and generation traces, we show that collaborative prosumption of energy through properly placed ESS can lead to significant savings of up to 50% compared to a non-cooperating setting. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Costs; Electric energy storage; Smart power grids; Charge and discharge; Consumption patterns; Electricity prices; Electricity storages; Energy distributions; Energy generations; Renewable energy generators; Temporal diversity; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922432483

To apply real-time pricing plans, it is crucial to collect accurate real-time power consumption readings from individual homes. Thus, utility companies are increasing the installation of smart meters in individual homes. Smart meters can record energy related data (e.g., power consumption) every second. However, power consumption data with high time granularity needs huge data storage space and generates significant communication overhead for utility companies to gather all the data for the pricing plans. In this paper, we present E-Sketch, a middleware for utility companies to gather data from smart meters with much less storage and communication overhead. E-Sketch utilizes adaptive sampling to compress power consumption changes in time domain. Then frequency compression is applied to further compress the sampled data. We conducted extensive system evaluations with 30 homes' second-level power consumption data for more than 2 months. Results indicate i) our design can reduce data storage space significantly by 90% with more than 99% accuracy of second-level power consumption on average for a single home, and ii) our design can achieve even more than 99.8% accuracy on average for aggregated power consumption of 30 homes. © 2014 IEEE.","data compression; energy consumption; smart meter","Costs; Data compression; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Middleware; Smart meters; Adaptive sampling; Communication overheads; Consumption patterns; Energy consumption datum; Frequency compression; Real time pricing; Time granularities; Utility companies; Big data",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921793731

As an effective error recovery mechanism, checkpointing has been widely used in such systems for their survival from unexpected failures. The conventional checkpointing schemes, however, are time-consuming due to the limited I/O bandwidth between the DRAM-based main memory and the backup storage. To mitigate the checkpoint overhead, we propose a fast local checkpointing scheme by leveraging Multi-Level Cell (MLC) STT-RAM. We take advantage of the unique features of MLC STT-RAM to accelerate local checkpointing. Our experimental results show that the average performance overhead is less than 1% in a multi-programmed four-core process node with a 1-second local checkpoint interval. The evaluation results also demonstrate that using MLC STT-RAM is an energy-efficient solution. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Computer aided design; Dynamic random access storage; Checkpoint intervals; Checkpointing schemes; Energy efficient; Error recovery mechanisms; Evaluation results; Large-scale computing systems; Multi level cell (MLC); Unexpected Failures; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936883372

While static process variations can often be mitigated through binning or by post-silicon tuning, dynamic variations change as a function of time and environment and cannot be reduced by static tuning. Examples of these types of dynamic variations include power supply (VCC) droop, temperature change, and device aging over time. The droop magnitude, frequency and duration depend on the complex interaction of capacitive and inductive parasitics at the board, package, and die levels and change with the workload and current demand [1-3]. VCC droops contain high-frequency (i.e., fast changing) and low-frequency (i.e., slow changing) components and occur locally and/or globally across the die. Temperature variations occur at a relatively slower time scale with local hot spots on the die, depending on environmental and workload conditions as well as the heat-removal capability of the package. Further, transistor aging slowly degrades the drive current over time as a function of gate bias and temperature conditions. Conventional designs build in VCC guardband (VCC GB) at a target frequency to ensure correct functionality even in the presence of worst-case dynamic variations. In the digital core, this GB accounts for the delay increase on critical paths when dynamic variations occur and guarantees that timing constraints are met even under worst-case conditions. In the storage arrays (register files and caches) this GB is added to the static minimum operating voltage (VMIN) to obtain the resultant operating VMIN and results in an increase of both leakage and dynamic array power. The key design aspect of adaptive and resilient designs is to remove a part of this GB, such that logic timing and memory functionality can be met at a lower VCC. This improves energy efficiency and improves battery life; a key consideration in mobile and handheld platforms. The mitigation of the design GB can be achieved in two fundamentally different ways. For dynamic variations with time scales in the order of hundreds of μs to ms (such as temperature variations or transistor aging), a reactive scheme where any functional error is avoided is applicable. For example, embedded temperature sensors can be used to trigger changes in the clock frequency or changes in the supply voltage, such that at low temperatures (when transistor currents are higher) a faster clock (at iso-VCC) or a lower supply (at iso-clock frequency) can be employed [4]. For dynamic changes which occur in time scales of ns to μs, such reactive schemes are impossible by design. Hence, an alternative scheme can be employed where timing errors (in logic) or read-write errors (in memory) are allowed to happen. Once errors occur, they are detected, and the errant instruction is replayed with proper care such that data integrity is maintained. A combination of such adaptive schemes (Fig. 1) result in the mitigation of a major part of the design GB, resulting in higher energy efficiency. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Clocks; Computation theory; Computer aided design; Dielectric materials; Digital integrated circuits; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Errors; Integrated circuit design; Power management; Temperature distribution; Time measurement; Tuning; Conventional design; Embedded temperature sensors; Minimum operating voltages (Vmin); Post-silicon tuning; Target frequencies; Temperature changes; Temperature conditions; Temperature variation; Computer circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936880050

Among various types of energy loads in buildings, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) and EV (electric vehicle) charging are two of the most important ones and have distinct characteristics. HVAC system accounts for 50% of the building energy consumption and typically operates throughout the day, while EV charging is an emerging major energy load that is hard to predict and may cause spikes in energy demand. To maximize building energy efficiency and grid stability, it is important to address both types of energy loads in a holistic framework. Furthermore, on the supply side, the utilization of multiple energy sources such as grid electricity, solar, wind, and battery storage provides more opportunities for energy efficiency, and should be considered together with the scheduling of energy loads. In this paper, we present a novel model predictive control (MPC) based algorithm to co-schedule HVAC control, EV scheduling and battery usage for reducing the total building energy consumption and the peak energy demand, while maintaining the temperature within the comfort zone for building occupants and meeting the deadlines for EV charging.

Recently proposed 3D vertical cross-point ReRAM (3D-VRAM) architecture is an encouraging development in ReRAM's evolution as a cost-competitive solution, and thus attracts a lot of attention in both industry and academia. In this work, an array-level model to estimate the read/write energy and characterize the vertical access transistor is developed. We use the model to study a range of design trade-offs by tuning the cell-level characteristics and the read/write schemes. The design space exploration addresses several critical issues that are either unique to 3D-VRAM or have substantially different concerns from the 2D cross-point array design. It provides insights on the design optimizations of the array density and access energy, and several important conclusions have been reached. Then we propose multi-directional write driver to mitigate the writer circuitry overhead, and use remote sensing scheme to take full advantage of limited on-die sensing resources. The benefits of these optimizations are evaluated and validated in our macro-Architecture model. With trace-based simulations, system-level comparisons between 3D-VRAM and a wide spectrum of memories are performed in mixed aspects of performance, cost, and energy.

All these phenomena usually cannot be described by analytical models, and require development of advanced and reliable numerical modeling techniques. One of the most common numerical methods, for a general solution of phase-change problems, is the enthalpy-porosity method. However, the available literature shows that this method is not completely suitable for cases in which the solid bulk moves, e.g. towards a heated surface. The latter phenomenon is called close-contact melting (CCM), because only a thin molten layer separates between the solid and the hot surface, as the melt is squeezed to the sides by the descending solid bulk. The present work demonstrates a numerical model that combines the enthalpy method with close-contact modeling. The model ability to solve CCM problems for an arbitrary solid shape is verified by comparison with a known solution from the literature. The model is then applied for a new problem, CCM of a horizontal cylinder on an isothermal plate. © 2021, Begell House Inc.

However, n-alkanes have the drawback of low thermal conductivity values. Understanding the thermal transport phenomena associated with n-alkane such as n-eicosane (C20 H42 ) and triacontane (C30 H62 ) is crucial for improving the efficiency of thermal storage systems. In this paper, the thermal conductivity of long chain n-alkanes (C20 H42, C24 H50, C26 H54 and C30 H62 ) is investigated by utilizing non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. The main challenge in this work is to remove the possible domain size effect from the existing data for solid n-alkanes. Thus, the effect of the cross section of the system is studied. We utilized three different numbers of molecules for the case of C30 H62 to investigate the effect of the size effect due to the cross section area. Results confirm that the 600 number of molecules being used for the simulation box is sufficient to remove the size effect. All simulations were performed with the large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) molecular dynamics package. © 2021, Begell House Inc.

The performance of lithium-ion batteries is dependent on the electrode microstructure. Processing attributes play an important role in the electrode microstructure formation and resulting influence on the properties and performance for lithium-ion batteries. In this work, an integrated study combining experiments and mesoscale modeling is presented in order to elucidate the impact of evaporation in electrode processing. Our experimental study demonstrates that a low evaporation rate can produce an electrode with active material particles more uniformly coated with conductive additive/binder composite. The electrochemical performance tests demonstrate that the electrode processed via a low evaporation rate has lower resistance than that processed by higher evaporation rate. In addition, the former one is beneficial for mitigating capacity fading during the cycling. To fundamentally understand the experimentally observed microstructure evolution affected by solvent evaporation, a morphology-detailed mesoscale model is developed. The simulations predict that a high evaporation rate cuts off the connecting pathways between active materials and conductive additives due to the fast growth of gas bubbles in the electrode slurry. However, an appropriate evaporation rate is beneficial for conductive additive coating on the active material. The mesoscale model also predicts that small-sized active material nanoparticles are beneficial for conductive additive coating due to the high specific surface area. In addition, a stepwise mixing sequence during the slurry evaporation facilitates electrode microstructure formation with improved properties performance. © 2021, Begell House Inc.

In order to enhance the rate of heat transfer into PCMs, one of the most common methods is the use of fins which increase the heat transfer area that is in contact with the PCM. The present work deals, both experimentally and numerically, with a latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) device that uses a radially finned tube. A heat transfer fluid (HTF) flows through the tube and heat is conducted from the tube to the fins which are in contact with the bulk of the PCM inside a cylindrical shell. The thermal storage charging/discharging process is driven by a hot/cold HTF inside the tube that causes the PCM to melt/solidify. First, the experimental setup is shortly described. Then, the numerical model is verified with a sensitivity test for the grid size and the time-step. The model is also validated by visual comparison with the experimental results. The numerical model is then used to study the effect of the HTF temperature on the melting rate. It is found that the results can be generalized by a dimensional analysis. © 2021, Begell House Inc.

When combined with a porous medium, a liquid piston compressor is able to provide near-isothermal compression, and high efficiency. However, the gas being compressed can dissolve into the liquid resulting in loss of compressed gas output. Also, the dissolved gas in the liquid lines can cause aeration that causes damage to pumps and valves. To understand this gas transport phenomenon in the liquid and to evaluate the total amount of gas dissolved, a numerical model was developed. Dispersion due to the porous medium is found to be the dominant mode of mass transfer. The dispersion coefficient is calculated based on an experimental correlation that is given in terms of flow velocity, porous medium geometry and molecular diffusion coefficient. The numerical model is used to investigate a case study in which a water liquid piston is used for air compression. The amount of dissolved gas under various conditions is calculated, such as gas concentration of the inlet flow to the compressor and discharge pressure to the storage tank at the end of compression.

Therefore it is important to develop methods for understanding P retention and release within soils and sediments of wetlands and streams that form an interface between the uplands and adjacent water bodies.

Also included are procedures for obtaining the linear and the empirical Freundlich equations. Isotherm parameters are related to other commonly determined physico-chemical properties of soils including the P saturation ratio (PSR) and the soil P storage capacity (SPSC). The PSR provides an easily measurable indicator for identifying soils that pose a potential environmental P risk, while the SPSC serves as an indicator of the capacity of a wetland soil to safely retain additional P.

Soil mechanical behavior is discussed in terms of (a) soil breakup and (b) soil compaction. The soil breakup model is based on the assumptions that (a) the optimum soil physical (water storage, heat flow, and gaseous diffusion) or biological (microbial activity, seed germination, and seedling growth) processes are associated with bulk density of any given soil, (b) the packing bulk density of medium to fine-textured agricultural soils is related to the aggregate size distribution and the aggregate characteristics, and (c) the energy required to create different aggregate size distributions varies with the water content and the type of soil. Thus, if the optimum bulk density is known, then the procedure suggested in the soil breakup model can be used to select tillage implements for a soil at a given water content that would provide aggregate size distribution optimum for a soil process. The soil compaction model is based on the empirically derived relationship between bulk density and applied stress at different water contents. Inputs to the model are particle size analysis, the type of clay, the water contents at the time of vehicular traffic, traffic load, and the dimensions of the contact area between the tire and the soil surface. Output from the model is the change in the porosity of soil as influenced by water content and applied load. Porosity changes with water content and applied stress are then used to show a range of water contents and vehicular stresses that do not cause detrimental soil compaction.

The powerful linear proton accelerator at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) generates pulses of 800 MeV protons, which after compression in the proton storage ring, impinge on a tungsten target producing spallation neutrons. This spallation neutron source, called the Lujan Neutron Scattering Center, operates as a user facility that serves a wide community of international users. Currently, the primary high-energy neutrons are further slowed down and moderated in a moderator-reflector-shield assembly to provide thermal and cold neutrons that are then available at 16 neutron Flight Paths (FPs). The current generation Target-Moderator-Reflector-Shield (TMRS) was optimized to deliver cold and thermal neutrons to neutron-scattering experiments. As the current TMRS approaches the end of its life, we are working on several conceptual physics design for the next generation TMRS. Four neutron FPs will provide a higher intensity in the epithermal and medium energy ranges while the other 12 FPs will preserve most of the thermal and cold neutron capabilities that currently support neutron scattering experiments. This new design will enable many new nuclear physics experiments that are currently limited by neutron intensity or energy resolution available at existing neutron FPs at LANSCE. Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended (MCNPX) was used to model the complex Mark III TMRS design and compare it to various arrangements of the moderator/reflector/filter materials. Both neutron energy and time emission spectra were extracted from the simulation results and are presented in this paper. © 12th International Topical Meeting on Nuclear Applications of Accelerators 2015, AccApp 2015.

Fusion fuels such as Helium 3 (3He) and deuterium can be wrested from the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune and either returned to Earth or used in-situ for energy production. Helium 3 and deuterium were the primary gases of interest with hydrogen being the primary propellant for nuclear thermal solid core and gas core rocket-based atmospheric flight. A series of analyses were undertaken to investigate resource capturing aspects of atmospheric mining in the outer solar system, including analyses of the gas capturing rate, storage options, and different methods of direct use of the captured gases. While capturing 3He, large amounts of hydrogen and 4He are produced. With these two additional gases, the potential for fueling small and large fleets of additional exploration and exploitation vehicles exists. The mining aerospacecraft (ASC) could fly through the outer planet atmospheres, for global weather observations, localized storm or other disturbance investigations, wind speed measurements, polar observations, etc. Analyses of orbital transfer vehicles (OTVs), landers, and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) mining factories are included. Preliminary observations are presented on near-optimal selections of moon base orbital locations, OTV power levels, and OTV and lander rendezvous points.

Natural gas ideally in an adsorbent material will have a density intermediate between that of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) and the compressed natural gas (CNG). Thus, adsorbed natural gas (ANG) will have a very high energy density without the need of low temperature (LNG) or the need of high pressure tanks (CNG). While in principle this is an ideal storage scheme for natural gas as an automotive fuel, one has to find or develop the proper adsorbent material. ANG technology allows storing big amounts of natural gas at a relatively low pressure (40-60 bars) at room temperature in a relatively thin walled tank filled with adsorbent. This level of pressure allows refueling the tank using simple and cheap equipment or sometimes refueling directly from NG pipelines. At present, activated carbon appears with the greatest potential for storing natural gas at pressures not to exceed 500 psi. In addition, high performance carbons tend to have high densities. Consequently, the high density carbons will occupy a smaller volume in the storage vessel. This paper reviews the storage technologies for natural gas. Technical comparison is made between storage systems for adsorbent, liquefied and compressed natural gas and cost estimates. We discuss carbon adsorbents, design of storage tanks, cost and safety.

Each region can experience simple, tortuous, and complex fracture behavior creating unique pressure signatures. It has been observed that complex fractures with extended fracture storage can result from hydraulic fracture stimulation in highly deviated and horizontal wells. Complexity is created as a result of induced hydraulic fractures turning and twisting as they exit the wellbore in the near-well region, propagating into the mid-field region, and then re-orienting in the direction of principal stresses in the far-field. This results in anomalously high apparent net pressures as evident by increased ISIP's and rapidly declining pressures that dissipate minutes after shut-in. This paper presents minifrac and post-job pressure matching case studies that identify and describe mid-field fracture complexity (MFC), or extended wellbore pressure storage. The pressure behavior supports complex fracture propagation, high fracturing pressures and pressure fall-off responses typically observed in horizontal shale wells. High apparent fracturing stress gradients are often seen that are much greater than the over-burden stress-gradients. Although suggestive, these high stress gradients are not indicative of horizontal fractures in the far-field. Uncharacteristically high MFC is also not necessarily related to fracture complexity in the far-field. A methodology is presented that identifies the actual ISIP which allows for in-situ stress calibration, true net pressure identification, proper minifrac interpretation and an improved fracture treatment design. Rapidly declining pressure during a shut-in as a result of MFC resembles pressure dependent fluid loss and often is misinterpreted as such. However, the pressure response is a result of extended fracture storage and energy dissipation in the mid-field region, which can result in multiple closure signatures. Multiple closure events are indicative of complex fracture network behavior as a result of stress anisotropy and creation of multiple non-planar fractures in the mid-field region. Additionally, hydraulically induced secondary fractures perpendicular to the maximum horizontal stress can provide insight into stress anisotropy. Identifying and incorporating MFC into pressure interpretation analyses will enhance fracture treatment design and post-job pressure matching providing a systematic methodology for designing and analyzing horizontal shale fracture treatments. Information regarding MFC is critical in interpreting fracture treatment pressure responses and optimizing fracture treatment designs in horizontal wells, including well spacing and fracture interference.

The aim of both of these installations is to produce high-quality renewable heating bio-oil from woody biomass, e.g. forest residues. Valmet has integrated the bio-oil demonstration plant to an existing 200 MWth Fortum combined heat and power (CHP) plant in Joensuu, Finland [13]. The nominal output of the pyrolysis plant is 30 MW of bio-oil with a planned annual output of 50,000 tons which equals to 210 GWh of energy. The demonstration plant will utilize 225,000 solid cubic meters of forest residue and sawdust annually. At the moment the main market for the fast pyrolysis oil is to replace heavy fuel oil (HFO). Standardisation towards boiler fuels under CEN is going-on [3]. The same technology may also be developed further for the production of transportation fuels and chemicals. One of the challenges in bio-oil storage and use is to avoid the phase-separation into aqueous and lignin-rich phases [4]. This phenomena could be applied as advantage for chemical production. If a wet feedstock is used for thermal fast pyrolysis, a spontaneous phase-separation of the aqueous and lignin-derived phases is obtained (Figure 1). Figure 1.

This is caused by the waste of energy due to poor weight on bit transfer or downhole tool's damages due to high vibration levels encountered. High friction of the drill string against the wellbore has become a major concern in the process of drilling, whether it is in directional or horizontal drilling application. This source of additional torque and drag will lead to lower rates of penetration, poor tool face control, induced torsional vibration, instable drilling operation and higher rates of nonproductive rig time. This paper presents the benefits of utilizing the axial oscillation tool in conjunction with standard RSS drive systems in directional drilling applications, whereby the mechanism of axially oscillating the BHA or drill string has substantially reduced drag and friction, resulting in improved weight transfer, more consistent torque, and therefore, more consistent reactive torque. This provides a significant reduction in stick slip vibration levels and more stable drilling operation in all modes of drilling. With reference to the offset data, this paper also illustrates actual field runs that highlights the significant improvement in WOB transfer, ROP and torsional vibration mitigation, encountered to utilizing the Axial Oscillation Tool in conjunction with standard RSS system, which has led to more stable and cost effective drilling operation.

For that reason, a proper understanding of the multi-scale transport phenomena within these highly heterogeneous formations is crucial from both scientific and economic perspective. Because anisotropy of shale rock exists across multiple scales, determining changes in pores distribution has proven to be difficult. Recent studies have indicated that shale rock pores significantly vary in number, size (from nano-, through micro- and meso-, to macro-pores), and kind (organic and inorganic). Thus far, the role of pore network and, more specifically, what pores contribute the most to the hydrocarbons storage or the production process, is not well understood and remains largely unknown. Hence, it is vital to address the need for understanding of how well different pores are connected and how they create possible flow pathways for the hydrocarbons migration. Here we present a comprehensive modeling and simulation framework for Woodford shale rock that links and correlates two most important parameters for characterizing flow in shale rock reservoirs: porosity and permeability. First, multi-scale 3D models are reconstructed from FIB-SEM, nano- and micro-XRM images of the Woodford shale rock specimen. Through this process, the mineralogy, porosity, and pore size distribution of the sample are obtained. Second, newly created 3D representations of the shale rock matrix are used as an input to the direct and indirect CFD solvers to simulate fluid flow and determine the shale rock permeability. Visualization of the resulting models revealed the full detail of the shale rock geometry and mineralogical composition. This work provides a guidance for reconstruction of realistic geometries, as well as a template for many different simulation studies relevant to unconventional reservoir characterization.

Over 12 billion barrels of heavy oil in shallow sandstone are known in the Lower Fars in North Kuwait (Oskui et al 2009), and the first phase of thermal EOR targeting 60,000 bopd is now in engineering and construction, with targets established of 270 M bopd and above (Sanyal 2009). Large resources in carbonate formations at the Wafra field in the PZ have responded favorably to pilot thermal EOR (Barge et al 2009, Meddaugh et al 2012), and large scale production has been planned with first phase of thermal EOR targeting 80,000 bopd (Chevron 2015). Thermal EOR creates huge demands for fuel to make steam, and the cost and availability of that fuel has a very strong impact on the economic viability of the production operation. Kuwait currently experiences gas shortages that are driving LNG imports, and power generation requirements are forecast to rise faster than new domestic gas production. The energy required for these new thermal EOR operations adds greatly to requirements for new fuel supplies in Kuwait Solar steam generation has emerged as a promising large-scale source of energy for thermal EOR operations, with several successful pilot projects now operating in California and the Middle East, and full-field commercial facilities in construction in Oman. Solar EOR replaces gas-fired steam with solar-generated steam, eliminating up to 80% of fuel use. Solar EOR offers large opportunities for reduced production costs and expanded reserves in Kuwait's fields. Kuwait enjoys year-round high levels of solar radiation, allowing solar energy to deliver large reductions in gas used for EOR. Long term solar steam supply without fuel costs will defer shut-in, extend the economic life and increase ultimate recovery. This creates a triple prize for the Kuwait oil industry: lowered current production costs, expanded current production levels, and increased proven reserves. The Kuwait desert environment poses unique challenges for solar energy systems, however, with levels of wind, sand, dust and heat beyond the experience and capabilities of many existing solar technologies. Special care must be taken in specifying and planning systems for Kuwait oilfield operation. This paper reviews available data on these subjects and the field experience of solar systems operating in harsh environments. We review the technical requirements for successful integration of solar energy into these heavy oil developments, and the key technical challenges. Based on these technical requirements the fraction of solar energy is calculated for various scenarios. The results show that solar EOR can economically replace 75% of the gas required for thermal recovery in Kuwait. All of the 75% savings are delivered by direct solar steam generation, which is the simplest and least-cost approach. The results show that thermal energy storage- The molten salt systems which have been used in solar electric power generation is not required and adds additional costs and technical risk. © Copyright 2015, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Costs; Crude oil; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Fuels; Heat storage; Heavy oil production; Proven reserves; Reserves to production ratio; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Steam; Steam generators; Thermal Engineering; Carbonate formations; Commercial facilities; Enhanced oil recovery; Large scale productions; Production operations; Solar energy systems; Technical challenges; Technical requirement; Thermal oil recovery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088059147

The numerical results indicate that changes in both PEM thickness and LGLD thickness have significant influences on the cell voltage and efficiency. Decreasing the PEM thickness and LGDL thickness can reduce the cell voltage and consequently improve the cell performance and efficiency.

As energy storage capabilities advance, electric propulsion technology is increasingly being considered for aircraft and aircraft designers are now more willing to invest in understanding and modeling the performance characteristics of electric motors. This paper explores the feasibility of using electric propulsion technology in a commercially viable ten-seat two-engine aircraft. A series of trade studies performed to examine the system interaction of key technologies are addressed in this work. This showed that the fuel cells are still the most attractive primary energy conversion device for remote site locations and find application where an assured electrical supply is required for power generation, distributed power, remote and uninterruptible power. Nevertheless, the relatively poor dynamic response, high cost, heavy weight and limited lifetime of these cells have impeded the widespread adoption of this technology. However, the emergence of large ultracapacitors with high power density and the shift to hybridization in air vehicle technology, has resulted in the development of high power, low-cost, reliable fuel cell/ultracapacitor combination systems with fast dynamic response times, making them well suited for aviation technology.

As the interest in LPG production in Nigeria and other developing countries increases, it is imperative to study some of the flow assurance issues associated with LPG. Due to the presence of moisture in commercial LPG, hydrates can form during LPG production, transportation and storage. Hence, it is important to predict hydrate forming conditions of LPG and propose a prevention plan if the LPG production, transportation or storage system falls in the hydrate formation zone. This paper examines the mechanism of hydrate formation in LPG and how LPG hydrates can be inhibited using methanol and ethanol. The inhibitor effectiveness was evaluated by the degree of temperature depression effected by equal amounts of these inhibitors. It was discovered that Methanol performed better than Ethanol when 20wt% of methanol and 20wt% of ethanol respectively were used in inhibiting hydrates formed in LPG. The effect of dehydration on LPG hydrate formation was also examined by varying the water content of the LPG from 7wt% water to 2.5wt% water. This simple approach to hydrate inhibition will enable the Engineer reduce the risk of hydrate formation during LPG production, transportation and storage.

These advanced capabilities introduce more challenges to the energy management system by increasing both electrical and thermal loads and reducing the options for heat rejection. The aerospace industry has been investigating alternative fuels for aviation fuel supply for environmental, economic and security benefits. Most of the fuels investigated and tested were derived from biomass or other forms of organic supply and waste. Biomass fuels can be interchangeable with jet fuels, but typically do not offer any technical advantages unless modified to withstand higher temperatures. Another fuel option is liquefied natural gas (LNG). At first glance, LNG has environmental, economic and security benefits, but with technical challenges. Technical challenges such as low energy density (MJ/m3) and thermal stability at standard atmospheric conditions have limited the research and development efforts due to hurdles in implementation, such as complexity in fuel tanks, storage, transportation and energy storage density. When considering the aircraft as an entire system and not just focusing on the fuel management system, LNG can provide some benefits. LNG has at least ten times more thermal heat sink potential when compared to jet fuels. A quarter of the heat sink potential is at a sink temperature of 112K. Utilizing thermal cooling capabilities of LNG has the potential to reform the way aircraft are designed. LNG offers a compact and efficient thermal management solution which can reduce subsystem size and weight while reducing energy consumption.

However, unknown wells may exist because innumerable wells were drilled during Pennsylvania's early years of intense oil and gas development when incomplete records were kept of well locations. The concern is that early wells are likely to be unsealed because there were no laws that required effective plugging when the wells were abandoned. Now, many unrecorded wells are thought to be in areas of emerging shale gas and shale oil development where open wellbores might provide a pathway for undesired upward migration of fluids and gas from hydraulically fractured reservoirs. Because of this concern, Pennsylvania regulators have asked operators to locate orphaned and abandoned wells within a 1000-ft- buffer of new wells before hydraulic fracturing. The National Energy Technology Laboratory conducted high-resolution, helicopter magnetic surveys over four large land tracts in western and north-central Pennsylvania where historic oil and gas production has taken place and where unconventional oil and gas resource development is occurring or expected. The project's objective was to evaluate the ability of helicopter magnetic surveys to locate existing wells in heavily vegetated areas of varying terrain. Magnetic surveys locate wells by detecting the unique magnetic signature of vertical, steel well casing, which is depicted on magnetic maps as a ""bull's eye"" type anomaly centered directly over the well. To mitigate for the likelihood that wellbores exist where most or all casing has been removed, this study augmented helicopter magnetic data with supplemental information from farmline maps, state well databases, historic air photos, and digital terrain models generated from LiDAR datasets- all information that is publically available for areas within Pennsylvania. The four surveyed areas include: 1) a 7 km2 (2.7 square mile) tract of privately owned land in Washington County with historic oil and gas production and where gas is now being produced from five, horizontal Marcellus Shale wells; 2) a 17.7 km2 (6.8 square mile) area of state owned land (Hillman State Park) in Washington County with historic oil and gas production and where the uppermost well casings were often cut off or buried by 1950's era surface coal mining; 3) a 28 km2 (10.8 square mile) block of state-owned land in the Susquehannock State Forest of Potter County where gas was once produced from the Oriskany Sandstone, but it is now a gas storage field; and 4) a 37.7 km2 (14.6 square mile) area of state owned land (Oil Creek State Park) in Venango County, which contains more than 900 known wells, including some of the oldest oil wells in the United States. Ground surveys to confirm well targets from the helicopter magnetic surveys have been completed for two of the four areas flown including: 1) the private land tract in Washington County, PA with Marcellus Shale development and 2) the area in Susquehannock State Forest that is now a gas storage field. At the private land tract in Washington County, the helicopter magnetic survey identified 13 well-type magnetic anomalies within 1000 ft of the five horizontal Marcellus wells located there. The ground investigation confirmed that nine well-type magnetic anomalies were wells while four magnetic anomalies were found to arise from non well sources. One additional well with a weak (initially overlooked) magnetic anomaly was found using historical air photos. Of nine confirmed wells, six wells had recorded locations in Pennsylvania's statewide oil and gas wells database (PA∗IRIS/WIS). However, the PA∗IRIS/WIS locations were sometimes too inaccurate for the wells to be located in the dense underbrush. At the gas storage field in Susquehannock State Forest, the helicopter magnetic survey identified 81 magnetic anomalies, including 55 well-type magnetic anomalies. A subsequent ground investigation confirmed that 30 of the 55 well-type magnetic anomalies were well locations. All confirmed wells except one were listed in the PA∗IRIS/WIS state oil and gas well database and the locations provided were sufficiently accurate to locate the well in the field. The helicopter magnetic survey also identified two gas transmission pipelines with pulsed cathodic protection and multiple short pipeline segments without cathodic protection. Helicopter magnetic surveys identified 192 well-type magnetic anomalies within Hillman State Park and 742 well- type magnetic anomalies within Oil Creek State Park. The ground investigation to confirm well locations in the two state parks had not commenced at the time of this report. Preliminary observations from this study are: 1. the PA∗IRIS/WIS well database is incomplete for wells drilled between 1890 and 1920, the era of early well drilling at the Washington County Marcellus Area. Only six of nine confirmed wells were listed in this database. 2. the PA∗IRIS/WIS well database contained 29 of 30 wells found by the helicopter magnetic survey at the gas storage field in Susquehannock State Forest. Wells in this area were drilled post-1950 to produce from and store natural gas in the Oriskany Sandstone. This area contains active gas storage wells and plugged and abandoned gas wells. 3. high resolution magnetic surveys acquired from low-flying aircraft provide accurate locations for wells with steel casing. However, wells with no steel casing exhibit weak or no magnetic anomaly. 4. the inspection of publically available historic air photos or LiDAR imagery for well signatures can sometimes augment helicopter magnetic surveys by identifying well locations where the steel casing was recovered for reuse or salvage. 5. complete casing strings are not needed for detection by helicopter magnetic survey although the minimum casing requirement for detection is not known.

Buffer Basin is an open concrete basin connected to downstream of API Separator (integrated system in New Oily Water Treatment/NOWT, Senipah Terminal). Originally, Buffer Basin was designed to handle fluctuation/excessive flow of incoming oily water from process (e.g. from separator and storage tank draining). The biggest impact of isolating buffer basin is stopping liquid production of all TEPI sites. This generates long discussion and trial before the implementation. Consequently, accumulations of sludge/sand were affecting not only the quality of the discharged produced water but also the health of people/personnel due to the massive generation of BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl Benzene, and Xylene). The key factor of Buffer Basin cleaning was the successful re-activation of old OWTU to temporarily bypass the incoming oily water treatment. During this temporary period, no process shutdown was experienced which may impact occurrence of production loss. The oily water treatment operating cost was reduced by approximately 50% due to reduction on chemical injection. The quality of disposed water to environment is still below permit requirement. Meanwhile, cleaning the Buffer Basin itself was challenging due to huge amount and various properties of sludge/solid, highly impacted by weather, hazardous material exposure, etc. The sludge was treated using Sludge Oil Recovery (SOR) process resulting in 4 derivatives/products (recovered oil, solid, emulsion, and oily water). To comply with environment regulation, upon relevant Government Bodies approval, TEPI in cooperation with licensed Contractor used 3R (Reduced, Reuse, Recycle) approach to manage the waste. The solid waste was processed to become fire resistant bricks which can later on be used as heat insulation. The emulsion was used as synthetic fuel and become energy source for making the bricks. The water was treated in oily water treatment unit prior disposal to environment. Recovered oil was sent back to TEPI's storage tank. The project was completed and all the challenges were overcome.

A preliminary version of the TDU system (which excludes the PCU for now), is referred to as the RxSim subsystem and was used to conduct flow tests in Vacuum Facility 6 (VF 6). In parallel, a computational model of the RxSim subsystem was created based on the CAD model and was used to predict loop pressure losses over a range of mass flows. This was done to assess the ability of the pump to meet the design intent mass flow demand. Measured data indicates that the pump can produce 2.333 kg/sec of flow, which is enough to supply the RxSim subsystem with a nominal flow of 1.75 kg/sec. Computational predictions indicated that the pump could provide 2.157 kg/sec (using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model), and 2.223 kg/sec (using the k-e turbulence model).

Direct Potable Reuse (DPR) is the supply of highly treated reclaimed water directly to a drinking water treatment plant or distribution system, with or without an engineered storage buffer. This differs from Indirect Potable Reuse (IPR) which is already practiced in many areas of the US and involves the inclusion of an environmental buffer (such as a lake, reservoir or aquifer) prior to arriving at the intake of a drinking water treatment plant. There are a number of potential benefits of DPR relative to IPR, including reduced energy requirements, reduced construction costs and reduced operational costs. DPR may even provide an opportunity to allow potable reuse in situations where a suitable environmental buffer is not available for IPR. All water treatment facilities require a high level of reliability to ensure water is delivered to an acceptable quality and the risk to public health is minimized. This importance is underlined in the case of DPR, where the real risks of higher contaminant levels in plant feed water (e.g., during epidemics or after industrial accidents), along with perceived risks associated with public perception of reuse, require a high level of operational certainty. Consistent and assured levels of reliability can be met only with a holistic asset management framework including a robust design, effective and transparent operational management, a carefully managed maintenance strategy, and proven response procedures. The plant must be designed correctly, it must be operated well with realistic and practical demands on operations staff, and the assets and infrastructure must be maintained in a highly reliable condition. As the perceived “human element” in the process, operations must have robust and reliable operational plans, systems, and processes to ensure safety and reliability - essential elements for the advancement of public acceptance of recycling for potable use. Relative to existing water and wastewater treatment systems, operations teams are under much greater scrutiny for performance, and must therefore have adequate training and certification processes in place to provide a framework for developing and evaluating the necessary skills for successful operation and management of water recycling systems. This paper will present some of the work of Watereuse Research Foundation Study (WRRF 13-13 - Development of Operation and Maintenance Plan and Training and Certification Framework for Direct Potable Reuse Systems, which outlines an Operations and Maintenance Framework for DPR.

There are a number of potential benefits of DPR relative to IPR, including reduced energy requirements, reduced construction costs and reduced operational costs. DPR may even provide an opportunity to allow potable reuse in situations where a suitable environmental buffer is not available for IPR. However, a potential obstacle to implementation of DPR is related to the perception and acceptance of potential risks rather than science or engineering that quantify those risks and provide solutions to address them. A number of technical issues relating to the perceived functions of an environmental buffer need to be addressed in a transparent process, including in particular the need to ensure consistent and assured levels of reliability. Critical control points (CCPs) are defined at steps in a treatment train where control can be applied and is essential to prevent or eliminate a public health risk associated with a water quality hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level. It can include specific treatment processes but also chemical addition steps. CCPs must have both a monitoring component, which allows the operator to verify that the process is operating as intended, and a control component, which allows the operator to adjust the functioning of the unit process to improve its performance. While there are many “critical” aspects to the proper and efficient operation of a water, wastewater, or water reuse facility, there are only a handful that have direct bearing on the public health implications of water from that facility. This is a key concept as it allows operations staff to better manage various alarms and issues that will inevitably arise in any treatment process, focusing on those that are critical to public health protection. However, even with CCPs and a well-trained operations team in place it is important that multiple barriers be a component of direct potable reuse (DPR) systems to manage the total risk from chemical and microbial threats to public health. Our team has been working on a WateReuse-funded project (13-03) to demonstrate the robustness and reliability of DPR processes and to quantify the impacts of specific critical control points within a DPR system to help overcome this obstacle. Through this project we have identified critical control points (CCPs) for both a full advanced treatment (FAT) membrane based process (MF/RO/UV H2O2/Cl2) and a non-membrane treatment system (Floc/Sed/O3/BAC/GAC/Cl2) using a hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) team process and risk assessment. By incorporating a combination of both operational and maintenance data from full scale operating facilities we have been able to quantify the role of each CCP and then use Monte Carlo analysis to demonstrate the robustness (that is the concentration of contaminants that a given process train can handle) and the redundancy (that is the number of processes that can handle a given contaminant) across all of the CCPs in each DPR treatment train. Inherently present in the full-scale operational data is also the reliability aspect of each unit process. Thus, when full-scale data are combined across each unit process/CCP, a Monte Carlo analysis can provide insight into the “worst” case scenarios and then quantify those with a value for probability of occurrence. This presentation will provide an overview of the CCPs selected for the two water recycling treatment trains and then will demonstrate the use of Monte Carlo to develop the probability distributions across the processes. The presentation will focus on microbial data in addition to several key chemical parameters and potential surrogate parameters.

Two level spreaders distribute the basin effluent across a riparian buffer prior to reaching the receiving stream. Plunge pools designed at the inlets to the rain garden dissipate energy and settle out solids before entering the gardens. The new stream includes rock vanes, and pool and riffle sequences to mimic a natural stream. Designing the stormwater management facilities at the site was complex due to the close proximity to the existing stream, set elevations on the site, a high water table and accelerated design schedule.

Below glass transition temperature (Tg), amorphous food constituents exist in a thermodynamically unstable nonequilibrium and disordered state. Isothermal storage/aging of glassy amorphous food components results in structural relaxations that achieve a more stable equilibrium state over extended time periods (Struik 1978). Since the equilibrium state is a low energy state, some of the energy is lost/relaxed in the nonequilibrium glassy amorphous state during isothermal storage of food components. This energy can be recovered in the form of enthalpy during the reheating of the glassy system by using a differential scanning calorimeter, since physical aging is a reversible process. The enthalpy recovered during reheating of the aged material system is a measure of the system’s molecular mobility at the selected aging temperature (Gupta et al. 2004). Structural relaxation in the glassy state of amorphous food components during isothermal storage/aging is also known as enthalpy relaxation/physical aging. Many macroscopic properties of glassy materials, such as volume, enthalpy, refractive index, electrical conductivity, and viscosity, change during physical aging (Struik 1978). The changes in macroscopic properties may adversely affect the physicochemical stability during the isothermal storage of low water amorphous foods and food constituents (Farahnaky et al. 2008). © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Glass transition temperature; KWW model; Molecular weight; Physical aging",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060616565

Despite the billions of dollars companies invest, the discovery and optimization of new promising materials is too slow to answer modern needs. First principle physics modeling of materials on supercomputers is a new trend in material science to accelerate the discovery and commercialization of new materials. Equations of motion (EOM) that carry out simultaneous dynamics of nuclei and electrons are derived and implemented in a computer program. This approximation to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation is obtained using the DiracFrenkel time-dependent variational principle with Kohn-Sham (KS) electronic Hamiltonian. The total molecular wave function is defined similar to a Born-Huang series, but with Gaussian wave-packets for the nuclei and a single complex spin unrestricted determinant for the electrons in Thouless parameterization, build from time-dependent KS orbitals. Another major difference is the use of derivatives of one, the reference electronic wave function, instead of all electronic Eigen states, as is the case of an original Born-Huang series.

Following the path taken in electronics of reducing devices to their ultimately fundamental forms, for instance, single-electron transistors, now optical devices have also been scaled down, creating the increasingly active research fields of integrated nanophotonics.1-5 A fundamental nanophotonic device, involving single elementary excitations such as photons and spins, offers various advantages over a macroscopic object: its state can be controlled, initialized and read out with a precision at the fundamental quantum mechanical limit; its operational fidelity based on the interconversion of single excitations can approach 100%; and its functionality may be based on coherent rather than incoherent dynamics, allowing for devices that maintain quantum coherence, which is a crucial requirement for applications in quantum information processing. Thus, a fundamental device could outperform traditional devices in terms of operation speed, integrability, and energy efficiency. On the fundamental level, a device consists of various coupled and/or integrated entities, such as single emitters, optical microresonators, optical waveguides, and photon-to-electron or photon-to-spin interfaces (Fig. 1.1). If different-material systems are involved (for example a combination of organic and inorganic units), then the resulting device might be appropriately described as “hybrid.” However, this term can also be used in a broader sense when new functionality is gained from a combination of different physical effects. Examples are the fusion of bioassays and micro-or nanoelectromechanical systems and that of microfluidics and optics. A merging of quantum optics and nanomechanics, photonics and atomic physics, or quantum optics and plasmonics is likely to provide new fundamental insight as well as novel applications such as quantum coherent devices or quantum-limited sensors.6-13 For example, a quantum computer, by contrast with its classical counterpart, needs to maintain coherent superpositions of discrete quantum states, acting as so-called quantum bits. A similar challenge occurs in quantum sensors, where exploitation of entangled quantum states allows for improved precision over classical equivalents. Whereas long storage times of quantum states may be possible, for example in atomic systems, fast read-out and information transfer using integrated optics, that is, an atomic-photonic hybrid system, would be desirable. The quantum mechanical decoherence and energy transfer processes in these hybrid systems are, however, not fully understood. This broader class of hybrid system is the motivation of this chapter, many of above applications will benefit from the understanding of the fundamental coupled integrated photonic system. This chapter emphasizes model systems combining metallic and dielectric nanophotonic constituents by scanning probe manipulation.A typical example of a hybrid nanophotonic system is photonic molecule. With the rapid progress of nanotechnology, many nanoscale photonic devices as small as 30 nm have been realized, which are very promising to achieve manipulation of photons at chip scale and having broad applications in renewable energy (photovoltaic cells, solid state lighting), telecommunications and bio medical field.14,15 Recently, it was found that the electromagnetic modes of certain photonic devices are very similar to the electronic wave function of molecules16 (Figs. 1.2a-f). One of the most interesting examples is microresonators, especially when we arrange two or more microresonators together within optical coupling regime, the electromagnetic modes of the whole structure are very similar to the bonding (symmetric) or antibonding (antisymmetric) electronic wave function modes formed in molecules.17-20 It is interesting to study the photonic molecule of various structures using optical techniques and it may further improve our understanding of more complex photonic structures. © 2016 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Atoms; Energy efficiency; Energy transfer; Hybrid systems; Integrated optoelectronics; Light; Lighting; Medical nanotechnology; Molecular biology; Molecules; Nanomechanics; Nanophotonics; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photonic devices; Photons; Photovoltaic cells; Plasmonics; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Resonators; Single electron transistors; Wave functions; Coherent superpositions; Complex photonic structures; Electronic wave functions; Elementary excitations; Energy transfer process; Integrated photonic systems; Optical microresonators; Quantum-information processing; Optical waveguides",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054743222

The stored chemical energy in biomass can be deployed to produce electricity on demand, reducing the overall intermittency of a renewable energy portfolio. The storage capacity of biomass is particularly important for the seasonal intermittency of wind and solar energy which are not easily addressed by alternative storage schemes such as pumped hydropower, thermal energy storage, compressed air energy storage, flow batteries, fuel cells, flywheels, or superconducting magnetic energy storage [2, 3]. Seasonal variation in wind and solar energy production require much larger amounts of energy storage than required to address short-term intermittency in wind and solar energy production as well as energy storage over longer periods. © Campbell JE, Lobell DB, Genova RC, Zumkehr A, and Field CB.",,"Biomass; Compressed air; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Fuel cells; Heat storage; Magnetic storage; Solar energy; Superconducting magnets; Abandoned croplands; Bioenergy productions; Energy productions; Renewable energies; Seasonal energy storages; Seasonal variation; Storage capacity; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Fuel storage",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054466025

Signal- and time-frequency-dependent asynchronous approaches discussed in this chapter provide efficient sampling and data storage, low-power consumption, and analog processing of such signals. The asynchronous procedures considered and contrasted are based on the level-crossing (LC) approach and the asynchronous sigma delta modulator (ASDM). LC sampling results in nonuniform sampling, and the signal reconstruction requires better localized functions than the sinc, in this case the prolate spheroidal wave functions, as well as regularization. An ASDM maps its analog input into a binary output with zero-crossing times depending on the input amplitude. Duty-cycle analysis allows development of low- and high-frequency signal decomposers, and by modifying the ASDM, a filter bank analysis is developed. These approaches are useful in denoising, compression, and decomposition of signals in biomedical and control applications. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Modulators; Signal reconstruction; Wave functions; Asynchronous processing; Control applications; Filter-bank analysis; Low and high frequencies; Low-power consumption; Nonstationary signals; Prolate spheroidal wave functions; Sigma Delta modulator; Signal sampling",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054222262

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an efcient way to reduce CO2concentration in the atmosphere. It is a three-step process including capture of waste CO2from other emissions before entering the atmosphere, CO2transportation to a storage site, and its permanent storage. Among them, the CO2capture is the most challenging key step in which new adsorbent materials need to be developed. Three main approaches have been proposed for the separation of CO2/CH4and CO2/N2mixtures: absorption with liquid solvents, membranes, and adsorption using porous solids. Conventional adsorbent materials rely on either chemisorption or physisorption to capture CO2. Amine scrubbing has been extensively used in order to remove CO2from gases and utilizes alkanolamines such as monoethanolamine (MEA) in aqueous solutions as the adsorbent, relying on the chemical reaction between the amine group and CO2to generate carbamate or bicarbonate [9]. The biggest problem with amine scrubbing, however, is that large amounts of heat are needed to release absorbed CO2during adsorbent regeneration. Moreover, the amine scrubbing solutions are corrosive and chemically unstable upon heating. Additionally, because of their liquid form, their handling is considerably more difficult than that of solid adsorbents. In amine-functionalized absorbents such as mesoporous molecular sieves in solid form although they partially overcome some of the aforementioned limitations, their parasitic energy waste is still pretty high [10]. In contrast, physisorption between solid adsorbents and CO2molecules is a reversible process that requires much less energy for desorption. Traditional adsorbents such as zeolites and activated carbons have been extensively studied for CO2capture [11,12]. © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053955645

Heat may be added or removed to carry out the reaction at the specified condition of temperature and pressure. The product separation is achieved by heat addition (to a reboiler in a distillation column) and removal (from a condenser of the distillation column). The product may be heated or cooled to the correct temperature for storage and transportation. Thus, at all times heat is either added or removed to a variety of process streams by utilities or by heat exchange between process streams.

Significant development in the use of nanoparticles for modification of epoxy matrix has led to improved mechanical properties of the FRP composites. Carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites were modified with 2 wt. % Montmorillonite nanoclay and 0.3 wt. % multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). A hybrid system wherein 2 wt. % of nanoclay and 0.1 wt. % of MWCNTs was also developed. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA), Thermo-Mechanical Analysis (TMA), and 3-point bending tests were conducted for characterizing samples. Low Velocity Impact (LVI) tests were conducted at different energy levels. Impact damage was characterized through thermography. Results obtained from these experiments were compared with unmodified carbon/epoxy composites. Reinforcement with nanoparticles was found to significantly improve the mechanical and thermomechanical properties of composites. Addition of nanoparticles in composites caused significant improvement in mechanical and viscoelastic properties compared to those of control ones. Best results were obtained for addition of 0.1% MWCNT/2% MMT hybrid nanoparticles in epoxy. Composites modified with hybrid nanoparticles exhibited about 15% increase in storage modulus as well as 10° C increase in glass transition temperature. Flexural modulus for hybrid nanoparticle modified composites depicted about 30% improvement compared to control ones. Viscoelastic properties like storage and loss modulus increased by over 40% and coefficient of thermal expansion decreased both in the inplane and through the thickness directions. Carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites modified with MMT/MWCNTs hybrid nanoparticles displayed better impact resistance than control samples. Improved impact resistance of modified composites will help to address some of the major issues with using composite materials in naval vessels and offshore structures without sacrificing the advantages of composite structures. © 2015 International Committee on Composite Materials.

In the meantime interest in eco-friendly solutions has been increasing in the area of stranded & associated gas fields. According to the BP report 2015, global natural gas reserves are approximately 6,607 tcf. Nearly half of that is assumed to be stranded & associated gas that is uneconomical for market delivery due to its remoteness from potential markets and lack of economic transportation, infrastructure and GTL conversion technology. Therefore, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) has researched Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) & Modular GTL as potential solutions for developing offshore oil & gas fields. Because products of the GTL process can be easily combined with crude oil in the Hull tanks and used in the existing energy infrastructure. From a shipbuider s perspective, key design considerations in assessing onshore GTL technology for GTL FPSO & Modular GTL application were studied and analyzed as follows: Robustness to marine motion, Limited space, Weight and height, Self-sufficiency, Safety, Constructability and Certification Requirement. Moreover, commercial & demonstrated GTL technologies involved in Gas Treatment, Pre-Reformer, Reformer, Fischer-Tropsch Reactor, Upgrading and others were compared and reviewed to determine which technology is the best option for GTL FPSO & Modular GTL. Additionally, we have studied which GTL application method would be more competitive depending on the gas production size in offshore fields. Moreover, preliminary market analysis was performed to better define the scope of GTL products to be produced. Economic analysis was also performed to identify the major cost factors and understand their sensitivity on the project. DSME has recently completed the feasibility study to acquire the preliminary design & engineering of GTL FPSO & Modular GTL for stranded gas & associated gas fields in offshore locations. The results of this feasibility study suggest that design concepts of GTL applications are technically practicable. The clean fuel and the chemical feedstock from the GTL process will be profitable in the markets and the design concept will be economically competitive within the range of the current project cost factors. DSME hopes to set up a cooperative network with competitive companies for the next stage of GTL FPSO & Modular GTL. The cooperation network will implement at GTL FPSO & Modular GTL Pre-FEED and the economic study and will result in the commercial realization of this innovative approach for monetizing stranded & associated gas fields offshore.

Vp and Vs values measured by the acoustic tools influence: elastic property calculations, seismic-to-well ties, wavelet extraction, fluid substitution and amplitude versus offset (AVO) modeling. Modern acoustic tools use sources that transmit sound energy across a range of frequencies. The energy propagates through mud, formation, and back through the mud again before the signal reaching the tool transducers. During this energy transit, and in the subsequent data processing, the factors that can influence the quality of the data include: • Wellbore and formation conditions: For example, hole size, borehole geometry, mud properties, variation in formation velocity relative to mud velocity for consolidated or unconsolidated (soft or ultra-soft formation), and formation shear velocity relative to the mud velocity. • Data processing methodology: The sonic tool is not directly measuring the slowness and velocity. It is only via processing of the travel time of wave propagation relative to the receiver array spacing that it can be calculated. • Frequency effects: Not all formations respond equally at all frequencies. There is a necessary trade-off between decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the flexural mode that drives the shear slowness versus reducing the size of the dispersion correction at lower frequencies. Identification of mixing acoustic modes, problematic receivers, and reading consistency can also be difficult. This paper discusses how these factors can impact on the quality of acoustic data acquired, highlighting the differences between wireline and LWD technologies, and presents a practical work flow that can be employed to optimize data quality.

However, oil and gas industry face today to one of the major environmental problems presented by hydrocarbons contamination of soil and water. Various processes in this industry generate different contaminated hydrocarbon wastes, resulting from voluntary or accidental presence of petroleum products during the exploration, production, refining, transport, and storage. Sustainable management of this industrial chain requires a sharp HSE vision, ultimately based on preventing and abating the pollution in order to ensure work safety and to protect environmental components such as water and soil from contaminations and therefore, to develop practical studies in response to potential disasters. In oil and gas industry, solid and liquid wastes such as process waters or waste waters and contaminated soils contain high concentrations of hydrocarbons, which constitute the major widely distributed environmental contaminants and most of them are biodegradable by various microorganisms. The present study highlights the aerobic degradation of hydrocarbons by a novel indigenous bacterial strain, isolated from a drilling sludge in the south of Algeria. The biodegradation is carried within two kind of matrix; synthetic medium and sand microcosm with crude oil as the sole carbon source during three months. The results of the bacterial strain characterization can affiliate the isolated strain to Enterrobacter genus, with an emulsification index of 60 %. In the bulk medium, metabolic parameters evolve with time; the bacterial count increases gradually and the pH shows fluctuations in response to the metabolic and environmental changes. The surface tension of the bulk decrease considerably from 60 mN/m to 30 mN/m in less than one month, with a total emulsification of crude oil in the end of treatment. In sand microcosm, pollution parameters change with time and hydrocarbons concentration decreases significantly, with a biodegradation rate of 47.35 % after only three months of treatment. Therefore, it may be concluded that microbial degradation can be considered as a key component in the cleanup strategy for petroleum hydrocarbon remediation for a good sustainability. Furthermore, our results indicate that the isolated bacterial strain has an exploitable ecologic role, which may potentially be used in the biodepollution of hydrocarbon polluted waters generated by oil and gas industry and in the bioremediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soil of the same industry. © 2015 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

The in situ tests were used to verify the design base parameters of the rock mass, which were calculated during the preliminary design stage by reduction of intact rock properties based on the GSI method. The Gilboa Pump Storage Project (2 X 150MW) will supply 300MW of peak power to theIsrael Electric Corporation (IEC). The project will include two pump-turbines that are able to convert hydraulic energy into mechanical energy and vice-versa. The project will also involve the construction of 4.5km of tunnels, two large underground caverns for the powerhouse, and a vertical shaft of 500 m depth. The geotechnical site investigation included deep core drilling to a depth of 570 meters. The project is located in Israel and is situated 6 km west of the Jordan Rift Valley, which is an active tectonic boundary between the Arabian plate and the Sinai plate. The rock mass propertieswere obtainedviain-situ testing. This allowed for optimal design of the steel pipe and concrete lining along the high pressure tunnel and for the support design of the two large turbine caverns. The PLT was conducted usinga hydraulic jack, which was installed ina test adit in order to measure the horizontal and vertical deformation modulus, whereas the FJT involved the installation of six flat jacks on different angles relative to the tunnel axis. The evaluation of both the values and orientation of the principle stresses will involve the development of an analytical solution for the FJT.

Recent studies indicate the useful application of non-destructive methods with the aim of better reflecting mechanical properties and the degree of deterioration of real concrete. Ultrasonic testing methods (including ultrasonic pulse velocity UPV) are widely used to determine material mechanical properties and the changes induced by a variety of mechanical or chemical processes. However, only a few laboratory studies of ASR focused on ultrasonic testing of mortar bars. Due to this fact, a heating chamber was designed and constructed to enable ultrasonic sounding of mortar bar specimens while stored in accelerating solution. Regular ultrasonic sounding of mortar bars reveals significant dependence of ultrasonic data such as longitudinal P-wave velocity, signal energy, signal amplitude and signal frequency on mortar bar storage time. Ultrasonic data were subjected to time domain as well as frequency domain analysis. Different storage conditions were used to determine the effect of ASR on ultrasonic parameters. Mortar bars, prepared in the same manner with one type of aggregate, were stored in cold or warm water or in an accelerating warm medium. Ultrasonic data accurately reflects the differences in hardening and deterioration of tested mortar bars due to different storage conditions. Ultrasonic results showed very good correlation with the results of ASTM standard expansion tests and much higher sensitivity to ASR-induced concrete deterioration. Expansion tests showed 1% measured length differences in comparison with up to 80% resolution of ultrasonic data.

The discovery of new oil and gas frontiers in Uganda and the east African region at large will add significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere coupled with the fact that Africa region has only one project for implementing carbon capture and storage in Salah in Algeria. The capture and storage of carbon dioxide (CCS) produced during the combustion of fossil fuels offers one option for attaining large scale reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases and thus, promote a clean environment.

Such a field should, however, be larger enough to overcome the coercive field of the materials and thus consumes a large amount of power. Although the spin transfer torque generated by the spin current lowers the current requirement of switching one bit by orders of magnitude, the voltage-controlled spintronics is greatly demanded for ultraminiature and power-efficient devices. Multiferroic materials and magnetoelectric heterostructures have attracted intensified research interest because of the strong magnetoelectric coupling that can control the magnetism of ferromagnetic materials by applied voltage. Different magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms and strain-mediated, interfacial charge-mediated, and exchange coupled magnetoelectric effects are discussed in this chapter. The ferroelastic nonvolatile switching of magnetism in artificial ferromagnetic/ferroelectric magnetoelelctric heterostructures is a focus. The localized voltage control of the magnetic bit offers great opportunity to miniaturize spintronic devices. In traditional magnetic random access memory devices, a reduced Oersted field on the neighboring bit would also apply. With the presence of multiferroic or magnetoelectric materials, spin is controlled by an electric field, which opens new opportunities for voltage control of spintronic devices. In such novel spintronics the spin and charge, or magnetic and ferroelectric degrees of freedom, are coupled to achieve voltage control of the magnetic state with ultralow energy consumption. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Notably, he pointed also on the importance of collaboration between scientists of different scientific areas. Talking about the progress in biology, Feynman indicated on several molecular problems that the biologists solved (or still continue to study!) only in next decades, for example, how proteins are synthesized or how the light is converted into chemical energy in the nature. He stressed also the important role of physicists for the progress in biology, which is not only the methodological input but also innovative solutions for the construction of better laboratory equipment for the analysis of biological objects. Especially important opinion, which is still crucial also in current molecular biology, is the look at the thing principle.

Fluid control and physical movement were investigated for the previous experiments. Utilization of both seemed to create the best effects for reduced head/tail development, reduced edge bead, and improved parallel edge effects. Surface modification and vacuum were not considered for this work. In this ever progressing field, developing a deeper understanding of raw material rheology and process limitations provide the framework for new developments and breakthroughs in the intermittent coating industries. Investigations into line speed limitations, die swell (liquid spread) and the effect of forces (gravity, pressure, viscosity and surface energy) were completed. Intermittent coating continues to be an important and growing area in the world of slot die coating technology in general, and the flexible electronics and energy storage industries in particular. Join us for a discussion on the art and science of patch coating. Every coating process has a start and stop. In patch coating, this occurs more often than at the beginning and end of a roll. Of course the steady-state continuous flow in between starting and stopping has been discussed at length and has its own issues to deal with. But what special issues are associated with the start and stop of a coating head? For this discussion we will concentrate on slot die patch coating. Any shape can be coated - as long as it is a rectangle! In the start-up and stop flow analysis, the challenge is to reduce waste and defects associated with the transition from fluid flow to not. The considerations of start-up include wetting of the fluid on the substrate, pump control of fluid dynamics, and physical position of the coating equipment to the substrate. Wetting: The ability of the fluid to displace air at the fluid/solid interface in coating is critical to reducing defects. If the surface tension of the fluid and the surface energy of the substrate are not compatible the start of the coating bead may be delayed or jagged. This would lead to an improper ""head' of the coated patch. Surface energy modification may be required to produce a solid patch. Pump Control: There are many techniques for intermittent coating, with the most widespread technique using valve control of the fluid and physical movement of the coating head. The valve acts as the immediate start/stop of fluid flow, while the mechanical movement of the coating head breaks the wetted bead. The timing of the valve control with the mechanical movement can produce a good head or a poor start that includes poor bridging of the fluid, streaks, or a heavy ""head."" Physical Position: Where the coating head sits in relation to the substrate can determine the output flow of the fluid ""head."" As a liquid surface approaches a substrate, the liquid boundary layer has vapor molecules that begin to adsorb to the substrate surface. This adsorption forms bridge when the concentration is high enough. If the bridge occurs with a concentration that is even across the coating width, the coating will be uniform for the ""head"" or beginning of the coated patch. If the concentrated vapor is too far away, the substrate surface too rough, or the concentration of the fluid fluctuates, the coating will create a curved coating ""head"" to the patch. The considerations of stopping are similar to start-up, but need to consider fluid reaction to mechanical and rheologic behavior. The resultant ""tail"" of the coated patch are a function of the timing between the valve for fluid control, mechanical movement of the coating head, and wettability of the substrate by the fluid. There is not just one way to coat patches of fluid onto a substrate, but as long as you are aware of the coating fundamentals, you will be successful in your intermittent coating operation.",,"Air; Boundary layers; Dies; Flexible electronics; Flow of fluids; Fluids; Interfacial energy; Kinematics; Leakage (fluid); Liquids; Lithium alloys; Lithium-ion batteries; Mechanics; Substrates; Surface treatment; Valves (mechanical); Wetting; Coating application; Coating equipment; Energy modification; Liquid boundary layers; Mechanical movements; Physical movements; Slot-die coatings; Substrate surface; Coatings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026940583

Continental crust is composed of a variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks that weather and reform over geologic cycles lasting millions to billions of years. At the crust surface, these weathered minerals and organic material combine to produce a variety of soils types that provide suitable habitats and niches for abundant microbial diversity (see Chapter 4). Beneath this soil zone is the subsurface. Once thought to be relatively free of microorganisms, recent estimates have calculated that between 1016-1017 g, C biomass (2%-19% of Earth’s total biomass) may be present in this environment (Whitman et al., 1998; McMahon and Parnell, 2014).

While these different environments contain varying physical and chemical conditions, the absence of light is a constant. Despite this, diverse physiologies and metabolisms enable microorganisms to harness energy and carbon for growth in water-lled pore spaces and fractures. Carbon and other element cycles are driven by microbial activity, which has implications for both natural processes and human activities in the subsurface, e.g., bacteria play key roles in both hydrocarbon formation and degradation. Hydrocarbons are a major focus for human utilization of the subsurface, via oil and gas extraction and potential geologic CO2 sequestration. The subsurface is also utilized or being considered for sequestered storage of high-level radioactive waste from nuclear power generation and residual waste from past production of weapons grade nuclear materials. While our understanding of the subsurface is continually improving, it is clear that only a small fraction of microbial habitats have been sampled and studied. In this chapter, we will discuss these studies in the context of the distribution of microbial life in the subsurface, the stresses that microorganisms must overcome to survive in these environments, and the metabolic strategies that are employed to harness energy in a region of the planet far removed from sunlight. Finally, we will consider both benecial and deleterious effects of microbial activity in the subsurface on human activities. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Aquifers; Biodegradation; Biospherics; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Groundwater pollution; Hydrocarbons; Igneous rocks; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear weapons; Organic minerals; Physiology; Radioactive materials; Sedimentary rocks; High level radioactive wastes; Hydrocarbon formation; Hydrocarbon production; Lithostatic pressure; Microbial activities; Physiological adaptations; Subsurface biosphere; Unconsolidated aquifers; Metamorphic rocks",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024111324

During operation, the battery processes involve electron transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface and are closely associated with the electrical double layer that affects the kinetics of electrode reactions. Although the theoretical cell potential of a battery is governed by the Nernst equation, the overpotential always exists in the actual operation of practical batteries. The three major origins of the cell overpotential and the governing laws are introduced individually: ohmic loss, electron transfer, and mass transfer. Other important battery parameters, such as capacity, efficiency, energy density, cycle life, and safety, are briefly discussed. Emphasis is given to the electrochemical fundamentals of three main types of batteries that currently undergo extensive research efforts: lithium-ion battery, redox flow battery, and sodium battery. The working principles, cell architectures, typical electroactive materials, battery reactions, and capacity fading mechanisms of these batteries are introduced in details. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Battery; Capacity; Electrochemistry; Lithium-ion battery; Potential; Redox flow battery; Sodium battery","Electrochemical cells; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electron transitions; Flow batteries; Mass transfer; Battery; Capacity; Capacity fading mechanisms; Electrical double layers; Electrode-electrolyte interfaces; Kinetics of electrode reaction; Potential; Sodium battery; Lithium-ion batteries",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021152972

Identifying fracture density away from existing well control would allow a drainage area to be mapped and would aid in determining the well spacing needed to effectively drain remaining hydrocarbon reserves in Bluebell Field. An added benefit of identifying natural fractures is the possibility of uncovering additional new drilling opportunities in zones not previously considered as targets and thus adding new reserves. A 35 square mile wide azimuth 3D seismic program was conducted in 2010-2011 over a portion of Bluebell Field. One of the goals, based on the seismic data, was to locate areas of high fracture intensity in the productive Eocene Green River Formation to Paleocene Wasatch Formation interval and to match that against cumulative fluid production to find under-drained areas for future well locations. Post-stack multi-attribute statistical analysis was conducted over three reservoir intervals in the Wasatch interval since the Wasatch had produced over 80 percent of the cumulative production. The analysis consisted of seismic attribute selection and optimization by step-wise multivariate linear regression using cross-validation techniques which included hidden well prediction. After extensive analysis of over 300 attribute maps, a combination of seven seismic attributes was eventually chosen for the statistical modelling and comparison with production data. The resultant map of predicted fracture network was then correlated with cumulative fluid production from the first Wasatch well in each section. Best results (0.842 correlation coefficient) were obtained over one of the three modeled reservoir intervals. This reservoir interval, approximately 700 feet thick, correlates with the 'most prolific oil-producing zone' (geologic marker W180-WAS200) that had been identified from previous geologic work. Practical application of this technique along with offsetting well drainage patterns has enabled Devon Energy to high grade future drilling locations. © 2015 SEG.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018971927

The complex structural features and mineralogy of shale has broad implications on the development of the unconventional oil and gas industry. Although shale reservoirs are large in scale and offer the potential for long-lived production, extremely low matrix porosity and permeability, as well as complex heterogeneity, pose major challenges in obtaining economically viable oil or gas. A lack of predictive understanding of microstructure-based heterogeneity in shale limits the effectiveness of currently used production technologies. Hence, addressing the challenges of shale oil and gas production requires an in-depth understanding of microstructural features that control the oil and gas storage, release, and transport mechanisms. Because anisotropy of shale exist across multiple scales, determining changes in pore distribution has proven to be difficult. Recent studies have indicated that shale pores significantly vary in number, size (from nano- to micro-pores), and classification (organic and nonorganic). Thus far, the role of pore network and, more specifically, what pores contribute the most to the oil and/or gas storage or to the production process, is not well understood and remains largely unknown. Hence, it is vital to determine how well different pores are connected and how they create possible flow pathways for hydrocarbon migration. Here we present a comprehensive digital rock physics (DRP) framework for a three-dimensional (3D) pore network investigation in a Marcellus Shale rock matrix. Pore networks within both organic and nonorganic matter are reconstructed from focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) two-dimensional (2D) images of the shale specimen. Through this process, the pore size distribution, porosity, pore connectivity, and mineralogy - organic and nonorganic pores - of the sample are obtained. The impact of obtained parameters on fluid flow in shale is analyzed.

The battery-free PVR unit is designed to work optimally in locations with at least 4 average peak sun-hours per day. Farmers can receive a premium price for providing higher quality, refrigerated evening milk to dairy processors that would otherwise spoil. Dairy processors can also charge a premium for better quality and tasting dairy products from better quality milk that is maintained chilled from farm to factory.

They are characterized by strong transients and require robust, fast and accurate dynamic simulation tools to permit a proper evaluation of their performance. Model reduction, i.e. the simplification of detailed models, is an attractive method to improve the computational efficiency while simulating such systems. In this context, a μCSP plant featuring a solar field of parabolic troughs, a thermocline storage and a 5kWe power unit is investigated. Both the solar field and the thermocline storage are modeled with complex and simplified methods. The whole power plant is simulated under identical operating condition and deviations between the simulation results are analyzed.

A small insulated 20 liter storage tank is firstly charged up with the use of an electrical heater in thermal contact with an oil circulating copper spiral coil. After charging, the storage tank is left to cool down for 24 hr cycles. Cool-down experimental thermal cycles are carried out with the three different oils. De-stratification and heat loss parameters are evaluated. The stratification number is evaluated and it signifies the degree of thermal stratification. Stratification numbers are seen to be slightly higher for Sunflower Oil as compared to the other oils at the later stages of cool-down.

The model, termed SPPEEDI (SAIDI Payback Period Evaluation for Extended Duration Interruption), incorporates savings from avoided business interruption with utilization of PVBS. While the PVBS system can produce clean energy and maintain energy continuity, its prohibitive cost of installation is a barrier to widespread adoption. By using the SPPEEDI model and incorporating avoided business interruption in evaluating PVBS payback periods, the model allows for a more accurate estimate of the return on investment for PVBS. This analysis identifies key grid outage thresholds where commercial PVBS could be a better investment than conventional photovoltaic systems. © 2016.

Nonetheless, latent heat storages face challenges of storage charging, heat retaining, and discharging the stored heat. The focus point of solar concentrators is the ideal position to collect maximum thermal power; however, this place is not convenient. Therefore, it is important to transport the concentrated heat from the focus to some place efficiently in order to utilize it safely. This paper addresses the challenges of heat transportation and storage charging-discharging issues. The heat transportation from the receiver over some distance is carried out with a pipe lines and water as heat transfer fluids. However, the charging-discharging process was carried by pipe less method with the help of fins. In addition, the stored heat was retained for a couple of days by using appropriate insulation material. The latent heat is stored in a phase change material (PCM) of nitrate salt (mixture of 60%NaNO3 and 40%KNO3), which melts at 222°C and has 109 J/g specific heat of fusion. The storage was designed to supply nearly isothermal heat during the liquid-solid phase transition and the sensible heat stored in the solid and liquid form is used to perform additional applications that do not require uniform heat. The low thermal conductivity of the PCM is improved by using extended fins, which enhance the thermal conductivity within the storage. In this article, two-phase loop thermosyphon of steam was used to manage long distance heat transportation between the receiver and the storage. The steam in the thermosyphon flow was restricted to a maximum working temperature of 250°C. Steam is selected for its highest heat capacity, easily availability and stable nature. The steam carries the heat from the collector focus point and condenses in a coiled pipe imbedded in aluminum plate placed on top of the storage. Many fins have solidly attached to this plate to conduct this heat down to the PCM inside the storage during charging. This design configuration avoids pressure development inside the PCM storage. The charging-discharging temperature of the storage is recorded in three zones (top, middle and bottom) of the storage. The experimental and numerical results show the heat transportation, retention and charging-discharging methods are effective. © 2016.

This paper presents an introduction to the campus Photovoltaic Charging Station (PV-CS) that generates clean electricity from the sun and charges the LEVs batteries which can lead to reduction of CO2 emissions, along with fulfillment of national and international green sustainability targets. Based on the evaluation of possible options for PV-CS design, the optimal design configuration was chosen as a ""Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)"". The PV generated electricity that is stored in battery banks will serve as the primary source for charging the campus vehicles, with any surplus demand being met by the utility grid. Batteries have been included in the design due to intermittent nature of Irish sunshine and the charge time requirements of campus load. This paper concentrates on the detailed sizing of the BESS via two approaches: BESS with DC generation and BESS with LEV load demand. In the first approach the outputs were normalized and grouped into specified generation categories in MATLAB. To establish the accurate BESS capacity the load demand variations of the LEVs were monitored. Based on DC generation and demand profile, the optimal capacity of BESS was chosen to be in the range of 6-8 kWh, which can accommodate up to 6 LEVs. © 2016.

This work describes an integrated energy system in Norway which supplied several commercial and residential buildings with heating and cooling. The integrated thermal energy system consisted of heat pumps (∼1 MW total cooling capacity), solar thermal collectors (290 m2), district heating connection as well as water tanks (15000 l) and boreholes (62 x 300 m) for thermal energy storage. The water tanks acted as buffer and balanced the mismatch of supply and demand during a day. The seasonal operation modes were chosen depending on the outdoor conditions. In summer, the condenser heat from the cooling systems and the solar collectors was sent to the boreholes. In winter, the heat pumps used the boreholes and the surplus heat from the cooling systems as heat source and delivered heat to the buildings for space heating and domestic hot water. In spring, certain cooling demands could be covered by free-cooling as long as the borehole temperature was low enough.

Application: a unique way to test intimate details of the nuclear structure by performing atomic (rather than nuclear) experiments and calculations. 2) Charge exchange is not really an inherently quantal phenomenon, but rather has classical roots. Application: continuum lowering in plasmas. 3) The most challenging problem of classical physics that led to the development of quantum mechanics - the failure to explain the stability of atoms - can be solved within a classical formalism that has its roots in Dirac’s works. The underlying physics can be interpreted as a non-Einsteinian time dilation. 4) In two-electron atoms/ions, the spin-spin interaction (singular in its nature), usually considered unimportant, makes a significant contribution to the binding energy. 5) In magnetized plasmas the standard Inglis-Teller concept, concerning the number of observed lines in spectral series of hydrogen, breaks down. Application: new plasma diagnostic. 6) Extrema in transition energies of molecules/quasimiolecules can result in dips (rather than usually considered satellites) within spectral lines. Application: the experimental determination of rates of charge exchange between multicharged ions - important for magnetic fusion in Tokamaks, for population inversion in the soft x-ray and VUV ranges, for ion storage devices, and for astrophysics. © 2015 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

The nixtamalization process is one of the main direct food uses of this cereal grain. Selected white, yellow, and blue dent open-pollinated varieties or hybrid corns are processed into tortillas and alkaline-cooked snacks. The major advantages of growing hybrids are improved yields and more uniform kernel type and maturity. Genetics, environment, and postharvest practices of grain handling and storage affect the quality composition and physical properties of the kernel. The main criteria used to select corn for the manufacturing of tortillas and related snacks are related to their physical properties because these affect chemical composition, functionality, processing parameters, and end use. Table tortillas are preferably manufactured from dent white maize, although yellow kernels are also used or blended with white kernels before lime-cooking. Most industrial tortilla processors contract food-grade and non-genetically modified corns. The preferred corns should have a test weight of 76-78 kg/hL and a density of 1.3 g/cm3 and be medium to large sized (290-340 g/1,000 kernels). They should possess a round crown, a smooth dent, an intermediate endosperm texture, an easily removable pericarp, a clean bright white or yellow color, and a kernel with tolerance to damage during handling. In addition, kernels should be free of heat, insect, or mold damage. A high proportion of hard (vitreous) to soft (chalky) endosperm is required, but flinty is not desirable because flinty corns require higher cooking regimes, which demand more energy. These grain features are relevant because they are closely related to dry matter loss or tortilla yield, processability, and end-product quality. © 2015 AACC International, Inc.

Conclusions and PerspectivesThe metabolism of chondrichthyan fishes is of interest because it is unlike that of any other vertebrate group with the possible exception of the coelacanth. It is dominated by the osmotic strategy of urea retention. This involves continuously synthesizing and maintaining large amounts of urea and thus impacts not only their nitrogen metabolism but also, indirectly, the metabolism of lipids and ketone bodies. The chondrichthyans may be the most nitrogen limited vertebrates. The system for synthesizing urea requires glutamine as the nitrogen donor and thus nitrogen metabolism is focused on providing this amino acid. The absence of albumin in the group precludes the rapid transport of non-esterified fatty acids for muscle contraction. Consequently, lipid-derived ketone bodies replace fatty acids as the energy source in muscle and heart. As the most primitive extant jawed vertebrate group, the chondrichthyans show advances over the jawless fish, the agnathans. They provide insight into the early stages of vertebrate evolution where food intake and digestion improved; metabolic organization started to become more specialized, with more tissue-specific protein isoforms that allowed better control of metabolism; and improved efficiency and rates of metabolic processes.

The resonances are produced by changes in beam-pipe geometry that generate reflections and standing waves, with typical behavior being similar to a section of waveguide with shorted ends. The technique uses fact that the EC density will shift the resonant frequencies. In previous analysis, we have made the simplifying approximation that the standing waves are multiples of a half-wavelength and that the magnitude of the electric field is symmetric about the longitudinal center of the resonance. In this paper we show that some changes in beam-pipe geometry will result in asymmetric electric field magnitudes along the resonant length. When this is combined with an EC density that varies along this length, the magnitude of the frequency shift will be altered. We present our initial attempt to correct for this effect by modeling the existing beam-pipe using CST Microwave Studio® to obtain a more realistic electric field distribution. This correction is then applied to data taken with beam at several resonant frequencies. The measurements were made at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), which has been reconfigured as a test accelerator (CesrTA) providing electron or positron beams ranging in energy from 2 to 5 GeV.

In multi-turn injection schemes, this notch in the beam may be generated either in the linac pulse prior to injection or in the accelerator itself after injection. In the case of the Fermilab Booster, the notch is created in the ring near injection energy by the use of fast kickers which deposit the beam in a shielded collimation region within the accelerator tunnel. With increasing beam powers, it is desirable to create this notch at the lowest possible energy to minimize activation. Fermilab has undertaken an R&D project to build a laser system to create the notch within a linac beam pulse at 750 keV, where activation issues are negligible.

Currently, the energy range of the gamma-ray beam is from 1 MeV to about 100 MeV, with the maximum total gamma-ray flux about 3E10 gammas per second around 10 MeV. The FEL is typically operated in quasi-CW mode. Some HIGS user experiments can benefit tremendously from a pulsed mode of FEL operation. For that purpose, a fast steering magnet was developed years ago [1] to modulate the FEL gain. This allows a build-up of a high peak power FEL pulse from a well-damped electron beam. However, the use of this gain modulator at low e-beam energies can dramatically limit e-beam current due to beam instability and poor injection. It also suffers from the problem of a significantly reduced ebeam lifetime. To overcome these shortcomings, we developed and successfully tested an RF frequency modulation technique to pulse the FEL beam. In this paper, we will describe this development, and report our preliminary results of this improved pulsed FEL operation.

This presentation intends to provide a picture of the multi-criterial analyses of salt cavern locations in Romania. The energy sector is facing with the necessity to store large energy quantities for short to long term in order to adapt to the increasingly intermittent renewable energy. The results of this presentation have originated from an ongoing European assessment project by the name of HyUnder (FCH JU, grant 303417) regarding utilization of salt caverns for hydrogen underground storage. Currently, main uses of salt caverns include storage of hydrocarbons or wastes disposal. Salt caverns have stirred the interest of the scientific community regarding the potential applications in hydrogen economy. Romania has active mines or caverns and others closed, many of them have the potential to be used from hydrogen storage. These facts represent an interested situation in order to initiate studies or assessments of the potential hydrogen underground storage. The salt mines, hydrogen producers, renewable energy sources and research centers with high qualified scientists, represent essentially elements for new type of studies regarding hydrogen economy. In the context of scientific community's efforts from Romania to assert active in the area of hydrogen technologies, this approach can certainly constitutes an attractive example for pan-European cooperation. The work disclaims the technic multi-criterial analyses of salt cavern locations regarding hydrogen underground storage.

Muon storage rings can serve as high precision neutrino sources, and a muon collider is an ideal technology for a TeV or multi-TeV collider. Progress in muon accelerator designs has advanced steadily in recent years. In regard to 6D muon cooling, detailed and realistic designs now exist that provide more than 5 order-of-magnitude emittance reduction. Furthermore, detector performance studies indicate that with suitable pixelation and timing resolution, backgrounds in the collider detectors can be significantly reduced thus enabling high quality physics results. Thanks to these and other advances in design & simulation of muon systems, technology development, and systems demonstrations, muon storage-ring-based neutrino sources and a muon collider appear more feasible than ever before. A muon collider is now arguably among the most compelling approaches to a multi-TeV lepton collider. This paper summarizes the current status of design concepts for muon-based accelerators for neutrino factories and a muon collider.

The electron collider ring accepts electrons from CEBAF at energies from 3 to 12 GeV. Protons and ions are delivered to a booster and captured in a long bunch before being ramped and transferred to the ion collider ring. The ion collider ring accelerates a small number of long ion bunches to colliding energy before they are re-bunched into a high frequency train of very short bunches for colliding. Two sets of low frequency RF systems are needed for the long ion bunch energy ramping in the booster and ion collider ring. Another two sets of high frequency RF cavities are needed for rebunching in the ion collider ring and compensating synchrotron radiation energy loss in the electron collider ring. The requirements from energy ramping, ion beam bunching, electron beam energy compensation, collective effects, beam loading and feedback capability, RF power capability, etc. are presented.

Nanodiamond powder is a state-of-the-art material widely used in polishing compositions, coatings, lubricants and polymers. Currently nanodiamond powder is rapidly finding its way into biomedicine, Thermal Management in electronics, energy storage, field emission displays and other advanced applications. Since nanodiamonds can ""transfer"" diamond like properties (heat conductivity, electrical insulation, strength of material) they are natural candidates for space applications and technologies such as: Rad-hard parts and coatings, Advanced composite reinforced with ND for space environment, Weight reduction by reinforcing existing materials, Electric propulsion plasma-environment ceramics, Anti friction technology for moving parts, bearings and momentum wheels, Thermal conductive, electric insulating advanced materials. The presentation will include an introduction to Nanodiamonds, current technologies for producing and manipulating nanodiamonds and prospects for the future. The presentation is in collaboration with Ray techniques, an Israel nanodiamonds company. Ray techniques has developed technology for producing nanodiamonds based on the laser treating of specially prepared targets containing carbon soot mixed within hydrocarbon media. In contrast to the traditional technology of nanodiamonds synthesis by detonation of explosives in metal reactors, Ray's method is controllable, environment-friendly and non-hazardous. Ray-nanodiamonds are of much higher purity than detonation nanodiamonds available today in the market. In addition, the company has developed a new approach in the design of novel nanodiamond composite materials with desired properties. This technology is based on special nanodiamond surface modification, full disaggregation and covalent bonding between diamond nanocrystals and molecules of chosen material. Uniform introducing nanodiamonds within the medium results in increase of nanodiamond performance in each compound and in the possibility to reduce nanodiamond content and the cost of the composite material.

Reservoir data is difficult and expensive to obtain in horizontal sections; therefore, most completions are designed geometrically, with little or no concern for reservoir heterogeneity. This leads to dramatic variability in productivity between neighboring wells, often described as the statistical nature of the play. In this study, we demonstrate a reliable, cost effective methodology that empowers shale operators with reservoir data on every well. This technique will enable operators to engineer their designs by using reservoir data on every completion, resulting in significant productivity improvement without any significant increased cost or inconvenience. This methodology leverages commonly available drilling measurements (rate of penetration, weight on bit, rotational speed, hole diameter, flow rate, differential pressure and standpipe pressure) and mud motor parameters (Kn, Tmax, APmax) to derive Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE), using well established algorithms. The MSE parameter is then shown to be a good proxy for Unconfined Compressive Strength, a valuable reservoir parameter commonly used in frac designs. The MSE drives a facies-based answer product that enables the operator to position perforation clusters so that they breakdown at a common treating pressure, resulting in uniform fracture treatment within each frac stage. To date the technique has been applied successfully on over 60 wells. It is validated through comparison to openhole wireline logs and by comparing productivity to offsetting wells. The technique is shown to be superior to similar attempts done by using openhole wireline logs and production data confirms its accuracy and reliability. This study demonstrates that drilling data can be effectively used to derive reservoir parameters that lead to completion designs that produce superior production results. This methodology is the first application of drilling data to derive reservoir parameters that are then used to engineer a completion design. The significance of this development cannot be overstated, since it provides shale operators with the guidance they need to intelligently engineer their completions. The end result is significant productivity increases without any associated cost or inconvenience. © Copyright 2015, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Compressive strength; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Engineers; Flow rate; Infill drilling; Productivity; Water towers; Well logging; Differential pressures; Drilling measurements; Mechanical specific energies; Productivity improvements; Productivity increase; Reservoir heterogeneity; Reservoir parameters; Unconfined compressive strength; Shale",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992597894

The design, construction and operation of the production and air compression facilities are discussed. Under normal conditions, the water cut (BSW) in Quifa is above 90% and the ultimate primary recovery is less than 14%, which imposes strong design and operational challenges for an ISC project. The pilot project was operated from Nov 2011 to July 2014. A modified inverted-nine spot pattern was used, with all wells instrumented with pressure and temperature devices, as well as the majority of the surface equipment. Real-time monitoring and visualization was developed for proper surveillance of the pilot operation. This paper emphasizes about the surface facilities designed and selected to obtain the best performance of the process in the pilot. Since this was the first time that an ISC project was carried out in Colombia, there was no previous field performance data available about the quality of the produced fluids under ISC, so the main design data for the project were based on combustion tube tests performed for the Quifa field, and data from different projects worldwide available on technical literature. The design and operation of the surface facilities considered the effect of ISC on the mechanical integrity of the installations and the environment, with the implementation of the adequate piping class specification and HSE practices to comply with local and international standards due to the presence of H2S and acid water. Early detection systems were installed, which helped to operate the pilot within regulations and strict safety conditions. With this pilot project Pacific Rubiales Energy has built a valuable learning curve in the design, construction and management of an ISC processes, obtaining a unique experience for future projects of its kind.

This paper describes and investigates a concept for managing waste water and urine to simultaneously produce electric and heat energies as well as fresh water. It utilizes an original technique for aluminum activation to react spontaneously with water at room temperature to produce hydrogen on-site and on-demand. This reaction has further been proven to be effective also when using waste water and urine. Applying the hydrogen produced in a fuel cell, one obtains electric energy as well as fresh (drinking) water. The method was compared to the energy production technology of the Space Shuttle, which is based on storing hydrogen and oxygen in cryogenic tanks as a source of the reactants for the fuel cells for electric power generation. It is shown that the alternative concept presented here may provide improved safety, compactness (reduction of more than one half of the volume of the hydrogen storage system), and management of waste liquids for energy generation and drinking water production.

The measurement of these magnetic moments and the comparison with the values predicted by the standard model of particle physics is a way to test our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of our world. In some cases, such as for the electron, this comparison has resulted in confirmation of the standard model with incredible precision. In contrast, the magnetic moment of the muon has shown a longstanding disagreement in the measured and the predicted value. There is currently a tantalizing three-standard-deviation difference between the current best measurement (with a precision of 0.54 ppm) and the state-of-the-art standard model prediction. This represents one of the very few experimental hints for physics beyond the standard model. There are currently two major experimental efforts underway to improve the precision of the muon magnetic moment measurement. The first is an evolution of the E-821 experiment, originally located at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States. This is experiment, E-989, is located at Fermilab and will measure the spin precession rate of positive muons in a 14-m diameter storage ring using decay positrons. The goal of the experiment is to reduce the current experimental uncertainty by a factor of three. The experiment is currently being constructed and aims to start taking data in 2017. An alternative, and very complementary, experiment is being planned at J-PARC in Japan. This experiment, E-34, will utilize low energy, ultra-cold muons in a much smaller storage ring. This experiment aims for a similar precision to the Fermilab experiment and aims to begin data taking on a similar timescale. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons.",,"Digital storage; Magnetic moments; Storage rings; Brookhaven national laboratory; Experimental uncertainty; Fundamental building blocks; Fundamental properties; Moment measurements; Standard deviation; State of the art; The standard model; Charged particles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988632619

One of the realizations of the EIC, the eRHIC at BNL, plans to utilize the existing RHIC storage rings (polarized proton and other ion beams) and a high-intensity polarized electron facility to be built in the RHIC tunnel. Before the transition to eRHIC, RHIC itself still holds a huge potential for study leading to new insights into hadronic spin structure and cold nuclear matter with p+p and p+A collisions. An experiment based on the BaBar solenoid with barrel calorimeters and tracking detectors (sPHENIX, arXiv:1207.6378v2) and additional instrumentation in the proton-going direction (fsPHENIX) would realize this potential. By design, this detector is planned to smoothly evolve into a full-fledged EIC experiment at eRHIC with additional calorimeters, tracking, and particle identification systems (arXiv:1402.1209).

To contain and transport the natural gas, high-pressure vessels are needed. For better fuel efficiency, lightweight tanks are a key component and lightweight all-composite tanks are an alternative currently being considered. Conventionally, metals are used for such high-pressure applications. Type IV Aluminum tanks have been over-wrapped with fiber tows to achieve lightweight tanks. However, it would be ideal to replace these tanks with an all-composite construction. This project involves the design, manufacturing and testing of an all-composite liner-less CNG tank, which is considered to be a type V construction.

It is observed that pore size distribution has a significant effect on specific capacitance and bulk resistance of the composite material. BET and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data reveal a complex pore distribution for the materials. As the porosity of the composite material increased, its bulk resistance decreased by up to 400% and the specific capacitance increased by up to 200%. Ionic diffusion resistance associated with the pore structure for the porous composite decreased due to easy access of electrolyte ions through the pore length of the material. Specific capacitance of up to 34,240mF/g was obtained for the composite system at a scan rate of 50mV/s which remained fairly stable through the 50 cycle runs.

While such topics as energy storage and return have been studied in the athletic footwear area, there is no indication that these concepts have been explored for military footwear, other than in the context of energy harvesting. Also, while the provision of in-shoe foot orthoses (ISFOs) is commonplace in commercial athletic and outdoor footwear, similar devices that could be accommodated in an army boot have not received significant attention. The high rates of lower extremity injuries in the military point to the urgent need to close the footwear performance gap by providing military personnel with footwear and in-boot orthoses that incorporate up-to-date biomechanical knowledge and state-of-the-art materials. In this effort, a multidisciplinary team including the University of Delaware Center for Composite Materials, DIApedia LLC and the University of Washington, developed a novel design of an advanced modular In-Shoe Foot Orthosis (ISFO) and Energy Storage and Return Orthotic (ESRO) device within a new boot container assembly. The innovative boot housing and modular foot orthosis design is aimed at reducing footwear weight and loading rates while improving comfort, flexibility and energy return. This paper presents the various designs considered for the ESRO device including FE simulations and experimental test data that shows significant performance improvements over the current combat boot design. The footwear technology developed as part of this effort can be adapted and utilized by all active military personnel in all divisions who are issued standard military footwear to reduce injuries from overuse and potentially protect at-risk feet with a custom orthosis design.

Ancillary services, renewable energy integration and transmission support are promising for near term growth while CES is most promising for long- Term growth in grid energy storage. Near- Term growth will come from past investments as well as the emergence of new policies to promote the market. The long- Term market for storage will depend on the ability of suppliers to reduce costs and policies to help formalize application markets.

Although, BOPP films offer extremely low loss, stable capacitance and long life at ambient temperature; the energy density in these films is limited to 2.4 J/cc at film level, which leads to large capacitor volume. Many other disadvantages include DC conduction losses at high temperature leading to capacitor failure. Increased energy density decreases the life expectancy exponentially. Increased energy density capability, high temperature stability while maintaining low losses is critical in pulsed power capacitors.

Raman spectroscopic techniques can help characterize the vibrational phonon modes of nanomaterials with little in the way of sample preparation, making it an ideal tool for device characterization. The Stokes Raman spectra of carbon nanotubes and tungsten oxide were recorded with a DXR Smart Raman spectrometer over a temperature range of 27-200 degrees Celsius. The Raman spectra of SWCNTs were used to demonstrate the bond softening and resultant red-shifting of the various Raman peaks of SWCNTs. The thermal changes in the spectra were used to characterize the nanomaterial samples with an eye to future applications for energy storage (using carbon nanotubes) and for toxic gas sensing (using tungsten oxide). The observed and modeled red-shifting of the Raman frequencies and broadening of the peak widths are being used to better understand the thermo-mechanical response of the nanomaterials for potential device applications at elevated temperatures.","Carbon nanotube; Chirality; Radial breathing mode; Raman spectroscopy; Tungsten oxide","Carbon nanotubes; Characterization; Chemical detection; Chirality; Energy storage; Gas detectors; Metals; Nanostructured materials; Nanotubes; Oxides; Raman scattering; Raman spectroscopy; Spectrometers; Tungsten; Tungsten compounds; Yarn; Device characterization; Gas sensing applications; Metal oxide nanomaterials; Potential device applications; Radial breathing mode; Resonant Raman Spectroscopy; Thermo-mechanical response; Tungsten oxide; Gas sensing electrodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983341721

The United States Department of Energy Used Fuel Disposition Campaign is examining the feasibility of direct disposal of dual-purpose (storage and transportation) canisters (DPCs) in a geological repository. One of the major technical challenges for direct disposal is the ability to demonstrate the subcriticality of the DPCs loaded with SNF for the repository performance period (e.g., 10,000 years or more) as the DPCs may undergo degradation over time. Specifically, groundwater ingress into the DPC (i.e., flooding) could allow the system to achieve criticality in scenarios where the neutron absorber plates in the DPC basket have degraded. However, as was shown by Banerjee et al., some aqueous species in the groundwater provide noticeable reactivity reduction for these systems. For certain amounts of particular aqueous species (e.g., chlorine, lithium) in the groundwater, subcriticality can be demonstrated even for DPCs with complete degradation of the neutron absorber plates or a degraded fuel basket configuration. It has been demonstrated that chlorine is the leading impurity, as indicated by significant neutron absorption in the water that is available in reasonable quantities for the deep geological repository media under consideration. This paper presents the results of an investigation of the available integral experiments worldwide that could be used to validate DPC disposal criticality evaluations, including credit for chlorine. Due to the small number of applicable critical configurations, validation through traditional trending analysis was not possible. The bias in the eigenvalue of the application systems due only to the chlorine was calculated using TSURFER analysis and found to be on the order of 100 percent mille (1 pcm = 10-5 keff). This study investigated the design of a series of critical configurations with varying amounts of chlorine to address validation gaps. Such integral experiments would support the crediting of the chlorine neutron-absorption properties in groundwater and the demonstration of subcriticality for DPCs in deep geologic repositories with sufficient chlorine availability.","Chlorine; Disposition; Groundwater; Validation","Criticality (nuclear fission); Degradation; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Fuel storage; Fuels; Geological repositories; Geology; Groundwater; Neutron absorption; Neutrons; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive waste encapsulation; Radioactive wastes; Water absorption; Criticality evaluations; Deep geologic repositories; Deep geological repository; Disposition; Spent nuclear fuel management; Storage and transportations; United states department of energies; Validation; Chlorine",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983341184

The growth in resistance is related to the capacity fading of the cell. Using a model of series resistors, the total internal ionic resistance over cycling performance is expressed and compared for various nanostructured cathodes at different rates. It has been shown that SEI layer is the most significant factor in increasing of ionic resistance at the begiiming of the battery aging, while electrode degradation and other phenomena are dominating resistance rise over higher cycles.

In this paper, we presented a novel Nano-Electrical-Mechanical Switch (NEMS), which is developed to address some intrinsic limitations of the CMOS technology due to the feature size shrinking, such as short channel effects, sub threshold leakage, gate tunneling, band to band tunneling current and so on. Theoretical calculation and FEA software simulation have been done to model the NEMS device. To demonstrate the advantages of the novel NEMS devices, a Ternary Content Addressable Memory cell is implemented with only 6 NEMS devices, compared with 12 transistors in the traditional CMOS technology. The reduced number of devices decreases the delay time, realized a better yield and better operation margins. The static and dynamic powers of this NEMS Ternary Content Addressable Memory cell are also calculated. The leakage power of the NEMS TCAM is almost zero. The dynamic power consumption is shown much lower than the TSMC 0.13 um CMOS devices.

With the increasing need for storage, due to elimination of reprocessing as a viable alternative, SFPs with high-density racks required neutron absorber materials to control reactivity and maintain criticality safety margins. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) conducted an industry wide survey in 2013 and the survey was updated recently based on additional utility data provided by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). The survey results show that about one-quarter of the pools in the United States either do not have neutron absorber material in the SFP or do not credit it even when it is present. Also, about half of the plants in the U.S. use BORAL® as the neutron absorber material followed by Metamic, Carborundum, Alcan, and borated stainless steel. For neutron absorber monitoring, the majority of the plants rely on a coupon testing program. However, for those plants that never installed coupons or have exhausted their supply of coupons from coupon sampling, insitu measurements at periodic intervals can be performed to determine the status of the neutron absorber. In this paper, an overview of the types of neutron absorber materials used in SFPs, the distribution of absorber material use by material type, types of monitoring programs as part of aging management programs, operational experience to date with different absorber materials based on monitoring programs, and industry initiatives toward addressing long-term performance issues related to neutron absorber material degradation and monitoring are presented.","Criticality; Neutron absorber materials; Spent fuel pools","Criticality (nuclear fission); Digital storage; Fuel storage; Fuels; Lakes; Neutron absorption; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Silicon carbide; Software testing; Spent fuels; Stainless steel; Surveys; Testing; Aging management programs; Borated stainless steel; Electric Power Research Institute; Long term performance; Neutron absorber material; Nuclear Energy Institute; Operational experience; Spent fuel pools; Neutrons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983268949

The DNFSB was concerned over the lack of capability management of practical experience pertinent to avoiding a criticality accident in non-reactor environments. One of the specific recommendations of 1997-2 was to ""Identify a core group of criticality experts experienced in the theoretical and experimental aspects of neutron chain reactions to advise on the above steps and assist in resolving future technical issues"". The CSSG, a group of 10 recognized experts in criticality safety, was chartered in late 1997 to address the recommendation. Members of the CSSG are drawn from DOE employees and contractor staff to provide advice and technical support to help meet the criticality safety needs of DOE missions, including stockpile stewardship, materials stabilization, transportation, storage, facilities lifecycle (design through decommissioning), and waste disposal.

This project includes two phases. The first phase (1) investigates applicability of peak reactivity methods currently used in spent fuel pools (SFPs) to storage and transportation systems and (2) evaluates validation of both reactivity (keff) calculations and burnup credit nuclide concentrations within these methods. The second phase will focus on extending burnup credit beyond peak reactivity. This paper documents the first phase, including an analysis of lattice design parameters and depletion effects, as well as both validation components. Initial efforts related to extended burnup credit are discussed in a companion paper. Peak reactivity analyses have been used in criticality analyses for licensing of BWR fuel in SFPs over the last 20 years. These analyses typically combine credit for the gadolinium burnable absorber present in the fuel with a modest amount of burnup credit. Gadolinium burnable absorbers are used in BWR assemblies to control core reactivity. The burnable absorber significantly reduces assembly reactivity at beginning of life, potentially leading to significant increases in assembly reactivity for burnups less than 15-20 GWd/MTU. The reactivity of each fuel lattice is dependent on gadolinium loading. The number of gadolinium-bearing fuel pins lowers initial lattice reactivity, but it has a small impact on the burnup and reactivity of the peak. The gadolinium concentration in each pin has a small impact on initial lattice reactivity but a significant effect on the reactivity of the peak and the burnup at which the peak occurs. The importance of the lattice parameters and depletion conditions are primarily determined by their impact on the gadolinium depletion. Criticality code validation for BWR burnup credit at peak reactivity requires a different set of experiments than for pressurized-water reactor burnup credit analysis because of differences in actinide compositions, presence of residual gadolinium absorber, and lower fission product concentrations. A survey of available critical experiments is presented along with a sample criticality code validation and determination of undercoverage penalties for some nuclides. The validation of depleted fuel compositions at peak reactivity presents many challenges which largely result from a lack of radiochemical assay data applicable to BWR fuel in this burnup range. In addition, none of the existing low burnup measurement data include residual gadolinium measurements. An example bias and uncertainty associated with validation of actinide-only fuel compositions is presented.","BWR burnup credit; Peak reactivity; Spent nuclear fuel; Storage; Transportation","Beam plasma interactions; Boiling water reactors; Criticality (nuclear fission); Digital storage; Energy storage; Fission products; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gadolinium; Isotopes; Pressurized water reactors; Radioactive wastes; Transportation; Boiling water reactor (BWR); Burn up; Nuclide concentrations; Oak ridge National Laboratory; Product concentration; Spent nuclear fuels; Storage and transportations; United states nuclear regulatory commissions; Reactivity (nuclear)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983247617

Experimental tests were done to corroborate the system's linearity; two speakers are used instead of musicians and audio is recorded with conventional techniques and model of Overlay of Acoustic Sources. The audios were discretized using MATLAB in order to evaluate their physical parameters and the correlation coefficients between energy, maximum values, minimum values, frequency response, the zero crossing rate and spatiality of recordings. All the research sought to answer the question: if is it possible to get an audio signal able to imitate the signal's characteristics captured in real time in a recording by takes?

Methane is the predominant component of natural gas. Significant efforts have been undertaken in the past for the separation, storage and transportation of methane. However, the following challenges remain: (i) materials with high selectivity for methane separation from natural gas often do not have high-deliverable capacity for storage, and (ii) materials with high-deliverable capacity for methane storage often do not have high selectivity for separation. In this work, we develop a combined separation and storage (CSS) technology to purify and store methane with both high selectivity and high deliverable capacity at the same pressure in the same vessel, thereby essentially eliminating the need for a separate purification process. The proposed method is based on microporous materials (e.g., zeolites). While the stateof-the-art research considers materials for methane separation or storage separately, we propose a technology and uncover novel materials which simultaneously separate and store methane from natural gas. Using a multi-scale systems engineering approach, we have designed a CSS process that takes a mixture of CH4/N2 as feed, and store CH4 inside an adsorbent-packed column with while venting the purge gas (N2). We have simulated the dynamic adsorption and breakthrough of methane to identify the extent of storage and purity achieved for a given adsorbent in this work. Lastly, we have identified several zeolites as candidate materials for CSS technology with suitable separation selectivity and storage capacity.",,"Air purification; Fossil fuels; Gas adsorption; Gases; Methane; Natural gas; Proven reserves; Purification; Separation; Storage (materials); Zeolites; Candidate materials; Dynamic adsorption; High selectivity; Multi-scale system; Purification process; Separation selectivity; State of the art; Storage and transportations; Microporous materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983140507

Consequently, the cost is highly affected by environmentally related factors. Energy efficiency is one of the main factors, which together with waste management, affect manufacturing decisions. The complexity and diversity of the factors that determine energy efficiency require intelligent systems for their optimization at each ""manufacturing level"". Manufacturing decisions should be taken as fast as possible and with the highest possible accuracy. Artificial intelligence/machine learning tools have made significant progress during the last decade and are suitable for such applications. The main objective of the current study is that an architecture for the development of a networked, online, decision support tool, be provided towards achieving sustainable value chain management. The main idea behind the proposed design is that stakeholders be assisted in taking decisions towards improving the energy and eco-efficiency of the entire value chain or parts of it. This is suggested within the context of a multi-objective optimization procedure, taking into account other important decision making attributes, such as flexibility, quality and time for the final reduction in the overall cost. This architecture incorporates real time information modules that interact with online monitoring systems, using any available information within the value chain and the existing IT tools. A partial realization of the proposed idea is implemented in the form of a user friendly software tool (the MetaCAM tool). This based, decision support tool aiming to optimize a current production line or to propose alternatives for the manufacturing of a product. The tool performs optimization based on a set of predefined criteria, namely energy, waste, cost and time. For each of these criteria, the end-user selects the desired weight factor in order to drive the optimization procedure accordingly. The tool presents the characteristics of the setup of the proposed optimized line and maintains all used data and calculations in order to be reused when necessary.. For the tool's validation, three real case studies from different industrial sectors have been used. The first case study comes from the domestic appliances sector (refrigerator door panel), the second one from the automotive sector (a two seat bench for light commercial vehicles) and finally, the third case study derives from the aeronautics sector and deals with the production of the loading ramp hinge of a military aircraft.

The motivation for this using device was based on an exergy analysis and the second law efficiency. Previous analysis illustrated how the exergy analysis could be used to identify the irreversibilities in the system and indicated modifications to increase the performance of the tray design desalinator for the sensible energy content of the discharge. The exergy related to the higher concentration level of the discharge is now investigated for a RED device. These analyses are extended to investigate the potential of using the higher salinity of the out flowing brine to produce electrical energy by using the reversed electrodialysis (RED) process. The RED process which converts 70-80% of the change in Gibbs energy to electricity uses the concentrated brine to produce electrical power while the freshwater is being produced. The analysis demonstrates it is possible to produce a maximum electrical output of 0.32 kJ/kg for the expected concentration differences.

The objective of the analysis was to determine whether the addition of another TES tank would be economically justified under the present electric rate structure and cooling load demand of the campus. The analysis was done: (i) using blended on-peak and off-peak energy rates (an approach commonly adopted due to its simplicity for evaluating different system alternatives and operating strategies meant to reduce cost and/or energy use), and (ii) using the actual electric rate structure which includes energy and demand charges. The latter rate structure suggests a 42 year payback, while the former rates predicted a payback period of over 100 years. If the incremental avoided cost of an additional chiller (to meet anticipated increases in cooling loads) is included in the economic analysis, the payback will be greatly reduced from the 42 year payback, and make this option a design choice meriting further investigation. The study also suggests a way of generating indifference plots which provide insights into how future changes in the electric rate structure would impact the payback period. The methodology adopted in this study would serve as a case study example to energy analysts evaluating TES systems as a design option for meeting increasing cooling demand and reducing costs in an existing building or campus facility.

Any battery pack alone cannot achieve its optimal performance unless there is a robust and efficient energy management system, commonly known as battery management system or BMS. The Lithium-Ion charger is a voltagelimiting device that is similar to the lead acid system. The difference lies in a higher cell voltage; tighter voltage tolerance and the absence of trickle or float charge at full charge. In this work, we propose the design of a novel optimal strategy for charging the battery that better suits the battery performance. A performance index is defined that aims at minimizing the effort of regeneration along with a minimum deviation from the rated maximum thresholds for cell temperature and charging current. A more realistic model based on battery electrochemistry is used for the optimal algorithm design as opposed to equivalent circuit models. To solve the optimization problem, Pontryagin's principle is used which is very effective for constrained optimization problems with both state and input constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal charging algorithm is capable of shortening the charging time of a Lithium Ion cell while maintaining the temperature constraint when compared with the standard constant current charging.

Therefore, the accumulation capacity of sensible heat is proportional to the mass storage and the increase of temperature, so that an increase in the requirements involves a bigger tank volume. Phase change materials (PCM) stored energy at constant temperature (or at least in a fairly narrow range of temperature) while the phase change is produced, they are presented as an alternative to compensate the solar heat supply periods and the thermal demand with a better heat accumulation per volume unit. In contrast, these systems require more complicated thermal analysis and designs than the traditional systems by sensible heat with a single phase. The selection of PCM, its content and location on the device will have a determining effect on the overall performance of the solar collector. This implies that the heat exchanger must be designed for each specific application. Currently, there are no commercial devices for heating water by solar energy using thermal accumulation with PCM. However, preliminary studies in lab scale have shown significant increases in efficiencies and supply capacity. Several authors have been performed experimental and numerical studies in solar collectors including PCM technology, but, due to the complexity of the phenomena and the high consumptions of resources for both approaches, it has not been possible to evaluate different configurations that lead to optimized designs for selection, location and amount of PCM. This fact shows the need to develop simplified models that consider the main physical phenomena in the operation, in order to support the experimental and numerical techniques to determine the comprehensive thermal behavior. This kind of models can be used to estimate the performance for different configurations and boundary conditions in a fast way, to make possible in a posterior stage a detailed evaluation with numerical analysis or an experimental technique. In this paper, a simplified comprehensive model for assessing thermal performance of a flat-plate solar collector with PCM is presented with incorporation of specialized semiempirical correlations. The model takes into account the main thermodynamic and heat transfer processes in the device, including the internal and external convection effects, conduction, solar radiation analysis, radiation, losses and interactions between surfaces, material solid-liquid phase change and conjugated problems in gas-liquid-solid zones. Due to the numerous existing design alternatives, consideration of an excessive number of options in the final design can lead to long development times and process inefficiencies. Therefore, a methodology of design that includes fast calculations of the main thermal parameters is highly regarded, since this can reduce the number of study cases and thus obtain optimal configurations from the simplified models. The performance of the reduced model, including a sensibility analysis of several input data, is compared qualitatively with results obtained in a traditional collector for a typical cycle available in bibliography. Integrated simplified models are developed to perform a coarse preliminary design of flat solar collectors with incorporation of PCM technology, and thus serve as a pre-evaluator of the different configurations.

Heat pump performance can be further enhanced by integrating a solar thermal unit to provide hot water and subsidize space heating. This paper presents numerically examined energy feasibility study of a solar driven heat pump system for a low energy residence, where a flat plate solar collector served as the sole low temperature heat source. A parametric study on the ambient-tosolar fluid heat transfer coefficient has been conducted to determine the required solar collector heat transfer characteristics in this system. Solar collector area and storage tank volume were varied to investigate their impact on the system performance. A new performance indicator availability was defined to assess the contribution of the solar collector as low temperature energy source of the heat pump. Results showed that the use of a solar collector as low temperature heat source was feasible if its heat transfer rate (UA-value) was 200 W/K or higher. Achievement of this value with a realistic solar collector area (A-value) required an increase of the overall ambient-to-solar fluid heat transfer coefficient (U-value) with a factor of 6 to 8 compared to the base case with only natural convection heat exchange between solar collector cover and ambient.

A 20 K cryocooler capable of 20 W of refrigeration would offer a significant mass savings in cryogen storage by facilitating propellant zero boil-off and hence long term cryogen storage, which would provide scope for long duration missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). For direct current (DC) type cryocoolers, as well as open cycle liquefaction systems, effective recuperative heat exchange is a highly critical function. Coefficient of Performance (COP) of cryocoolers is greatly sensitive to heat recuperator effectiveness, more so than to the efficiencies of other key components such as compressor, turbine and cold head. A heat recuperator with high effectiveness is extremely important for achieving a high COP for cryocoolers. Current recuperators tend to be the heaviest and largest components in space cooling systems. Primary issues in miniaturization of a heat recuperator that adversely affect the performance are the longitudinal/axial heat conduction in the wall and insufficient flow length (size) to achieve complete heat transfer between the hot and cold fluids. Further, frictional pressure drops are usually large as a result of decreased size of the flow channels. In addition, it is worth noting that, in general, attempts to improve heat transfer would almost always result in increasing the pressure drop (or otherwise, attempts to decrease pressure drop usually result in lowering the heat transfer performance). This paper discusses a split wavy channel heat recuperator design to overcome the above mentioned technical showstoppers. A split wavy channel design has the advantage of increased flow length and improved heat transfer in the same form factor as a heat exchanger with straight channels without causing a large increase in the pressure drop. So far, this concept has never been studied and exploited for a cryogenic heat recuperator. High fidelity numerical simulations were used to study the three-dimensional flow of working fluid through hot and cold wavy channels of the heat recuperator separated by a wall. A two channel scheme was modeled for the analysis. Wavy geometry consisting of two sinusoidal parallel channels was built in a pre-processor for the solver. Governing equations in mass, momentum and energy at steady-state were implicitly solved on a computational grid using a commercial finite element solver to obtain the pressure, velocity and temperature fields. The developed numerical model was employed to perform a systematic parametric study. Two working fluids (helium and nitrogen) were considered addressing both liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellant boil-off temperatures. Wavy wall amplitude was varied between 125 μm, 250 μm, and 500 μm with a goal of identifying optimal configuration that will have maximum effectiveness for the size. Entrance Reynolds numbers of 300 and 600 were considered. The performance of various configurations were compared using a performance factor, and traditional recuperator effectiveness. The results showed that wavy channels, due to a unique fundamental physical phenomenon of geometry governed boundary layer thinning, help in augmenting heat transfer and in realizing a compact cryogenic heat exchanger. An interesting observation was that wavy channels which were previously found by researchers to enhance heat transfer substantially (up to 55% or more) at room temperature for liquids were found to improve heat transfer performance only by up to 10% for gases at cryogenic temperatures, which could be attributed to the drastic variation in thermo-physical properties of gases at these temperatures suggesting the consideration of a different design methodology compared to design for room temperature applications. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Boundary layers; Cold working; Cooling; Cooling systems; Cryogenic equipment; Cryogenics; Design; Drops; Explosives; Fluids; Heat conduction; Heat exchangers; High pressure effects; Hot working; Liquefied gases; Liquids; NASA; Numerical models; Orbits; Pressure drop; Propellants; Recuperators; Reynolds number; Walls (structural partitions); Coefficient of Performance; Cryogenic applications; Frictional pressure drops; Heat transfer performance; Recuperative heat exchange; Temperature applications; Thermo-physical property; Velocity and temperature fields; Heat transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982976331

Coolant flow over the hot nuclear fuel rods often gets stalled during major accidents resulting in high temperature levels. These elevated temperature levels can potentially melt the fuel rod material and cause the release of radioactive gases. Research activities, both numerical and experimental in nature to explore these rare but potentially catastrophic possibilities have resulted in sophisticated numerical codes capable of simulating the various post-accident scenarios. These codes, although reasonably accurate and reliable have steep learning curves and are not often very user-friendly. A fast and accurate prediction of the critical temperature conditions using popular commercially available software packages is the subject of current study. Results from this parametric study of temperature distribution over a partially cooled fuel rod carried out using ANSYS as the numerical analysis tool is reported. Nuclear fuel rods being inadequately cooled inside a stagnant pool of coolant water in an accident scenario resulting in disrupted coolant flow has been simulated. This situation can arise within the reactor (design-basis accidents) or in the waste-fuel storage (as faced in Fukushima). In these situations, the fuel rod is often left partially immersed in the coolant water resulting in immersed portion of the rod cooled by water and the exposed portion cooled by air leading to non-uniform and improper cooling of the system. Realistic dimensions and materials as in commercial nuclear fuel rod have been used in the study. Taking advantage of the symmetry, an axisymmetric radial plane sliced longitudinally has been analyzed. Variations in the tangential direction have been neglected. The heat transfer problem uses homogeneous convective boundary conditions and assumes temperature dependent thermal conductivity. The parameters varied are the coolant level and the heat generation rate inside the fuel rod. A macro to automatically capture the transients in the temperatures was written in ANSYS (a finite element package). The governing energy equations were implicitly solved using finite volume scheme in MATLAB. ANSYS results are in close agreement with those obtained using MATLAB. The centerline temperature of the fuel rod shows a sharp rise below a certain coolant level. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Accidents; Coolants; Finite element method; Fuels; Heat transfer; MATLAB; Nuclear fuel elements; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Numerical analysis; Temperature; Temperature distribution; Thermal conductivity; Convective boundary conditions; Design basis accidents; Finite element packages; Finite volume schemes; Heat transfer problems; Tangential directions; Temperature-dependent thermal conductivity; Transient temperature distributions; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982975726

In this work, the development of a virtual platform to evaluate the performance of an electrical vehicle is presented and applied to the study of public urban transportation. The aim is to analyze the requirements and optimize specifications for a light weight, energy efficient, autonomous vehicle without energy supply along the trajectory, except in the stations. Virtual platforms for vehicle performance have been developed before, and in many cases characteristic velocity profiles are used as a reference, according to the traffic environment in which the vehicle will operate. Vehicle analysis and design is focused on feasibility of the vehicle to be able to follow the prescribed velocity profile. In the present study, the evaluation is instead based on the cost/benefit relationship for an urban transport vehicle on traffic-free trajectories, enabling to adjust and optimize the velocity profiles in order to optimize the energy use while minimizing travel time. Therefore, the virtual platform is focused on the calculation of the net energy usage, the travel time and the system cost corresponding to an electrical vehicle with different battery and ultra-capacitor energy storage capacities, regeneration and storage of brake energy and an automatic governor for autonomous vehicle control. The influence of design parameters, such as the installed motor power, energy storage capacity, vehicle weight, passenger load and vehicle control strategy on the time schedule and energy efficiency is studied. However, the effort does not aim for a straight forward optimization of efficiency or minimization of travel time. In fact, energy optimization often conflicts with the travel time optimization. Therefore, both are analyzed simultaneously in order to assist in the search for an optimum compromise. In addition, the results are interpreted in terms of the overall obtained benefits of travel time reduction or optimization of the energy use, in contrast with the corresponding increment of the investment cost of the vehicle related to the implementation of the studied parameter variation. Specific trajectory profiles, including height profiles can be defined for optimization of the vehicle system for application in specific locations with specific geographic conditions.

Energy efficiency can be enhanced through recovery of the kinetic energy lost in the form of waste heat during braking. The kinetic energy could be converted into a reusable energy source and aid in acceleration, hence the braking system would contribute to improving the overall efficiency of a vehicle. Hydraulic- Pneumatic Regenerative Braking (HPRB) systems are a hybrid drive system that works in tandem with a vehicle's engine and drivetrain to improve efficiency and fuel-economy. A HPRB system functions by recovering the energy typically lost to heat during vehicle braking, and storing this energy as a reusable source that can propel a vehicle from a stop. The major advantages of a HPRB system are that a vehicle would not require its engine to run during braking to stop, nor would the engine be required to accelerate the vehicle initially from a stop. The benefit realized by this system is an increase in fuelefficiency, reduced vehicle emissions, and overall financial savings. An HPRB system AIDS in slowing a vehicle by creating a drag on the driveline as it recovers and stores energy during braking. Therefore, HPRB system operation reduces wear by minimizing the amount of work performed by the brake pads and rotors An experimental investigation of Hydraulic-Pneumatic Regenerative Braking (HPRB) system was conducted to measure the system's overall efficiency and available power output. The HPRB in this study is a 1/10th lab-scale model of a light-duty four wheel vehicle. The design/size was based on a 3500 lbs light-duty four wheel vehicle with an estimated passenger weight of 500 lbs. It was assumed that the vehicle can accelerate from 0 - 15 mph in 2 seconds. The aim of this work is to examine the effect of heat losses due to irreversibility on energy recovery. The experimental facility consisted of a hydraulic pump, two hydraulic-pneumatic accumulators, solenoid and relief valves, and data acquisition system. The HPRB system did not include any driveline components necessary to attach this system onto a vehicle's chassis rather an electric motor was used to drive the pump and simulate the power input to the system from a spinning drive shaft. Pressure transducers, Hall effects sensor, and thermocouples were installed at suction and discharge sections of the hydraulic and pneumatic components to measure hydrodynamic and thermos-physical properties. The measured data were used to determine the system's energy recovery and power delivery efficiency. Results showed that the HPRB system is capable of recovering 47% of the energy input to the system during charging, and 64% efficient in power output during discharging with an input and output of 0.33 and 0.21 horsepower respectively.

The proliferation of these connected low-power devices will result in a data explosion that will significantly increase data transmission costs with respect to energy consumed and latency. Edge computing performs computations at the edge nodes prior to data transmission to interpret and/or utilize the data, thus reducing transmission costs. In this work, we seek to understand the interactions between IoT applications' execution characteristics (e.g., compute/memory intensity, cache miss rates, etc.) and the edge nodes' microarchitectural characteristics (e.g., clock frequency, memory capacity, etc.) for efficient and effective edge computing. Thus, we present a broad and tractable IoT application classification methodology and using this classification, we analyze the microarchitectural characteristics of a wide range of state-of-the - Art embedded system microprocessors and evaluate the microprocessors' applicability to IoT computation using various evaluation metrics. We also investigate and quantify the impact of leakage power reduction on the overall energy consumption across different architectures. Our work provides insights into the microarchitectural characteristics' impact on system performance and efficiency for various IoT application requirements.

The proposed system is low-cost and hybridizes compressed air and pumped-storage approaches that will allow for the off-peak storage of intermittent renewable energy for use during peak times. A detailed control-volume energy analysis of the system is carried out, yielding a set of coupled differential equations which are discretized using a finite difference scheme and used to model the transient response during charging and discharging. The energy analysis includes coupled heat transfer and pressure drop analysis used to predict system losses for more accurate round trip efficiency (RTE) calculations and specific energy density (ED) predictions. Preliminary analysis of the current prototype indicates an electric-to-electric RTEE of 66% (corresponding to shaft-to-shaft mechanical RTEM of 78%) and ED of 2.5 MJ/m3 of air, given initial air volume and pressure of 2 m3 and 70 bar. The electric power output ranges from a max of 2.5 kW to a min of 1.2 kW and the output current ranges from a max of approximately 21 amps to approximately 10 amps at 120 V, 60 Hz dispatchable electricity, over a period of approximately 50 minutes. Additionally, it is shown that heat transfer enhancement to the point of a 5-fold increase in air heat transfer rates results in a near 5% improvement in RTEE (70% considering all component losses). Additional component efficiency improvements and efficiency gains due to system scale-up could see higher achievable RTEs.

The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) is helping resolve technical concerns with the WTP, which are related to piping erosion/corrosion (wear). SRNL is assisting in the design of a flow loop to obtain long term wear rates that will use prototypic simulant chemistry, operating conditions, and materials. The challenge is to accurately measure slurry wear to a pipe wall thickness tolerance of 47 microns/year anywhere in the test flow loop in a timely manner. A first step in such a test is to secure knowledge of high wear locations so that highly sensitive measurement techniques can be incorporated and properly located. Literature exists to help locate such wear locations in pipe and pipe fittings but most of the information deals with slurry flows that have significantly different velocities, different flows steams, e.g., steam, gas-liquid-solids, or made from different materials. To better estimate these high wear rate locations under the WTP conditions a separate pre-test flow loop was constructed and operated. This loop is referred to as the paint loop because it was internally coated with paint, which wears faster than the steel pipe, when a solids-laden slurry is circulated. The test flow conditions were a slurry velocity of 4 m/s in a 0.0762 -m (3-inch) Schedule 40 pipe system, resulting in Reynolds number just above 3 × 105, i.e., turbulent flow at a temperature of 25°C. The slurry was a mixture of water and sand, d50 ~ 199 microns.

As a means to extend the battery life of electronic equipment while moving away from the power grid and extra battery storage, a power generating unit is needed. Current approaches are to carry the anticipated number of spare batteries, to use solar cells or any number of small generating thermionic devices. While each of these have a place in the market, they also have negative cost, size, and weight drawbacks.

The device is a lightweight, collapsible wind turbine constructed of rugged materials to be used on camp sites, remote locations etc. and carried within a pack for travel. It is of a size and weight to be part of an emergency or survival pack. The wind turbine, in its preferred embodiment, is a self-starting/sustaining device that starts at low wind speeds so no monitoring or priming of the device is necessary.

Energy Storage systems are required to enable the renewable energy sources to continuously generate energy for the power grid. Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is one of the most promising forms of energy storage due to simplicity and economic reasons. However, heat transfer is a well-known problem of most TES systems that utilize solid state or phase change. Insufficient heat transfer impairs the functionality of the system by imposing an upper limit on the power generation. Isochoric thermal energy storage system is suggested as a low-cost alternative for saltbased thermal energy storage systems. The isochoric thermal energy storage systems utilize a liquid storage medium and benefit from enhanced heat transfer due to the presence of buoyancy-driven flows. In this study, the effect of buoyancydriven flows on the heat transfer characteristics of an Isochoric Thermal Energy Storage system is studied computationally. The storage fluid is molten elemental sulfur which has promising cost benefits. For this study, the storage fluid is stored in horizontal storage tubes. A computational model was developed to study the effect of buoyancy-driven flow and natural convection heat transfer on the charge/discharge times. The computational model is developed using an unsteady Finite Volume Method to model the transient heat transfer from the constanterature tube wall to the storage fluid. The results of this study show that the heat transfer process in Isochoric thermal energy storage system is dominated by natural convection and the buoyancy-driven flow reduces the charge time of the storage tube by 72-93%.

The test vessel system, experimental procedure and results, and analytical solutions are discussed. The phase-change material (PCM) is contained in a vertically oriented test cylinder that is cooled at its outside boundary, resulting in radially inward freezing. Detailed quantitative time-dependent volumetric temperature distributions and freeze-front motion and shape data were experimentally obtained. To fully understand the behavior of the eicosane, four freezing tests were performed with different temperature set points as low as 10°C. In the analysis, results of a test in which molten eicosane, initially at 50°C, was solidified and brought to a final temperature of 10°C are presented. In the freezing case study, a mathematical model based on a one-dimensional analysis, which considered heat conduction as the only mode of heat transfer was developed. The phase-change medium, 99% pure eicosane (C20H42) was chosen as the PCM. Eicosane is desirable because its fusion temperature is just slightly higher than ambient temperature (36.5°C), which is convenient for phase-change experimentation. Low-temperature heating can be used to melt the PCM and ambient-temperature cooling can be used to re-freeze it. To evaluate the inward radius of fusion, several analytical and experimental approaches were considered. These approaches were (1) experimental method; (2) conduction model; (3) integral method; and (4) cumulative heat transfer method. Comparison of these methods reveals excellent agreement. In most cases, the heat transfer estimated from the freezing-front analysis was slightly higher than the heat transfer evaluated from the time-series data. The largest discrepancy occurs at fifty minutes into the experiment (10.7%).

GNP having a two dimensional structure is composed of several layers of graphite nanocrystals stacked together. GNP is expected to provide better reinforcing effect in polymer matrix composites as a nanofiller along with greatly improved mechanical and thermal properties due to its planar structure and ultrahigh aspect ratio. GNP is also considered to be the novel nanofiller due to its exceptional functionalities, high mechanical strength, chemical stability, abundance in nature, and cost effectiveness. Moreover, it possesses an extremely high-specific surface area which carries a high level of transferring stress across the interface and provides higher reinforcement than carbon nanotubes (CNT) in polymer composites. Hence, this research has been focused on the reinforcing effect of the aminefunctionalized GNP on mechanical, viscoelastic, and thermal properties of the epoxy resin-EPON 828 composite. Amine functionalized GNP was infused in EPON 828 at different loadings including 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 wt% as a reinforcing agent. GNP was infused into epoxy resin Epon 828 Part-A using a high intensity ultrasonic liquid processor followed by a three roll milling processor for better dispersion. The GNP/epoxy mixture was then mixed with the curing agent Epikure 3223 according to the stoichiometric ratio (Part A: Part B = 12:1). The mixture was then placed in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 10 m to ensure the complete removal of entrapped bubbles and thus reduce the chance of void formation. The asprepared resin mixture was then poured in rubber molds to prepare samples for mechanical, viscoelastic, and thermal characterization according to ASTM standards. Molds containing liquid epoxy nanocomposites were then kept in the vacuum oven at room temperature for seven days to confirm full curing of the samples according to the manufacturer's suggestion. Similarly, neat epoxy samples were fabricated to obtain its baseline properties through mechanical, viscoelastic, and thermal characterization and compare these properties with those of nanophased ones. The reinforcing effect of the aminefunctionalized GNP on the epoxy was characterized through mechanical, viscoelastic, and thermal analyses. Fracture morphology of mechanically tested samples was evaluated through scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) study. The mechanical properties were determined through flexure test according to the ASTM standard. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) were performed to analyze viscoelastic and thermal performances of the composite. In all cases, the 0.4 wt% GNP infused epoxy nanocomposite exhibited the best properties. The 0.4 wt% GNP-loaded epoxy sample showed 20% and 40% improvement in flexure strength and modulus, respectively. Moreover, 16% improvement in the storage modulus and 37% decrease in the coefficient of thermal expansion were observed due to the integration of GNP reinforcement into the epoxy system. Scanning electronic micrographs exhibited smooth fracture surface for the neat sample, whereas the roughness of surface increased due to the GNP incorporation. This is an indication of change in the crack propagation during loading and a higher energy requirement to fracture the GNP-loaded sample.

Typically, the steam produced is delivered through a network at different pressures to the various steam consumers. The primary requirement from the steam network controls is to ensure required steam quality and availability while maintaining overall energy efficiency. Unfortunately, consumption or production disturbances can be quite sudden and large in magnitude with very little advance warning. In such cases, traditional steam network controls compromise on overall energy efficiency in an attempt to secure steam quality and availability. Traditional steam network load leveling systems are limited by the fact that the main control loops for different leveling components lack coordination and the priority of utilization of each compensator is rarely changed. Truly efficient compensation requires coordinating between different steam network components such as Deaerator (DA) storage tanks, reduction stations, steam accumulators, boilers and dump condensers. Advanced Process Control (APC) solutions when applied to the steam network enable a more coordinated and intelligent level of control between different network components. APCs offer a cost effective solution to optimize steam production to demand and drastically shortens the duration of production and consumption disturbances and subsequent losses. In this paper we present our results from separate steam network control optimization projects: Brazil's Cenibra pulp mill where results include a 90% reduction in vented steam, improved steam quality and reliability, and reduced fuel costs and mill carbon footprint with savings of about USD 5.1 million in 2009; and the Stora Enso mills Anjalankoski and Veitsiluoto, which realized reduced fuel costs, optimized steam load leveling, and improved steam quality and availability.","Advanced process control; Model predictive control; Steam network optimization","Boilers; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Energy efficiency; Intelligent control; Leveling (machinery); Model predictive control; Network components; Paper and pulp mills; Pulp; Quality control; Steam; Steam accumulators; Steam condensers; Advanced Process Control; Cost-effective solutions; Different pressures; Intelligent level; Overall energy efficiency; Production and consumption; Pulp and paper mill; Steam networks; Process control; Boilers; Condensers; Optimization; Paper Mills; Process Control; Steam",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981225214

The Southwest Regional Partnership on Carbon Sequestration (SWP), sponsored by the Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory, is using this project to monitor C02 injection and movement in the field to determine CO2 storage potential in depleted oil reservoirs. The field was discovered in 1955 with estimated initial oil in placc of about 120 MMBO. The target reservoir is the Pennsylvanian-aged Upper Morrow sandstone, locally termed the Morrow ""B"" sandstone. CO2 flooding was initiated by Chaparral Energy in December 2010. This paper describes a compositional simulation of CO2 storage in a depleted oil reservoir. Mechanisms considered for CO2 storage include structural/ stratigraphic trapping, dissolution in formation water and oil, and residual trapping. A high resolution geological model constructed from geological, geophysical and engineering data from FWU was used for the study. FWU has no recorded oil-water contact. The model was first calibrated to the reservoir's primary and secondary recover)' history performance as a benchmark for the study. Several models were constructed and the storage capacity was analyzed as a function of injection volume, time and pressure. Numerical simulation results show that with over 25 years of WAG injection, 75% of the CO2 was sequestered. Afterwards wells were shut-in to monitor the storage. Significant amount of stored CO2 was dissolved in remaining oil, contributing to enhanced oil recovery from the tertiary stage of the field operations. Supercritical phase CO2 mass within the reservoir compared to CO2 dissolved in formation water was dependent on CO2 injection rate. Residual trapping contribution was significant when hysteresis was modeled. Pressure, volume of reservoir fluid present, and cap rock integrity and optimized WAG injection strategies were significant parameters to determine long-term CO&gt; storage capacity within FWU. This work shows an improved strategy of maximizing CO2storage within a depleted oil reservoir. It was evident in this study that pressure changes within the reservoir have to be continuously monitored to. Copyright 2015.

In final application, it may be employed in various real world situations that include existing systems like thermoelectric generators (TEGs) and thermal scavenging systems that provide power output from freely available thermal sources. Experimental tests were conducted using various porosity metallic copper foams ranging from 85 % to 89 % porosity. Copper foams were selected to serve as the heat exchanger innards and examined for several key attributes. These included the ability of the foams to yield capillary action with working fluids like water or 3MTM HFE7200. Thermal energy absorption by the exchanger to the working fluid was also monitored. These results were compared to other exchangers based on capillary channel fabrication techniques as previously reported by the research team. Full characterization was based on operating temperature, measured thermal input, mass transfer rate, and heat transfer capability. Preliminary investigation of a matching, small-scale TES unit designed to integrate with the heat exchanger and a future thermoelectric for energy harvesting application was also conducted. Thermal storage was accomplished via solid-liquid phase change of a paraffin wax within the TES device forming a so-called ""thermal battery."" In a final design, the TES includes what is defined by thermodynamics as heat pipes. The integrations of several heat pipes, made of copper tubing and filled with working fluid, mounted vertically and immersed in the wax medium will transfer heat to the wax by means of thermal conductivity and phase transition. This represents a first of its kind in this small-scale, thermal harvesting application. The specific tests performed in this initial work included one TES unit filled with a paraffin wax medium and a second that contained several copper vertically placed tubes surrounded by the paraffin wax. The overall thermal conductivity of the phase change medium (wax) was investigated for both constructions as was the ability of each to absorb thermal energy directly. Results indicated capillary action of the working fluid was possible via incorporation of copper foams within the heat exchanger. Maximum heat flux observed in exchanger tests was 0.27 kW/m2 given an operating temperature of 76.6 °C and 2.5W thermal input. Thermal storage tests indicated a maximum thermal capture rate of 0.91 W and phase change material thermal conductivity of 1.00 W/mK for the TES device constructed with copper tubing innards. This compared favorably to the baseline wax conductivity of approximately 0.32 W/mK . Future efforts will fully incorporate both the heat exchanger and matching TES device for a complete harvesting and thermal capture system. The ability of the exchanger to provide thermal energy for storage to the ""thermal battery"" will be monitored.

This inherent randomness greatly impedes the ‘orderly’ management and control of heat, particularly when compared to electrical energy (e.g., power distribution lines) and optical energy (e.g., fiber optics). The thermal conductivities of common solids, for example, span only a few orders of magnitude, whereas electrical conductivities vary by ten or more orders. Further, chemical and electrical energy can be stored and released with relative ease, while thermal storage materials and systems are typically bulky and inefficient. Motivated by critical aerospace needs to develop transformative thermal management strategies-particularly for high-flux, episodic heat loads within the tightly weight-and volume-constrained environment of aerospace vehicles-this paper provide an overview of prospective strategies and technologies that can address these challenges by exploiting the transient nature of the required cooling while also providing insights into the commensurate uncertainty quantification and control methods that will be essential to their eventual transition to practical applications. © 2015, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The degree of thermal rectification is measured by the difference between the heat transfer rate in favorable and unfavorable directions to the heat transfer rate in the unfavorable direction. A gas-filled, nano-gap structure with two different surface coatings is considered to design the thermal rectifier. In such a structure where the characteristic length scale is similar to the order of the mean free path of the fluid particles (Knudsen flow regime), the effective thermal conductivity is dominantly controlled by the gas-surface interaction, i.e., thermal accommodation coefficient. For the thermal rectification, the adsorption-based, nonlinear thermal accommodation coefficient change is a key design parameter. Here, these are examined using the kinetic theory for various pressure and temperature ranges. Optimal material selections are also discussed.

However, there have been few reports on MOFs for adsorption cooling applications. Adsorption cooling technology is an established alternative to mechanical vapor compression refrigeration systems. Adsorption cooling is an excellent alternative in industrial environments where waste heat is available. Applications also include hybrid systems, refrigeration, powerplant dry cooling, cryogenics, vehicular systems and building HVAC. Adsorption based cooling and refrigeration systems have several advantages including few moving parts and negligible power consumption. Key disadvantages include large thermal mass, bulkiness, complex controls, and low COP (0.2-0.5). We explored the use of metal organic frameworks that have very high mass loading and relatively low heats of adsorption, with certain combinations of refrigerants to demonstrate a new type of highly efficient adsorption chiller. An adsorption chiller based on MOFs suggests that a thermallydriven COP>1 may be possible with these materials, which would represent a fundamental breakthrough in performance of adsorption chiller technology. Computational fluid dynamics combined with a system level lumped-parameter model have been used to project size and performance for chillers with a cooling capacity ranging from a few kW to several thousand kW. In addition, a cost model has been developed to project manufactured cost of entire systems. These systems rely on stacked micro/mini-scale architectures to enhance heat and mass transfer. Presented herein are computational and experimental results for hydrophyilic MOFs, fluorophilic MOFs and also flourophilic Covalent-organic frameworks (COFs).

Reliability of Li-ion batteries used in these devices has been recognized as of high importance from a broad range of stakeholders, including medical device manufacturers, regulatory agencies, patients and physicians. To ensure a Li-ion battery operates reliably, it is important to develop health monitoring techniques that accurately estimate the capacity of the battery throughout its life-time. This paper presents a sparse Bayesian learning method that utilizes the charge voltage and current measurements to estimate the capacity of a Li-ion battery used in an implantable medical device. Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is employed as a probabilistic kernel regression method to learn the complex dependency of the battery capacity on the characteristic features that are extracted from the charge voltage and current measurements. Owing to the sparsity property of RVM, the proposed method generates a reduced-scale regression model that consumes only a small fraction of the CPU time required by a full-scale model, which makes online capacity estimation computationally efficient. 10 years' continuous cycling data and post-explant cycling data obtained from Li-ion prismatic cells are used to verify the performance of the proposed method.

Humidification-dehumidification (HDH) is a scalable, commercially-viable technology that primarily utilizes thermal energy in order to extract fresh water from a high salinity water source. Because of inherent variability and uncertainty in solar energy availability due to daily and seasonal cycles, solar-powered HDH desalination systems may benefit from installing thermal energy storage (TES). TES can allow higher utilization of the installed system components and thus reduce the overall lifecycle cost of fresh water production. This work presents a configuration for a HDH desalination system augmented by TES. The system is optimized using Genetic Algorithms (GA) for minimum total annual cost (TAC) per unit volume of produced potable water while satisfying a preset potable water demand. The optimum results for the same location and cost function are compared with results from a previous system which does not have TES. The comparison shows a considerable reduction in potable water production cost when TES is utilized in addition to the benefit of smaller variation in water production across the day.

Much of this growth is attributed to a decreasing cost of solar PV modules, reduction in the cost of installation and other ""soft costs,"" along with net-metering, financial incentives, and the growing societal interest in low-carbon energy. Yet this steep rise in distributed, uncontrolled solar PV capacity is being met with growing concern in maintaining electric grid stability when solar PV reaches higher penetration levels. Rapid reductions in solar PV output create an immediate and direct rise in the net system load. Demand response and storage technologies can offset these fluctuations in the net system load, but their potential has yet to be realized through wide-scale commercial dissemination. In the interim these fluctuations will continue to cause technical and economic challenges to the utility and the end-user. Late-afternoon peak demands are of particular concern as solar PV drops off and household demand rises as residents return home. Transient environmental factors such as clouding, rain, and dust storms pose additional uncertainties and challenges. This study analyzes such complex cases by simulating residential loads, rooftop solar PV output, and dust storm effects on solar PV output to examine transients in the net system load. The Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area is used as a case study that experiences dust storms several times per year. A dust storm is simulated progressing over the Phoenix metro in various directions and intensities. Various solar PV penetration rates are also simulated to allow insight into resulting net loads as PV penetration grows in future years.

Although these studies have explored the implications of removing CCS from the portfolio of mitigation options, they have not included systematic assessments of the implications of different assumptions about CCS costs and performance. Furthermore, recent research indicates that costs may be higher than many people expected them to be a decade ago. In this paper, we review the recent literature on CCS cost and performance to develop three possible future scenarios. We then use these scenarios as assumptions in the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) to explore their implications for mitigation costs, energy system transformations, and CCS deployment for a range of climate change mitigation goals.

The CO2 transformation into valuable fuels through the Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) concept attracts the attention of the researchers for further investigation in the last years, since the global community is hesitant to the CO2 storage. Power to Fuel (PtF) is a CCU scheme that exploits CO2 from energy intensive industries and low cost electricity. Through this process, CO2 is catalytically hydrogenated with H2 derived from water electrolysis unit, yielding fuels such as the methanol, or other chemical products. However, since this concept has not been commercialized yet, there is an expanded research area for further reduction of the methanol production cost and the optimization of the overall concept. Hence, this study focuses on the investigation of the plant performance for various cases and the determination of their competiveness against the conventional routes of methanol production. More specifically, a thorough economic evaluation, including the specific costs estimation, the capital and the operational expenditures is carried out in order to evaluate the influence of each component on the overall concept. The economic evaluation is followed by a sensitivity analysis based on the most crucial parameters.","Carbon capture and utilization; Economic evaluation; Electrolysis; Methanol; Power to fuel","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electrolysis; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Sensitivity analysis; Crucial parameters; Economic evaluations; Energy intensive industries; Low-cost electricity; Methanol production; Operational expenditures; Plant performance; Water electrolysis; Economic analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978828818

A typical-in-practice Rankine-cycle system was synthesised in our modelling framework DNV GL COSSMOS to describe the thermodynamic behaviour of the baseline system. Then, three alternative configurations were examined: A) the addition of a micro steam turbogenerator to utilise the potential steam rejection that may take place during an operation at low load; b) the addition of superheaters in the boiler to drive the steam turbines; c) the replacement of one steam turbine driven pump by a variable frequency electric driven pump. To assess the system for the actual operation, a realistic operating profile was used based on on-board measurements from discharge operations of an Aframax cargo-oil tanker over one year. The thermoeconomic comparison of the alternative designs is based on operational, capital, and installation costs. The operational costs of each design (fuel and energy consumption) were estimated based on the simulation of system performance. Capital and installation costs were estimated based on economic data from similar previous applications. The alternative designs were assessed both for new built vessels and as potential retrofit solutions for existing vessels. Sensitivity analysis with respect to capital costs and the fuel oil price complete this study.","Marine energy systems; Process modelling; Rankine cycle; Tanker operations; Thermoeconomic assessment","Boilers; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Costs; Crude oil; Design; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Rankine cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Steam; Steam turbines; Turbogenerators; Unloading; Variable speed drives; Alternative configurations; Marine energy systems; Modelling and simulations; On-board measurements; Process modelling; Tanker operations; Thermo-economic; Thermodynamic behaviour; Oil tankers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978818185

The main idea is to try a solar driven heat pump to produce the heating load for a residential building and to compare this with an air to air heat pump system. Simultaneously a fan coil system driven from solar collectors with an auxiliary heater is examined in order to make a general comparison for these 3 systems. The gain by using a solar driven heat pump system is the increase in coefficient of performance (COP) because of the high temperature of hot water. An optimization for the collecting area and for the volume of storage tank is made in order to determine the optimum system. The results shows that 25m2 of flat plate collectors with a storage tank of 1 m3 are able to drive the heat pump and in the case of fan coils, 40m2 of solar collectors with a 1.25m3 storage tank covers 71% of yearly heating demand. The simulation of the three systems is made by the commercial software TRNSYS and the weather data for Athens is taken from Meteonorm. Finally a comparison is made between the different solutions both from the point of view of energy efficiency and economic feasibility.","Flat plate collectors; Heating; Parametric analysis; Solar driven heat pump","Buildings; Computer software; Digital storage; Dust collectors; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Heating; Heating equipment; Housing; Pumps; Solar collectors; Tanks (containers); Auxiliary heater; Coefficient of Performance; Commercial software; Economic feasibilities; Flat-plate collector; Heat pumps; Parametric -analysis; Residential building; Heat pump systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978811453

The SU has two queues with a battery for energy storage. One of the SU's queues is used to store the relayed packets from the primary user (PU) queue. While the other one is used to store its own packets. Each transmission consumes a fixed amount of energy, and the battery is replenished through energy harvesting. A PU's packet is admitted to the relay queue with an admission probability. Moreover, the SU serves either the queue of its own data or the queue of the PU relayed data with certain service probabilities. The finiteness of energy has an effect on the system throughput and how it is affected by varying the service and admission probabilities. The analysis of this system is non- trivial due to the interdependence between the battery and SU's packet queues. This results in an interacting system of queues. To decouple this interaction, and characterize the stability region, we resort to a dominant system approach for the analysis. The obtained stability region is compared with the stability region of the system without energy constraints, and the losses due to finite energy are identified. Furthermore, the average delay encountered by the packets of both PU and SU is shown not to be affected by the finiteness of the energy within the stability region. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Cognitive systems; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Energy harvesting; Probability; Queueing theory; Radio systems; Stability; System stability; Cognitive radio network; Cooperative multiple access; Energy constraint; Interacting system; Service probability; Stability and delays; Stability regions; System throughput; Cognitive radio",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978021764

One of the most intriguing examples of this plasticity is somatic embryogenesis during which somatic cells dedifferentiate into cells that are capable to form embryos. The latter are morphologically similar to zygotic embryos and can regenerate whole plants. The transition of somatic cells into embryogenic ones is the most intriguing and the part of somatic embryogenesis least understood. To better understand the mechanisms of somatic embryogenesis, comparative proteomic approaches have been used, and in recent years, hundreds of proteins have been identified in embryogenic and nonembryogenic cultures, in somatic and zygotic embryos, and during distinct stages of somatic embryogenesis in both angiosperms and gymnosperms.

In this paper, the available storage capacity, efficiency of the storage process and power shifting capability are defined and demonstrated as key performance indicators for the ADR potential of structural storage. Building energy simulations are used to quantify these indicators as function of building design parameters, showing that the ADR potential mainly depends on the heat loss coefficient and available thermal mass. Moreover, it is shown that the efficiency and the available storage capacity are not constant but depend on the dynamic boundary conditions.a.",,"Benchmarking; Buildings; Heat losses; Heat storage; Building design parameters; Building energy simulations; Generic quantification; Heat loss coefficients; Key performance indicators; Key technologies; Storage technology; Sustainable energy; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976412720

A typical residential building with PCM-embedded layer is analyzed using a whole-building simulation tool ""TRNSYS"" under two climates of Oman. Although not significant, the simulation study shows that PCM can reduce energy consumption of buildings. The PCM is found to autonomously store and release thermal energy under desirable environmental conditions. The set of simulation runs are found helpful to explore the potential of PCM and the results can be used by architects and engineers to carefully propose PCM in their energy-efficient building designs. It was concluded that the optimal melting temperature of PCM is 1°C above the cooling setpoint in hot-humid climate but found 2- 3°C above or below the setpoint in the warm tropical climate. A tight melting temperature range for PCM was favored. Overall, the PCM poorly performed (i.e., being less than 2% savings in annual cooling load) in a continuously operated dwelling due to the lack of passive means to discharge the absorbed heat. Future research is found crucial to better understand the dynamic thermal behavior of PCM under hot climates. In particular, it will be useful to explore its performance when coupled with natural ventilation.",,"Buildings; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Housing; Melting; Melting point; Thermoelectricity; Ventilation; Building simulation; Energy efficient building; Environmental conditions; Natural ventilation; Reduce energy consumption; Residential building; Simulation studies; Thermal behaviors; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976412128

Three rounded quartz sands with different particle sizes were used in experiments to investigate the effects of particle size and fines content on thermal conductivity. Results revealed that thermal conductivity increased with increasing particle size for uniform sands. The thermal conductivity was lower in fine sands than in coarse sands under dry conditions but higherin fine sands than in coarse sands at low moisture contents. The thermal conductivity of coarse sands was increased to peak value by increasing the fine sands content to the critical fines content corresponding to maximum thermal conductivity.

Latent heat energy storage systems that utilize Phase Change Materials (PCMs) present an effective way of storing thermal energy and offer key advantages such as high-energy storage density, high heat of fusion values, and greater stability in temperature control. Military vehicles frequently undergo hightransient thermal loads and often do not provide adequate cooling for powertrain subsystems. This work outlines an approach to temporarily store excess heat generated by the transmission during high tractive effort situations through the use of a passive PCM retrofit thereby extending the operating time, reducing temperature transients, and limiting overheating. A numerical heat transfer model has been developed based on a conceptual vehicle transmission TMS. The model predicts the transmission fluid temperature response with and without a PCM retrofit. The developed model captures the physics of the phase change processes to predict the transient heat absorption and rejection processes. It will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed candidate implementations and provide input for TMS evaluations. Parametric studies of the heat transfer model have been conducted to establish desirable structural morphologies and PCM thermophysical properties. Key parameters include surface structural characteristics, conduction enhancing material, surface area, and PCM properties such as melt temperature, heat of fusion, and thermal conductivity. To demonstrate proof-of-concept, a passive PCM enclosure has been designed to be integrated between a transmission bell housing and torque converter. This PCM-Augmented module will temporarily strategically absorb and release heat from the system at a controlled rate. This allows surging fluid temperatures to be clamped below the maximum effective fluid temperature rating thereby increasing component life, reliability, and performance.

It is hypothesized that an earlier defined concept of compliance number and stored strain energy in a compliant mechanism are strongly correlated. It therefore becomes necessary to define and better understand the characteristics of deformation mode shapes of compliant mechanisms. A compliant mechanism may exhibit a variety of mode shapes. In keeping with the classical mechanics notions, this paper systematically develops the mode shapes in compliant mechanisms, utilizing two distinct categories: i) segmental (elemental) mode shapes, and ii) mechanism (system) mode shapes. The possible mode shapes of the basic segment types are identified. Based on the energy storage capability of the segment types, segmental mode shapes are further classified into higher and lower order mode shapes. Similar identification is extended to compliant mechanisms as well, and the possible mechanism mode shapes are illustrated with the help of a few examples. Finally, the utility of this methodology in identifying an appropriate pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) corresponding to a given compliant mechanism is demonstrated. An experimental procedure AIDS in this process.

The bottle necks of operating a compressor drive on PV are: supplying high starting current, effect of intermittent nature of PV on drive performace, effective power management and stable operation in standalone mode. In this work, a control algorithm is proposed to operate a BLDC drive on PV and and a hybrid energy storage system (HESS).

Worldwide, buildings consume 20% of the total energy production. Therefore, increasing efficiency of the HVAC system will result in significant financial savings. As one solution, Thermal Energy Storage (TES) tanks are being utilized with buildings to store excess energy to be reused later. An optimal control strategy is crucial for optimal usage. Therefore, this paper presents a novel control framework based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for optimally controlling a TES for achieving increased savings. The presented ANN controller utilizes 3 main inputs: 1) current TES energy availability, 2) predicted building power requirement, and 3) predicted utility load/price. In addition to the design details of the control framework, this paper presents implementation details of the ANN controller. Further, experiments on several test cases were carried out and the paper presents the experimental setup and obtained results for each test case.

This paper investigates the fuzzy energy management strategy for ESS based on supercapacitors (SC) for human driven trams. Operating the SC on board of a tram brings the following benefits: reduction of peak power demands, decrease of power consumption, improvement of performance and efficiency. Whereas the commonly used ESS Energy management strategies (EMSs) have been dealing without knowledge of vehicle position, the main interest of the presented research is put on the algorithm using the Global Positioning System (GPS). The tram position, located by a GPS module, is used to predict future energy demands and power flows. This information is used in the preparation of the supercapacitor energy level and its power flow control. The optimal ESS power flow with the respect to the tram position is a very complex problem. For this reason, soft computing techniques are used in this paper. The main part of the proposed ESS EMS is the Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy controller (T-S Fuzzy). The T-S Fuzzy reduces problem dimensionality using the expert knowledge represented by the rules.

However, primary recovery is typically below 10%. To improve Bakken recovery factors, many companies are considering the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Since 2012, a research program to evaluate the potential for CO2-based EOR in the Bakken and attendant storage of CO2 for greenhouse gas emission mitigation has been conducted by the Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center (EERC) with broad-based financial support from producers, service companies, government organizations, and CO2 suppliers. The ultimate goal of the program is to provide stakeholders with new knowledge that can be applied toward the design and execution of a pilot injection and production test in a Bakken reservoir. From 2012 to 2014, program activities were conducted on samples of key Bakken lithofacies, including the shales, from several wells. These resulted in the generation of reservoir characterization data (e.g., core analyses, well logs, oil analyses, etc.) and laboratory experimental data on CO2 permeation and hydrocarbon mobility. Detailed evaluations of porosity and permeability, including naturally occurring microfractures that will serve as key pathways for CO2 migration, were conducted using several techniques, including focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, dual-energy x-ray computerized tomography (CT) and micro-CT scanning, ultraviolet fluorescence, and standard optical microscopy. Data generated from laboratory-scale CO2 penetration and hydrocarbon extraction experiments indicate that diffusion is a primary mechanism driving fluid mobility. Fluid mobility rates within the matrix were also quantified for each key lithofacies. The characterization and experimental data were incorporated into modeling efforts, including simulations of a variety of injection and production schemes. The best-case simulation results showed over 50% improvement in oil production. While the production response was predicted to be delayed compared to EOR in a conventional reservoir, patience may be rewarded by substantial increases in the estimated ultimate recoveries of Bakken wells. Application of the findings to the U.S. Department of Energy methodology for estimating CO2 EOR and storage capacity suggests that 4 Bbbl to 7 Bbbl of incremental oil could be produced from the Bakken, resulting in a net storage of 1.9 to 3.2 billion tons of CO2.

As a result, storage capacity and recovery can be impacted in the shale reservoir due to nanoscale pore structure. It is therefore critical to investigate the impact of pore confinement to accurately estimate the gas resources and the phase behavior in the shale reservoirs. In this study, the shift in critical properties of the typical Marcellus Shale gas confined in different size nanopores were determined. The adjusted fluid properties was then used to estimate the gas deviation factor for dry gas and to predict the phase behavior of gas/condensate. The gas/condensate fluid model was then used in a compositional reservoir simulator in order to estimate the liquid recovery from a Marcellus Shale gas/condensate reservoir developed by hydraulically fractured horizontal well. The results indicate that the gas storage capacity of the shale is altered by the pore confinement. The degree of the fluid properties alteration by pore proximity in the shale depends on the composition of the gas mixture and the size of the nanopores. Therefore to accurately estimate the gas resources in the shale reservoirs, it is necessary to incorporate the alteration of the gas deviation factor by pore proximity. In gas/condensate shale reservoirs the fluid confinement could have either positive or negative impact on the liquid recovery depending on the pore size. The results of the investigation can provide an insight relative to production optimization and economic recovery of gas/condensate reservoirs in the unconventional resources.

Moreover, the communication and control network in the smart grid inherently creates opportunities for the adversaries to launch cyber attacks to the system. Natural disasters may further exacerbate the challenge. Designing resilient (if not robust) solutions for the smart grid therefore, was, and remains a high priority. To this end, we present three solutions towards resilience of a microgrid during emergencies. First, we propose the use of electric vehicles (EVs) as temporary power supplies to support critical infrastructure during emergencies. Second, we recommend to use a combination of distributed renewable energy sources, EVs and a community-level storage unit to further enhance the resilience of the microgrid, by utilizing the locally available renewable energy options, exploiting the electric vehicles moderately, and by investing reasonably on the storage unit. Third, we introduce the software defined networking paradigm as a highly relevant platform for both power virtualization and network function virtualization, to support, coordinate and control the dynamic operation of the virtual power plants for reliable power supply and resilient operations of the microgrid in the disaster mode. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of each of these solutions for implementing them in practice. © 2015 IEEE.","Community-level storage; Distributed energy generation; Electric vehicles; Emergency; Microgrid; Resilience; Software defined networking","Disasters; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Energy resources; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Software defined networking; Systems engineering; Vehicles; Virtual reality; Communication and control; Distributed energies; Distributed Energy Resources; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Emergency; Micro grid; Renewable energy source; Resilience; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971323756

However, the design of a combined heat and power (CHP) system involves problems related to technology selection, sizing and operation of the central CHP unit. To solve this problem, there have been used optimization algorithms that consider environmental parameters, usually related to ambient temperature, economic, as fuel costs or prices of electricity and operating, maintenance and capital costs of equipment and the energy demands of the end user. Traditionally, it was considered that these elements behave regularly over time. However, the reality is that these parameters fluctuate and the designer has no control over them. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology based on a mixedinteger nonlinear programming model that considers the selection of technologies, a thermal storage tank, an auxiliary water heating system using a conventional boiler, the optimal sizing of the system and the interactions of purchase - sale of energy with the grid of the local company to meet the energy demands of a housing complex. As design parameters under uncertainty there have been considered the ambient temperature, energy demand related to the floating population and local energy market prices. As objective function there is considered a multi-objective scheme that allows to minimize the total annual cost of the system and secondly to minimize the generation of greenhouse gas emissions associated to fuel consumption. As a case study is considered a housing complex located in the center of Mexico with 1440 households. The results obtained under different scenarios show economic and environmental benefits in implementing CHP systems.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971280346

In this talk, we study empirical data from a demand response pilot program in Kentucky in an attempt to understand consumer behavior under demand response and to characterize the thermo dynamics when set point for HVAC is adjusted for demand response. In addition, consumer survey from the pilot program indicates that many electricity consumers would rely upon central utility to control major appliances such as water heater and HVAC, as well as the operation of the battery and inverter units, in order to manage demand during the predicted peak periods. Therefore, we propose a consumption scheduling model to optimally control these loads and storage in maximizing efficiency without impacting thermal comfort.

The Carbon Storage Program implemented by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy and managed by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is helping to develop technologies that safely and permanently store carbon dioxide (CO2) without adversely impacting natural resources or hindering economic growth. Specifically, the Carbon Storage program is developing and advancing CCS technologies both onshore and offshore that will significantly improve the effectiveness of the technology, reduce the cost of implementation, and be ready for widespread commercial deployment. Since 1997, DOE's Carbon Storage program has significantly expanded the CCS knowledge base in selected technology areas through a diverse portfolio of applied research projects and field demonstrations. The Storage program is comprised of three primary technology components: (1) Core Storage R&amp;D, (2) Storage Infrastructure, and (3) Strategic Program Support. These areas work together to address significant technical challenges in order to meet program goals that support the scale-up and widespread deployment of CCS. Core Storage R&amp;D involves applied laboratory- and pilot-scale research focused on developing new technologies and systems for geologic storage, and encompasses three technology areas: (1) Geologic Storage Technologies and Simulation and Risk Assessment; (2) Monitoring, Verification, Accounting (MVA), and Assessment; and (3) Carbon Use and Reuse. The Storage Infrastructure technology component is comprised of three technology pathways: (1) the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSP) Initiative; (2) Characterization field projects (onshore and offshore); and (3) Fitfor-Purpose projects. All three technology pathways address the opportunities and challenges associated with the range of geologic formations potentially available for large-scale CCS development across the United States. The RCSPs include more than 400 distinct organizations, spanning 43 states and four Canadian provinces. These partnerships form the core of a nationwide network developing the framework needed to validate geologic carbon storage technologies. The RCSPs are actively involved in disseminating research information and public outreach, both domestically and internationally, by integrating research initiatives and lessons learned into Best Practices Manuals that highlight technical and nontechnical lessons learned from these field projects. The RCSPs also play an integral role in providing regional storage data to the National Carbon Sequestration Database and Geographic Information System (NATCARB) that provide an interactive visual representation of CCS potential in the United States. Additionally, the DOE Carbon Storage Atlas provides updates on CO2 storage resources and showcases research being conducted through the RCSP Initiative, with emphasis on large- and small-scale field activities. The Strategic Program Support component promotes an integrated approach to ensure that CCS technologies are costeffective and commercially available. The program relies on research conducted by NETL as part of the national laboratory network to complement the program approach to reducing CO2 emissions. NETL research focuses on fundamental and applied fossil energy R&amp;D, performed by Government engineers and scientists, and offers a venue for participation in collaborative research and provides an evaluation of new technology concepts, products, and materials. CCS and other clean coal technologies can play a critical role in mitigating CO2 emissions while supporting energy security throughout the world. DOE's Carbon Storage program has positioned the United States on a path toward ensuring that the enabling technologies will be available to address the demands of new regulations and impact CCS projects in the 2020-2030 timeframe. Continued U.S. leadership in technology development and future deployment is important to the cultivation of economic rewards and new business opportunities, both domestically and abroad. © Copyright American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

When electricity demand is high or when renewable energy sources have high fluctuations, reliable power sources should be used to meet the demand and compensate for the fluctuations in the renewables. This becomes especially important for some of the renewables such as wind and solar that are very intermittent. In such events, two main approaches are used to meet the power demand or compensate for the fluctuations: (1) using responsive power generation units such as gas- or oil-fired turbines (2) cycling the baseline generation units in advance. However, running gas- or oil-fired turbines (as the spinning/non-spinning reserves) is very expensive and inefficient. Cycling the baseline generation units, such as coal-fired boilers, also imposes various thermal damage to the boilers [1]. A third approach to overcome the abovementioned problems is to use large-scale energy storage systems. Energy storage offers several advantages to the power generation units. The most important function of the energy storage is the peak-shaving of the electricity load. This means that whenever power could be produced in excess, it is generated and saved in an energy storage medium. Then, during periods with high electricity demand, stored energy is used to meet the demand. When energy storage is used, the baseline power generators are not obliged to cycle to meet the peak demand. In addition, by appropriately designing an energy storage system, there is less need for the responsive but expensive generators (spinning/non-spinning reserves) because the required electricity during peak hours is met from the energy storage. Other advantages of the energy storage systems include the ability to have energy arbitrage, the possibility to smooth the variations in renewable energy sources and to increase their contribution to the grid, and power grid stability [2].",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970002283

Dean Keeton St. Stop C0400, Austin, TX  78705, United States","Amine scrubbing is a leading technology for capturing CO2 from fossil fuel power plant emissions. The in-and-out intercooled absorber1 and advanced flash stripper2 process configuration (Figure 1) using concentrated piperazine solvent has been proposed to reduce the capital and operating costs associated with separating CO2 from flue gas and compressing it for geological sequestration. A low-fidelity dynamic model of this advanced process has been developed and implemented in MATLAB® for the purpose of screening regulatory process control strategies. The lowfidelity model has been validated with both a high-fidelity model and pilot plant data, and it is valid for simulating the system near the design conditions. The primary process control objective of an amine scrubbing plant will likely depend on environmental regulations, electricity markets, and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) economics. Two possible objectives are proposed here: delivering a constant rate of CO2 to an EOR facility and maintaining a 90% removal rate in the absorber. We consider a capture unit integrated with a base-loaded coal-fired power plant that experiences disturbances in boiler load of. 5%. Steam is extracted from the power plant turbine intermediate pressure/low pressure (IP/LP) crossover. The steam extraction valve is assumed to be 100% open at design conditions, which limits steam availability during a disturbance. The offdesign turbine operation is predicted using Stodola's Ellipse Law. In the constant CO2 delivery case, the compressor is flow controlled to meet the specified CO2 rate and the CO2 inventory in the solvent is allowed to vary. In the case where removal rate from the flue gas is controlled, two choices for manipulated variables are examined: the solvent circulation rate (set by the lean solvent pump) and the CO2 delivery flowrate (set by the compressor speed). After assigning manipulated variables for level and water balance control, the remaining variables are paired with self-optimizing process variables. With constant CO2 delivery, the removal rate in the absorber floats for a period of several hours when a disturbance is introduced. Because the process variables spend long periods away from steady state, the steam extraction rate is also floating. The process is not optimal when it is away from steady state, and there is an energy penalty associated with the transient period. There is also a clear tradeoff between electricity produced and the amount of CO2 available for EOR. This scenario may require an oversized compressor to avoid reaching the capacity limit as the pressure of the stripper drops. In the event of a sustained disturbance, the CO2 inventory may become depleted and cause the solvent to approach the solid solubility limit. No oscillations in process variables were observed in this scenario. As a result of the heavy material and energy recycle in the process, maintaining a constant removal rate in the absorber is challenging with only feedback control3. Manipulating solvent rate to control removal with a small process inventory leads to significant oscillations in process variables. The oscillations could possibly be reduced by less aggressive tuning or a larger lean storage tank; however this will make the response much slower and a large inventory is likely not acceptable. These observations are consistent with previous work that investigated using solvent rate to control removal on a simple absorber and reboiled stripper with monoethanolamine4,5. Without any knowledge of the absorber, a feedback controller that manipulates compressor speed must be tuned non-aggressively to assure stability and is subject to slow oscillations as the system comes to steady state. A model-based supervisory controller is proposed to improve upon this strategy by making control moves that take into account the heavy material recycle. © Copyright American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

Renewable raw materials, including natural fiber sources, are the future of storage resources with a variety of positive effects on both the planet ecosystem and the living and working environment, and the energy consumption of delivering the required functionality. One of the most important energysaving types is to reduce energy consumption in buildings by insulating them. For Latvian conditions suitable crops are historically grown flax and hemp. Within the framework of the studies, hemp stems are being used. Hemp compared with flax, are less suffering from diseases and less damaged by pests, so hemp cultivation is practically free from use of chemical pesticides and herbicides reducing the risk to the ecosystem. One of the most frequently mentioned industrial hemp raw materials positive qualities are their very wide use, practically all plant parts can be used in production of different products. This work explores the possibilities and technologies within the Latvian grown hemp stems to work into board materials with insulation capability. Hemp fibers/shives mix boards can fulfill the main function of insulation materials, i.e., to reduce the transmission of heat, because they have a porous structure and low density. Material thermal insulation properties affect physical and structural properties of compounds. Cost effective particles board samples from chopped hemp stems with three types of adhesives and different thicknesses were produced and their thermal conductivity evaluated. The technologies applied and test results will be discussed in the paper. © Rezekne Higher Education Institution (Rēzeknes Augstskola), Rezekne 2015.","Hemp stems; Insulation materials; Particle boards; Thermal conductivity","Cost effectiveness; Ecology; Ecosystems; Energy utilization; Flax; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hemp; Hemp fibers; Insulating materials; Insulation; Linen; Particle board; Thermal conductivity; Yarn; Chemical pesticides; Environmental pollutions; Fossil raw materials; Insulation materials; Reduce energy consumption; Renewable raw materials; Required functionalities; Thermal insulation properties; Thermal insulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969579635

The impact of GNP content on electrical conductivity, damping behavior and mechanical properties was investigated. While tensile tests showed that there were generally some decreases in tensile strength and strain at break, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) has shown that compared with either the pristine GNP paper or the neat PEI film, the storage modulus increased 7 to 20 times and the capacity to dissipate damping energy in terms of loss modulus was substantially improved by up to 30 times. The tan δ value gained more than 5 times, indicating that a higher fraction of loaded energy was converted to heat. Comparative studies showed that the PEI with relatively smaller molecular weight and large GNPs exhibited better damping effects.

Such enhancements can be done by improving the resource allocation and management algorithms. In this paper, a model that identifies common patterns for the jobs submitted to the cloud is proposed. This model is able to predict the type of the job submitted, and accordingly, the set of users' jobs is classified into four subsets. Each subset contains jobs that have similar requirements. In addition to the jobs' common pattern and requirements, the users' history is considered in the jobs' type prediction model. The goal of job classification is to find a way to propose useful strategy that helps improve energy efficiency. Following the process of jobs' classification, the best fit virtual machine is allocated to each job. Then, the virtual machines are placed to the physical machines according to a novel strategy called Mixed Type Placement strategy. The core idea of the proposed strategy is to place virtual machines of the jobs of different types in the same physical machine whenever possible, based on Knapsack Problem. This is because different types of jobs do not intensively use the same compute or storage resources in the physical machine. This strategy reduces the number of active physical machines which leads to major reduction in the total energy consumption in the data center. A simulation of the results shows that the presented strategy outperforms both Genetic Algorithm and Round Robin from an energy efficiency perspective. © 2015 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Data Center; Virtualization Management; Energy Efficiency","Cloud computing; Combinatorial optimization; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Java programming language; Routers; Cloud data centers; Data centers; Job classification; Knapsack problems; Placement strategy; Resource allocation and management; Storage resources; Total energy consumption; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965029371

One of its important challenges of this technology is how to efficiently allocate the wireless resources of physical wireless networks to multiple virtual network users. To overcome these challenges, we develop the game- theory based schemes to resolve the resources allocation problem on both buffer/storage space and transmission-rate. Mapping the virtual networks onto the physical wireless network is formulated as the process of bidding for the limited wireless resources from a physical substrate wireless network, and competing with the other mobile-user players, which bid for the same wireless resources of a physical substrate wireless network. Our proposed game- theory schemes work as follows. First, virtual network announces its value function to the physical substrate wireless network, to claim for their required resources (buffer/storage space and transmission bandwidth). Then, the physical substrate wireless network allocates the two types of wireless resources to each virtual wireless network and charges for the provided resources according to the claimed value functions for all virtual users and its current network conditions. Finally our proposed schemes feed back conjectural prices for virtual networks' next-time bid. By accepting the conjectural prices, the game of virtual networks converges the Nash Equilibrium where their long term payoffs are optimized. The simulation results obtained validate and evaluate our proposed schemes through numerical solutions and the simulations. © 2015 IEEE.","Conjectural price; Energy-efficiency; Game-theory; Nash Equilibrium; Resources allocation; Wireless network virtualization","Computation theory; Costs; Energy efficiency; Resource allocation; Virtual reality; Wireless networks; Conjectural price; Nash equilibria; Network virtualization; Resources allocation; Transmission bandwidth; Transmission rate allocations; Transmission rates; Wireless resources; Game theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964909287

To analyze practical finite- length channel codes, we develop a second-order approximation to the communication rate for such channels with energy information causally known at the transmitter.

The system will be built into existing homes that have been vacated as a result of a long period of economic recession in the area in such a way that homes can be occupied while their energy usage is being monitored and managed with in a non-invasive way. Renovated homes will either operate off of the 380Vdc or from the utility. The detached home garage for each home will be equipped with solar PV and battery energy storage with a lead home acting as substation that connects the microgrid into the larger utility through a 240Vac gateway connection. The homes will also be outfitted with readily available DC appliances so that a large portion of the home load can be directly fed from DC. In this environment living laboratories will be created that will enable participation of community members and students from a local STEM high school to become stakeholders in the operation of the community microgrid.

Integrating wind turbines as microsources in islanded microgrids could be a first step towards achieving this goal.

Waste heat-flow through liquid-coolant and the exhaust gas are considered. We have developed two models, written in Matlab, to estimate energy in real-time from the coolant and exhaust. Heat power in kW is estimated as a function of mass flow rate, specific heat capacity, and temperature. Instantaneous heat power integrated over a drive cycle resulted in the estimated energy in kWh. We have obtained mass-flow rates and the coolant temperature from the recordings of the vehicle's onboard diagnostic data (OBD). We measured exhaust-gas temperature wirelessly, in parallel with OBD data recording, using an infrared-temperature sensor and an Arduino-Uno microcontroller with Xbee-wireless-data-interface. The dynamic specific heat capacities of the exhaust gas and the coolant are estimated as the 5th-order polynomial functions of corresponding temperatures. We have found that the harvestable energy per hour of driving from the coolant is about 8.44 kWh in a city drive-cycle; and it is about 16.77 kWh of energy in a highway drive cycle. It is expected that about equal amount energy can be extracted from the exhaust gas. © 2015 IEEE.","energy through coolant and exhaust gas; Harvestable green energy; Thermo-electric generators TEGs; Vehicle waste heat","Coolants; Digital storage; Energy policy; Gases; Mass transfer; MATLAB; Solid wastes; Specific heat; Vehicles; Waste heat; Coolant temperature; Exhaust gas temperatures; Experimental estimations; Green energy; Infrared temperature sensor; On-board diagnostics; Order polynomials; Thermo-electric generators TEGs; Phase interfaces",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964680531

Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) can help create more reliable and dispatchable systems by adjusting charging and discharging time and rate. In this study, an economic model is developed for a hybrid system of grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV), Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), and batteries. PV generation depends on solar irradiance. CAES can store energy in large amounts and for longer periods and at lower cost than other storage systems. Batteries are integrated with CAES in the developed model mainly to operate for lower demand and shorter periods. Optimal planning for generation and storage is derived based on the developed model for each day using Dynamic Programming (DP) or simulation methods. The original non-linear model of the system is converted to a linear model in this study. The results of the model are different for each period and are highly dependent on the load demand. © 2015 IEEE.","Battery; compressed air energy storage; modeling; operation research; solar PV","Compressed air; Dynamic programming; Electric batteries; Energy resources; Energy storage; Hybrid systems; Models; Photovoltaic cells; Pressure vessels; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Battery; Compressed air energy storages (CAES); Economic modeling; Energy storage systems; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Operation research; Solar photovoltaics; Solar PVs; Compressed air energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964621518

The results show that the storage deployment is significantly suitable whenever the power penetration of wind-wave resources is at least 50% of the local maximum power demand. The results show that the reduction in the cost of energy is larger when the renewable power penetration is 100% than when it is 50%.

Thick bundles of aligned CNTs have been used as heat pipes, but the thermal input and output power densities are the same, providing no heat spreading effect. We demonstrate the use of energetic argon ion beams to join overlapping CNTs in a thin film to form an interpenetrating network with an isotropic thermal conductivity of 2150 W/m K. Such thin films may be used as heat spreaders to enlarge the thermal footprint of laser diodes and CPU chips, for example, for enhanced cooling. At higher ion energies and fluence, the CNTs appear to collapse and reform, aligned parallel to the ion beam axis, and form dense high aspect ratio tapered structures. The high surface area of these structures lends themselves to applications in energy storage, for example. We consider the mechanisms of energetic ion interaction with CNTs and junction formation of two overlapping CNTs during the subsequent self-healing process, as well as the formation of high aspect ratio structures under more extreme conditions. © 2014 Materials Research Society.",,"Argon lasers; Aspect ratio; Heat pipes; Heating equipment; Ion beams; Ions; Nanotubes; Spreaders; Thermal conductivity; Thermal conductivity of solids; Thin films; Yarn; Extreme conditions; Heat spreading effect; High aspect ratio; High aspect ratio structures; High surface area; Junction formation; Self-healing process; Tapered structure; Carbon nanotubes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964556255

Although, traditional communications interfaces, protocols and standards has been used in the electrical grid in an isolated manner, modern communications networks are considered as the fundamental enabling technologies within a Smart Grid environment. Emerging communications technologies, protocol architectures and standards can help to build a common communications network infrastructure for data transport between customer premises, power substations, power distribution systems, utility control centers and utility data centers. The Smart Grid will support traditional applications such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), distribution automation (DA), energy management systems (EMS), demand site management (DSM) and automated meter reading (AMR), etc., as well as new applications like advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), substation automation (SA), microgrids, distributed generation (DG), grid monitoring and control, data storage and analysis, among others. To make this possible, the Smart Grid requires a two-way wide area communications network between different dispersed areas, from generation to consumer premises. An AMI system uses communication technologies for smart meter reading several times a day to get data consumption of electricity, as well as sending outage alarm information and meter tampering almost in real time, from the meter to the control center. Currently, there are various communication technologies to implement AMI systems. This paper presents an overview of the most relevant communications technologies that can be used to implement AMI communications infrastructure such as neighborhood area networks (NAN), field area networks (FAN) and wide area networks (WAN) using different transmission media such as fiber optics, spread spectrum radio frequency, microwave, WiMAX, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, cellular, and power line carrier.

Two carborane cages, with a metal atom (Fe or Co) in the middle are connected to electrodes via a sulfur-terminated thiophene ring at each side. In the first study where the metal atom is Fe, a strong dependence of the conductivity on the spin state is observed showing the potential application of this molecule for storage or switching. In the second part of the study, with Co as the central atom, it is shown that at low voltage, as a tip-shaped electrode is pulled away, conductivity increases rather than decreasing. The phenomenon is attributed to the destabilization of the HOMO-2 (first conductive orbital) that moves up in energy towards the Fermi level leading to a lower onset for conduction. © 2015 IEEE.","Modeling; Nanomagnetics; Nanomanipulation; Spintronics","Atoms; Computational geometry; Electrodes; Magnetoelectronics; Models; Molecules; Nanomagnetics; Nanotechnology; Spin dynamics; Carborane cages; Computational studies; Conductive properties; Junction geometries; Magnetic state; Nanomanipulations; Strong dependences; Thiophene ring; Metals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964374547

An adequate model of the pneumatic strain energy accumulator on a systems level is needed to explore the design space in order to optimize the device. The recent success of the pneumatic strain energy accumulator on an Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO) medical assist device serves as motivation for such a systems level model. In laboratory experiments the AFO medical assist device has reported from 25-75% energy efficiency improvement when using the pSEA depending on the various parameters of the medical device. Early measurements and calculations for a single stage independent process pSEA indicated a theoretical maximum energy efficiency increase of 33% which lies between the energy efficiency values realized on the AFO device using a single stage coupled process pSEA. A study of a lumped parameter model using measured Pressure- Volume curve data as a model input will be used to quantify energy efficiency increases for a variety of system configurations.

These machines normally use fluid power transmission in drivelines and working actuators. New energy efficient technologies, e.g. a hybrid power transmission with an energy recovery feature, have been introduced. Currently most of the manufacturers are still using conventional technologies in their product development process. Human operators have an effect on the overall efficiency of the machines. Taking into account the human effects is difficult and expensive using the conventional design processes and tools. The objective of this study is to provide international machine manufacturers instrumental, yet novel, community and simulation-based (ICT-enabled) tools/methods for the strategic and cost effective development of their product practices and design processes. The development of models and methods will allow for rapid real-time virtual prototyping of complex machines and machine fleets that operate within a number of worksites or geographical conditions. The introduction of this state-of-the art (and going beyond) advancement in real-time virtual technology, simulation, internet based design technologies and software, cyber-physical and big data processing systems, will present a holistic approach to improve the entire product life. Targeted user groups are manufacturers of non-road mobile machinery (i.e. excavators, wheel loaders, etc.). These machines and production systems share the following key features: 1) They are complex mechatronic systems with several interconnections between hydraulic drives; mechanics, electronics, software and 2) they include autonomous, semiautonomous and human driven operated systems. Methods developed will enable machine manufacturers' access to technologies that will lead to a more cost effective consumer ordinated, life cycle optimization process.

Hydraulic transformers can potentially be an energy efficient, throttle-less control approach for multi-actuators systems powered by a common pressure rail (CPR). The transformer transforms the input CPR pressure to the desired pressure of the actuator instead of throttling it. Regenerative energy can also be captured. For transformers to be useful, they must also have good control performance. This paper presents a a passivity based trajectory tracking controller for a hydraulic actuator driven by a transformer consisting of two mechanically coupled variable displacement pump/motors. In addition to controlling the motion of the actuator, the transformer speed can also be regulated at the most efficient operating speed. The nonlinear controller is designed using a Lyapunov function that is based upon a recently discovered natural energy storage function for hydraulic actuators. Experimental results validate the efficacy of this controller. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Actuators; Backstepping; Controllers; Energy efficiency; Hydraulic equipment; Lyapunov functions; Motion control; Power control; Back-stepping controls; Common pressure rails; Control performance; Hydraulic transformer; Non-linear controllers; Trajectory tracking; Trajectory tracking controllers; Variable displacement; Hydraulic actuators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964329405

Main purpose of this study was to obtain a reliable information basis for assessing the potentials of hybrid drives, in particular the amount of recoverable energy. Differences concerned the size (tonnage) of the excavators and the hydraulic systems, open center versus load sensing. All machines were tested at the same set of operation scenarios, which are typical for practice, and with different operators. To this end, all test machines have been equipped with pressure, flow rate, temperature, angular and position sensors. These signals (about sixty) and several available from the machines CAN bus were recorded with a standard data acquisition system and electronically stored for later analysis. These raw data were processed to obtain the interesting data, like speeds, power flows, energies. In addition, videos of each test were recorded to facilitate the correct interpretation of the measurements and their correlation with the actual working processes. Power flows from the combustion engine, different pumps, and at each actuator and energetic losses at the different loss sources were plotted for the different operation scenarios. Total efficiencies of the machines for different scenarios and the energy in and outflow at each actuator were computed. From the latter so called relative and absolute recovery degrees for each actuator and for the total machine in the different operation scenarios were derived. The relative recovery degree is the ratio of the total outflow energy (second and fourth quadrant) and the total inflow energy (first and third quadrant). The absolute recovery degree is the ratio of the total outflow energy of an actuator and the total energy delivered by all pumps in an operation scenario. In most operation scenarios the total efficiency of consumed mechanical output energy at the hydraulic actuators relative to delivered hydraulic energy is in the range 15% to 25%. Reasonable recovery potentials do have the swing and the boom drive. For small machines, however, the boom drive dominates. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Actuators; Construction equipment; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Electric load flow; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Excavation; Excavators; Hydraulic equipment; Hydraulic machinery; Mechanical actuators; Motion control; Power control; Recovery; Combustion engines; Data acquisition system; Different loss source; Efficiency measurement; Hydraulic system; Information basis; Mechanical and hydraulic systems; Recoverable energy; Hydraulic actuators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964320803

It’s important to establish the mechanical defects that appear during long term preservation, in order to try avoiding or diminishing these defects. In order for these defects to appear, a significant part is played by the height where the fruit are kept in storing packages. It’s important to establish the factors that influence the occurrence of mechanical defects in apples due to the static and quasistatic compression loads, and also to establish the mathematical models that anticipate the size of the defects in various storing conditions. It’s also mandatory to determine the values of some mechanical measurements for apples, necessary for evaluations required by various engineering activities in the field. Foreseeing the biological material behavior, generally and especially in fruit, while under various types of mechanical load, can be achieved by knowing the rheological parameters, such as the elasticity module, viscosity coefficients, relaxation times, etc. After analyzing the apple varieties grown in Romania, the authors chose to study the Golden Delicious and Idared varieties, because they are in demand and they show technological attributes useful for long term preservation. Experimental research wanted to show the behavior while under compression load for the two apple varieties. Measurements were made to determine the bioyield force and its corresponding deformation with a Hounsfield machine. The results of the experiments have allowed establishing some correlations between the mechanical parameters (E – Young elasticity module, Rp – resistance to penetration, σc – normal bioyield tension) and the different degrees of apple ripening.

The data have been continuously collected for almost four years. The solution has three primary ingredients: ""Feedback Sensors, BCS (Building Control System) Programming & Remote Meter Monitoring"". 1. Real Time Feedback: Providing real time feedback that proves that BCS commands are successful is essential. New electricity current and temperature sensors were installed to supplement existing information to determine if the BCS commands are performing correctly. 2. BCS Programming: Rules and associated analytics for all energy saving features were written and programmed into the existing BCS. 3. Remote Monitoring: In addition to all BCS points, there are nine electricity meters, one water meter and two space temperature and humidity sensors that are monitored via the internet. This solution takes advantage of the building's existing BCS, by using it to do what it does well, repetitive tasks. AOCx has been implemented for the following energy saving features: 1.

To help reach these ambitious goals, Kazakhstan has adopted the Law on Energy Savings (2012) and the ""Energy Saving 2020"" program (2013) [1]. Under these policies, businesses that consume more than 1500 ton of coal equivalent (tce) per year and all municipal buildings are required to conduct energy audits and implement identified energy-saving measures. Achieving these national goals and helping regulated companies comply with the law requires the services of experienced energy professionals. Thus, in 2014, the USAID Kazakhstan Climate Change Mitigation Program (KCCMP) helped launch the AEE Kazakhstan Chapter, and establish three Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs) based at leading Kazakhstani technical universities. Although the local model differs slightly from that of US-based IACs, the Centers provide on-the-job training to help create the next generation of energy professionals and assist small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in complying with the laws. A typical Kazakhstani energy audit group consists of an international energy auditing expert, nationally certified auditors, as well as engineering faculty members and students. These four types of individuals learn from each other while identifying opportunities for enterprises to decrease their energy intensity. Since their establishment (October 2014), IAC teams have performed 11 express energy audits and trained 71 local energy practitioners. The average annual energy consumption of eight audited businesses (out of the 11) is 33,340.5 tce, or about $8.2 million in annual energy expenditures. To date, the IAC teams have identified energy savings of as much as $2.4 million annually (7,845.4 tce). Thus, IACs are helping to implement Kazakhstan's national energy strategy by training qualified professionals and by helping businesses to both be more competitive and to comply with national regulations.",,"Climate change; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Laws and legislation; Personnel training; Annual energy consumption; Climate change mitigation; Energy professionals; Energy-saving measures; Engineering faculty members; Industrial Assessment Centers; Small and medium enterprise; Technical universities; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964048480

Technologies developed for facility- And campus-scale energy storage show promise for managing short-term demand peaks as well as longer-period demand response events. The paper's authors have investigated facility/campus-scale energy storage for efficiency program administrators in the US and recently completed a storage technology research report for an international consortium of utilities. This work has identified promising avenues for distributed storage. Currently, facility-scale storage has three primary uses: 1. power quality - The monitoring and regulation of voltage fluctuations, frequency disruptions, and harmonic distortions, 2. bridging power - short-term power supply for critical demands, often used to cover time periods in which emergency generators are powering up, 3. energy management - energy storage on a scale to support a facility/campus for extended periods of time. These systems can be responsive to utility demand programs and time-of-use rates to cut peak demand costs. All three of these uses inform the development of strategies for utilizing distributed storage for the successful power continuity and demand management strategies. This paper will present the technical properties of current storage systems, including flywheel, compressed air, and various battery technologies. The technical and market barriers associated with distributed storage, along with proposed paths for resolving said barriers, will also be discussed.",,"Compressed air; Energy storage; Facilities; Current storage systems; Demand management strategies; Demand response programs; Distributed storage; Energy storage technologies; International consortium; Technical properties; Voltage fluctuations; Storage management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964043467

While monitoring software gives businesses the tools to track energy use and identify operational changes that would reduce energy costs, these solutions typically require significant hands-on attention and operational flexibility. By combining a customer-sited intelligent energy storage solution with a cloud-based monitoring platform, businesses achieve benefits that cannot result from hardware or software alone. With an intelligent storage system and predictive analytics software, businesses gain real-time visibility into electricity usage and accrued costs to predict bills before they arrive and automatically respond to savings opportunities. Access to this real-time data and the ability to instantly translate usage into costs empowers organizations to adapt to their tariff or supply contract without affecting productivity. Energy intelligence software with predictive analytics can enable fast or fully automated decision-making, helping commercial businesses more easily and effectively manage energy expenses. At the same time, intelligent controls allow customers to do more with less battery, maximizing returns while reducing space requirements and installation costs. In this presentation, Stem will discuss how customer-sited storage coupled with intelligent controls and cloud-based software tools can reduce energy bills, improve operations and accurately predict future costs. The presentation will demonstrate the value for commercial and industrial entities, and can offer a software demo to show how real-time analytics can work with storage systems to unlock the full value of this new technology.",,"Cost reduction; Costs; Decision making; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Intelligent control; Office buildings; Real time systems; Sales; Industrial customer; Intelligence software; Intelligent energies; Intelligent storage systems; Operational changes; Operational flexibility; Predictive analytics; Real-time visibility; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964012170

Mexico is aiming at expanding the role of geothermal energy, and renewable energy in general, in the country's power generation matrix. Four high-enthalpy sites are currently under commercial ownership and production by the Federal Commission of Electricity (CFE) in Mexico, totaling 958 MWe. Traditional water-based geothermal systems require significant amounts of water, a high permeability and porous formation and sufficiently high subsurface temperatures. Supercritical CO2 is recognized to have good mobility and flow properties that make it an excellent alternative to water for heat recovery from geothermal reservoirs, thus expanding the range of usable natural geothermal formations. CO2 is expected to be available in the future from carbon capture systems added to fossil-fired power plants for greenhouse gases abatement. CO2 as a geothermal heat mining fluid also provides the added benefit of carbon storage within the geothermal formation. Estimations of heat mining potential using sCO2 were performed using the TOUGH2 computer software. Simulations for three representative reservoirs in Mexico (Hard Dry Rock, HDR - Acoculco (260°C, 160 bar), Deep Saline Aquifer, DSA - Puruandiro (165°C, 100 bar), and Low Enthalpy Reservoir, LER - Agua Caliente Comondú (95°C, 75 bar) indicate that CO2-based systems have better heat mining potential than H2O-based systems, corresponding to enhanced heat extraction rates as high as 160 percent with respect to the H2O-based systems, with the heat mining benefit by sCO2 increasing in inverse proportion to the site subsurface temperature. Additional simulations for twenty-one characterized geothermal sites in Mexico estimate a total power generation potential with sCO2 of 1,161 MWe. This represents 51.4 percent additional power generation that can be mined by the use of sCO2, in comparison to water. Additionally, a sCO2-based geothermal system would be able to sequester in these twenty-one geothermal reservoirs, over an expected 30-year life of the reservoir, approximately 72 million tons of CO2, or about 10 percent of the current total CO2 emissions inventory for the country.",,"Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Enthalpy; Fossil fuel power plants; Geothermal fields; Geothermal wells; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Supercritical fluid extraction; Sustainable development; Waste heat; Deep saline aquifers; Emissions inventory; Fossil fired power plants; Geothermal reservoir; Heat extraction rate; Inverse proportions; Subsurface temperature; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963542680

This year 100th anniversary of the first UGS storage in Welland County, Ontario in Canada has been honoured. Originally, UGS was built as gas accumulation element covering imbalances in gas consumption markets. Since its early beginnings, UGS has developed into a complex gas infrastructure providing physical flexibility to gas markets as it contains substantial volumes of gas close to customers and flexibility to deliver gas at a short notice according to market needs. The basic roles of UGS are the following: • Seasonal, monthly, daily and even hourly balancing of gas consumption variations • Transmission and distribution gas grids optimization and balancing • Security of gas supply • Gas production optimization • Gas trading and arbitration Each UGS is characterized by storage capacity consisting of working gas volume, withdrawal and injection rate. Due to the fact that the basic role of UGS is to moderate gas consumption fluctuations, interconnections to gas grids are important. The classification of UGS types is as follows: Porous storage • storage in aquifers • storage in gas fields • storage in oil fields Caverns • storage in salt caverns • storage in rock caverns (including lined rock caverns) • storage in abandoned mines. Usually due to their characteristics, caverns provide flexible storage with relatively smaller volumes and higher rates and porous storages fit to seasonal storages where larger volumes are smaller rates in relative terms. However, this is general classification and also very deliverable porous storages might be found. In this triennium, WOC2 have had three study groups dedicated to: • SG 2.1 UGS database • SG 2.2 Techniques and new opportunities • SG 2.3 Human resources: attracting students to storage activities SG 2.1 This group has been working for 5 trienniums providing a valuable summary of UGS activities worldwide. Total WGV is 393 bcm without taking into account long term strategic reserves, operated in about 715 storage facilities all over the world with the withdrawal rate of some 6 656 mcm/d. Most storages are developed in former gas fields. During this triennium a special web based application was developed summarizing SG's deliverables as follows: • UGS Data viewer • UGS facts in Charts &amp; Tables • UGS interactive map • UGS vocabulary in fourteen languages • Studies from previous triennium and is accessible at http://ugs.igu.org/ after registration. Moreover, a general definition of trends in established and emerging gas regions is given. SG 2.2 The main orientation was on UGS techniques, new opportunities and best practices. As operators of underground gas storage facilities have to react quickly to changing market demands for gas while raising safety standards and reducing environmental impacts. The first part looks at subsurface integrity management and the second at the reduction of the environmental footprint of UGS operations and the enhancement of their energy efficiency. UGS operators are taking advantage of sophisticated and advanced technologies which were mainly developed by and for oil and gas majors or engineering service companies. But UGS operators are also investing in R&amp;D to adapt these technologies to their specific needs in order to continuously improve their practices. Furthermore, information to which extent UGS technology may contribute to energy storage generated from intermittent renewable energy sources is given. This part focuses on the identification of solutions UGS applications might contribute, on the related technology gaps together with the R&amp;D effort needed to overcome them, and on current market uncertainties, opportunities and constraints likely to impact the deployment of these UGS. SG 2.3 The main goal of SG was to find the key factors affecting talent attraction to the underground storage sector and develop strategic approaches to HR development. The results based on questionnaire survey are reported in a comprehensive report. The most important part of SG 2.3 was development of ""Program of competition in honour of 100th anniversary of UGS"". The programme was destined for the students and young specialists (younger than 30 years old) working with or willing to work in UGS industry.

To do that, the sector will need to build pipeline systems, onshore and offshore production sites, compressor stations, carbon capture facilities, shale gas drilling pads and LNG terminals. But building infrastructure means neighbours will be impacted, and getting their buy-in is increasingly challenging. Protests against gas infrastructure projects are widespread, from shale gas in Pennsylvania, a pipeline in Ireland, an LNG terminal in Spain to CO2 storage in the Netherlands. Public acceptance is a pre-condition to the success of many gas infrastructure projects. And acceptance won't come from technological prowess or government assurances to the public. It will require a pro-active industry that invests in public consultation, negotiates a social licence and engages communities to gain their trust. The business case for social licence comprises much more than anecdotal protests. Project managers in the oil and gas industry understand the importance of these ""non-technical risks"". A Goldman Sachs study looked at 190 oil and gas projects in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia Pacific and the Middle East. It found that 140 out of 190 delayed projects were delayed as a result of political and/or stakeholder-related risks, not technical or commercial risks. In short, public acceptance is critical to success. Local concerns about a project in a community are nothing new. Concerns around traffic, jobs, health, local benefits, air quality, preservation of nature and lifestyle are legitimate and understandable and change - social, cultural, economic or environmental change - can be challenging. The process of change - how am I approached and are my concerns heard and recognized - is also key. Several factors play a key role in getting communities to accept change. The rationale of the project, of course, has to be solid and able to weather harsh criticism. Equally important, if not more, is the way communities are included in the process, values shared and concerns and feelings acknowledged. Scientific reports do not suffice when citizens feel they are threatened or at risk, or when a project seems to be driven by a different set of values. And no matter how much companies want to stay in their comfort zones and play the rational card, a paradigm shift is needed to negotiate a social licence. 3.2 Public Acceptance Needs Trust, Co-Creation and Conversation The key to gaining public acceptance is the ability for the project partners - public or private - to combine three elements in their approach: trust, value co-creation and conversation. • Be a trustworthy partner: Do project partners give proof of integrity, intent, capabilities and delivery of results (past and future) that together build credibility and trust with stakeholders? • Co-create value: Do project partners design a project that allows value to be co-created by seeking input early on? • Engage in conversation: Do project partners engage and communicate about the project with stakeholders in an open and effective way; do they seek a conversation, and listen and address the concerns? 3.3 Hardware and Soft Skills Operations and communications are complementary in many ways. Our hardware has to come with soft skills. Citizens are sensitive to the process of change and their involvement in the consultation process. Engaging stakeholders in a transparent, credible and meaningful manner is key to the success of a natural gas project. If you want citizens to trust the process, than they will need to be part of the process. Sending a fancy brochure will no longer do: Companies must engage in real conversation. The ""golden rules"" of stakeholder engagement are captured in these guiding principles: • Engage early: Engage audiences early in the process. Waiting until decisions are made and all questions answered is too late and fundamentally counters the co-creation model. • Communicate often and online: In a networked world, communication has to be almost constant. Social media has given people a platform to communicate. It has also raised expectations towards companies to be direct and fast. Social media provide a unique opportunity to listen to citizens and engage with them directly: Use the tool to your advantage. • Be consistent but not dogmatic: Consistency in messages being communicated and the people communicating them will help your case. Yet to build a relationship you also need authenticity, which comes by trusting your people and letting them use common sense. • Be open and transparent: Including with bad news: Ensuring you and your representatives are open and transparent is critical to establishing integrity and trust. Often a lack of clarity on a project will by default be assumed as negative intent on your part. • Be close to your community: You must have boots on the ground. Being close to the impacted community is key. Understand and acknowledge what is going on there. • Be flexible as well as strategic: Your communications strategy should be flexible and match the project phase. You have to be flexible in setting goals and adjust constantly to the project. • Be on the record: Put in place a proper system to record, document and store information relating to each individual stakeholder engagement. Records related to any regulatory and/or approval processes that play an essential role in the overall project life cycle are also critical. • Break down barriers in your company: This is easier said than done, but communications and operations must work together to build trust in the organization, make the conversation meaningful and create value in project design. A business case cannot be built without public support. Investing in stakeholder engagement to gain public acceptance will provide opportunities for our industry to grow.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963516495

Interestingly, however, there are comparatively few surficial manifestations of geothermal activity. This study is part of a renewed examination of this region as a possible hidden or blind geothermal resource. We present an integrated conceptual model for basalts and genetically derivative topaz rhyolite lava domes of the Blackfoot Volcanic Field (BVF), linking ultimate heat and mass sources rooted in the upper mantle to potential blind geothermal systems in the upper crust. In our model intracrustal magma transfer and storage respond opportunistically and interactively evolving tectonic processes. Production of rhyolite magma is dominated by mantlederived mass and heat sources. Rhyolite formation processes via fractional crystallization, cyclic remelting, mixing and assimilation occur mainly in the mid- to upper-crust, contributing to incremental assembly of an evolving magma storage and pluton system. Pre-eruption storage and phenocryst formation for China Hat occurred at ∼14 km depth, and is inferred to be representative of the most evolved parts of the magmatic system. Approximately 1.2 km3 of topaz rhyolite have been erupted since 1.6 Ma and up to another 350 km3 of silicic rocks may have been intruded as hypabyssal dikes and sills at depths of 0.5 to 6 km. Average silicic magma production rate could therefore be on the order of ∼1 to 200 km3/m.y. Given simple assumptions of magma genesis, eruption rates, and initial and final volatile concentrations, we infer average H2O and CO2 volatile fluxes from the rhyolite source region of ∼0.1 to 10 MT/year and 10 to 1000 T/day, respectively. Lithium flux may be comparable to CO2, and it may be both an effective tracer and resource in fluids derived from the inferred consolidating China Hat magma body.","Blind geothermal systems; Idaho; Magma-related; Quaternary tectonics; Rhyolite; Snake River Plain","Carbon dioxide; Domes; Geothermal fields; Geothermal wells; Granite; Silicate minerals; Tectonics; Topaz; Volcanoes; Blind geothermal systems; Idaho; Magma-related; Rhyolite; Snake river plains; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962921348

Nowadays, with a steady increase of renewable electricity being introduced, its usage is not always optimal. Alongside, its intermittent nature makes wind and solar not suitable for applications such as EV charging. Using a life cycle assessment methodology we analyze the impacts of the construction, usage and disposal/end of life of each of the studied systems. Pumped hydro and compressed air storage are studied as mechanical storage and advanced lead acid, sodium sulfur, lithium-ion and nickel-sodium-chloride batteries are addressed as electrochemical storage systems. Hydrogen production from electrolysis and subsequent usage in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell is also analyzed. The functional unit is one kWh of energy delivered back to the grid/vehicle, from the storage system. The environmental impacts assessed are climate change, human toxicity, particulate matter formation, and fossil resource depletion. Different energy mixes are used in order to mimic scenarios where the environmental applicability of the technologies is put to the test. Results indicate that the performance of the storage systems is tied to the electricity source used during use stage. Renewable energy sources have lower impacts throughout the use stage of the storage technologies. Regarding infrastructure and end of life, battery systems have higher impacts than mechanical ones because of lower number of cycles and life time energy (9.000 fold).

Within the medium- And heavy-duty commercial vehicle segment, both the Smith Electric Newton and Navistar eStar vehicles qualified for such funding opportunities. In an effort to evaluate the performance characteristics of the new technologies deployed in these vehicles operating under real world conditions, data from Smith Electric and Navistar medium-duty EVs were collected, compiled, and analyzed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) Fleet Test and Evaluation team over a period of 3 years. More than 430 Smith Newton EVs have provided data representing more than 150,000 days of operation. Similarly, data have been collected from more than 100 Navistar eStar EVs, resulting in a comparative total of more than 16,000 operating days. Combined, NREL has analyzed more than 6 million kilometers of driving and 4 million hours of charging data collected from commercially operating medium-duty electric vehicles in various configurations. In this paper, extensive duty-cycle statistical analyses are performed to examine and characterize common vehicle dynamics trends and relationships based on in-use field data. The results of these analyses statistically define the vehicle dynamic and kinematic requirements for each vehicle, aiding in the selection of representative chassis dynamometer test cycles and the development of custom drive cycles that emulate daily operation. In this paper, the methodology and accompanying results of the duty-cycle statistical analysis are presented and discussed. Results are presented in both graphical and tabular formats illustrating a number of key relationships between parameters observed within the data set that relate to medium duty EVs.","Drive cycle; Electric vehicle (EV); Medium duty (MD)","Catalytic converters; Digital storage; Dynamometers; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Investments; Statistical methods; Vehicles; Drive cycles; Electric vehicle drive cycles; Heavy-duty commercial vehicles; Medium duty (MD); National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Performance characteristics; Statistical characterization; U.S. Department of Energy; Commercial vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962835849

The U.S. has actively supported the development of cleaner, more efficient automotive technologies over the long term. Further impetus for these efforts comes from several legislative mandates - including parts of the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act and its successive Acts. Over time, the U.S. has adopted specific strategies and policy initiatives to meet the goals set by such mandates. Accordingly, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through its Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO) has supported the development and deployment of advanced vehicle technologies with electric drive systems -often in close partnership with industry. This paper provides an overview of the current market adoption of HEV and EV vehicles in the U.S. and the associated VTO R&D and Deployment initiatives for accelerating their commercialization.

It started operating in 2009 with a scientific program foreseen to extend over the next coming decades at increasing energies and luminosities to maximise the discovery potential. During Run1 (2009- 2013), the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) successfully delivered all the necessary computing resources, which made the discovery of the Higgs Boson possible. Looking ahead, it is forecasted that increased luminosities will extrapolate to a multiplicity in the storage and processing costs, which is not reflected in a corresponding funding growth of the WLCG. ATLAS, one of the four experiments at the LHC, is therefore leading an upgrade program to evolve their software and computing model to make the best possible usage of available resources, and also leverage on upcoming state of the art computing paradigms that could make important resource contributions. These proceedings will give an insight into the accompanying work in PanDA, ATLAS' workload management system. PanDA has implemented event level bookkeeping and dynamic generation of jobs with tailored lengths, in order to integrate and optimise the usage of oppor- tunistic resources, e.g. Cloud Computing or High Performance Computing (HPC). In conjunc- tion, the Event Service has been developed as a way to manage fine grained jobs and its outputs. Usage examples on some of the leading commercial and research infrastructures will be given. In addition, we will describe the work on further exploiting the current network capabilities by allowing remote data access and reducing regional boundaries. © 2015 The Authors.","ATLAS; Cloud Computing; Grid Computing; HPC; Workload Management System","Bosons; Cloud computing; Digital storage; Luminance; ATLAS; High performance computing (HPC); Large Hadron collider LHC; LHC computing grids; Remote data access; Research infrastructure; Scientific programs; Workload management; Grid computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962733484

Due to their highly transient and stochastic nature, they pose substantial challenges for power grid operation. Power dispatched from these sources are uncontrolled and do not necessarily coincide with demand; this in turn affects power quality. Hence, extensive demand side management (DSM) is required. DSM relies on flexible loads as well as energy storage facilities. Furthermore, renewable power generation is by its very nature highly distributed and consists of large numbers of small units. These have a substantial effect on traditional power grid operation and electricity pricing patterns. In this paper, a concept of unidirectional, decentralized, on-site optimization of a battery storage system is presented. A mathematical model of the battery storage system is used to simulate battery dynamics. Battery operation is driven by an optimization procedure, which relies on a one-way communicated pseudo-cost function (PCF). Currently, day-ahead stock market electricity prices are used as the PCF. Optimal operation of the battery is carried out by finding a control function that minimizes the pseudo costs, or maximizes profits.","Battery storage system; Decentralized on-site optimization; Demand side management; One-way communication; Pseudo-cost function driven","Cost functions; Costs; Demand side management; Electric batteries; Electric load dispatching; Electric power transmission networks; Power markets; Solar energy; Stochastic systems; Battery storage system; Electricity generation; Optimization procedures; Power grid operations; Pseudo-cost function driven; Renewable energy source; Renewable power generation; Solar energy systems; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962668759

Therefore, this paper presents a proposed solution of the unit commitment problem for a multi-area grid, which contains conventional and renewable energy sources and storage units. To ensure optimum and economic operation with the stochastic nature sources, it is essential to develop an efficient forecasting model for renewable power generation. Forecasting model was built by using a hybrid Markov to forecast solar power, while, auto regressive integrated moving average model is used to predict wind power. Unit commitment problem incorporate with forecasting model to develop probabilistic unit commitment. The proposed formulation is subject to multi-constraints. To overcome the variation and error of renewable power forecasting, the reserve coefficient is modified to develop two new reserves; up reserve and down reserve. The optimization algorithm used to solve probabilistic unit commitment is Dynamic programming based on Neural Network. The system under study in this paper is a standard IEEE 30, with wind speed and solar radiation data are based on the available data of the city of Florida in USA.","Renewable energy; Renewable forecasting; Storage system; Unit commitment","Digital storage; Forecasting; Neural networks; Solar energy; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Wind; Wind power; Auto regressive integrated moving average models; Environmental requirement; Optimization algorithms; Renewable energies; Renewable energy penetrations; Renewable power generation; Storage systems; Unit-commitment; Dynamic programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962645167

The observed temperature behavior is contrary to what is expected, as uppermost formations typically tend to be cooler than lowermost formations, as dictated by a normal geothermal gradient response. Formation temperature readings have been crosschecked using 3 independent sources, each showing the same uncharacteristic trend. This phenomenon of temperature gradient inversion has been correlated against fractional fluid composition and geothermal properties of the formation. Based on available seismic & geological information, there are signs of the existence of overlying ""gas clouds"", linked to the presence of ""Chimneys"", which may act as heat source. Massive water bearing shale layers which may act as a natural heat storage chambers have also been detected supporting the presence of abnormal geothermal gradients. The immediate effect of this anomaly has been linked to fluid redistribution. Gravity segregation as the main driver for fluid redistribution has been discarded because the MM formation in one of the fields is highly fractured and its matrix is mostly oil wet, implying a negligible effect of gravity over capillary forces. The objective of work reported herein is to describe the implications of this abnormal geothermal gradient on fluid thermodynamic gradation and redistribution with depth. Based on actual well test, seismic and geological data, the combined effect of column height and temperature equilibrium on fluid composition was assessed by applying the Equation of State (EOS), while allowing small changes in depth, temperature and pressure gradients. Discrete fluid composition was determined using available PVT software, and two existing and validated laboratory generated PVT data sets. This in turn was used to reproduce the variation of fluid column with depth that corresponds with the observed abnormal temperature gradient.

As we have transitioned to our current state, inefficient, limited storage systems have become an impediment to fast feedback to online shift crews. Motivation for a centrally accessible, scalable and redundant distributed storage system had become a necessity in this environment. OpenStack Swift Object Storage and Ceph Object Storage are two eye-opening technologies as community use and development have led to success elsewhere. In this contribution, OpenStack Swift and Ceph have been put to the test with single and parallel I/O tests, emulating real world scenarios for data processing and workflows. The Ceph file system storage, offering a POSIX compliant file system mounted similarly to an NFS share was of particular interest as it aligned with our requirements and was retained as our solution. I/O performance tests were run against the Ceph POSIX file system and have presented surprising results indicating true potential for fast I/O and reliability. STAR'S online compute farm historical use has been for job submission and first hand data analysis. The goal of reusing the online compute farm to maintain a storage cluster and job submission will be an efficient use of the current infrastructure.",,"Data acquisition; Data handling; Distributed computer systems; Feedback; File organization; High energy physics; Multiprocessing systems; Online systems; Stars; Data collection; Distributed storage system; Limited storage; Object storages; Online computing; Performance tests; Real-world scenario; True potentials; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962319663

Over the last few years there has been intense work to streamline the computing infrastructure in preparation for data, which started to flow in from the far detector in Fall 2013. Major accomplishments for this effort include migration to the use of off-site resources through the use of the Open Science Grid and upgrading the file-handling framework from simple disk storage to a tiered system using a comprehensive data management and delivery system to find and access files on either disk or tape storage. NOvA has already produced more than 6.5 million files and more than 1 PB of raw data and Monte Carlo simulation files which are managed under this model. The current system has demonstrated sustained rates of up to 1 TB/hour of file transfer by the data handling system.

Input and output control and data flows, bookkeeping, monitoring, and data storage are all managed at the event level in an implementation capable of supporting ATLAS-scale distributed processing throughputs (about 4M CPU-hours/day). Input data flows utilize remote data repositories with no data locality or pre-staging requirements, minimizing the use of costly storage in favor of strongly leveraging powerful networks. Object stores provide a highly scalable means of remotely storing the quasi-continuous, fine grained outputs that give ES based applications a very light data footprint on a processing resource, and ensure negligible losses should the resource suddenly vanish. We will describe the motivations for the ES system, its unique features and capabilities, its architecture and the highly scalable tools and technologies employed in its implementation, and its applications in ATLAS processing on HPCs, commercial cloud resources, volunteer computing, and grid resources.

For example, according to Deloitte (2014), ""Midstream energy companies' share of overall market value in the oil and gas industry has already risen, nearly tripling over the last six years."" Midstream operators are becoming the stars of the energy industry, investing $26 billion on new pipelines and facilities in 2012 - a drastic increase from the seven billion spent just six years earlier [1]. Particularly in the United States due to the success of shale and the increasing possibilities for exportation along with recent accidents and fatalities, more scrutiny is being given to both process safety and the humans in the myriad of midstream systems. In the petroleum industry, midstream activities are often taken for granted. Midstream, the conduit between upstream (retrieval of crude oil) and downstream (the processing of petroleum products), is deceivingly complex and risk laden. The process safety issues are many and often the integration of those issues with the elements of crude oil storage and transportation is elusive. ""Even the best designed, engineered, maintained, and operated pipelines and modes of transportation can be vulnerable to human failures and organizational complexity."" [2] Human Factors (HF) is a scientific tool that integrates humans (and their capabilities and limitations) into highly complex processes and systems. This discussion describes how the integration of human factors with process safety in crude oil storage, pipeline management, and transportation preserves human safety, organizational credibility, public goodwill, and infrastructure confidence along with investment maximization and preservation. Each aspect and phase of midstream activities share commonalities with the others and yet each has its own unique aspects and challenges. This paper describes human factors integration with process safety in the midstream environment. Issues and considerations common to most facets of midstream enterprises are addressed. In addition, unique components of each of the midstream factors such as pipelines, transportation - rail, ship, and truck - and logistics and technology are discussed from a human factors perspective.","Crude oil transportation; Human factors; Midstream oil and gas; Pipelines; Process safety",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962272621

Indirect access to other CPU's (remote) RAM is still possible, but such requests are slower as they must also pass through that memory's controlling CPU. In concert with a NUMA-aware operating system, the NUMA hardware architecture can help eliminate the memory performance reductions generally seen in SMP systems when multiple processors simultaneously attempt to access memory. The x86 CPU architecture has supported NUMA for a number of years. Modern operating systems such as Linux support NUMA-aware scheduling, where the OS attempts to schedule a process to the CPU directly attached to the majority of its RAM. In Linux, it is possible to further manually tune the NUMA subsystem using the numactl utility. With the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.3, the numad daemon became available in this distribution. This daemon monitors a system's NUMA topology and utilization, and automatically makes adjustments to optimize locality. As the number of cores in x86 servers continues to grow, efficient NUMA mappings of processes to CPUs/memory will become increasingly important. This paper gives a brief overview of NUMA, and discusses the effects of manual tunings and numad on the performance of the HEPSPEC06 benchmark, and ATLAS software.",,"Benchmarking; Computer architecture; Computer hardware; Computer operating systems; Hardware; High energy physics; Linux; Multiprocessing systems; Program processors; Random access storage; Reconfigurable hardware; ATLAS software; CPU architecture; Hardware architecture; Memory performance; Multiple processors; Non uniform memory access; Symmetric multi processing; X86 servers; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962220030

Explosion has resulted in a need for individuals to generate and keep large personal analysis data sets which represent the skimmed portions of official data collections, pertaining to their specific analysis. While a significant reduction in size compared to the original data, these personal analysis and simulation sets can be many terabytes or 10s of TB in size and consist of 10s of thousands of files. When this personal data is aggregated across the many physicists in a single analysis group or experiment it can represent data volumes on par or exceeding the official production samples which require special data handling techniques to deal with effectively. In this paper we explore the changes to the Fermilab computing infrastructure and computing models which have been developed to allow experimenters to effectively manage their personal analysis data and other data that falls outside of the typically centrally managed production chains.

In this paper we discuss in detail how we have created a robust toolset and simple portal into the Fermilab archive facilities, which allows for scientific data to be quickly imported, organized and retrieved from the multi-petabyte facility.

Using by-product D2O and thorium-U233 in CANDU and RBMK piles may circumvent need for either fast breeder reactors or seawater uranium. Atmospheric CO2 is presently increasing 2.25%/a (2.25 percent per year) in proportion to 2.25%/a exponential fossil fuel consumption increase. Roughly 1/3 anthropologic CO2 is removed by various sinks. CO2 removal is modeled as being proportional to 50-year-earlier CO2 amount above 280 ppm-C. Water electrolysis produces roughly 0.1 kg-D20/kWa. Material balance assumes each electrolysis stage increases D2O bottoms concentration times 3. Except for first electrolysis stage, all water from hydrogen consumption is returned to electrolysis. D2O enrichment from water electrolysis is augmented by using the resulting Hydrogen and Oxygen in fuel cells. Condensate from hydrogen consumption returns to the appropriate electrolysis stage. Fuel cell condensate originally from reformed natural gas may augment second-stage feed. Previously, recycling only hydrogen from combustion back to upper electrolysis stages allowed a 5%/a atomic power expansion. Using fuel-cells to augment upper-stage electrolysis enrichment increases atomic power expansion from 5%/a to 6%/a. Implementation of this process should start by 2020 to minimize peak atmospheric CO2 concentration to 850 ppm-C. Atomic power expansion is 6%/a, giving 45000 GW by 2100. World primary energy increases at the historic rate of 2.25%/a, exceeding 4000 EJ-thermal/a by 2100. J-electric ~ 3Jthermal. CO2 maximum is roughly 850 ppm-C around year 2100. CO2 declines back below 350 ppm-C by 2250 if the 50- year-delay seawater sink remains effective. The 15-year global temperature rise hiatus is apparently caused by convective heat transfer into seawater. Presumably convective CO2 transfer into seawater also occurs by the same mechanism. Each decade rapid atomic power expansion is delayed results in a 100 ppm increase in maximum atmospheric CO2 concentration. 50 TW dispatchable CSP (concentrated solar power), including 2 TWa storage, costs 1600 trillion USD and covers two Australias. © 2015 by ASME.",,"Atoms; Breeder reactors; Carbon dioxide; Electrolysis; Expansion; Fast reactors; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Heat convection; Heat transfer; Hydrogen; Nuclear reactors; Seawater; Seawater effects; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Uranium; CO2 concentration; Concentrated solar power; Convective heat transfer; Fast breeder reactors; Global temperatures; Hydrogen consumption; Uranium resources; Water electrolysis; Cell engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962175420

Small modular reactors (SMRs) will be significant in establishing hybrid energy systems because of their inherent financial advantages over larger commercial reactors; flexible deployment and faster onsite assembly; and ability to closely match required energy needs for industrial process heat applications. An SMR is a thermal energy plant comprised of many complex systems that interact with each other and their surroundings. To study such a system and set appropriate prices for outputs, it is important to assess thermoeconomics or the effective utility and costs of all resources. At its core, thermoeconomics is based upon the quality of energy, or exergy, flowing into and out of each component within a system. Limited research into the thermoeconomics behind SMRs has been performed, leaving an important gap in understanding. This article presents relevant exergetic cost theory and details methods behind an exergy analysis for an SMR-wind-storage system. To perform this analysis, both the physical and economic environments are identified to provide information on how overall system efficiencies and costs may be analyzed. The physical environment incorporates the actual system components, necessary raw materials, and the surroundings or reference environment. The economic environment refers to the upfront installation and operational costs in addition to market prices. In a purely thermodynamic exergy analysis, the exergetic cost may be determined from the physical environment alone and describes the necessary exergy for production to occur. To improve or optimize a system, system efficiency must be balanced with economics to make NHES more competitive and further their development. © 2015 by ASME.",,"Carbon; Cell engineering; Costs; Exergy; Renewable energy resources; Small nuclear reactors; Sustainable development; Economic environment; Hybrid energy system; Industrial process heat; Physical environments; Quality of energies; Reference environments; Renewable energy technologies; Small modular reactors; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962160963

Now, however, the network is seen as much more capable and reliable. Data are routinely transferred with high efficiency and low latency to wherever computing or storage resources are available to use or manage them. Although there was sufficient network bandwidth for the experiments' needs during Run-1, they cannot rely on ever-increasing bandwidth as a solution to their data-transfer needs in the future. Sooner or later they need to consider the network as a finite resource that they interact with to manage their traffic, in much the same way as they manage their use of disk and CPU resources. There are several possible ways for the experiments to integrate management of the network in their software stacks, such as the use of virtual circuits with hard bandwidth guarantees or soft real-time flow-control, with somewhat less firm guarantees. Abstractly, these can all be considered as the users (the experiments, or groups of users within the experiment) expressing a request for a given bandwidth between two points for a given duration of time. The network fabric then grants some allocation to each user, dependent on the sum of all requests and the sum of available resources, and attempts to ensure the requirements are met (either deterministically or statistically). An unresolved question at this time is how to convert the users' requests into an allocation. Simply put, how do we decide what fraction of a network's bandwidth to allocate to each user when the sum of requests exceeds the available bandwidth? The usual problems of any resourcescheduling system arise here, namely how to ensure the resource is used efficiently and fairly, while still satisfying the needs of the users. Simply fixing quotas on network paths for each user is likely to lead to inefficient use of the network. If one user cannot use their quota for some reason, that bandwidth is lost. Likewise, there is no incentive for the user to be efficient within their quota, they have nothing to gain by using less than their allocation. As with CPU farms, some sort of dynamic allocation is more likely to be useful. A promising approach for sharing bandwidth at LHCONE is the 'Progressive Second-Price auction', where users are given a budget and are required to bid from that budget for the specific resources they want to reserve. The auction allows users to effectively determine among themselves the degree of sharing they are willing to accept based on the priorities of their traffic and their global share, as represented by their total budget. The network then implements those allocations using whatever mix of technologies is appropriate or available. This paper describes how the Progressive Second-Price auction works and how it can be applied to LHCONE. Practical questions are addressed, such as how are budgets set, what strategy should users use to manage their budget, how and how often should the auction be run, and how do we ensure that the goals of fairness and efficiency are met.",,"Bandwidth; Budget control; Data transfer; Digital storage; High energy physics; Networks (circuits); Available bandwidth; Bandwidth guarantee; Bandwidth sharing; Dynamic allocations; Network bandwidth; Progressive second price auctions; Resource-scheduling; Storage resources; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961956261

One storage option is a packed bed of a solid storage material with a gaseous heat transfer fluid. Alumina is considered a strong candidate as the storage material in the packed bed due to a high heat capacity and thermal stability, making it well suited for high temperature thermal energy storage. A simplified, one-equation model is presented with air as heat transfer fluid flowing through a packed bed of α-alumina beads. The thermal properties are averaged in the one-equation model, and all of these properties are calculated as a function of temperature. In addition to the thermal model, the pressure drop is also calculated. The modeling approach is compared to experimental data at multiple flow rates during storage and recovery. For this air and alumina system, the one-equation approach works well in describing the thermal front as it moves through the packed bed. With this validated approach, a designer could quickly study the key parameters (e.g. bed diameter, bead size, materials) associated with the storage for a user's specific conditions (e.g. maximum temperature, flow rates).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961895869

In its original incarnation, only flat information was stored revealing many restrictions such as the lack of historical change information, the inability to keep track of members leaving and re-joining STAR, or the ability to easily extend the saved information as new requirements appeared. In mid-2013, a new project was launched covering an extensive set of revisited requirements. The requirements led us to a design based on a RESTful API, back-end storage engine relying on key/value pair data representation model coupled with a tiered architecture design. This design was motivated by the fact that unifying many STAR tools, relying on the same business logic and storage engine, was a key and central feature for the maintainability and presentation of records. This central service API would leave no ambiguities and provide easy service integration between STAR tools. The new design stores the changes in records dynamically and allows tracking the changes chronologically. The storage engine is extensible as new field of information emerges (member specific or general) without affecting the presentation or the business logic layers. The new record system features a convenient administrative interface, fuzzy algorithms for data entry and search, and provides basic statistics and graphs. Finally, this modular approach is supplemented with access control, allowing private information and administrative operations to be hidden away from public eyes.",,"Access control; Algorithms; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Design; Digital storage; Engines; Fuzzy sets; High energy physics; Reconfigurable hardware; Records management; Stars; Virtual storage; Business logic layers; Data representation models; Fuzzy algorithms; Historical changes; Modular approach; Private information; Service integration; Tiered architecture; Search engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961880624

Driven by oil price and consumption, engine emissions and climate change, along with the lack of sustainable fossil fuels, transportation sector has generated an interest in alternative, renewable sources of fuel for internal combustion engines. The focus has ranged from feed stock optimization to engine-out emissions, performance and durability. Biofuels for transportation sector, including alcohols (ethanol, methanol.etc.), biodiesel, and other liquid and gaseous fuels such as methane and hydrogen, have the potential to displace a considerable amount of petroleum-based fuels around the world. First generation biofuels are produced from sugars, starches, or vegetable oils. On the contrary, the second generation biofuels are produced from cellulosic materials, agricultural wastes, switch grasses and algae rather than sugar and starch. By not using food crops, second generation biofuel production is much more sustainable and has a lower impact on food production. Also known as advanced biofuels, the second-generation biofuels are still in the development stage. Combining higher energy yields, lower requirements for fertilizer and land, and the absence of competition with food, second generation biofuels, when available at prices equivalent to petroleum derived products, offer a truly sustainable alternative for transportation fuels. There are main four issues related to alternative fuels: production, transportation, storage, handling and usage. This paper presents a review of recent literature related to the alternative fuels usage and the impact of these fuels on fuel injection systems, and fuel atomization and sprays for both spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines. Effect of these renewable fuels on both internal flow and external flow characteristics of the fuel injector will be presented. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Agricultural wastes; Biodiesel; Biofuels; Climate change; Combustion; Combustion equipment; Diesel engines; Engines; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Fuel injection; Fuel storage; Fuels; Ignition systems; Internal combustion engines; Liquid methane; Motor transportation; Oils and fats; Petroleum transportation; Starch; Waste incineration; Biofuel production; Cellulosic material; Compression ignition engine; Development stages; Engine-out emissions; Fuel injection systems; Transportation fuels; Transportation sector; Alternative fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961827287

Simon Sandstone, which is the basal sandstone in the Illinois Basin. MGSC recently injected 1 million tonnes of CO2 into the Mt. Simon Sandstone to demonstrate geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) and is currently monitoring the injected CO2 and subsurface pressure. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has issued permits for two additional, Class VI injection wells in Illinois - FutureGen 2.0 and Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage (ICCS). To evaluate the feasibility of future, commercial-scale, multi-site, geologic sequestration within the Illinois Basin, a flow and transport model has been developed and is currently being revised as new geologic and hydrogeologic data become available. Key issues to be addressed by this numerical modeling effort are the fate of the injected CO2, the fate of the native brine, the integrity of the injection formation and its caprock, and effects on other industries or stakeholders. Input data for the TOUGH2-MP simulator include a geologic model with three rock units - pre-Mt. Simon sandstone, Mt. Simon Sandstone, and Eau Claire (bottom to top). In these simulations, 100 million tonnes of CO2 are injected per year for a period of 50 years. TOUGH2-MP modeling results demonstrate that pressure fronts from adjacent injection wells will intersect and that the pressure fronts will extend many kilometers from the injection wells. However, the CO2 plumes will remain close to the injection wells and will not migrate vertically to the caprock for the scenarios studied. A simulation covering 5,000 years indicates that most of the injected CO2 will be trapped via residual saturation. Future directions to improve GCS modeling will also be discussed. To address the potential for affecting freshwater aquifers at the periphery of the basin, a method was developed for linking two flow models. This linkage will allow us to utilize information from a calibrated bedrock aquifer model. In addition, the goals of a new USDOE-funded, Energy Frontiers Research Center will discussed and its research plans will be described.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961718020

Among the specific topics covered are the application of the ASME Code requirements to structural materials, containments, loading and design; the design of containment internal support structures and buckling analysis; fabrication, welding, examination, and test requirements; quality assurance; physical testing, structural and thermal modeling and analysis considerations; and containment, shielding, and criticality analysis considerations. Special topics covered include non-Code materials, hydrogen gas generation, and aging management for extended long-term storage of used fuel and subsequent transportation. The expanded training course was offered in June 2014 at Argonne with 27 participants representing mainly industry and government agencies. On the basis of the feedback and course evaluation by the participants, the course may be expanded from 3 to 4.5 days in the future to allow more time for in-class discussion and exercises, as well as to include additional topics related to aging management for extended long-term storage of used fuel and its post-storage transportation. The course provides insight into the DOE and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) transportation and storage cask certification processes. The target audience is DOE, DOE contractors, other agency personnel, and commercial transportation packaging and storage cask engineering employees.

Aside from the fact that natural gas is widely spreading all over the world and that securing natural gas supply has become a matter of great concern to all energy market players, natural gas still suffers from significant price variations and long-term supply dependency, which results in limited competition, less flexibility and reduced diversity of supply. In particularly compared to liquid fuels, natural gas lacks certain features required for commoditization. These features are found in the so called ""perfect competition"" market structure and include among others, standardization or inconsiderable differentiation of the sold product, neglected price margin, diversity of supply, increased cost and hence price stability, availability, and obtainability. In general, product commoditization shall result in a number of benefits not only for the end users, but as well for all involved players along the whole processing value chain. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether or not natural gas can be classified as a commodity and the forces that are currently affecting this commoditization process. In doing that the paper will study the effect of natural gas transportation infrastructure costs, long term versus spot market contracts, storage methodologies, LNG compared to natural gas from a commoditization perspective and security of supply requirements. The paper will also discuss the reasons for the increased natural gas price differences worldwide. Finally, it will highlight some of the existing eco-political forces that might affect the pace of natural gas commoditization taking into account the effect of subsidy and trade barriers in certain regional markets on the commoditization process.

In the traditional approach, the propellant is carried on board in the form of material fuel. This approach has the drawback of being limited in Delta v by the amount of fuel launched with the craft, a limit that does not scale well to high Delta v due to the massive nature of the fuel. Directed energy photon propulsion solves this problem by eliminating the need for on-board fuel storage. We discuss our system which uses a phased array of lasers to propel the spacecraft which contributes no mass to the spacecraft beyond that of the reflector, enabling a prolonged acceleration and much higher final speeds. This paper compares the effectiveness of such a system for propelling spacecraft into interplanetary and interstellar space across various laser and sail configurations. Simulated parameters include laser power, optics size and orbit as well as payload mass, reflector size and the trajectory of the spacecraft. As one example, a 70 GW laser with 10 km optics could propel a 1 kg craft past Neptune (∼30 au) in 5 days at 4% the speed of light, or a 1past Mars (∼0.5 au) in 20 minutes at 21% the speed of light. However, even lasers down to 2 kW power and 1 m optics show noticeable effect on gram-class payloads, boosting their altitude in low Earth orbits by several kilometers per day which is already sufficient to be of practical use. © 2015 SPIE.","delta-v; high-powered laser; orbital dynamics; photon propulsion; spaceflight","Fuel storage; Fuels; Interplanetary flight; Interplanetary spacecraft; Light; Light velocity; Nanophotonics; Orbits; Photons; Propellants; Propulsion; Reflection; Space flight; Spacecraft; Delta-V; Directed energy; Interstellar space; Low earth orbits; On-board fuels; Orbital dynamics; Orbital simulation; Traditional approaches; Spacecraft propulsion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960918667

This approach has led to many great achievements in science, but will never help to explore the interstellar medium. Fortunately, a paradigm shift is upon us in how a spacecraft is constructed and propelled. This paper describes a mission concept to get to our Sun's Gravity Lens at 550AU in less than 10 years. It will be done by using DE-STAR, a scalable solar-powered phased-Array laser in Earth Orbit, as a directed energy photon drive of low-mass wafersats. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] With recent technologies a complete mission can be placed on a wafer including, power from an embedded radio nuclear thermal generator (RTG), PV, laser communications, imaging, photon thrusters for attitude control and other sensors. As one example, a futuristic 200 MW laser array consisting of 1-10 kw meter scale sub elements with a 100m baseline can propel a 10 gram wafer scale spacecraft with a 3m laser sail to 60AU/Year. Directed energy propulsion of low-mass spacecraft gives us an opportunity to capture images of Alpha Centauri and its planets, detailed imaging of the cosmic microwave background, set up interstellar communications by using gravity lenses around nearby stars to boost signals from interstellar probes, and much more. This system offers a very large range of missions allowing hundreds of wafer scale payload launches per day to reach this cosmological data reservoir. Directed Energy Propulsion is the only current technology that can provide a near-Term path to utilize our Sun's Gravity Lens. © 2015 SPIE.","directed energy; directed energy propulsion; mission concept; near-Term mission; Solar gravity lens","Attitude control; Cosmology; Digital storage; Gravitation; Nanophotonics; Orbits; Photons; Probes; Propulsion; Radio astronomy; Solar energy; Space flight; Space research; Spacecraft; Stars; Cosmic microwave backgrounds; Directed energy; Interstellar communication; Interstellar exploration; Interstellar mediums; Mission concepts; near-Term mission; On-board electronics; Spacecraft propulsion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960916790

It is produced along with oil and gas from nearly every well. Fresh water is used as a base fluid in production, drilling and completion operations. Produced water is primarily handled in three ways: As a base fluid in hydraulic fracturing, for pressure maintenance in secondary or tertiary recovery projects, or for disposal into salt-water injection wells. Hydraulic fracturing uses more water than any other process in the drilling and completion of unconventional wells. An easy way to think of the need for water is: No water, No fracturing, No oil or gas resource play. This paper's focus is on how Newfield Exploration Company approached the design and installation of an infrastructure system for the procurement, transportation, storage, reuse and disposal of water for hydraulic fracturing and associated operations in its Cana Woodford Shale Play. Newfield's Cana Woodford Shale Play covers over 275,000 net acres in central Oklahoma running from Elmore City in the southeast to Watonga in the northwest. When Newfield started on its new venture in the Cana Woodford, the existing infrastructure in the area was not capable of supporting its planned drilling and completion program nor the resulting production and water disposal requirements. To accommodate the exploratory drilling and completion plan, Newfield would install discrete water management systems for each well, which would include (1) sourcing water, (2) constructing frac pits, (3) transporting water to the storage pits in sufficient quantity, and (4) transferring water from the storage pits to well location to support the completions. These one-well water management systems were a necessity for the exploratory drilling program; however, as Newfield shifted to infill drilling and field development, it sought to install a more efficient, fully integrated water management infrastructure that would reduce trucking, make more efficient use of storage space for water, provide broader access to geographically dispersed water resources, and allow for the recycling of produced water as a hydraulic fracturing fluid. Newfield forged new relationships with landowners as a part of establishing operations in the region. Landowner agreements were required to construct pads, obtain right-of-ways to lay water transport pipelines, and build frac pits and other facilities. Several landowners were instrumental in helping our water management team identify water sources in the Cana Woodford play especially in light of the ongoing drought in Oklahoma. ©2015, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Energy resources; Enhanced recovery; Fracturing fluids; Human resource management; Hydraulic fracturing; Infill drilling; Oil shale; Petroleum industry; Petroleum prospecting; Produced Water; Secondary recovery; Shale; Storage management; Trucks; Water conservation; Water management; Water recycling; Well completion; Drilling and completion; Exploration company; Exploratory drilling; Infrastructure systems; Management infrastructure; Pressure maintenance; Water injection wells; Water management systems; Injection (oil wells)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959900728

Global population growth will increase demand for fresh water and all users - domestic, agriculture, and industry - will need to effectively manage supplies to meet demands. ConocoPhillips is committed to creating a responsible water management plan in developing assets in the Delaware Basin of West Texas. Sourcing water for the large multi-frac stimulations in West Texas is a well-known constraint on oil and gas development activities in the area. Additionally, large volumes of produced water have traditionally required disposal in injection wells. Rather than viewing these constraints only as challenges, the Permian Unconventional water management team realizes the tremendous and unique opportunity to address both issues by using treated produced water for reuse in hydraulic fracturing operations. With this perspective, water management strategy development has become a truly collaborative and integrative process that addresses the full life-cycle of water. To reduce implementation risks and improve economics in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, the Permian Unconventional Asset plans to initiate full field produced water reuse early in appraisal and development of the project. In 2014, ConocoPhillips executed several produced water reuse pilots in their unconventional assets, including a multi-well reuse program in the Delaware Basin. Produced water reuse for hydraulic fracturing is recognized as one technology that could simultaneously address both the completion water source shortage and the disposal of large produced water volumes. Strong collaboration led to success in these projects, and they were designed and executed through a significant team effort made by completion engineers, technologists, the asset development team, and operations team members. However, these pilot projects were not without challenges. Equipment configuration on location and produced water storage and transfer logistics were addressed through collaboration of completion and production teams and treatment and pumping services vendors. As a result of the success of these pilot projects, produced water reuse implementation is projected to begin in 2015 in ConocoPhillips' Delaware Unconventional Project. Developing full field water management infrastructure plans will be a challenge for the Permian Unconventional water management team. In developing a holistic water management strategy, addressing the full life-cycle of water creates synergies and efficiencies that could not be realized utilizing an isolated approach to addressing the needs of functional teams. Addressing all aspects of water source, transfer, storage, reuse, and disposal within a full field development infrastructure plan requires continuous communication and integration of asset development strategy, completion technology advances, produced water forecasting, assessment of third party offerings, economic evaluation, and engagement with internal and external stakeholders. With these communication and collaboration pathways in place, the Permian Unconventional water management strategy will continue to evolve to ensure successful execution of Delaware Basin Unconventional Asset development. Although the water management strategy and challenges will be unique to every asset and produced water reuse may not be the appropriate solution, these lessons learned can be applied in other ConocoPhillips assets where technically feasible and economically justifiable. ©2015, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Computer software reusability; Confined flow; Forestry; Human resource management; Hydraulic fracturing; Injection (oil wells); Oil field development; Planning; Population statistics; Produced Water; Sustainable development; Wastewater reclamation; Water supply; Water treatment; Well stimulation; Communication and collaborations; Development strategies; Environmentally responsible; Equipment configuration; External stakeholders; Fracturing operations; Management infrastructure; Water management strategies; Water conservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959891175

One solution commonly employed is to fill thermally conductive foams with PCMs to increase overall thermal conductivity. These systems are often designed to use solid/liquid phase change from the phase change material to control a system’s temperature for as long as possible. However, the transient response of the thermal storage system has not been fully explored, particularly for aerospace applications in which the conditions of the surrounding environment are rarely steady. Consequently, an experimental study focusing on changing boundary conditions was developed, the results of which are reported here, and recommendations on the use of different foams for certain conditions are provided.

The models created in these efforts range in size from small-scale pinnacle reefs up to formation-and basin-scale, spanning various reservoir types and lithologies, and many have utilized the multiple point statistical (MPS) method in the facies modeling process. This method allows the incorporation of geologic understanding, in the form of a training image, to better capture reservoir heterogeneity. Some complex reservoirs may be divided into multiple ?geobody' regions for the MPS process, with each region having a unique training image and facies distribution. The various facies models constructed in these CO storage and CO EOR investigations are used to constrain petrophysical property distributions, which are then used to analyze total and effective pore volumes and viability for CO injection.

Especially, CO2 due to its role in global climate change. Industrial boilers are considered to be one of the largest stationary sources of CO2 emissions in oil and gas (O&amp;G) industries(J.C.M. Pires.et al., 2012). These emissions from boiler's stack represent the highest ratio of the boiler losses because of the heat carried out by hot combustion products (nitrogen, carbon dioxide, sulfur oxide and excess oxygen). The high amount of energy wasted by dry flue gases depends on the amount of water vapor loss. The amount of wasted energy depends on final boiler exhaust temperature and mainly the hydrogen content of the fuel which ranges from 4 to 11%, depending on the type of fuel.One potential way to reduce this emission is to capture, transport and store CO2 either in geologic or oceanic formations. In addition, storage of CO2 in geologic formations could lead to new environmental issues such as threat of CO2 leakage, or potential contamination of ground water(Dennis Y.C.Leunga.et al., 2014). Biomitigation is an ideal and sustainable alternative solution for CO2 capture and recycle (CCR) by using microalgae. Using algae, as a source of biofuels offers many advantages over traditional biofuel crops including the potential to be grown on the marginal land, use of water sources which is not suitable for agriculture because algae can tolerate high salt content. Meanwhile, they sustain high growth rates, and relatively high lipid content. In fact, using captured CO2 to grow microalgae is limited by the high cost of CO2 capture technologies and utilization(Liam Brennan.et al.,2010). Moreover, algae grow poorly at night, as CO2 cannot be temporarily stored until sunrise. Therefore, the condensation of CO2 from flue gasses in the form of bicarbonate (HCO-3) solution would provide a superior alternative for CO2 delivery as feedstock for algae culture system (Van Den Hende et al., 2012.)Furthermore, it reduces CO2 emissions significantly up to 80%, and reduces the use of fossil fuels by improving the efficiency of boilers. In addition, transport and storage of the aqueous bicarbonate solution costs less than for that of compressed CO2. © Copyright 2015, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","Algae; Bicarbonate; Biofuels; Boilers; CCR; CO2; Condensation; Flue gases; Stack losses","Algae; Aluminum; Biofuels; Boilers; Carbon; Climate change; Coal combustion; Combustion; Condensation; Flue gases; Flues; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Heating; Industrial emissions; Microorganisms; Petroleum engineering; Sulfur dioxide; Alternative solutions; Aqueous bicarbonates; Bicarbonate; Biofuels production; Environmental issues; Exhaust temperature; Global climate changes; High lipid contents; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959102315

Their operation is usually controlled by manipulating inlet fluid temperatures or mass flow rates. On the basis of the accepted and critically clarified assumptions, a linearized mathematical model of the cross-flow heat exchanger has been derived, taking into account the wall dynamics. The model is based on the fundamental law of energy conservation, covers all heat accumulation storages in the process, and leads to the set of partial differential equations (PDE), which solution is not possible in closed form. In order to overcome the solutions difficulties in this paper are analyzed different methods for modeling the heat exchanger: approach based on Laplace transformation, approximation of partial differential equations based on finite differences, the method of physical discretization and the transport approach.

The consequence of this phenomenon is a rise in the average earth surface temperature. It is established that the earth's natural greenhouse effect makes living on earth possible and comfortable for humans but the activities of humans such as burning of fossil fuels(hydrocarbons) over time has intensified the natural greenhouse effect by significantly increasing the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide resulting in global warming. Global warming has resulted in widespread melting of snow and ice, sea level rise, increased humidity, and increased heat content of the oceans. The Bonny Oil and Gas terminal receives, dehydrates, stabilizes, stores and exports all crude oil produced in SPDC Eastern operations and the processed crude oil is exported by pipeline to tankers and to the nearby NNPC refinery. In the Terminal, LP fuel gas (composed mainly of methane) is used as blanketing gas and is introduced into storage tanks and vessels to prevent a vacuum from developing when liquid is removed from a tank to maintain the desired blanket pressure and prevent outside air from contaminating the tank or creating a flammable or explosive environment. It also ensures that a constant gas pressure is maintained in the vapour space of a storage tank. Efficient blanketing gas demand would ensure that pressure relief from tanks and vessels which ultimately result in greenhouse gas emissions are minimized. This is implemented through the use of split range control scheme for blanketing gas on fixed roof storage tanks in the Export Terminal. In a split range control scheme, the output of the controller is split and sent to two final control elements (pressure control valves).The splitter is configured to define how each pressure control valve will open. The first valve which allows inflow of blanket gas to the tank opens when the output is of the range 0-45% while the second pressure control valve to the flare opens at an output range of 55%-100%.

Currently, one main issue with shale oil production is the low primary recovery factors still less than 10%. Therefore, efficient enhanced oil recovery methods are highly desired to improve shale oil recovery. As an essential component of shale, kerogen plays a key role in generation, adsorption, storage and migration of hydrocarbons in shale as well as the geomechanical properties of shale. On the other hand, during the shale oil extraction process, shale oil can be produced from kerogen by pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution reactions. The basis to improve the efficiency of both recovery and extraction processes is to establish and clarify the molecular structure of kerogen. Previously, some 2D molecular structures of kerogen have been proposed based on some characterization techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrospcoy. However, the physical and chemical properties of kerogen are essentially determined by its 3D stereochemical molecular configuration. In this work, according to the 2D molecular structure of Green River oil shale kerogen from literature, a 3D solid state model of kerogen was built based on molecular dynamics(MD) simulation method. The kerogen of Green River oil shale is a mixture of seven molecules that are held together by physical adsorption mechanism. This kerogen belongs to type I based on O/C (0.026) and H/C (1.57) ratios. An adsorption method was applied to combine the seven molecules together. By changing the adsorption sequences of the seven molecules, a total of 24 possible 3D nanocluster models of kerogen were obtained. Then the 3D nanocluster structure with the lowest energy was further applied to build the solid state model of kerogen at 298k under 1 atm based on a MD simulation method. The final 3D solid state model of kerogen was used to calculate the density, mechanical properties, NMR, IR and Raman spectra of kerogen. The theoretical results agree well with the experimental data. The density from the 3D structure was calculated as 0.968 g/cm3 which falls in the range of experimental results from 0.95 to 1.45 g/cm3. The calculated Young's modulus, Poisson ratio, compressibility, bulk modulus and shear modulus are 3.50 GPa, 0.25, 370.64 TPa-1, 2.63 GPa and 1.37 GPa respectively that matches the experimental results very well. The calculated spectral data are also in accord with the experimental results. These results will help us better understand the physical and chemical properties of Green River oil shale kerogen. Moreover, the calculated properties of kerogen can be applied to implement new techniques or improve existing methods for enhancing oil recovery from shale oil resources.

In daily industrial production of different plastic products we often have to deal with various errors that practically occur on the mold primarily as a result of tool wear and tear, improper storage and improper settings on the injection molding machine. In the testing phase of plastic materials we use many times different inserts that are made from standard tool steels, such as OCR12VM. In case of tool steel inserts after some years of usage a few micro-cracks can occur in the early stage, which can later quickly spread according to the applied loading. With the help of different non-destructive testing methods we know that we can most certainly detect possible formation of cracks on the tool steel inserts. The acoustic emission was measured on an injection mold with the visible sign of a crack on the cavity's surface, using two contact PZT sensors under normal and increased injection pressure loads. In this paper, we focused exclusively on the acoustic emission signal acquisition by using two resonant 150 kHz piezoelectric AE sensors on such tool steel inserts that are already affected by macro-cracks. On such tool steel insert the obtained acoustic emission results were compared with those obtained from a brand new tool steel insert. The final obtained acoustic emission results on the crack defected tool steel insert revealed as expected that the energy and intensity of the captured AE signals is higher compared with the ones that were captured on the brand new engraving insert under same processing conditions.","Acoustic Emission; Crack; Injection Molding; Mold; Polypropylene","Acoustic emissions; Crack detection; Cracks; Fungi; Injection molding; Materials testing; Molding; Molds; Nondestructive examination; Plastic products; Polypropylenes; Signal detection; Signal processing; Steel; Steel testing; Tool steel; Tools; Acoustic emission signal; Industrial production; Injection pressures; Nondestructive testing method; Plastic materials; Processing condition; Shrinkage behaviour; Thermoplastic materials; Acoustic emission testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957990207

Importantly, ATP synthetic capacity must be sufficient to support a wide range of energy demands with high rates of ATP generation and must not be associated with destabilization of cytosolic and intra-organelle chemical milieus. The latter characteristic is crucial if the performance of the contractile apparatus and intracellular organelles is to remain optimal over the broad range of cardiac work states required by a physically active organism. Hence, even a high rate of myocardial energy expenditure must not induce the fatigue that is known to develop in heavily working skeletal muscle. This chapter describes the ways in which the chemical energy stored in ingested carbon substrates (glucose, fatty acids, and, to a modest extent, proteins) is transferred to ATP and reviews some of the regulatory systems which integrate the function of these pathways and make them responsive to changes in ATP demand without destabilizing the intracellular chemical milieu. The generation of toxic by-products of the metabolic processes and mechanisms that limit their adverse effects are also reviewed. Last of all, the effects of several physiological states and diseases on these processes are briefly discussed, and the concept that the diseased heart may be energy limited is presented. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Adenosine triphosphate; Electron transport; Fatty acid metabolism; Glucose metabolism; Myocardial blood flow; Oxidative phosphorylation; Regulatory processes; Stable intracellular chemical milieu reactive oxygen species","Adenosinetriphosphate; Biochemistry; Blood; Body fluids; Enzyme activity; Glucose; Heart; Metabolism; Phosphates; Physiology; Electron transport; Fatty acid metabolism; Glucose metabolism; Myocardial blood flow; Oxidative phosphorylation; Reactive oxygen species; Regulatory process; Fatty acids",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957634580

The Greenhouse gas Laser Imaging Tomography Experiment (GreenLITE)-developed under a cooperative agreement with the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-attempts to improve monitoring capabilities of Ground Carbon Storage (GCS) sites. GreenLITE sensors are based on an intensity modulated continuous wave (IM-CW) approach developed at ITT (now part of Harris Corp.) in 2004. The GreenLITE system recently completed a remote deployment of nearly 4,000 hours at a GCS site in Illinois. It provided continuous, real-time spatial distribution maps of CO2 via an open web-based interface from February to August 2015. In early 2015 we began work on a new implementation of GreenLITE capable of providing similar measurements over a 25 km2 area and are planning to test the system over a 5 km range late summer 2015. If successful the system will be deployed in an urban environment late 2015, demonstrating the utility of real-time 2-D spatial mapping of CO2 concentrations at this scale. This paper will review the concept for this new measurement capability, including results from the 1 km system. Ultimately, the measurement concept can be adapted to other greenhouse gases such as CH4 and NO2. © 2015 SPIE.","Carbon; Laser Absorption Spectroscopy; Tomography","Absorption spectroscopy; Carbon; Gas lasers; Greenhouse gases; Mapping; Multimedia systems; Optical radar; Remote sensing; Spatial distribution; Spectrometers; Tomography; Cooperative agreements; Laser absorption spectroscopy; Measurement concepts; Monitoring capabilities; National Energy Technology Laboratory; Spatial distribution map; U.S. Department of Energy; Web-based interface; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957620882

These challenges are related in the supply side with the anticipated smart decarbonized grid, and in the demand side with the strict building performance regulations that require Zero Energy Buildings (ZEBs). Heat pumps, solar thermal collectors, photovoltaics and combined heat and power and thermal energy storage (TES) display the energy performance characteristics that can allow buildings to fulfill the ZEB agenda and integrate seamlessly with the smart grid. In the temperate climates of the Mediterranean region, those particular building energy technologies, either for new buildings or retrofits, can increase the flexibility provided by buildings and offer demand response services. For this demand response potential to be significant in high-performance buildings, it needs to be augmented by energy storage technologies.

Humans are inseparably linked to the existence of vegetables, as they are the source of several bioproducts essential for the survival of the animal kingdom. The importance of vegetables from the point of view of the food industry is determined by their complex chemical content that is important to the human body and includes organic substances (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and organic acids), phytoncides and antimicrobial substances, a high content of minerals (Ca, P, Fe, K, Mg, S, Cl, Zn, and Cu), and a high content of vitamins (A, B complex, C, E, F, K, P, and PP). The complex chemicals in vegetables have a favorable effect on the human body because they provide hydration due to their high water content, regulate metabolism in general, stimulate the muscular and skeletal systems, internal glands, and enzymatic activity, and have high nutritional and energy value. Vegetables are characterized by high nutritional density with low energy input and contain a variety of biological phytonutrients that make them an important part of the basic diet. It is recommended that vegetables be consumed fresh when their nutritional value is at its highest; some methods of processing and storage cause some water-soluble vitamins and nutrients to be lost. With energy from the sun, vegetables synthesize the basic compounds necessary for their survival (carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins), and a variety of organic phytochemicals can be extracted as raw materials that have important applications in dermatology, cosmetics, medicine, technology, and commerce. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,"Carbohydrates; Lipids; Nutrition; Organic minerals; Proteins; Vitamins; Antimicrobial substance; Chemical compositions; Complex chemicals; Enzymatic activities; High water content; Nutritional value; Organic substances; Water soluble vitamins; Vegetables",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957398670

Important insights can be obtained through microstructurally motivated modelling studies. With the drive for increased efficiency, there is a corresponding drive towards increasing operating temperatures in conventional power plant. With these increasing temperatures, and with the increased flexibility required of modern power plant working in a mixed energy economy, more robust material testing and modelling tools are required to accurately predict the response of power plant steels. This works deals with the development of a material model for a martensitic steel, P91, relevant to the range of temperatures typically seen in a modern power plant. High temperature (20, 400, 500, 600°C) tensile testing at various strain rates was carried out the steel. Tests were taken to failure and the stress strain response recorded. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is employed to determine the complex microstructure of the P91 material. This information is incorporated within a representative volume element (RVE) and a nonlinear, rate dependent, finite strain crystal plasticity model used to represent the deformation of the material. The material model was calibrated to each temperature and strain rate to give a robust physically based model that has been fully validated through experimental data.

The higher free energy and therefore the apparent high solubility of the amorphous phase are some of the advantages for promoting the amorphous phase, as compared to its crystalline counterpart. It is well known that the amorphous phase is thermodynamically unstable. This might result in the conversion of the metastable form to its stable crystalline form during storage. This conversion might also lead to product failure during storage owing to the poor dissolution properties of the crystalline form. Excipients can play a key role in preventing such a transformation during storage as well as maximizing the therapeutic efficacy of the amorphous material.

Although video data contains this information, analyzing it is a challenge esp. on portable devices that are constrained in energy and storage. A naïve solution is to sample and stream video to the cloud, where advanced algorithms can be used for analysis. However, this increases communication energy costs, making this approach impractical. In this article, we show how to reduce energy in such systems by employing simple on-device computations. In particular, we use a low-complexity feature-based image classifier to filter out unnecessary frames from video. To lower the processing energy and sustain a high throughput, we propose a hierarchically pipelined hardware architecture for the image classifier. Based on synthesis results from an ASIC in a 45 nm SOI process, we demonstrate that the classifier can achieve minimum-energy operation at a frame rate of 12 fps, while consuming only 3mJ of energy per frame.

However, hydrogen as an energy carrier and chemical element can be obtained by several methods such as reforming and gasification of fossil fuel or electrolysis of water. Hydrogen from renewable energy sources is a clean and sustainable way to satisfy the world demand of this element. As hydrogen is mostly used in the industry where electrical energy is needed to run the various production machines, design of stand-alone photovoltaic system for both clean electrical energy and hydrogen production is proposed in this chapter as an environmentally friendly and zero-emission solution. This system, which constituted principally with a photovoltaic array, electrolyser, compressor, fuel cell and hydrogen tank storage, has a DC bus bar, AC bus bar and hydrogen piping. The latter connects in the same time the electrolyser to the hydrogen demand and storage tank, and the storage tank to the hydrogen demand and fuel cell. The mismatch between the intermittent solar irradiation and the time-varying of both electrical energy and hydrogen demands impacts the system performances and increases the system cost. In this context, optimal energy and hydrogen management strategy with a hysteresis band scheme is investigated to achieve high system efficiency with rational cost.

The latter become a significant part of the semiconductor market especially in the last decade as a result of the rapid market expansion of the portable systems (Lu 2010). Introduced also in the late sixties, the â€œcharge trapâ€(CT) memory refers to a device structure and operating principles similar to those of a FG memory. The main difference between these two kinds of NVMs is that the charges are stored in a conducting material(usually a doped polysilicon layer)in the case of the FG memories, while for the CT memories charge storage takes place in localized traps within a dielectric layer(typically made of silicon nitride).As recalled in Sect.3.2 of this chapter, the CT memories have been the focus of intense research and product development since the early demonstration of MNOS devices.In recent years, they benefited from remarkable advances in thin film technology and charge-trap engineering, which have increased their potential to move from niche applications(e.g., smartcards, specific space and military systems) to mass applications guided today by the growing demands of the portable market. The conventional FG memories, despite their leading role in NVMs, are facing a number of challenges as scaling continues beyond the 22Ânm technology node (to date at 19â€“16Ânm, third Q 2014).Severe issues are the floating-gate interference effect between adjacent memory cells, the patterning costs and the reduction of the tunnel oxide thickness (Mark 2013;Libsch and White 1990).Compared to the FG memories, the advantages of the CT memories in terms of scalability and fabrication requirements (and thus in production costs) make them particularly attractive for the further development of ultra-scaled NVMs for both standalone and embedded applications. In addition to the brief historical outline and state of the art of the CT memories presented in Sect.3.2, two technological options related to the use of the low-energy (LE) Si ion-implantation technique for achieving improved CT memories are described in Sects. 3.3 and 3.4. Section 3.3 reports on the development of CT devices using a nitride layer with an embedded thin band of Si nanoparticles, while Sect. 3.4 deals with CT devices employing a control oxide layer obtained by low-temperature oxidation of LE Si-implanted nitride film.These technological options are part of our investigations we conducted the last 20 years in the field of NVMs. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Commerce; Dielectric materials; Military applications; Nitrides; Nonvolatile storage; Semiconductor device manufacture; Silicon; Silicon nitride; Smart cards; Conducting materials; Embedded application; Low-temperature oxidation; Material technologies; Semi-conductor market; Si ion implantations; Thin-film technology; Tunnel oxide thickness; Flash memory",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956485979

The earthquake and resulting tsunami that severely damaged Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on March 11, 2011, raised questions in Congress about the disaster's possible implications for nuclear safety regulation, U. S. nuclear energy expansion, and radioactive waste policy. The tsunami knocked out electric power at the six-reactor plant, resulting in the overheating of several reactor cores, loss of cooling in spent fuel storage pools, major hydrogen explosions, and releases of radioactive material into the environment. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued orders to U.S. nuclear plants March 12, 2012, to begin implementing safety improvements in response to Fukushima. Significant incentives for new commercial reactors were included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05, P.L. 109-58), such as tax credits and loan guarantees. Together with volatile fossil fuel prices and the possibility of greenhouse gas controls, the federal incentives for nuclear power helped spur renewed interest by utilities and other potential reactor developers. License applications for as many as 31 new reactors were announced, and NRC issued licenses for four reactors at two plant sites in early 2012. However, falling natural gas prices, safety concerns raised by the Fukushima accident, and other changing circumstances have made it unlikely that many more of the proposed nuclear projects will move toward construction in the near term. Four U.S. reactors were permanently closed in 2013, and another shutdown has been announced for late 2014. Three reactors were closed because of the need for major repairs, and the other two because electricity prices fell below their generating costs. DOE's nuclear energy research and development program includes advanced reactors, fuel cycle technology and facilities, and infrastructure support. The Obama Administration's FY2015 funding request for nuclear energy research and development totaled $863.4 million. Including advanced reactors, fuel cycle technology, infrastructure support, and safeguards and security, the total nuclear energy request was $25.0 million (2.9%) below the FY2014 funding level. The House approved $826.7 million (H.R. 4923), while the Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development Appropriations recommended $777.0 million. Disposal of highly radioactive waste has been one of the most controversial aspects of nuclear power. The Obama Administration halted work on a long-planned waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future (BRC) to recommend new approaches to the waste problem. The BRC issued its final report to the Secretary of Energy on January 26, 2012. In response to the BRC report, and to provide an outline for a new nuclear waste program, DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste in January 2013. The DOE strategy calls for a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites, similar to recommendations by the BRC. No funding has been requested or appropriated since FY2011 to continue NRC licensing of the Yucca Mountain repository, although the House voted to provide DOE with $150.0 million and NRC $55.0 million for Yucca Mountain licensing activities in FY2015. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Radioactive contamination from the Fukushima plant forced the evacuation of communities up to 25 miles away and affected up to 100,000 residents, although it did not cause any immediate deaths. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) operates the Fukushima nuclear power complex in the Futaba district of Fukushima prefecture in Northern Japan, consisting of six nuclear units at the Fukushima Daiichi station and four nuclear units at the Fukushima Daini station. All the units at the Fukushima complex are boiling water reactors, with reactors 1 to 5 at the Fukushima Daiichi site being the General Electric Mark I design, which is also used in the United States. The Fukushima Daiichi reactors entered commercial operation in the years from 1971 (reactor 1) to 1979 (reactor 6). The Fukushima Daini reactors shut down automatically after the earthquake and were able to maintain sufficient cooling. When the earthquake struck, Fukushima Daiichi units 1, 2, and 3 were generating electricity and shut down automatically. The earthquake caused offsite power supplies to be lost, and backup diesel generators started up as designed to supply backup power. However, the subsequent tsunami flooded the electrical switchgear for the diesel generators, causing most AC power in units 1 to 4 to be lost. Because Unit 4 was undergoing a maintenance shutdown, all of its nuclear fuel had been removed and placed in the unit's spent fuel storage pool. One generator continued operating to cool units 5 and 6. The loss of all AC power in units 1 to 3 prevented valves and pumps from operating that were needed to remove heat and pressure that was being generated by the radioactive decay of the nuclear fuel in the reactor cores. As the fuel rods in the reactor cores overheated, they reacted with steam to produce large amounts of hydrogen, which escaped into the unit 1, 3, and 4 reactor buildings and exploded (the hydrogen that exploded in Unit 4 is believed to have come from Unit 3). The explosions interfered with efforts by plant workers to restore cooling and helped spread radioactivity. Cooling was also lost in the reactors' spent fuel pools, although recent analysis has found that no significant overheating took place. Radioactive material released into the atmosphere produced extremely high radiation dose rates near the plant and left large areas of land uninhabitable, especially to the northwest of the plant. Contaminated water from the plant was discharged into the sea, creating international controversy. The United States and other countries, as well as the International Atomic Energy Agency, are providing assistance to Japan to deal with the nuclear disater. U.S. assistance has included transport of pumps, boron, fresh water, remote cameras, use of Global Hawk surveillance drones, evacuation support, medical support, and decontamination and radiation monitoring equipment. Studies of the Fukushima disaster have identified design changes, response actions, and other safety improvements that could have reduced or eliminated the amount of radioactivity released from the plant. As a result, Fukushima has prompted a reexamination of nuclear plant safety requirements around the world, including in the United States. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

That path is called a supply or distribution chain. The upstream portion of the chain includes the journey of each active and inactive ingredient and their chemical components to the manufacturer that creates the finished drug product. The downstream chain, which this report addresses, includes the repackagers, wholesale distributors, associated storage and transport companies, and, finally, the dispenser. Dispensers include independent community or chain pharmacies, hospitals or other health care facilities, and physicians' offices. Usually the supply chain provides consumers with unadulterated prescription drugs. However, the chain is potentially vulnerable, and when it breaks, a dispenser might provide a counterfeit product containing no active ingredient, less-than-labeled dosage, or a dangerous substitution. The dispenser might also provide a mishandled or diverted drug that has become sub- or superpotent or has gone past its expiration date. In addition to the potential harm to patients, these security breaches can affect a manufacturer's reputation and financial bottom line. Congress has addressed pharmaceutical supply chain security several times over the past 107 years. The 1906 Food and Drugs Act focused on labeling; the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA) addressed adulteration, misbranding, and the registration and inspection of manufacturing establishments; and the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA, P.L. 100- 293) required that wholesale distributors be licensed by the states and required that a wholesale distributor, except one in a specified ongoing relationship with the manufacturer, provide to the purchasing distributor or dispenser a statement-called a pedigree- ""identifying each prior sale, purchase, or trade of such drug."" More recently, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA, P.L. 110-85) required the ecretary to ""develop standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the drug supply chain against ounterfeit, diverted, subpotent, substandard, adulterated, misbranded, or expired drugs""; and, in 2012, the Food and Drug Administration afety and Innovation Act (FDASIA, P.L. 112-144) expanded registration and reporting requirements. Despite current federal law and actions y state legislatures, opportunities for breaches of the supply chain continue to exist. The 112th and 113th Congresses have worked to craft set of national requirements that would protect both patient and manufacturer, and allow the assignment of accountability for identified roblems, while attempting to manage cost and avoiding a confusing patchwork of state legislation. In their work, House and Senate olicymakers have been considering many decisions. These include, for example, definitions; pedigrees; track-and-trace technologies; erialization; lot- and unit-level requirements; authentication; interoperable data collection and systems; data confidentiality and ccess; requirements for transaction reporting and notification regarding suspect deliveries; implementation timing; licensure, egistration, and accreditation standards for entities in the supply chain; accountability; cost; and the relationship between federal and tate laws. After passing individual bills (H.R. 1919 and S. 959), majority and minority leadership of the House Committee on Energy and ommerce and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions announced an agreement on September 25, 2013.

Skeletal structure and function The skeletal system is vital to life. It plays an essential role in mineral metabolism, movement, protection of viscera, endocrine regulation of critical biologic processes (energy metabolism, male phenotype and fertility, ion homeostasis), and the storage and nourishment of hematopoietic marrow. To accommodate these demands the skeletal system is complex and composed of 206 organs, namely, the individual bones of the body, and a variety of different cell and tissue types (Fig. 1.1). Bones are intricate living structures that have the unique capacity to undergo constant remodeling throughout life. This special biology forms the foundation of its growth and development, its ability to change its structure, function, and metabolism in response to biomechanic and systemic requirements, and its remarkable proficiency in repairing itself, often completely, in the setting of skeletal injury (1). © Paul K.

With regard to Australia, the issue of coal industry sustainability took on a more urgent tone in July 2012 when the Australian Government passed into law its Clean Energy Act of 2012, which included a policy known as the Carbon Pricing Mechanism (CPM) for taxing CO2 CO2 by large domestic emitters of CO2. But scarcely two years later, on July 17, 2014, the Australian Senate voted to repeal the CPM elements of the Clean Energy Act. The repeal of the CPM left Australia without a mechanism for pricing CO2 emissions, and the pitched political battles over the CPM (see Chapter 6) have highlighted the tensions around coal and climate change that still exist in the country. As a developed economy, Australia arguably is in a better position to afford the high cost of regulating GHG emissions than most emerging economies of Asia. On the other hand, coal exports and coal-fired power contribute significantly to Australia’s economy, creating important constituencies opposed to the carbon tax. Industry concerns coupled with a sometimes ham-handed rollout of the CPM program turned it into a political liability and ultimately contributed to its repeal (see Chapter 6). The demonstrated ability of Australia’s black coal industry to implement advanced, productivity enhancing technologies, would seem to make Australia a logical candidate to lead in the development and implementation of technologies for reducing the GHG footprint of coal use. And indeed, Australia has led to varying degrees in the development of three such technologies - coal bed methane (CBM) extraction, underground coal gasification (UCG), and CO2 capture and storage (CCS) - which are assessed in detail in this chapter. These three technologies, which are at different stages of development, face different regulatory regimes, and have different cost structures and economic drivers in the absence of GHG emission regulation. At the present time, CBM extraction is by far the most economically attractive on its own merits, and as a result it has developed into a significant success story in Australia over the past decade. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954190180

However, the convertible power is often limited and discontinuous which requires the need of an energy storage unit. If this unit (and thus the whole system) is de-energized, the start-up process may take a significant amount of time because of an inefficient energy harvesting process.

Several hardware implementations were previously suggested in the literature with the goal of improving the performance, area, or both. In this paper, a new hardware implementation of the RC4 algorithm using FPGA is proposed. The main idea of this design is the use of a dual-port block RAM in the FPGA in order to better utilize the available logic and memory resources. Combined with a new pipelined hardware implementation, the new design achieves better performance. The design is described using Verilog HDL and synthesized and implemented using Xilinx ISE suite for different FPGA devices. Synthesis results show that the proposed design achieves higher efficiency than previous implementations by reducing area while maintaining a good throughput/LUT ratio. The proposed design is also more efficient in terms of power consumption. © 2015 The Authors.","Area; Block RAM; Cryptography; FPGA; Pipelining; Power; RC4 stream cipher; Throughput","Cryptography; Design; Energy efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; Network security; Pipe linings; Random access storage; Reconfigurable hardware; Throughput; Area; Block rams; FPGA implementations; Hardware implementations; Pipelined hardware; Power; Security protocols; Stream Ciphers; Integrated circuit design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954124327

In order to study systems at a variety of physical scales - from individual buildings to distribution systems - interconnected through these energy infrastructures, NREL is developing an Integrated Energy System Model (IESM), with an initial focus on the electricity system. Today's electricity grid is the most complex system ever built - and the future grid is likely to be even more complex because it will incorporate distributed energy resources (DERs) such as wind, solar, and various other sources of generation and energy storage. The complexity is further augmented by the possible evolution to new retail market structures that would provide incentives to owners of DERs to support the grid. The IESM can be used to understand and test the impact of new retail market structures and technologies such as DERs, demand-response equipment, and energy management systems on the system's ability to provide reliable electricity to all customers. The IESM is composed of a power flow simulator (GridLAB-D), building and appliance models including home energy management system implemented using either GAMS or Pyomo, a market layer, and is able to include hardware-in-the-loop simulation (testing appliances such as air conditioners, dishwashers, etc.). The IESM is a system-of-systems (SoS) simulator wherein the constituent systems are brought together in a virtual testbed. We will describe an SoS approach for developing a distributed simulation environment. We will elaborate on the methodology and the control mechanisms used in the co-simulation illustrated by a case study. © Society of Computer Simulation International.","Co-simulation; DEVS; Discrete-event simulation; GridLAB-D; Integrated energy systems; Optimization; Smart grid; System-of-systems","Air conditioning; Commerce; Discrete event simulation; Electric energy storage; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Energy resources; Optimization; Sales; Smart power grids; System of systems; Traction (friction); Cosimulation; DEVS; Distributed Energy Resources; Distributed simulation environments; Energy infrastructures; Home energy management systems; Integrated energy systems; Smart grid; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954096154

Researchers have suggested that a PCM's thermal energy storage capability is linked to its thermal properties, yet this connection has not yet been quantified. This study first uses group theory and known values from literature to obtain the thermophysical properties for a variety of paraffins and unsaturated acids. Then, multiphysics-based finite element analysis (FEA) is applied to determine the influence of these thermophysical properties on the PCM latent heat storage capability for a side heating configuration. The FEA models include melting and re-solidification, natural convection, conduction, and the monitoring of input and output periodic heat fluxes. The phase change was achieved through application of temperature-dependent viscosity and heat capacity relations. The thermal energy storage efficiency is defined as one minus the ratio of integrated output heat flux to the integrated input heat flux. The FEA results are used to provide predictions of thermal energy storage for a variety of PCMs for various aspect ratios under different heating conditions. Insights are gained in relating thermal storage efficiency to the system configuration.

However, the addition of nanoparticles to a base fluid is known to result in an increase in viscosity. An increase in viscosity can suppress convective currents, reducing overall heat transfer thus it necessary to quantify the impact of nanoparticle addition on the viscosity of a PCM. In this work nanoparticle enhanced phase change mateirals are synthesized using paraffin and three different types of nanoparticles: Exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (xGNP), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and herringbone graphite nanofibers (HGNF). The particles are loaded at rates between 0.0024wt% to 0.1wt%. The viscosity is analyzed at temperatures between 60 and 100°C. The influence of temperature, nanoparticle type and nanoparticle loading level on viscosity are presented and discussed. The results show that for xGNP and HGNF within the operating condition studied here that there is no impact of the nanoparticle addition on the viscosity of the base material.

These units are most of the time heavily underutilized, where the fans within the units are still consuming energy circulating air without actually providing cooling. In more modern facilities such fans are equipped with variable frequency drives, which can reduce substantially the energy consumption if proper controls are implemented. While there have several solutions for controlling and optimizing such variable frequency drive operated air conditioning units, control systems without variable frequency drives (discrete on/off ACU controls) have not been addressed thoroughly.

By 2030, LED lightbulbs will be more plentiful, projected to drive a 40% reduction in energy [1]. Yet today's LED lightbulbs have bulky heat sinks that do not leverage modern thermal management techniques. Reducing the size of the heat sink offers lower cost and increased energy efficiency. To leverage modern techniques, it is valuable to understand how thermal performance degrades light quality as people utilize lights over weeks and months. However, using current data acquisition systems to obtain such massive data sets is expensive, time-consuming, and cable-ridden. We have developed a robust ground-to-cloud system to acquire temperature and luminosity data for building lighting systems. The data acquisition units are small and may be positioned in existing lighting installations. During acquisition, data is backed up automatically. Usability studies demonstrate that novice users can configure an experiment in less than four minutes.

In data management, system performance means acceptable response time and throughput on critical-path operations, ideally with scalability guarantees. Performance is improved with top-of-the line research on data processing algorithms; efficiency, however, is contingent on seamless collaboration between the database software and hardware and storage devices. In 1980, the goal was to minimize disk accesses; in 2000, memory replaced disks in terms of access costs. Nowadays performance is synonymous to scalability; scalability, in turn, translates into sustainable and predictable use of hardware resources in the face of embarrassing parallelism and deep storage hierarchies while minimizing energy needs - a challenging goal in multiple dimensions. We discuss work done in the past four decades to tighten the interaction between the database software and underlying hardware and show that, as application and microarchitecture roadmaps evolve, the effort of maintaining smooth collaboration blossoms into a multitude of interesting research avenues with direct technological impact. © 2015 VLDB Endowment 2150-8097/15/08.",,"Application programs; Computer architecture; Data handling; Database systems; Digital storage; Hardware; Query processing; Reconfigurable hardware; Scalability; Virtual storage; Data processing algorithms; Database software; Hardware resources; Micro architectures; Minimizing energy; Multiple dimensions; System architectures; Transaction processing; Information management",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953874676

The knowledge gained from these sectors could be adapted for the improvement of food products, such as for applications in food safety and quality (e.g., detecting pesticides and microorganism identification), encapsulation, improving the efficiency of delivery of nutraceutical and bioactive compounds, and packing systems and food storage. The nanoscale devices are often manufactured with the view to imitate the nanodevices found in nature; one way to get these results is by means of the biosensors to detect, among others, proteins, DNA, enzymes, cells, membranes, and other natural biomolecules used as bioreceptors and selecting the right transduction method (electrochemical, mechanical, or optical) in order to get more sensitive, specific, and real-time results. This chapter provides an introduction to the nanosensor field including specific consideration of three main application areas (food, environmental, and pharmaceutical); it also describes the typical biosensor assay format used and is subsequently structured according to the biorecognition elements used (i.e., enzymes, cellular structures/cells, antibody/antigen, nucleic acids/DNA, bacteriophages).

Such a grid not only has to rely on predicting electricity production, but also its consumption. A growing body of literature exists on the topic of energy consumption and demand forecasting. Many contributions consist of presenting a methodology, and showing its accuracy. This paper goes beyond this common practice on two levels: first, by comparing two regression techniques to a univariate autoregressive baseline and second, by evaluating the models in term of industrial applicability, in close collaboration with domain experts.

While some concerned about climate change urge a rapid expansion of nuclear power to facilitate a shift away from fossil fuels (e.g. Caldeira et al. 2013), others argue for a decisive rejection of nuclear energy, especially in the wake of Fukushima and ongoing difficulties with the storage of long-lived nuclear waste (e.g. Yucca Mountain). Interestingly, much of the argument on both sides is overtly ethical, highlighting obligations to the most vulnerable and to future generations. The nuclear community accepts that its work raises ethical questions and promotes various standards, based on explicit ethical principles, to address them. Given its influence on national and international energy policy, this system is likely to come under increasing scrutiny in the years ahead, as the debate between pro- and anti-nuclear positions intensifies. Still, on the whole, the community appears satisfied with its current approach. For instance, after an important report by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), one commentator declared that “the system of protection established by and large in its present form several decades ago has reached a certain level of maturity [such that] no major changes to radiological protection regulations … should be necessary” (Wrixon 2008: 161, 167; emphasis added), while ICRP itself stated that it expected publication “to lead to a clear understanding and wide acceptance” of its approach (Clarke and Valentin 2009: 98). In my view, such confidence is premature, at least when it comes to nuclear energy. Serious questions persist about how the current principles are formulated, understood, and implemented, and there are also major gaps in the present system. As a result, a new approach is needed to protect nuclear policy from several standing threats. Here I pursue a pluralist, ""bottom up"" strategy for identifying guiding principles of nuclear ethics, resulting in the introduction of a number of new principles and fresh interpretations of existing ones. My proposals challenge the existing system by raising specific alternatives. © 2015, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952779396

Today, the compulsator is the best approach for achieving compact energy storage and pulsed power generation for multi-MJ, multi-GW applications requiring voltages of up to 15-20 kV and discharge durations between 1 and 10 milliseconds. Electromagnetic railguns, coil launchers, and directed energy systems requiring high-power, high-energy pulsed-power in compact form are ideal candidate loads for compulsators. Since the initial validation of compulsator theory in the late 1970's, a transition from iron-core to air-core magnetic circuits and the associated incorporation of composite materials and self-excitation has provided substantial increases in both stored energy density and power density [1]. On a per unit mass basis, the current state of the art is more than 1 kW/g peak power in a machine that provides greater than 10 J/g inertial energy storage [2]. While the advancement has been significant, further gains in compactness are possible by exploiting continued innovation in the topology of the machine, the mode in which it operates, and by developing new technologies specifically for compulsator application. This paper focuses on practical machine topologies that offer promise for obtaining higher specific energy and power. The evaluation presented also contemplates current and potential future improvements in compulsator component technologies, including composite materials and switching devices that can substantially impact the magnitude of possible improvements as well as the selection of the most promising topology. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Composite materials; Electric discharges; Energy storage; Magnetic circuits; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Rail guns; Synchronous generators; Component technologies; Directed Energy Systems; Discharge duration; Electromagnetic rail guns; Future improvements; High-energy pulsed; Pulsed alternator; Switching devices; Topology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952040638

During this time, the system was developed and designed by Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM (SNLA) in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Extensive reliability testing was performed at SNLA on the First Article NIF Test Module (FANTM) test facility and design improvements were implemented based on FANTM test results, leading to the final design presently undergoing system reliability testing at LLNL. Low-cost energy-storage capacitors, charging power supplies, and reliable, fault-tolerant components were developed through partnerships with numerous contractors. Extensive reliability and fault testing of components has also been performed. This paper will provide an overview of the many efforts that have culminated in the final design of the NIF PCS.

Their enduring use testifies to a robust design. Today energy storage capacitors having a lower equivalent series inductance (ESL) will contribute to increasing the power capability of new or revised pulsed power machines. Lower ESL coupled with an improved terminal configuration for better integration with the system design, will produce faster discharge times and lower driver impedance, making higher power systems more sensible and energy efficient. A lower ESL capacitor that is compatible with existing proven hardware will also make upgrading more cost effective. This paper discusses the establishment of standardized test methods for determining the inductance of different SCYLLAC style energy storage capacitors; for example Maxwell Type C capacitors, which are now manufactured by General Atomics Energy Products, a part of Sorrento Electronics, and units from Aerovox. The effects leading to imprecision in inductance measurements will be noted. The inductance of existing designs will be compared with new hardware compatible prototype configurations with a goal of reducing the inductance up to 50%. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Cost effectiveness; Electric discharges; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Testing; Energy efficient; Energy products; Energy storage capacitor; Equivalent series inductance; General atomics; Power capability; Robust designs; Standardized tests; Inductance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952012294

The spinning toroids are observed to be stable in atmosphere with no confining magnetic fields. Spinning toroids have the appearance of spheres, or balls, and create bright light through collisions with neutrals in the atmosphere. The spinning toroids are observed to last for more than 200 milliseconds in partial atmosphere. This paper describes the initiation apparatus and parameters. An explanation for the plasma toroid is presented that it is a hollow toroid of electrons where all the electrons travel in parallel paths orthogonal to the toroid circumference and reside in a thin outer shell of the toroid. The electron motion creates a current in the surface that in turn creates an internal magnetic field. Equations are presented detailing the initiation of the plasma toroid, and detailing the plasma toroid itself. The stability analysis for the plasma toroid has been completed that explains how the plasma toroid remains stable in atmosphere. The spinning plasma toroid has the appearance of Ball Lightning, in observations, computer simulations, and equations. The plasma toroid explains how a plasma ring can be stable in atmosphere with no external magnetic fields, and how it can contain many electrons with high energy. Ball lightning is often reported as a ring current, in toroid shape, and since a spinning ring appears as a sphere or ball, the spinning plasma toroid provides an explanation for Ball Lightning. The technology of the plasma toroid has the potential for new applications in propulsion and energy generation and storage. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Electric arcs; Electrons; Lightning; Magnetic fields; Plasma diagnostics; Plasma stability; Ball lightning; Confining magnetic-field; Electron motion; Energy generations; External magnetic field; Internal magnetic fields; New applications; Stability analysis; Magnetoplasma",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951982153

Until recently, most drilling parameters were derived from load measurements taken on supporting structures or equipment related to the drillstring - but not actually a part of the string. The remote position of these classic sensors from the desired load often resulted in unacceptable error rates. SPE/IADC 163475 proposed a direct measurement system, designed by integrating drilling instrumentation into a standard top drive internal blow out preventer (IBOP). The instrumented IBOP (IIBOP) makes direct-load measurements of drilling parameters along the drillstring - just below the main shaft of the top drive - thereby circumventing the errors of the traditional measurements. This provides the timely, directly measured data needed to characterize drillstring phenomena required for drilling and equipment optimization purposes, without the mechanical losses of the traveling system. The system's primary purpose is to provide early warning signs of system failure or well control situations and to enable better decision making with regards to well construction. The previous paper presented examples of the data captured during initial field trials. Since that time, the sensor system has been run on multiple wells, achieving more than a year of cumulative data collected and analyzed by drilling experts. This paper reviews the extension, uptake, and applications of the technology, and presents case studies to demonstrate the use of direct drillstring data, with emphasis on lessons learned from high-speed data analysis for drillstring dynamics. Initial results demonstrate that the improved measurements provide more accurate values for surface mechanical specific energy (MSE), which is used to optimize applied drilling parameters such as weight on bit (WOB) and top drive rotation speed in revolutions per minute (RPM) for increased rate of penetration (ROP) and reduced risk of equipment failures. Additionally, improved measurements permit better friction factor estimations for greater knowledge of torque and drag effects on the drilling process, allowing drillers to initiate remedial actions earlier, and safely deliver longer extended-reach wells. The system's high-speed torque data has been used to compare the makeup and breakout torque of individual drillpipe connections. It has also been used to indicate drilling dysfunctions such as stick-slip and improve the understanding of drillstring dynamics. Examples of drilling data will be presented, along with case histories illustrating how this technology improves real-time drilling operations.

A particular emphasis of this scaling study is the comparison between the TAMU DPF and the DPF 6.5 results from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in 1973. The capacitor bank for the TAMU machine stores 460 kJ at a charge voltage of 60 kV. It can deliver > 3 MA into a plasma focus load with a rise time of ∼5 μs. Physically, this bank is divided into six modules of 24 capacitors with 44.4 μF of capacitance per bank. The energy storage at full voltage is < 80 kJ per module. The energy storage per capacitor is ∼∼3.3 kJ/can, and their reversal rating is 80%. Each module is discharged through a single high-current rail switch. The six modules deliver their current to the plasma focus load through 72, RG-17/14 coaxial cables. The primary neutron yield detectors for this facility are the silver detectors developed at Los Alamos that use four geiger tubes in a (30 cm x 30 cm x 15 cm) block of polyethylene and 0.254 mm thick silver foils.

Each ""opening switch"" is a toroid of ferrite material going around a single turn of the energy storage solenoid. Each small toroid of ferrite material is wrapped with several turns of wire. As the energy storage inductor is charged the ferrite material is driven into saturation. When a trigger pulse is sent through the wire around the ferrite material, the ferrite is driven out of saturation; thereby causing that section of a single tum to have a high impedance compared to the load. Conducting leads located on either side of each opening switch are attached to a common load. Each lead has a blocking device such as a spark gap or diode to prohibit current flow into the load circuit until the device is triggered. When the switches are all opened simultaneously, the current in the storage inductor is transferred to the load with a voltage characteristic of the load and/or the opening time of the switches. The leads are connected in parallel so N times the current in the energy storage coil is delivered to the load. This technique can store energy at greater than 10 megajoules/m3 and possibly as high as 100 megajoules/m3. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Electric inductors; Energy storage; Ferrite; Time switches; Current flows; Ferrite materials; High impedance; Opening switch; Opening time; Spark-gaps; Trigger pulse; Voltage characteristics; Storage (materials)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951939646

The model predictive controller was based on a load shifting algorithm for an ice storage system. The financial benefits produced by implementation of this controller over the current state of the art in ice bank load shifting control was simulated in a day ahead real time electricity pricing forecast environment. This real time electricity price was inferred from the cost of electricity in the Irish wholesale market. Multiple ice bank charge levels were simulated in order to quantity the performance of the two control methods for varying operating conditions such as; ambient temperature and milk cooling load. A milk production model was employed for milk yield profiling and load simulation. Both economic and energy saving benefits were found by simulating the operation of the model predictive controller for a dynamic electricity pricing tariff. The monetary savings achieved for high ice bank charges were low, but as the desired charge level was dropped the savings potential increased. This resulted in fluctuating cost saving as the cooling load is based on a seasonal variation. It was found that the benefits produced by the model predictive controller depended on the sizing of the ice bank, the electricity pricing profile and the milk cooling load. An overall mean cost saving of 6.1% was produced over a full milking season.","Dairy machinery; Energy modelling; Optimisation","Agriculture; Air conditioning; Cooling; Costs; Economics; Energy conservation; Ice; Ice control; Machinery; Power markets; Cost of electricity; Dynamic Electricity Tariffs; Electricity pricing; Energy modelling; Energy-saving benefits; Model predictive controllers; Operating condition; Optimisations; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951926783

This system incorporates high-performance components that are closely coupled and integrated into an extremely compact assembly. Low profile, custom ceramic capacitors with coplanar extended electrodes provide primary energy storage. Low-inductance, spark-gap switches incorporate miniature gas cavities imbedded within the central region of the annular shaped capacitors, with very thin dielectric sections separating the energy storage capacitors. Carefully shaped electrodes and insulator surfaces are used throughout to minimize field enhancements, reduce fields at triple-point regions, and enable operation at stress levels closer to the intrinsic breakdown limits of the dielectric materials. Specially shaped resistors and inductors are used for charging and isolation during operation. Forward-coupling ceramic capacitors are connected across successive switch-capacitor-switch stages to assist in switching. Pressurized SF6 gas is used for electrical insulation in the spark-gap switches and throughout the unit. The pressure housing is constructed entirely of dielectric materials, with segments that interlock with the low-profile switch bodies to provide an integrated support structure for all of the components.

Microgrids provide several advantages such as power quality control, uninterrupted power supply and integration of renewable resources. However, microgrids are increasingly connected to the Internet for remote control and management, which makes them susceptible to cyber attacks. To address this issue, several pilot deployments have implemented bolt-on security mechanisms, typically focused on securing the protocols used in microgrids. Unfortunately, these solutions are inadequate because they fail to address some important cyber security requirements. This chapter describes the μGridSec methodology, which is intended to provide comprehensive cyber security solutions for microgrid deployments.

Shaw Lane, East Lansing, Ml  48824, United States","Due to the greater demand in bioenergy and bio-based products, feedstock supply chain optimization is critical to decrease the logistics costs. As a primary phase in the biomass feedstock supply logistics, the storage of harvested biomass can directly affect transportation cost, biomass quality and its combustion efficiency. A model structured with linear programming was developed to determine an optimized biomass preprocessing, storage, and transportation strategy. The optimization model was applied in a simulated case study for an energy plant in Michigan. The results indicated that lower supply chain logistics costs and higher feedstock quality could be achieved by applying an optimized supply chain strategy while simultaneously meeting the feedstock user's demand. The sensitivity analysis indicated that transportation distance had no impact on the supply chain logistics strategy. The additional profit brought by higher quality biomass can offset the increased transportation cost for up to 151 miles. Through biomass MC increases, logging residue pile is always the preferred storage method. The impact of biomass moisture content (MC) is concluded to be more significant when it is higher. Through the increase of biomass MC, more biomass is required to satisfy the same energy demand. In average, every 1% increase in biomass MC can result in $760.68 increase in total cost and 52.1 more green tons biomass to satisfy the four-month energy demands.

Plasmonic local heating can provide solutions to several challenges in data storage and cancer treatment. Research conducted in this field to achieve plasmonic local heating has mainly utilized the excitation of localized surface plasmon (LSP) or surface plasmon resonance (SPR). However, achieving plasmonic local heating by the excitation of magnetic polariton (MP) has not been researched extensively yet. We numerically investigate the optical response of a nanostructure composed of a gold nanowire on a gold surface separated by a polymer spacer using the ANSYS High Frequency Structural Simulator (HFSS). The structure exhibits a strong absorption peak at the wavelength of 750 nm, and the underlying physical mechanism is verified by the local electromagnetic field distribution to be the magnetic resonance excitation. By incorporating the volume loss density due to the strong local optical energy confinement as the heat generation, nanoscale temperature distribution within the structure is numerically obtained with a thermal solver after assigning proper boundary conditions. The results show a maximum temperature of 158.5°C confined in a local area on the order of 35 nm within the ultrathin polymer layer, which clearly demonstrates the plasmonic local heating effect beyond diffraction limit by excitation of MP. © 2015 SPIE.","Local heating; Magnetic resonance; Nanowires; Plasmonics","Diffraction; Digital storage; Electric excitation; Electromagnetic fields; Gold; Heating; Magnetic resonance; Magnetism; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Nanowires; Optical properties; Phonons; Photons; Quantum theory; Resonance; Surface plasmon resonance; Diffraction limits; Electromagnetic field distribution; High energy densities; Local heating; Localized surface plasmon; Maximum temperature; Plasmonics; Resonance excitation; Plasmons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951823351

Second generation biofuels, which are mostly based on lignocellulosic biomass, have gained great attention in recent years. Size reduction of the lignocellulosic biomass is a key step to the efficiency of downstream processes (i.e., pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation), which will affect the yield of ethanol significantly. However, size reduction consumes considerable energy itself, it is an expensive process and needs to be optimized. Some studies have been done on corn stover size reduction, but none of them have examined the initial particle size of feedstock as a variable, and they failed to take the biomass harvest and storage conditions and downstream process requirements into consideration when setting the variables. The objective of this research was to study the effect of initial particle size of corn stover, moisture content, and screen size on energy consumption of corn stover size reduction. Consequently, these results should be generally applicable over a range of conditions that are affected by corn stover harvest and storage conditions and downstream processing.","Biofuels; Corn","Agriculture; Alternative fuels; Biofuels; Biomass; Energy utilization; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Particle size; Biomass harvest; Corn; Corn-based ethanol; Downstream process; Downstream-processing; Lignocellulosic biomass; Second generation; Storage condition; Size determination",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951793823

Pulse signal form was used to measure the Time of Flight (TOF) parameter comparing three different calculation methods: setting a threshold value, measuring the time between energy envelope peaks and between the centroids of the envelopes. The comparison showed the different applicability of the methods, including estimation of the acoustic dispersion phenomenon, which is one of the major drawbacks of ultrasonic testing of food materials. In the second experiment, TOF was estimated via cross-correlation based on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) of the input chirp signal and the response signal. The results of this method support the findings of the first experiment. Also, high correlations between signal amplitude vs. storage time and signal energy vs. storage time were found, yielding R2 values of 0.93 and 0.99 respectively. A third method was used to estimate storage time from the response spectra using discriminant analysis. 84% correct classification ratio was achieved with a maximum of 91% within-group with the spectrum magnitude values as estimators exclusively. Results showed that the applied methods are suitable for gathering parameters that are corresponding with certain internal properties and quality attributes of cheese.","Acoustic dispersion; Cheese; Internal properties; Quality controls; Ripeness; Signal processing; Signals; Storage; Time of flight; Ultrasonic; Ultrasound","Acoustic dispersion; Agriculture; Cheeses; Discriminant analysis; Energy storage; Fast Fourier transforms; Flight envelopes; Materials testing; Quality control; Signal processing; Signaling; Storage (materials); Ultrasonics; Correct classification ratios; Dispersion phenomena; Internal properties; Quality attributes; Ripeness; Spectrum magnitude; Through transmission; Time of flight; Ultrasonic testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951759033

In 2003, the total meat consumption per capita was 90.5 kg/year [U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 2005]. Since the U.S. has a high consumption of animal-based food products, the animal feed ingredients are fundamentally important. The ingredients can affect not only the quality of the animal-based food products, but also the potential human health. The U.S. is the largest producer of animal feed in the world (Gill 2004). Feed ingredients might include grains, milling byproducts, added vitamins, minerals, fats/oils, and other nutritional and energy sources. And kinds of feed ingredients are produced to use, like DDGS and soybean meal. Recently, some co-products of energy production, like DDGS are used as feed ingredient worldwide. This kind of co-product is nutrient rich and meets the requirement of animal feed nutrition. Since these food ingredients are used worldwide, they must be transported a long distance to some domestic and international market. And sometimes they are stored for a long time before be used. So during transportation and storage, ingredients often became restricted. This is a major problem that can affect the quality of ingredients. These issue most likely results from many factors, including ingredients' moisture content, particle size, temperature and relative humidity of air or pressure. The objective of this study was to investigate potential factors affecting flowability of feeding ingredients, as well as examines the effect of three moisture content levels (10, 20 and 30% db) on the resulting physical and flow properties of feeding ingredients. Certain amounts of water were added to adjust moisture content of ingredients and Carr indices were used to quantify the flowability of each ingredient. The results showed that moisture content had significant effects on physical and flow properties. According to Carr indices, flowability generally declined with increased moisture content. Using these, the best condition can be found for transportation and storage to maintain the good quality for ingredients when they are used.

The collector transforms a parabolic trough, commonly used in CSP plants, into an integrated spectrum-splitting device. This places a spectrum-sensitive topping element on a secondary reflector that is registered to the thermal collection loop. The secondary reflector transmits higher energy photons for PV topping while diverting the remaining lower energy photons to the thermal media, achieving temperatures of around 400°C even under partial utilization of the solar spectrum. The collector uses the spectral selectivity property of Gallium arsenide (GaAs) cells to maximize the exergy output of the system, resulting in an estimated exergy efficiency of 48%.

Case studies covering five regions of Africa were reviewed and general and common practices analysed. The analysis was approached under a broad categorization of traditional and modern methods. Findings showed that most African countries still make use of traditional techniques of tuber storage with very little percentage of modern methods, thus affecting availability for the next planting season and all year availability as food material. The study discovered that lack of finance, as against technical no how, accounted for the predominance of traditional methods. It is recommended that African Countries must prioritize giving farmers access to fund at zero or minimal interest rates.

A niche exists for an inexpensive, robust X-ray diode that can be used for experiments in hostile environments on multiple platforms, including explosively driven experiments that have the potential for destroying the diode during the experiment. A multiple channel stacked filtered array was developed with a small field of view where a wider parallel array could not be used, but filtered channels for energies lower than 1000 eV were too fragile to deploy under normal conditions. To achieve both the robustness and the required low-energy detection ability, we designed a small low-energy mirrored channel with a spectral sensitivity from 30 to 1000 eV. The stacked MiniXRD X-ray diode system design incorporates the mirrored low-energy channel on the front of the stacked filtered channels to allow the system to work within a small field of view. We will present results that demonstrate this is a promising solution for low-energy spectrum measurements. © 2015 SPIE.","Low energy channel (LEC); Low resolution X-ray spectrometer; Mirrored channel; X-ray diode (XRD); X-rays","Diodes; Inertial confinement fusion; Spectrometers; Spectroscopy; X ray spectrometers; X rays; Hostile environments; LEC; Low resolution; Mirrored channel; Soft x-ray spectrums; Spectral sensitivity; Spectroscopic measurements; XRD; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951178379

Development of this capability is underway at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, to establish sub-5 nm resolution ptychographic imaging with spatially resolved near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. This is being achieved via an upgrade of the current soft X-ray scanning transmission X-ray microscope at beamline 13-1, involving the installation of an area detector and an interferometer system for high precision sample motor control. The undulator source on beamline 13-1 provides the spatially and temporally coherent X-ray beam required for ptychographic imaging in the energy range 500 - 1200 eV. This energy range allows access to the oxygen chemistry and the valence states of 3d transition metals found in energy storage materials, making soft x-ray ptychography a particularly powerful tool to study the chemical states and structure of battery materials at relevant length scales. The implementation of ptychographic imaging can therefore provide a wealth of additional information on battery operation and failure.

Enough energy points are need to accurately determine the per pixel chemical information; however, total radiation dose needs to be limited to avoid damaging the system which would produce misleading results. Here we consider the number of energy points need to accurately reproduce the state of charge maps of a LiFePO2 electrode recorded during electrochemical cycling. We observe very good per pixel agreement using only 13 energy points. Additionally, we find the quality of the agreement is heavily dependent on the number of energy points used in the post edge fit during normalization of the spectra rather than the total number of energies used.

The control on catalytic activity is generally achieved by variations in water concentration, carbon feed, and sample placement on a few types of alumina or silica catalyst supports obtained via thin film deposition. We have recently expanded the choice of catalyst supports by engineering inactive substrates like c-cut sapphire via ion beam bombardment. The deterministic control on the structure and chemistry of catalyst supports obtained by tuning the degree of beam-induced damage have enabled better regulation of the activity of Fe catalysts only in the ion beam bombarded areas and hence enabled controllable super growth of carbon nanotubes. A wide range of surface characterization techniques were used to monitor the catalytically active surface engineered via ion beam bombardment. The proposed method offers a versatile way to control carbon nanotube growth in patterned areas and also enhances the current understanding of the growth process. With the right choice of water concentration, carbon feed and sample placement, engineered catalyst supports may extend the carbon nanotube growth yield to a level that is even higher than the ones reported here, and thus offers promising applications of carbon nanotubes in electronics, heat exchanger, and energy storage. © 2015 SPIE.","Carbon nanotube; catalyst support; catalytic activity; ion beam bombardment.","Alumina; Carbon nanotubes; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Characterization; Deposition; Graphene; Ion beams; Ion bombardment; Ions; Metal nanoparticles; Nanotubes; Photonic devices; Sapphire; Silica; Yarn; Better regulation; Carbon nanotube growth; Engineered catalysts; Ion beam bombardment; Surface characterization; Thin-film depositions; Vertically aligned carbon nanotube; Water concentrations; Catalyst supports",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951016563

However, application of external energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, increases the cost of solar energy systems and requires additional charging circuitry. This combination is bulky and relatively expensive, which is not ideal for many applications. In this work, a novel idea is presented for making electrochemical devices with dual properties of solar energy harvesting and internal charge storage. The device is essentially a supercapacitor with a photoactive electrode. Energy harvesting occurs through light absorption at one of the electrodes made of a composite of a conducting polymer (i.e. PEDOT:PSS) and a Porphyrin dye. The energy storage takes place in the both photoactive and counter electrode (CE). We have studied the effect of the CE material on the device characteristics. Using Y-Carbon (a commercial available electrode), an open circuit voltage of 0.49 V was achieved in light across the cell with '1 mF capacitance. The other two choices for CE were activated carbon and carbon nanotube based electrodes. The cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that the Y Carbon electrode was a better match. © 2015 SPIE.","Carbon electrodes; Electrochemical device; Energy storage; Solar cell","Activated carbon; Capacitance; Capacitors; Carbon nanotubes; Conducting polymers; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrodes; Electrolytic capacitors; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Energy conversion; Energy harvesting; Energy storage; Light absorption; Nanostructured materials; Open circuit voltage; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Storage (materials); Yarn; Carbon electrode; Counter electrodes; Device characteristics; Electrochemical devices; Energy availability; Impedance spectroscopy; Organic photovoltaic devices; Solar energy systems; Electrochemical electrodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950988381

Conventionally, reading and writing of data utilize only a fraction of the available light. Our techniques apply a resonator cavity to the readout and recording of holograms so that more of the available light is used. Functionally, more power is used than what is provided without violating energy conservation. Thus, data rates and/or capacities can be increased due to enhanced power. These improvements are also inversely related to the diffraction efficiency of a hologram, which makes these cavity enhanced techniques well suited to HDSS where large numbers of multiplexed holograms require low diffraction efficiencies. Previously, we presented the theory of cavity enhanced HDSS, the experimental effect of enhancement on readout, and the lack of effects on Bragg Selectivity. We have now formalized the enhancement in writing power and experimentally evaluated the improvement in writing speed over conventional means for writing a single plane wave hologram in Fe:LiNbO3 with a 532 nm wavelength, CW, single mode, DPSS, Nd:YAG, laser with a cavity on one of the writing arms. The diffraction efficiency was read during the recording by using a 632.8 nm wavelength HeNe Laser. We found that the enhancement of recording power for this configuration asymptotically approaches a factor of two, while the use of cavities in both writing arms provides a power enhancement which is limited only by the losses in the cavities. © 2015 SPIE.","Cavity; Data Storage; Diffraction Efficiency; Dynamic Range; Holography; Resonant; Standing Wave; Write Rate","Data storage equipment; Data transfer; Data transfer rates; Diffraction; Diffraction efficiency; Digital storage; Elastic waves; Helium neon lasers; Holograms; Holography; Lithography; Neodymium lasers; Search engines; Cavity; Data storage; Dynamic range; Resonant; Standing wave; Optical data storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950341770

Vasco Rd., Livermore, CA  94550, United States","There are many types of X-ray diodes that are used for X-ray flux or spectroscopic measurements and for estimating the spectral shape of the VUV to soft X-ray spectrum. However, a need arose for a low cost, robust X-ray diode to use for experiments in hostile environments on multiple platforms, and for experiments that utilize forces that may destroy the diode(s). Since the typical proposed use required a small size with a minimal single line-of-sight, a parallel array could not be used. So, a stacked, filtered multi-channel X-ray diode array was developed, called the MiniXRD. To achieve significant cost savings while maintaining robustness and ease of field setup, repair, and replacement, we designed the system to be modular. The filters were manufactured in-house and cover the range from 450 eV to 5000 eV. To achieve the line-of-sight accuracy needed, we developed mounts and laser alignment techniques. We modeled and tested elements of the diode design at NSTec Livermore Operations (NSTec / LO) to determine temporal response and dynamic range, leading to diode shape and circuitry changes to optimize impedance and charge storage. We fielded individual and stacked systems at several national facilities as ancillary 'ride-along' diagnostics to test and improve the design usability. We present the MiniXRD system performance which supports consideration as a viable low-cost alternative for multiple-channel low-energy X-ray measurements. This diode array is currently at Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 6. © 2015 SPIE.","Diode; MiniXRD; X-ray; XRD","Buffer storage; Costs; Radiation detectors; Telecommunication links; X rays; Hostile environments; Line of sight accuracies; MiniXRD; Multiple platforms; Soft x-ray spectrums; Spectroscopic measurements; X ray diode arrays; XRD; Diodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950336317

While the popular approach among academia adopts a social welfare maximization formulation, the industrial practice in the United States electricity market compensates customers according to their load reduction from a predefined electricity consumption baseline that would have occurred without DSM. This paper is an extension of a previous paper studying the differences between the industrial & academic approach to dispatching demands. In the previous paper, the comparison of the two models showed that while the social welfare model uses a stochastic net load composed of two terms, the industrial DSM model uses a stochastic net load composed of three terms including the additional baseline term. That work showed that the academic and industrial optimization method have the same dispatch result in the absence of baseline errors given the proper reconciliation of their respective cost functions. DSM participants, however, and very much unfortunately, are likely to manipulate the baseline in order to receive greater financial compensation. This paper now seeks to study the impacts of erroneous industrial baselines in a day-ahead wholesale market context. Using the same system configuration and mathematical formalism, the industrial model is compared to the social welfare model. The erroneous baseline is shown to result in a different and more importantly costlier dispatch. It is also likely to require more control activity in subsequent layers of enterprise control. Thus an erroneous baseline is likely to increase system costs and overestimate the potential for social welfare improvements.

It provides valuable operational data for a fleet-type electric vehicle (EV) operating over a fixed route. The primary aim of this study is to use the daily operational data obtained from the Ebus in order to formulate an optimal driving strategy. Existing research efforts to improve EVs focus on improvements to the architecture and the energy management strategy. However, they fail to provide the driver with an optimal driving strategy leading to suboptimal use of the stored battery energy. This shortcoming was addressed here by implementing a multi-objective approach to find an optimal driving strategy for an electric bus. The driving strategy was taken to comprise two parts: a constant trip speed and an acceleration value to achieve that speed. From the operational data, the efficiency and power consumption of the electric motor were computed for different speeds. By assuming the entire trip was executed at a constant speed, the range for each speed was calculated. The speeds were ranked based on their corresponding ranges. Then, to achieve the optimal speed, the acceleration duration and energy consumption for different acceleration values were computed. The values were ranked based on the trade-off between duration and energy. The choice of driving strategy (exact speed and acceleration values) is left to the driver since different strategies would be needed for different road conditions. This multi-objective approach gives flexibility to the driver and promotes optimal use of the stored battery energy, thereby enhancing the energy efficiency and range of the Ebus. It can be easily implemented in other electric vehicles as well.

The area is mainly supported by three lake-based hydro power plants, Maninjau, Singkarak, and Batang Agam. The electrical supply problems appear during the dry season when water availability is limited. Power outage during dry season in Padang area also becomes inevitable because the Sumatra island electricity system is a 150 kV interconnection power grid and due to the limitation of the transmission power transfer capacity lines from the Southern part of Sumatra (max for 250 MW) the demand cannot be satisfied. This paper presents the 2012 data of power outage and power production in Padang area. Using PVsyst software, a simulation of 200 MW solar PV systems in the Padang location is studied. Three scenarios are described, the current conditions without solar PV, with solar PV, and with solar PV-hydro collaboration. The results show that solar PVhydro collaboration reduces the power outages significantly and distributes it more uniformly for the 2012 data.

This is largely due to the fact that much of the energy dissipates into waste heat. However, the waste heat may be converted into electricity by using energy conversion modules made from bismuth telluride. In this work, it is demonstrated that electricity can be generated from waste heat due to the difference in temperatures. The thermal to electrical energy conversion is achieved by using a selfassembled thermoelectric generator (TEG). The TEG (thermoelectric generator) uses two different types of metallic compound semiconductors, known as n-typed and p-typed, to create voltage when the junctions are held at different temperatures. The work mechanism is based on the Seebeck effect. In this study, the TEGs are made from bismuth telluride (Bi-Te) with relatively high energy conversion efficiencies. In addition, it is readily available. The installation location of the TEG is studied. For testing purposes and convenience, the top of the radiator of a 1990 Mazda Miata car was chosen. The TEG and an aluminum finned heat sink were placed in order on the top of the radiator. Thermal paste was applied to both surfaces and secured with zip ties. A vent was cut on the hood of the car to promote airflow between the fins. Appropriate electrical wiring allowed the unit to output to a digital multimeter which was located within the car for operator to take data. It is found from the measured results that 0.948 V is the maximum output and the average voltage is 0.751 V. The highest voltage came from driving mountain paths due to the heat sink and coolant temperature being higher than nominal. We estimate that placing an insulator between the heat sink and TEG would push the maximum voltage over 1.0 V. During the cool down phase, the TEG produced electricity continuously with a maximum voltage of 0.9 V right after engine cutoff. The voltage decreased to about 0.6 V within 40 minutes. It is found that the relationship between the temperature difference and output voltage is linear.

A thermodynamic model developed to evaluate different design options has been utilized to calculate system performance and assess the impact of operation strategies, storage capacity, and market prices on the value of TES. The overall performance is also investigated through several parametric studies, such as solar multiple, geographic location, and choice of HTF. The influence of these parameters has been evaluated in consideration of exergy destruction due to heat transfer and pressure drop. By incorporating exergy-based optimization alongside traditional energy analyses, the results of this study evaluate the optimal values for key parameters in the design and operation of TES systems, as well as highlight opportunities to minimize thermodynamic losses. Annual performance for each case is characterized both by nominal and part-load efficiency.

Pressure Retarded Osmosis (PRO) has been a growing form of ""Blue Energy"" [1], a renewable energy medium involving mixing bodies of salt and fresh water. PRO systems take advantage of the pressure difference seen between freshwater and seawater by forcing fresh water across a semipermeable membrane into a body of saltwater. This transfer, through the means of forward osmosis, yields an increase in pressure on the saltwater side of the membrane. This observable increase in pressure can be used for generating electricity. A popular thought proposed has involved taking a part of this newly created pressure and diverting it back into the system with the use of a pressure exchanger. Residual pressure would then be devoted to the generation of electricity. If done correctly, a net gain can be seen between the electricity gleaned from the output of the system, and the energy consumed to run the pumps necessary for operation. The group's aim is to design and construct a variant of the traditional PRO system for the purpose of analysis in a laboratory setting. The design proposed consists of a compact, two-membrane system that allows for the testing and analysis of forward osmosis in a closed system. While the system is not intended for actual electrical generation, it provides a medium for future experimentation.

In recent years, many ski resorts have taken steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to mitigate the effects shorter winters, less snowfall, and continued drought are having on the future viability of the industry. Energy efficiency and renewable energy projects are common strategies to reduce emissions; less common, however, are resort-wide analyses of distributed generation (DG) systems combining traditional and alternative energy sources. The intent of this study is to evaluate the economic and technical feasibility of a hybrid conventional-renewable DG system at Vail Resort. Electrical and thermal loads for Vail's mountain operations were used to analyze three DG technologies; combined heat and power (CHP), photovoltaics (PV), and horizontal axis wind turbines. Technologies were chosen based on a resource assessment as well as input from site managers and analyzed using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER). The results indicate that the most cost-competitive DG system is a 700 kilowatt (kW) natural gas-fired CHP plant used to meet the site's base load during the summer months. Although CHP systems are generally most effective at displacing conventional grid-based power for facilities with little seasonal load variation, the findings of this study align closely with an existing system at Snowbird Resort in Utah. A small 700 kW CHP system could provide approximately 31% of annual electricity use and 24% of annual thermal energy needs based on the energy model used in this analysis. Furthermore, annual energy costs could be reduced by 3% and carbon emissions by 11%. Additional analyses are needed to more precisely determine the optimal system for Vail and the authors recommend that future studies include the energy use from base operations in addition to the mountain area considered in this analysis. The additional base area energy load during the summer could potentially make a larger CHP system more viable with subsequent cost and carbon emission savings. Additionally, site-specific resource data such as biomass production and ridge top wind speeds could aid in more definitively eliminating these technologies from consideration.

A highly efficient and easy-to-assemble solution for finned heat exchanger tubes is a key component for innovative thermal energy storage systems which play a key-role in electricity production and industrial heat management. In the present article the results of the investigation for different designs of bimetallic heat exchanger tubes is presented. These tube designs are developed for the use in latent heat thermal energy storage systems (LHTES) at a medium temperature range. For the use in latent heat thermal energy storage systems, the probably high pressure of the heat transfer medium and the high temperature differences between the operating temperature and the ambient temperature are challenging. Therefore, the bimetallic finned heat exchanger tube consists of a steel tube, where the heat transfer fluid flows, and an aluminum tube with longitudinal fins, which should improve the heat transfer to the phase change material. Due to different thermal expansion coefficients, displacements of the tubes are given. To guarantee a high heat transfer rate between the two connected tubes the contact between aluminum and steel plays an important role. In the present study 4 prototypes (including the new design) were designed, analyzed and compared on the connection strength. Long-term tests for simulating the application in a LHTES were done to determine the creep rupture properties of the compositions. All prototypes were tested successfully; the new design is convinced in many aspects of that challenge and is submitted to the Austrian patent office. Main advantages of the new design are the simple production and assembling compared to other analyzed prototypes. Furthermore, the new design shows the best results under the analyzed operation conditions and the layout of the geometry has a high optimization potential in terms of stresses.

Small airports are typically located in rural areas, making them excellent candidates for renewable energy. This paper focuses on the planning and selection of renewable energy systems as a strategic method to reduce energy use and increase electric power reliability at small-scale airport facilities. The target system may use a combination of renewable energy sources to produce electrical power for the on-site facilities. The framework details include methods of energy collection, power production, and energy storage that are environmentally sound. A small airport serving a dual role as a flight training facility was used as case study. In the case study, systems engineering methodology was adapted to the small airport/renewable energy domain in order to effectively identify stakeholders and elicit user requirements. These, coupled with industrial standards, relevant government regulations, and a priori constraints, are used to derive the initial requirements that serve as the basis for a preliminary design. The proposed framework also contains provisions for an on-site assessment of existing airport energy needs, sources, providers, and location-specific assets and challenges.

This combination is resulting in increasing trends of energy consumption in cities, associated mostly with air conditioning to maintain indoor human comfort conditions. During periods of extreme summer weather, electrical usage usually reaches peak loads, stressing the electrical grid. The purpose of this study is to explore the use of available, high resolution weather data by effectively preparing a building for peak load management. The subject of study is a 14 floor, 620,782 sq ft building located in uptown Manhattan, New York City (40.819257 N, - 73.949288 W). To precisely quantify thermal loads of the buildings for the summer conditions; a single building energy model (SBEM), the US Department of Energy EnergyPlus™ was used. The SBEM was driven by a weather file built from weather data of the urbanized weather forecasting model (uWRF), a high resolution weather model coupled to a building energy model. The SBEM configuration and simulations were calibrated with winter actual gas and electricity data using 2010 as the benchmark year. In order to show the building peak load management, demand response techniques and technologies were implemented. The methods used to prepare the building included generator usage during high peak loads and use of a thermal storage system. An ensemble of cases was analyzed using current practice, use of high resolution weather data, and use of building preparation technologies. Results indicated an average summer peak savings of more than 30% with high resolution weather data.

For the heat transfer to the sodium nitrate different finned tube designs, namely helical-, transversal- and longitudinal finned tubes, are used. The numerical results of the melting and solidification process for the different design cases will be compared. The numerical analysis of the melting process has shown that apart from the first period of the charging process natural convection is the dominant heat transfer mechanism. The numerical analysis of the melting process has also shown that for a fast melting process heat exchanger tubes should be designed in such a way that an unrestricted natural convection is guaranteed. The numerical investigation for the solidification process has shown that the dominant heat transfer mechanism is heat conduction. The investigation has also shown that the solidification front grows more uniformly from the tube surface to the outer shell compared to the melting front. Therefore no significant differences between the different tube designs are detected concerning the solidification process.

Universal access to energy is increasingly pursued as a policy objective via e.g. the U.N. Millennium Develop Goals (MDG), Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All), and U.S. Power Africa initiatives. Rational allocation of energy infrastructure for 1.6b people currently lacking access requires a screening process to determine the economic break-even distance and consumer connection density favoring topologically diverse energy technology approaches. Previous efforts have developed approaches to determine grid-connection break-even distances, but work on micro-grid and SHS breakeven distance and density is limited. The present work develops an open access modeling platform with the ability to simulate various configurations of PV, Concentrating Solar Power (CSP), and fueled generator backup systems with exhaust waste heat recovery. Battery and thermal storage options are examined, and typical meteorological year (TMY) data is combined with probabilistic and empirical load curve data to represent the appropriate physical dynamics. Power flow control strategy and infrastructure is optimized for a minimum tariff (USD/kWh) for cost recovery.

Research has shown that global population has increased drastically over the last three decades resulting in depleted efficiency of regional resources. Because of this, obtaining sustainable energy platforms is a world-wide concern. In evaluating the ability of urban communities to support sustainable elements, both spatial and temporal influences must be considered. As a result a spatial analysis model will be used to assess the geomorphological and land use aspects of urban watersheds to support sustainable communities' platform.

However, the main concern about the current state of art in the use of Building Energy Simulation (BES) as an approach to natural ventilation is the definition of input data which usually do not represent the real state of the buildings in the studied region. Within this context, the main contribution of this research is to propose a methodology through which the real state of buildings can be evaluated. By this analysis, valid input parameters was found to exploit the capabilities of BES and CFD simulations to fulfill the main objective of this study, which is to assess the impact of natural ventilation strategies in the energy consumption of HVAC systems and occupants hygrothermal comfort. Four natural ventilation strategies were evaluated: single sided ventilation, cross ventilation, solar chimney and double façade. The results show that the exclusive use of natural ventilation is ineffective to ensure hygrothermal comfort in a building with high thermal loads in a warm-humid climate like Guayaquil. However, by using a hybrid system (natural ventilation/dehumidification and cooling) cooling energy consumption can be reduced in up to 10.6% without compromising occupant's hygrothermal comfort. Due to the promising results regarding energy savings, further research will aim to evaluate the impact of other passive strategies in energy consumption.

However, under real conditions, many factors can affect the performance which suggests that statistical models developed with field data could give better results to predict the performance of a solar PV system.

The main engines of large shipping vessels produce a large quantity of low temperature heat, but this valuable heat energy is transferred to cooling systems and rejected to the oceans as waste. At the same time, the electrical needs of shipping vessels are sustained by burning diesel fuel to run generators. Calnetix Technologies, in partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, has developed the Hydrocurrent™ 125EJW Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), a modularized system capable of absorbing the waste heat of main engine jacket water and converting it into grid-quality electric power. By combining this renewable source with the existing non-renewable source (engine gensets) a unique renewable-non-renewable hybrid power system is realized with minimal changes to overall ship power train. This novel hybrid system can be applied to all new and existing ships and allow for further integration into ship systems with available waste heat. Shipping vessels such as tankers, bulk carriers, and container vessels are typically equipped with a category 3 marine diesel engine for main propulsion. A 30 MW engine, a most common engine size, utilizes 200-300 m3/hr of jacket water regulated to a heated temperature of 80-95 C. When integrated into the jacket water and sea water loops, the ORC can produce up to 125 kW of gross grid-quality electric power. This adds an immense benefit to the ship. To produce the same amount of power, a diesel generator consumes as much as 250 metric tons of diesel fuel per year, generates emissions, and requires significant maintenance. Calnetix Technologies has leveraged its core technologies to develop the ORC into a reliable, high efficiency, compact and modular design. The turbo-generator or Integrated Power Module (IPM) is a hermetically sealed, high speed radial turbine coupled to a permanent magnet generator supported by magnetic bearings. Power from the IPM is converted by a high efficiency power converter supplying the ship with reliable power. The integrated design of the ORC along with the sophistication of its controls systems ensures essential ship functions are undisturbed under all conditions. The ORC is designed to comply with Nippon Kaiji Kyokai and Lloyd's Register marine regulations and sea trials are anticipated to take place in 2015.

We investigate several choices for both models by studying a public data set of Google datacenter usage. We show the Burr XII distribution to be a particularly effective choice for modeling the marginals and the Frank copula to be the best choice for stitching these together into a joint distribution. Our approach offers a significant fidelity improvement and generalizes directly to higher dimensions. In use, this improvement will translate directly to reductions in energy consumption.",,"Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Economics; Energy utilization; Learning systems; Efficiency increase; Environmental footprints; Higher dimensions; Joint distributions; Marginal distribution; Multiple resources; Nonlinear structure; Sophisticated machines; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949759881

A prototype of a multi-cell thermochemical battery consisting of connected cells containing MgCl2 salt, and additional aircooled or air-heated cells containing liquid ammonia of varying quality, was constructed and tested. Each of the 17 cells contained thermocouple probes at three different axial locations within the cylindrical cells. Heat transfer rates, pressures, and ammonia condensation and vaporization rates were measured. Three tests were run. In the first test, the hot bed containing 10 cells was heated using cartridge heaters, driving vaporous ammonia from the salt phase once sufficient salt temperatures were reached. The evolved gaseous ammonia was condensed in an additional 7 empty air-cooled cells. Once the recharging cycle was complete, a valve in the ammonia vapor line connecting the cold and hot beds was closed, allowing indefinite storage of cooling or heating capacity. The second operational test involved the opening of the valve while simultaneous air-cooling the hot bed cells and air-heating the cold bed cells. Heating rates and cooling rates to/from air forced through the hot bed and cold bed, respectively, were monitored to gauge HVAC performance. The second recharge was performed by using a air/air heat exchanger that captured waste heat from an automobile engine exhaust manifold and trans ferred it to air that was re-circulated through the hot bed array.

The present study provides the computational framework and results of a one year simulation of a low-cost pilot 3 kWel micro-Concentrated Solar Power (micro-CSP) plant with TES. The modeling approach is based on a dynamic representation of the solar thermal loop and a steady state model of the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), and is validated to experimental data from a test site (Eckerd College, St. Petersburg, Florida). The simulation results predict an annual net electricity generation of 4.08 MWh/a. Based on the simulation, optimization studies focusing on the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) converter of the system are presented, including a control strategy allowing for a variable pinch point in the condenser that offers an annual improvement of 14.0% in comparison to a constant condensation pinch point. Absolute electricity output is increased to 4.65 MWh/a. Improvements are due to better matching to expander performance and lower condenser fan power because of higher pinch points. A method, incorporating this control strategy, is developed to economically optimize the ORC components. The process allows for optimization of the ORC subsystem in an arbitrary environment, e.g. as part of a micro-grid to minimize Levelized electricity costs (LEC). The air-cooled condenser is identified as the driving component for the ORC optimization as its influence on overall costs and performance is of major significance. Application of the optimization process to various locations in Africa illustrates economic benefits of the system in comparison to diesel generation. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Carbon; Cell engineering; Climate control; Cogeneration plants; Costs; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Electric energy storage; Electric power system control; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Electrochemical cells; Environmental technology; Geothermal energy; Heat storage; Historic preservation; Photovoltaic cells; Rankine cycle; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Computational framework; Concentrated solar power; Dynamic representation; Electricity generation; Levelized electricity cost; Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC); Simulation and optimization; Steady-state modeling; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949673515

Often little or no consideration is given to the end use or desired product of the energy used. Current energy generation, transport and storage are dominated heavily by a few large sectors, notably electricity and hydrocarbons. These are very effective and practical systems that facilitate the delivery of vast amounts of energy. It is then not surprising that most strategies for renewable energy generation and storage revolve around this centralized model in some way. In larger scale generation, power is usually fed onto the electrical grid with a current challenge being grid stabilization with increasing penetration of intermittent renewable resources. In small grid-independent system a mix of battery and hydrocarbon storage are often used to keep a microgrid available for various end use applications. A paradigm shift in the thinking and design of energy systems based on the required end use or product is needed. The philosophy and motivation that lead to the consideration of this new approach are outlined in this article. Following this a summary of a methodical approach to developing the most energy and cost-effective solution to general processes by considering their end-use physics is presented. Examples of innovative energy generation, storage, and transport solutions based on the multi-physics approach are then outlined.

To increase the market competitiveness, CSP technology needs to increase the solar-to-electric efficiency and reduce costs in the areas of solar collection from the heliostat field to the receiver, energy conversion systems, and TES. The current state-of-theart molten-salt systems have limitations regarding both the potential for cost reduction and improvements in performance. Even with significant improvements in operating performance, these systems face major challenges to satisfy the performance targets, which include high-temperature stability (>650°C), low freezing point (<0°C), and material compatibility with hightemperature metals (>650°C) at a reduced cost. The fluidizedbed CSP (FB-CSP) plant being developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has the potential to overcome the above issues with substantially lower cost. The particle receiver is a critical component to enable the FB-CSP system. This paper introduces the development of an innovative receiver design using the blackbody design mechanism by collecting solar heat with absorber tubes that transfer the radiant heat to flowing particles. The particle and receiver materials can withstand temperatures of >1000°C because the receiver can use low-cost materials, such as ceramics and stainless steel, and the solid particles can be any low-cost, stable materials such as sand or ash for particle containment and TES. The heated particles can be stored in containers for TES or supply heat for power generation. This study investigated the performance of convection, reflection, and infrared (IR) re-radiation losses on the absorber solar receiving side. We developed a flux model to predict the reflection losses from the absorber tubes based on the NREL SolTrace program, and conducted thermal modeling by using the Fluent Software. This paper presents the thermal modeling and results on the receiver performance. The receiver configuration may have broad applications for different heattransfer fluids (HTFs), including gas, liquid, or the solid particle-based system in our receiver development. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"C (programming language); Carbon; Cell engineering; Climate control; Cogeneration plants; Cost reduction; Costs; Electric power system control; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Environmental technology; Geothermal energy; Heat storage; Historic preservation; Solar absorbers; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Stainless steel; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Concentrating solar power; Energy conversion systems; High temperature stability; Material compatibility; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Operating performance; Receiver development; Receiver performance; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949671558

Costs and fuel consumption are modeled based on a Florida electric utility's hour-by-hour load data under two scenarios: 1) no storage, and 2) thermal storage attached to intermediate load, NGCC plants, displacing energy production from older, less efficient NGCT peaking units. Due to the nature of the power grid, several of the older units feature abnormally high fuel costs and abnormally low thermal efficiencies. By shifting load from the most expensive peaking units to more cost-effective combined cycles with a 204 MWhth storage system costing about $4 million, savings of more than $1 million per year can be realized while also reducing CO2 emissions by about 5000 metric tons per year.

Common heat transfer fluids used to capture heat in a solar receiver include steam, oil, molten salt, and air. These high temperature fluids can be stored so that electric power can be produced on demand, limited primarily by the size of the capacity and the energy density of the storage mechanism. Phase changing fluids can increase the amount of stored energy relative to non-phase changing fluids due to the heat of vaporization or the heat of fusion. Reversible chemical reactions can also store heat; an endothermic reaction captures the heat, the chemical products are stored, and an exothermic reaction later releases the heat and returns the chemical compound to its initial state. Ongoing research is investigating the scientific and commercial potential of such reaction cycles with, for example, reduction (endothermic) and re-oxidation (exothermic) of metal oxide particles. This study includes thermodynamic analyses and considerations for component sizing of concentrating solar power towers with redox active metal oxide based thermochemical storage to reach target electrical output capacities of 0.1 MW to 100 MW. System-wide analyses here use one-dimensional energy and mass balances for the solar field, solar receiver reduction reactor, hot reduced particle storage, re-oxidizer reactor, power block, cold particle storage, and other components pertinent to the design.

Two features of CSP that will decrease LCOE and improve reliability are higher operating temperatures for the power cycle and thermal energy storage (TES). Thermaphase Energy and San Diego State University are developing the Liquid Metal Thermal Energy Storage System (LiMTESS), an innovative TES system based on phase change in Al-Si and Mg-Si alloys that stores thermal energy produced by gas-cooled solar receivers at temperatures above 800 C. Proper containment for Al-Si and Mg-Si alloys is critical for LiMTESS commercialization. Any containment vessel must be simultaneously compatible with the molten alloys and hightemperature oxidizing gases (e.g., air), facilitate heat transfer between the alloys and high-temperature oxidizing gases, and accommodate internal stresses associated with TES operation. A ceramic-metallic composite material (TCON) and select ceramics such as siliconized silicon carbide (SiSiC) and alumina initially showed promise in meeting these requirements. A series of thermal cycling tests were performed to check the integrity of the containment vessels. TCON produced macroscopic nodules during the thermal cycling that eliminated it from further consideration. On the other hand, SiSiC performed well when exposed to high-temperature, AlSi36, MgSi56, and air. To further evaluate SiSiC as a containment material, the research team conducted multiple thermal cycles with variable temperature profiles, duration of test, and gas environments. Before and after each thermal cycle, the team conducted a mass analysis and performed SEM and EDS analysis on prepared, treated samples. The results confirm SiSiC is a good candidate for a containment vessel. At this point the research team is evaluating Morcoset, a silicon carbide-based mortar, for creating an air-tight seal for SiSiC. The research team assessed the quality of the seal by using the mortar to seal MgSi56 and conducted thermal cycling tests to compare the mass loss of the system due to Mg vapor escaping the system to that of a controlled system with no alloys sealed. Results confirmed that Mg vapor did not exit the system. There is still more work to do, but preliminary results indicate the Morcoset + SiSiC system is a good containment system for AlSi36/MgSi56. In this paper the results of the long-duration thermal cycling tests as well as electron micrographs of the containment seals and phase change materials are presented. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Alumina; Aluminum; Carbon; Cell engineering; Ceramic materials; Climate control; Cogeneration plants; Composite materials; Containment vessels; Electric energy storage; Electric power system control; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Environmental technology; Geothermal energy; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Historic preservation; Metals; Mortar; Phase change materials; Quality control; Silicon; Silicon alloys; Silicon carbide; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Storage (materials); Sustainable development; Thermal cycling; Thermal energy; Concentrated solar power; High-temperature oxidizing; Levelized cost of electricities; Metallic composite materials; Operating temperature; SEM and EDS analysis; Thermal cycling test; Thermal energy storage systems; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949661006

The current push to high-temperature receivers enabling the use of advanced power cycles has identified solid particle receivers as a desired technology. A potential way of increasing the specific energy storage of solid particles while simultaneously reducing plant component size is to implement thermochemical energy storage (TCES) through the use of non-stoichiometric perovskite oxides. Materials such as strontium-doped lanthanum cobalt ferrites (LSCF) have been shown to have significant reducibility when cycling temperature and oxygen partial pressure of the environment [1]. The combined reducibility and heat of the oxidation and reduction reactions with the sensible change in temperature of the material leads to specific energy storage values approaching 700 kJ kg-1. A potential thermochemical energy storage system configuration and modeling strategy is reported on, leading to a parametric study of critical operating parameters on the TCES subsystem performance. For the LSCF material operating between 500 and 900°C with oxygen partial pressure swings from ambient to 0.0001 bar, system efficiencies of 68.6% based on the net thermal energy delivered to the power cycle relative to the incident solar flux on the receiver and auxiliary power requirements, with specific energy storage of 686 kJ kg-1 are predicted. Alternatively, only cycling the temperature between 500 and 900°C without oxygen partial pressure swings results in TCES subsystem efficiencies up to 76.3% with specific energy storage of 533 kJ kg-1. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Carbon; Cell engineering; Climate control; Cogeneration plants; Cost effectiveness; Electric power system control; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Environmental technology; Gyrators; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Historic preservation; Oxygen; Partial pressure; Perovskite; Smart power grids; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Storage (materials); Sustainable development; Temperature; Thermal energy; Thermoanalysis; Concentrated solar power; Operating parameters; Oxidation and reduction; Oxygen partial pressure; Subsystem efficiency; Subsystem performance; Thermo dynamic analysis; Thermochemical energy storage; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949654735

Coupled with viable thermal energy storage (TES) strategies, this would bring us closer to achieving the goals of the U.S. Department of Energy Sunshot Initiative. Current TES media employ molten inorganic salts (namely, nitrate salts) for thermal storage, but they are limited in application to lower temperatures: generally, below 600°C. While sufficient for parabolic trough power plants, these materials are inadequate for use with the higher operating temperatures achievable in solar power tower-type CSP plants. For these higher temperatures, chloride salts are more ideal candidate storage media, either for sensible heat storage in the molten salt (e.g, a dual-tank storage arrangement) or for sensible and latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) as phase change materials (PCMs). Their melting points and those of their eutectic mixtures cover a broad range of potential operating temperatures, up to and including 800.7°C, the melting point of pure NaCl. This paper examines these salt systems and presents relevant properties and potential applications in high temperature (>400°C) utility scale solar thermal power generation. A preliminary screening of pure chloride salts based on available literature yields a list of promising candidate salts. Eutectic mixtures of these salts are also considered; the eutectic systems were modeled using the thermodynamic database software, FactSage. Thermophysical properties (melting point, latent heat) are summarized for each salt system. Radiative properties are also addressed, since at these temperatures, thermal radiation can become a significant mode of heat transfer. Candidate containment materials and strategies are discussed, along with the attendant potential for corrosion. Finally, cost data for these systems are presented, allowing for meaningful comparison among these systems and other materials in the context of utility scale thermal energy storage units. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Carbon; Cell engineering; Chlorine compounds; Climate control; Cogeneration plants; Digital storage; Electric power system control; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Environmental technology; Eutectics; Heat radiation; Heat storage; Heat transfer; High temperature applications; Historic preservation; Latent heat; Melting point; Mixtures; Molten materials; Phase change materials; Salts; Smart power grids; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Storage (materials); Sustainable development; Temperature; Thermal energy; Thermodynamic properties; Concentrating solar power; High temperature thermal energy storages; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Parabolic trough power plants; Sensible heat storages; Solar thermal power generation; Thermodynamic database; U.S. Department of Energy; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949643978

The night sky offers the lowest temperature and, therefore, the greatest potential across most of the US. Compared to a previous analysis that considered only the sensible cooling load, the objective of this new project was to evaluate the potential of night-sky radiation (NSR) to also serve the latent cooling load. ASHRAE standard 55 was used to establish the comfort limits (22°C for room temperature and 60% relative humidity). Condensation was evaluated as the mechanism for humidity reduction, thus the dew-point temperature, 13.9°C, corresponding to the ASHRAE limits was the maximum target temperature for night-sky cooling. Typical meteorological year (TMY3) weather data was used for eleven locations representing ASHRAE climate zones. Building heat gain, infiltration/ventilation requirements and night-sky radiator size were characterized by a load-to-radiator ratio LRR defined as the infiltration/ventilation volume flow rate times the ratio of building floor area to radiator area. Three values of LRR were evaluated: 0.35, 3.5 and 35 m/hr. Three thermal storage cases were considered: 1. Annual NSR cooling potential (seasonal storage), 2. Diurnal storage, and 3. The minimum storage capacity to serve the entire annual load, as well as the effects of capacity less than the minimum. To evaluate the effect of night-sky radiator temperature on storage capacity, six NSR temperatures Trad = 13.9 to -26.1°C were tested. Results showed that even in Miami, FL (the most challenging climate evaluated), annual NSR potential exceeded the total sensible and latent cooling load, at least for the lowest LRR and highest Trad. For diurnal storage, NSR could serve less than 20% of the load in the hot and humid southeast, but the entire load in the mountain west. The minimum storage capacity to meet the entire annual load corresponds to the capacity required to bridge the span of time without NSR availability during which the largest cooling load occurs. This capacity decreases with decreasing LRR and decreasing Trad. For the southeast, large capacity is required, but for Louisville, for instance, sufficient capacity is provided by the equivalent of as little as 0.05 m of water over the floor area of the building for LRR = 0.35 m/hr. These results demonstrate that for much of the US, night-sky radiation has the potential to serve the entire annual sensible and latent cooling load. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Air conditioning; Atmospheric radiation; Carbon; Cell engineering; Climate control; Cogeneration plants; Digital storage; Electric power system control; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental technology; Floors; Geothermal energy; Heat storage; Historic preservation; Humidity control; Radiators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Storage (materials); Sustainable development; ASHRAE standards; Cooling potential; Dewpoint temperature; Humidity reductions; Seasonal storage; Target temperature; Typical meteorological year; Volume flow rate; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949638155

The thermal energy range (below about 4 eV) requires many more scattering cross section datasets than at higher energies because of additional complications provided by the comparable energies of the neutron and target material. As a result, the memory burden for low-energy neutron scattering can become large. On-the-fly methods have been used to reduce the storage of cross section data by finding a temperature dependence. However, the low energy quantum, chemical and crystalline effects that can be ignored at higher energies make the temperature dependence of the double differential scattering cross section in the thermal energy range difficult to determine. A new approach has been developed by fitting the temperature dependence of energy and squared momentum transfer cumulative distribution functions using a least squares approach. The coefficients of these fits are used to directly sample the outgoing energy and angle for any temperature. This method has been implemented into the continuous-energy Monte Carlo code MCNP6 [1] and tested for the moderator material bound carbon in graphite. The secondary energy spectra and angular distributions were observed to be in good agreement by testing with Red Cullen's 'broomstick' benchmark [2]. This new method only requires about 21.7 MB of total data storage which is orders of magnitude less than the current method which requires about 25 MB of data per temperature.","Incoherent inelastic; Monte Carlo; On-the-fly; Temperature dependence; Thermal energy","Carbon; Digital storage; Distribution functions; Neutron scattering; Reactor shielding; Temperature distribution; Thermal energy; Continuous energy Monte Carlo code; Cumulative distribution function; Double differential scattering; Incoherent inelastic; Least-squares approach; On the flies; Scattering cross section; Temperature dependence; Monte Carlo methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949511347

Available simulation tools like TRNSYS are often complex and require much experience. This study proposes a simplified simulation model of solar systems using evacuated tube collectors with a storage tank that may be stratified or not. Models were developed for the three main components of the solar loop: global irradiation, the collector, and the storage tank. The differential equations generated were solved using a prediction-correction algorithm. A computer program, JANT-BI, was developed to allow for the monitoring of the different levels of temperature in the whole system. JANT-BI can be used to evaluate the solar coverage rate for a given load and as a function of different design parameters, and so is suitable for both numerical simulation and optimal design. A case study of process steam generation with a non-stratified system revealed that the tank volume is inversely proportional to the overall performance of the system. It was also found that for a given collector area, a collector arrangement that favors parallels against series provides a better solar coverage rate. © 2015 The Authors.

Renewable energy technologies can also be employed in lieu of expensive power umbilicals to provide power to subsea pumps for long distance tiebacks in deepwater. For example, power umbilicals alone required to provide 69kV to subsea pumps in deepwater could be upwards of $300MM for 100 mile long distance tie-backs. A renewable energy source, with storage, integrated into that system could significantly reduce both the CAPEX and OPEX costs.

The ability to deliver large amounts energy near instantaneously with a simple device that can last over millions of cycles is making dielectric capacitors one of the most attractive future options for large-scale electrical energy storage. The low gravimetric energy density, however, has prevented its widespread application in a wide range of fields including electric vehicles, and personal power technologies. Ceramic and polymer materials are being developed for energy storage, however, intrinsic limits on their dielectric properties (e.g., breakdown field and dielectric constant, respectively) prevents them from being used for high energy density applications. Because of this, composite systems of ceramics and polymers have been of increasing interest as they hold the potential for simultaneous improvement of both the dielectric constant and breakdown field leading to significant improvements in the energy storage potential.

Renewable energy targets and CO2 emissions markets drive the transition to a cleaner and renewable energy production system. In addition to increasing the overall plant cycle efficiency, there two principal means of the reduction of the CO2 from coal fired power plants: by coal and biomass co-firing and by the capture and long term storage of the CO2 emitted from power plant. Carbon dioxide capture and storage will involve substantial capital investment, accompanied by a significant power plant cycle efficiency penalty, and is not currently available on a fully commercial basis. Co-firing biomass, in comparison with other renewable sources, is the main contributor to technologies meeting the world's renewable energy target. However, the impact of biomass cofiring on boilers performance and integrity has been modest. Operational problems associated with the deposition and retention of ash materials can and do occur on all the major gasside components of combustion and boilers. The process occurs over a wide range of flue gas and surface temperatures, and dependent both on the characteristics of the ash and on the design and operation conditions of the furnace and boiler. Development and validation of the predictive models have been hindered significantly by the practical difficulties in the obtaining reliable data from the boilers operated with coal and biomass. Although specialized on -line deposition monitoring and sootblowing control systems are commercially available, but they are based on a very simple estimates of the fouling factors, which results in crude and not reliable approach to optimization of sootblowers operation. In the present paper an alternative approach and a new technique based on electro-optical sensor are demonstrated. The long term experience with the system attached to the furnace wall and capable to move the compact sensor in and out of the furnace, allowing to measure simultaneously deposits thickness and reflectivity, is described in details . Results of our study show that dynamics of both parameters on the operated power unit can be registered simultaneously in real time and then interpreted separately. Experiments have been carried out with different coal types at 575MW unit equipped with CE tangential boiler and 550 Mw equipped with B&amp;W boiler with opposite fired burners. The measurements were performed in different locations of the furnace. It was shown that dynamics of thickness and reflectivity variation just after the wall cleaning activation are quite different. Situations have been registered where changes of reflectivity have a significant impact on heat transfer, comparable and sometimes even greater than that of growing fouling thickness. Technique and device exploited in this study appears to be a very useful tool for sootblowing optimization and, as a result, for improvement of boiler efficiency and reduction of water wall erosion and corrosion in both pulverized coal and co-firing boilers. © 2015 by ASME.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Biomass; Boilers; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cell engineering; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal storage; Deposition; Deposits; Digital storage; Economics; Fossil fuel power plants; Furnaces; Heat transfer; Investments; Reflection; Soot blowers; Sustainable development; Thickness measurement; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Coal-fired power plant; Design and operations; Electrooptical sensors; Operational problems; Regulatory requirements; Sootblowing optimization; Surface temperatures; Boiler firing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947276835

The primary challenges in supplying the required electricity from wind are the variability, uncertainty, and the cost of electric power generation. An earlier paper presented the results of a system concept tradeoff using one-year wind/load data from Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland Interconnection LLC (PJM). While one year results showed a wind plus natural gas system can reduce CO2 emission as much as 50% below that of an all-natural gas system with only a modest increase in system cost, typical power generation modeling extends to three years. In this work, the developed model is employed to estimate the magnitude of cost versus performance using three-year wind/load data at PJM in the United States and EirGrid in Ireland, and cost estimations published by the Energy Information Agency. The year to year variation at each region is studied and compared with each other. Also, the curtailment curve obtained from three years wind/load data is compared with that from one year to access the variance. The grid-scale storage parameter variations are studied to estimate the generation cost with storage as a function of emission levels. © 2015 by ASME.",,"Cell engineering; Cost estimating; Costs; Digital storage; Electric power generation; Natural gas; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Cost estimations; Cost performance; Cost-versus-performance; Developed model; Energy information agencies; Environmental consequences; Natural gas systems; Use of renewable energies; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947222084

We have two primary generating plant sites: Deerhaven with two conventional coal-fired steam units (DH1 and DH2) and John R. Kelly (JCC1) combined-cycle Unit 1. Kelly Station (the focus of this study) is located in southeast Gainesville near the downtown business district. It has one - 120 MW combined-cycle unit (JCC1) in 1 x 1 configuration, consisting of: one GE Frame 7E combustion turbine (dual fuel), one Applied Thermal Systems two pressure HRSG, one 50-year old Westinghouse steam turbine unit with cooling tower, fuel storage, pumping equipment, transmission, and distribution equipment. In 2013, GRU with a seasonal peak load of approximately 500 MWs was to start receiving the output of a new 100 MW bio-fuel plant under a purchase power agreement. It was apparent that the operation of the GRU units would drastically change. It was predicted by GRU that DH2 a 255 MW coal unit would move to a cycling duty unit and the Kelly combined-cycle unit would be relegated to ""peaking"" operation. To better understand and predict future operational impacts, GRU contracted with Intertek AIM (APTECH) to conduct a Cost of Cycling study. This paper is our presentation of the results of the study and the changes that were indicated by the cycling analysis to manage the GRU system at the lowest cost and to incorporate the new modes of cycling operation. The expected modes of operation based on the results of the study were reversed to use the lowest cost unit for frequent cycling of JCC1 and changed the previously base loaded coal unit DH2 into a seasonal unit with long seasonal shut downs. This paper further shows the actions implemented by GRU at Kelly station to improve the cycling response and reduce the damage impact of each cycle by managing the startup ramp rates of the limiting equipment. The plant had limited budget for capital improvements and focused principally on managing the cost by modifying the startup procedures using real time operating data. Our conclusion was that by following the report recommendations, a new ""Start Model"" produced repeatable and acceptable results that minimized possible damage to the unit while meeting the need to use the renewable energy and support the customer by providing power at the lowest cost. The paper will demonstrate the improvement areas, the actual changes, and the results of those changes to the cycling data and the savings due to reduced damage. © 2015 by ASME.",,"Budget control; Cell engineering; Coal; Coal combustion; Cooling systems; Costs; Digital storage; Electric power generation; Equipment; Fuel storage; Plant shutdowns; Plant startup; Steam turbines; Sustainable development; Capital improvement; Combined cycle units; Distribution equipment; Distribution systems; Integrated utilities; Modes of operation; Operational impacts; Plant Asset Management; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947208463

The samples were then exposed to UV light beams in order to assist the layers polymerization by the proper exposure process. The photo chemical reaction occurred during the UV light polymerization process induces photo refractive changes which were presented as a function of wavelength or photon energy. Two main strong absorption peaks were observed in the films at around 330 nm (3.75 eV) and 500 nm (2.48 eV) for different curing time periods. This phenomenon enhances the films usage for optical data storage media at these two wavelengths. Since the deposited films were then useful as based layers for Read/Write optical data storage media, they were then tested by UV or laser Read/Write beams independently. The optical properties of the films were investigated while exposed to each beam. Finally, their optical properties were investigated as a function of aging time in order to relate the temporary and/or permanent light-exposure effect on the films compared to their optical properties before the light exposure. The films show a low absorbance at 630 nm (1.97 eV) and high absorbance at 480 nm (2.58 eV). This fact makes it possible to record holographic gratings in the polymeric film upon light exposure. In all cases the optical properties were evaluated by using the very sensitive, non destructive surface testing spectroscopic ellipsometry technique. The films were characterized in the spectral range of 300 to 1000 nm using Lorentz oscillator model with one oscillator centred at 4.15 eV.

This is mainly due to biogas production, which can be used for both power and heat production. The need for identifying different methods for on-site energy production and use is given by the increased operational costs of the water systems. The paper presents the results obtained when evaluating the heating needs of an anaerobic digester from a wastewater treatment plant situated in the Romanian shore area. These consist of heating needs for increasing the sludge temperature to the optimal value for the mesophilic stabilization and for covering the heat loss through the tank walls, cover and bottom. Each of them was differently calculated considering the specific conditions. In order to evaluate the heating needs, various parameters were monitored during extended time periods, including the sludge inflow, outside temperature, regional climate parameters, the sludge temperature before and after the heating system. Although the technological heat consumption has the highest contribution on the global plant heating needs, buildings heating was also evaluated in order to determine the global wastewater treatment plant thermal energy consumption. Biogas production was also monitored and on-site heat production for the plant needs was evaluated. The wastewater treatment plant on-site heating system consists of boilers and in the coming period will be equipped with cogeneration units. The results have shown that in the studied case the biogas production covers the thermal needs of the anaerobic digestion process. At the moment the biogas that exceeds the storage capacity is burned instead of being straightly released into the atmosphere but as soon as the CHP units will be installed it will be used this gas for energy production in order to cover an increased percentage of the plant power consumption. © SGEM 2015.","Anaerobic digestion; Heat; Wastewater","Biogas; Cogeneration plants; Energy utilization; Heating; Heating equipment; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Sludge digestion; Sludge disposal; Stabilization; Wastewater; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Anaerobic digester; Anaerobic digestion process; Biogas production; Energy productions; Heat consumption; Sludge stabilization; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment sludge; Anaerobic digestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946736425

In case of diesel fuel, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) is used as a substituent. FAME is manufactured by the transesterification of vegetable oils and therefore referred to as the first generation biodiesel. Natural oxidation processes (autoxidation) during storage cause degradation of FAME and the formation of secondary oxidation products. These degradation products cause interactions with fossil diesel which lead to further problems in engine applications. In this study the oxidation processes and reactions are described based on rapeseed methyl ester (RME). Secondary oxidation products, formed by ageing, are characterized analytically. Results from these experiments should allow conclusions for future applications. The practical laboratory experiments are carried out with pure RME. These secondary oxidation products formed by ageing were characterized by gas chromatography / mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis and spectroscopic methods. Based on observed changes during the process of ageing viscosity was measured and solubility tests were performed to determine the polarity and miscibility. Artificial ageing in the laboratory resulted in an almost complete degradation of unsaturated fatty acids of pure RME. Oxiraneoctanoicacid-3-octyl-methylester was formed as main secondary oxidation product. For formation of this epoxide two possible chemical reaction paths have been established. The first reaction is an autoxidation and decomposition of hydroperoxides of oleic acid to alkoxyl radicals and the other reaction is a direct epoxidation of the double bond via peroxycarboxylic acids. The knowledge about the possible reaction paths and the resulting effects are used for the development of new additive compounds to improve the oxidation stability of FAME and to enhance the utilization of raw materials by preventing unusability of aged biodiesel. © SGEM2015.","Biodiesel; FAME; Oxidation","Biodiesel; Chemical analysis; Chemical bonds; Chromatography; Degradation; Diesel fuels; Esters; Fatty acids; Fuels; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Oxidation resistance; Solubility; Spectroscopic analysis; Unsaturated fatty acids; Degradation products; FAME; Fatty acid methyl ester; Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopies; Laboratory experiments; Rapeseed methyl ester; Secondary oxidation products; Spectroscopic method; Oxidation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946712349

This paper presents the results of comparative study regarding the electrolytically production of hydrogen by two types of hybrid energy systems. The first hybrid power system was the type solar hydrogen (SE-HS) and the second type is hybrid power system wind hydrogen (SE-HE), energy systems that supply a residential building with a low energy, with location in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Analysis of electrolytic hydrogen production was conducted during one year of operation by evaluating the following performance indicators: energy used by electrolyser to generate hydrogen, operating time of electrolyser and the amount of hydrogen produced, also the amount of electricity that can be generated using the electrolytic hydrogen. The purpose of comparative analysis was to determine the most favorable version of the system which can be used for power supply of consumer type passive house, on contextual conditions to analyzed emplacement. The results show that using hydrogen on hybrid power generation systems favors increasing the use and harnessing of the renewable sources available for emplacement study, hydrogen is a storage medium thereof, also is the source of energy during the supply for intermittences caused by weather conditions and for covering the peak load demands. © SGEM2015.","Clean technologies; Hydrogen production; Passive house; Renewable sources","Electric power systems; Electrolytic analysis; Houses; Hydrogen storage; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Clean technologies; Electrolysis of waters; Electrolytic hydrogen production; Hybrid power generation systems; Passive house; Renewable energy source; Renewable sources; Sustainable energy sources; Hydrogen production",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946709035

In particular, it will be demonstrated that it is possible to synthesize NCD films whose dielectric properties exceed that of standard dielectric materials at temperatures above 300 °C.

During operation, components of nuclear facilities, including sensors, may degrade due to age, environmental exposure, and even maintenance interventions. These factors (which could lead to failure of the sensing element) result in anomalies, such as signal drift and response time changes in the measured signal, and challenge the ability to reliably distinguish between signal changes due to plant or subsystem performance deviations and those due to sensor or instrumentation issues. Online monitoring (OLM) is a non-invasive approach to assess measurement accuracy and component condition and provides an alternative to periodic sensor recalibration (the dominant current approach to addressing these instrumentation problems), which is costly, radiation-intensive, and time-consuming. No U.S. plant has implemented OLM for the purpose of extending sensor calibration intervals except for short-term demonstration and research purposes. This is partly due to several technical gaps that must be addressed in order to provide the technical and regulatory bases for these technologies for existing and future plants. Addressing these gaps will require the ability to better quantify sources of OLM uncertainty and associated bounds. This paper presents research supported by the Advanced Sensors and Instrumentation pathway of the U.S. Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy Enabling Technology program on a data-driven uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for OLM. A multi-output Gaussian process technique for UQ, which incorporates both spatial and temporal correlations from measured data in computing the uncertainty bounds, is proposed. The resulting UQ method can track changes in the uncertainty bounds as operating conditions change. Assessment of the proposed UQ methodology using data from an instrumented flow loop indicates the feasibility of generating error bounds on measurement data that are time-dependent. Further, results indicate that the approach may provide insights into the development of fault detection techniques for OLM sensor fault identification and localization.","Calibration assessment; Gaussian process; Online monitoring (OLM); Uncertainty quantification (UQ)","Calibration; Digital storage; Error analysis; Fault detection; Fuel storage; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Man machine systems; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Uncertainty analysis; Enabling technologies; Environmental exposure; Fault detection techniques; Gaussian Processes; Online monitoring; Spatial and temporal correlation; U.S. Department of Energy; Uncertainty quantifications; Partial discharges",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946202801

This is a concern both for current operating plants as well as new builds. • General familiarity and comfort with the existing analog technology on the part of the nuclear plant engineering staff, in spite of the superior performance and reduced maintenance costs of the digital replacements. At the same time, the nuclear industry is under significant cost pressure in the electric marketplace due to the abundance of gas generation. The industry would benefit by investment in new technologies that could lower future operating costs while addressing current obsolescence and reliability issues of the current technologies. However, the industry has been unable to formulate the business cases to take advantage of these labor savings and production reliability improvements. This paper presents the benefits digital actuator technology for four types of actuators that account for the vast majority of control applications in a nuclear power plant: pneumatic control, hydraulic control, motor control, and variable frequency drives. The paper describes the common failure modes of the analog actuators as confirmed by actual component failure records from an industry failure data base. The paper discusses the benefits of digital actuators, which are generally found in two main areas. First, the digital technology offers superior operational performance over its analog counterparts, in terms of accuracy and reliability. Second, the cost of maintaining the digital actuators is lower due to simplicity of operation (circuit boards vs. mechanical parts) and on-board diagnostics that greatly improve troubleshooting and repair. Notwithstanding the benefits of digital actuators, there are certain qualification and licensing challenges that are inherent with digital technology, and these are described in the report. One major qualification impediment for digital sensor implementation is software common cause failure (SCCF). A typical analysis for SCCF, in the form of a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulatory submittal, is presented to demonstrate the difficulty in addressing SCCF for nuclear safety-related designs. It also addresses what options exist to mitigate the SCCF concerns. The paper concludes with a summary of benefits to be gained and challenges to be addressed in pursuing the wide-scale application of digital actuator technology. In particular, it highlights the need for new approaches in digital technology qualification over the only currently-accepted approach of presenting a coping analysis for an assumed SCCF.","Actuator; Digital; Nuclear power; Software common cause failure","Actuators; Application programs; Cost engineering; Costs; Digital storage; Failure analysis; Hydraulic actuators; Hydraulic machinery; Man machine systems; Nuclear energy; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Obsolescence; Operating costs; Outages; Reliability; Safety engineering; Variable speed drives; Common cause failure; Digital; Nuclear plant designs; Nuclear regulatory commission; Operational performance; Production reliability; Reduced maintenance costs; Variable frequency drives; Pneumatic actuators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946125713

On this account, the mechanical, rheological and thermal properties of cement-lime dry plaster mixture with addition of 4, 8 and 12 mass% of PCM water dispersion are experimentally investigated in the paper. The increasing amount of applied PCM admixture causes the significant improvement of the plaster heat storage capacity in dependence on temperature exposure applied in the performed DSC experiment. Contrary to this positive finding, the higher content of tested polymer microencapsulated PCM in plaster matrix leads to the lower mechanical strength. However, it is still sufficient for construction applications. © (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Latent heat storage; Mechanical properties; Modified plaster; Phase change enthalpy; Phase change material; Thermal properties","Building materials; Buildings; Dispersions; Energy conservation; Heat storage; Latent heat; Lime; Mechanical properties; Plaster; Storage (materials); Sustainable development; Thermodynamic properties; Construction applications; Construction elements; Heat storage capacity; New building materials; Phase change enthalpy; Sustainability principles; Temperature exposure; Thermal performance of buildings; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945965629

As a by-product of this activity, approximately 37 million gallons of high-level liquid waste containing approximately 292 million curies of radioactivity is stored on an interim basis in 43 underground storage tanks. Originally, 51 tanks were constructed and utilized to support the mission. Six tanks have been operationally closed and taken out of service and two are currently undergoing the closure process. The Liquid Waste System is a highly integrated operation involving safely storing liquid waste in underground storage tanks; removing, treating, and dispositioning the low-level waste fraction in concrete; vitrifying the higher activity waste at the Defense Waste Processing Facility; and storing the vitrified waste in stainless steel canisters until permanent disposition. After waste removal and processing, the storage and processing facilities are cleaned and closed. A Liquid Waste System Plan was developed to integrate and document the activities required to disposition legacy and future High-Level Waste and to remove from service radioactive liquid waste tanks and facilities. It establishes and records a planning basis for waste processing in the liquid waste system through the end of the program mission. The integrated Plan which recognizes the challenges of constrained funding provides a path forward to complete the liquid waste mission within all regulatory and legal requirements. The overarching objective of the Plan is to meet all Federal Facility Agreement and Site Treatment Plan regulatory commitments on or ahead of schedule while preserving as much lifecycle acceleration as possible through incorporation of numerous cost savings initiatives, elimination of non-essential scope, and deferral of other scope not on the critical path to compliance. There is currently a premium on processing and storage space in the radioactive liquid waste tank system. To enable continuation of risk reduction initiatives, the Plan establishes a processing strategy that provides tank space required to meet, or minimizes the impacts to meeting, programmatic objectives. The Plan also addresses perturbations in funding and schedule impacts.",,"Liquids; Plant shutdowns; Radioactive materials; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Regulatory compliance; Stainless steel; Storage (materials); Tanks (containers); Vitrification; Defense waste processing facilities; High-level liquid waste; Integrated Operations; Processing facilities; Processing strategies; Radioactive liquid waste; Savannah River sites; Underground storage tanks; Waste management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945317289

The goals of these inspections were to demonstrate the accessibility of the canister surface and to collect information on the environmental conditions experienced by the canisters over decades of storage. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) has been identified as a potential degradation mechanism for stainless steel dry storage canisters. While laboratory studies indicate that SCC can occur in the materials used for dry storage canisters when exposed to a marine atmosphere, data from in-service canisters are needed to evaluate such behavior in real-world conditions. Conditions important for atmospheric-related SCC include temperature, humidity, distance and elevation from salt water, air flow, and the concentration of chlorides and other particulates in the air. Hence, to provide the information on the canister conditions the inspections included: visual inspection for signs of corrosion, canister surface temperature distribution, and salt and dust deposition on the canister surfaces (amounts and composition). To gather the data, EPRI collaborated with utilities and cask vendors to obtain visuals, temperature measurements, and surface samples from canisters at three in-service Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSIs).",,"Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric temperature; Corrosion; Degradation; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Inspection; Radioactive waste storage; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Stainless steel; Storage (materials); Stress corrosion cracking; Temperature measurement; Waste management; Degradation mechanism; Electric Power Research Institute; Environmental conditions; Independent spent fuel storage installations; Laboratory studies; Marine atmosphere; Surface temperature distribution; Visual inspection; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945315088

The PWR cladding alloys included Zircaloy-4 (Zry-4), ZIRLO™, and M5® in the as-irradiated condition and following simulated drying and storage at elevated temperature and pressure. The particular focus of this work was to determine the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) as a function of hydrogen content and peak drying-storage temperature, internal gas pressure, and pressure-induced hoop stress. Ring-compression tests (RCTs) were used to determine cladding ductility as a function of RCT test temperature, which in turn was used to determine DBTT. Characterization and RCT results from this work are summarized for HBU PWR cladding in the as-irradiated condition and following slow cooling from 400°C at peak hoop stresses in the range of 80 to 140 MPa. A direct correlation was found between 400°C hoop stress, the effective length of radial hydrides, and the DBTT. The radial-hydride continuity factor (RHCF) was used to determine the effective length of radial hydrides. Essentially, it is a measure of the fraction of cladding wall thickness along which unstable cracks can grow. While RHCF proved to correlate quite well with DBTT for HBU ZIRLO™ with 350 to 650 wppm hydrogen, a different relationship between DBTT and RHCF was found for M5® with only 60 to 90 wppm hydrogen. Other metrics were evaluated to determine the best metric or combination of metrics that correlated with DBTT for all PWR cladding alloys.",,"Cladding (coating); Compression testing; Ductility; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Residual stresses; Waste management; Zirconium alloys; Ductile-to-brittle transition temperature; Elevated temperature and pressure; Internal gas pressure; Ring compression tests; Storage temperatures; Test temperatures; U.S. Department of Energy; U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Pressurized water reactors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945303894

However, federal programs intended to meet this expectation were never able to develop the capability to remove used fuel from reactor sites - and these programs remain stalled to this day. Therefore, in the 1980s, with reactor pools reaching capacity limits, industry began developing dry cask storage technology to provide for additional on-site storage. Use of this technology has expanded significantly since then, and has today become a standard part of plant operations at most U.S. nuclear sites. Today, with no federal program yet on the horizon, it is evident that dry cask systems will be in use longer than originally envisioned and many storage systems now are coming due for license or certification renewal. In response to this challenge, a strong technical basis supporting long term dry storage safety has been developed. This technical basis includes not only the existing body of knowledge gained from the placement of over 2,000 dry storage systems into service over the past 28 years but also a forward-looking research and development component that will enable industry to address future challenges. Industry has responded to one such challenge - the increasing prevalence of high burnup (HBU) used fuel in dry storage - with a confirmatory High Burnup Dry Storage Cask Research and Development Project (HDRP) designed to address the aging characteristics of HBUfuel storage, validate thermal analysis codes and obtain additional information about conditions following vacuum drying. The HDRP - jointly funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) and Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) - involves loading a specially instrumented dry storage cask with a diverse collection of high burnup fuel, monitoring the condition of the fuel and cask in storage, and eventually transport the cask to a DOE site where it will be opened and the fuel examined. Loading the HDRP cask at Dominion's North Anna site is currently scheduled for 2017. The HDRP is also now being integrated into dry storage aging management programs at commercial power plant sites as part of the basis for the renewal of independent spent fuel storage installation licenses for periods beyond 20 years. This paper reports on the progress of the HDRP thus far, describes the role it is playing in license renewals, and highlights additional research and development needs going forward. The HDRP has become a central element of a comprehensive research and development portfolio supporting industry's goal of establishing a holistic approach to aging management.",,"Electric energy storage; Fuels; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Nuclear reactor licensing; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Research and development management; Spent fuels; Storage management; Thermoanalysis; Waste disposal; Waste management; Aging characteristics; Aging management programs; Comprehensive research; Department of Energy; Electric Power Research Institute; Independent spent fuel storage installations; Research and development; Research and development projects; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945303381

Since it became operational in 1951, the site has produced nuclear material for national defense, research, medical, and space programs. The separation of fissionable nuclear material from irradiated targets and fuels resulted in the generation of over 150 million gallons of radioactive waste. Originally, 51 tanks were constructed and utilized to support the mission. Six tanks have been operationally closed and taken out of service and two are currently undergoing the closure process. Most of the tank waste is a complex mixture of chemical and radioactive waste generated during the separation of special nuclear materials and enriched uranium from irradiated targets and spent fuel using the Plutonium Uranium Reduction Extraction (PUREX) process in the F-Canyon separation facility and the modified PUREX process in the H-Canyon separation facility (HM process). Waste generated from the recovery of Pu-238 in H-Canyon for the production of heat sources for space missions is also included. The waste was converted to an alkaline solution; metal oxides settled as sludge (iron, aluminum, uranium, manganese, nickel, and mercury), and supernate evaporated to form saltcake. The Liquid Waste System is a highly integrated operation involving safely storing liquid waste in underground storage tanks; removing, treating, and dispositioning the low-level waste fraction in concrete; vitrifying the higher activity waste at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF); and storing the vitrified waste in stainless steel canisters until permanent disposition. Continued long-term storage of these radioactive wastes poses a potential environmental risk. Therefore, since 1996, DOE and its contractors have been removing waste from tanks, pre-treating it, vitrifying it, and pouring the vitrified waste into canisters for long-term disposal in a permanent repository. As of December 31, 2014, DWPF had produced 3,917 vitrified waste canisters.",,"Alkalinity; Fluorine; Interplanetary flight; Manganese oxide; Plant shutdowns; Radioactive materials; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Separation; Stainless steel; Tanks (containers); Uranium; Vitrification; Waste disposal; Waste management; Defense waste processing facilities; Department of Energy; High-level waste management; Integrated Operations; Savannah River sites; Separation facilities; Special nuclear materials; Underground storage tanks; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945296889

Direct disposal of DPCs, without cutting them open and re-packaging the fuel, is technically feasible at least for some DPCs and some disposal concepts. Options for DPC direct disposal are taking form, based on an ongoing study by the U.S. Department of Energy. Direct disposal of DPCs should be viewed as one part of a diverse fuel management system that will eventually switch to loading standardized multi-purpose canisters (MPCs). Nearly all DPCs that are loaded before this switch could be directly disposed depending on the disposal environment selected. DPC direct disposal options have been developed for salt, crystalline and sedimentary host media. These options are suited to different populations of DPCs, ranging from those containing older, colder fuel (e.g., in sedimentary media) to all DPCs (salt). The timing of DPC use offers an opportunity to simplify the SNF management system. Commercial SNF will be generated in the U.S. for more than 90 years, whereas facility lifetimes are typically on the order of 50 years. Efficiencies could be realized by implementing disposal in ""campaigns. "" Additional accumulation of DPCs over the next 10 to 20 years, followed by a transition to MPCs, would define two such campaigns. A repository could first be constructed for MPCs, and disposal of DPCs could be deferred and addressed later using new, dedicated facilities. During the interim storage period DPC thermal output would decay, further expanding disposal options.",,"Fuel storage; Fuels; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Sedimentology; Waste disposal; Waste management; Direct disposal; Fuel management systems; Management systems; Multi-purpose; Re-packaging; Spent nuclear fuels; Storage periods; U.S. Department of Energy; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945269624

While recorded documentation of technical and scientific information such as documents, media, software code and data is fundamental for the long-term safety assessments of a repository, there are additional categories of knowledge that need to be managed and preserved. These additional categories include cultural considerations such as history, social context, values, folklore, processes and procedures, plus the memories of staff, retirees and stakeholders in general. The preservation of knowledge for a nuclear waste repository is challenged by the long time scales involved and require management practices of recorded documentation, cultural considerations and memories that are robust and, as far as possible, future-proof technologically. Robustness also requires resiliency to future operational and societal changes, such as the advent of new organizational structures and evolutions in the decision making environment as well as the changing perceptions of stakeholders over time. This paper discusses issues associated with the management and preservation of knowledge, including consideration of approaches that are expected to mitigate the inevitable changes in organizational structures and changing perceptions of stakeholders over time. Three case studies are presented, the first one is associated with knowledge management and preservation at Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) associated with the maintenance of nuclear weapons. In the late 1990's, Sandia recognized the need to capture, maintain, catalog and store knowledge associated with the development, improvement and maintenance of nuclear weapons. Many of these weapons have been designed as early as the 1950's and there is a requirement to maintain them to ensure they perform as designed, and, most importantly, to remain safe while in storage. A second case study discusses knowledge preservation efforts attendant to the shut-down of the Yucca Mountain Project and the third case study discusses knowledge management and preservation for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant radioactive waste repository. As repository development continues to advance in many countries, several disposal programs began to examine means for passive oversights to enhance the long-term safety of the future disposal facilities. In 2011, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) Radioactive Waste Management Committee (RWMC) launched a project on the ""Preservation of Records, Knowledge and Memory (RK&M) across Generations"". The RK&M Project aims at formulating and developing knowledge preservation methods that endure the longest possible timeframe (i.e. including the post-closure phase). This paper reports on the progress of RK&M as well as an initiative connected to RK&M entitled REPMET (repository metadata). The aim of this initiative is to identify sets of metadata that can be used by national programs to manage their repository data, information and records in a way that is both harmonized internationally and suitable for long-term management and utilization. It will also formulate a consistent set of guiding principles for capturing and generating metadata. The RepMet project fills a unique and important niche in the broader programs on knowledge management that are conducted nationally and internationally. The REPMET initiative includes European, Asian and North American participants.",,"Decision making; Digital storage; Geological repositories; History; International cooperation; Knowledge management; Management science; Metadata; Nuclear weapons; Pilot plants; Plant shutdowns; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Site selection; Waste disposal; Knowledge preservations; Nuclear waste repositories; Organization for economic co-operation and development; Organizational structures; Processes and procedures; Radioactive waste repository; Sandia National Laboratories; Waste isolation pilot plants; Waste management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945265745

Progress is being made on long lead time, destination-independent aspects of the transportation infrastructure. The large-scale transportation system for spent nuclear fuel is divided into three elements: institutional, operational, and hardware. The institutional element refers to the various forms of stakeholder interaction that must occur for this type of transportation system to be successful. It includes activities like development of a national transportation plan, work on policy development to implement Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and identification of a preliminary suite of national transportation routes based on regulatory requirements and coordination with a broad cross section of stakeholders. The operational element refers to the activities that must be undertaken to run a large-scale transportation system. This element is currently focused on development of a new SNF transportation routing analysis tool, study of the infrastructure near SNF storage sites that may be de-inventoried first, and development of tools for modeling transportation activities.

A limited number of full-scale tests and supporting efforts using surrogate materials, typically depleted uranium dioxide (DUO2), have been conducted in the interim to more definitively determine the source term from these postulated events. In all the previous studies, the postulated attack of greatest interest was by a conical shape charge (CSC) that focuses the explosive energy much more efficiently than bulk explosives. However, the validity of these large-scale results remain in question due to the lack of a defensible Spent Fuel Ratio (SFR), defined as the amount of respirable aerosol generated by an attack on a mass of spent fuel compared to that of an otherwise identical surrogate. Previous attempts to define the SFR in the 1980's have resulted in estimates ranging from 0.42 to 12 and include suboptimal experimental techniques and data comparisons. Because of the large uncertainty surrounding the SFR, estimates of releases from security-related events may be unnecessarily conservative. Credible arguments exist that the SFR does not exceed a value of unity. A defensible determination of the SFR in this lower range would greatly reduce the calculated risk associated with the transport and storage of spent nuclear fuel in dry cask systems. In the present work, the CTH shock physics code is used to simulate spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and DUO2 targets impacted by a CSC jet at an ambient temperature condition. These preliminary results are used to illustrate an approach to estimate the respirable release fraction for each type of material and ultimately, an estimate of the SFR.",,"Digital storage; Explosives; Fighter aircraft; Fuel storage; Fuels; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Spent fuels; Uncertainty analysis; Uranium dioxide; Data comparisons; Experimental techniques; Full scale tests; Numerical estimation; Respirable aerosols; Spent nuclear fuels; Surrogate materials; Temperature conditions; Waste management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945251212

The ""Standard Contract"" a between the DOE and nuclear power plant operators establishes the ""oldest fuel first "" (OFF) Waste Queue in which acceptance rights for DOE to remove SNF from reactor sites is accorded first for fuel that has been permanently discharged from the reactor the longest. However, the Standard Contract also gives DOE the authority to accept fuel from shutdown reactor sites before fuel from operating sites, and allows for ""exchanges "" of acceptance obligations. The Standard Contract is silent with respect to the order of pick up within the group of shutdown plants. This paper outlines a simple, equitable and efficient ""mini-queue"" for shutdown plants. • To the extent practical, DOE would pick up fuel site by site. • The order of pick up would be for the longest shutdown plant first (LSPF)b. • For a multi-unit site, the shutdown date would be based on the most recently shutdown unit. • For sites containing both shutdown reactors and operating reactors, pick up would occur only after all fuel is removed from other sites with no operating reactors. Assuming DOE exercises its discretion under the Standard Contract to give preference to shutdown plants, a site-by-site approach to the mini-queue is clearly preferable to OFF. Site-by-site allows for the quickest possible termination of security, emergency planning and other activities to safeguard SNF, thereby benefitting not only the licensees, but also the government through reductions in damage claim payments c. Moreover, fuel removal and transportation operations will be accomplished more efficiently with minimal ""wait times "" between shipments. The LSPF approach to the mini-queue is equitable in that first relief is provided to the licensee that has been waiting the longest for necessary DOE performance in order to eliminate regulatory requirements associated with the possession of SNF. Removal of spent fuel from a site that still hosts an operating nuclear power reactor does not provide the same benefit as removing all spent fuel from a site with no operating reactors. In the former instance, the licensee must still maintain a security and emergency planning infrastructure for the site, obviating most cost and resource savings. Finally, it should be noted this mini-queue for removal of fuel from shutdown plants in no way modifies any obligation of the government or any aspect of the Standard Contract, including the general OFF queue. This proposed approach is consistent with the Standard Contract and can be implemented under DOE's existing authority without contract modification or legislative authorization.",,"Fuel storage; Fuels; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Pickups; Plant shutdowns; Pressure tube reactors; Queueing theory; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Spent fuels; Waste disposal; Waste management; Contract modification; Disposal facilities; Nuclear power plant operators; Nuclear power reactors; Regulatory requirements; Spent nuclear fuels; Transportation operations; U.S. Department of Energy; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945248857

The mission of the UFDC is to identify alternatives and conduct scientific research and technology development to enable storage, transportation and disposal of used nuclear fuel and HLW generated by existing and future nuclear fuel cycles. The Storage and Transportation staff within the UFDC is responsible for addressing issues regarding the long-term or extended storage (ES) of UNF and its subsequent transportation. Available information is not sufficient to determine the ability of UNF, including high-burnup fuel, to withstand shock and vibration forces that could occur when the UNF is shipped by rail from nuclear power plant sites to a storage or disposal facility after extended storage. There are three major gaps in the available information-1) the forces that UNF assemblies would be subjected to when transported by rail, 2) the mechanical characteristics of fuel rod cladding, which is an essential structure for controlling the geometry of the UNF, a safety related feature, and 3) modeling methodologies to evaluate multiple possible degradation or damage mechanisms over the UNF lifetime. In order to address the first gap, options for tests to determine the physical response of surrogate UNF assemblies subjected to shock and vibration forces that are expected to be experienced during normal conditions of transportation (NCT) by rail must be identified and evaluated. The objective of the rail shock and vibration tests is to obtain data that will help researchers understand the mechanical loads that UNF assemblies would be subjected to under normal conditions of transportation and to fortify the computer modeling that will be necessary to evaluate the impact those loads may have on the integrity of the UNF assembly. The shock and vibration testing along with computer modeling is a vital part of research to achieve closure of a gap in information related to the ability of UNF to maintain its safety function when subjected to NCT. In support of this effort, preliminary structural dynamics modeling was conducted. The modeling investigates the rigidity of a hypothetical cask and cradle structure by comparing it to a monolithic concrete mass. The concrete mass represents a practical option for achieving the necessary cask and cradle mass on a flatbed railcar, but this comparative modeling study investigates whether or not the dynamic loads transmitted through a monolithic concrete configuration are adequately representative of a realistic cask and cradle system. This modeling highlights the need for rail testing by reporting the phenomenon of structural transmissibility. As shown herein, this structural transmissibility can cause an amplification of shock and vibration loads through the structure, which could potentially lead to accelerated mechanical degradation of UNF under NCT.",,"Ability testing; Concretes; Digital storage; Dynamic loads; Fuel storage; Fuels; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Plant shutdowns; Radioactive waste transportation; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Rigid structures; Safety testing; Shock testing; Structural dynamics; Transportation; Vibration analysis; Vibrations (mechanical); Waste disposal; Waste management; High level radioactive wastes; Mechanical characteristics; Mechanical degradation; Nuclear fuel assemblies; Research and development; Storage and transportations; Structural dynamics models; U.S. Department of Energy; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945244698

Additionally, resident and recruited macrophages constitute an important part of the adipose tissue, responsible for the secretion of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.Up until now, more than 40 different adipokines have been described. From these, leptin and adiponectin are the most studied during critical illness.Although knowledge is still limited, current available literature suggests that the endocrine functions of adipose tissue might play an adaptive role during critical illness. In the acute phase of illness, the anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing adiponectin is reduced, while pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in adipose tissue is upregulated. In the prolonged phase of critical illness, both adiponectin and anti-inflammatory cytokine production are increasing. Reports on the pro-inflammatory leptin during critical illness are controversial in both humans and animal investigations, possibly due to confounders such as gender, body mass index, and nutritional strategy.Observational studies report lower mortality in obese than in lean critically ill patients, an association referred to as the “obesity paradox.“Potentially, the altered adipokine secretion profile observed in obesity plays a protective role during critical illness. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945156643

The heat pipe was designed to be used in a thermal energy storage for concentrating solar power systems. It consists of a primary heat pipe and an array of secondary heat pipes. In the complex heat pipe, all thermal energy applied to the evaporator is transferred to the condenser via phase change and vapor/liquid flow of the working fluid. Some part of the heat absorbed by the heat engine and the excess heat is used to charge the phase change material through secondary heat pipes. Due to the complex geometry of the heat pipe, a new numerical approach was developed.

To do so the middleware layers of SDDCs must be able to calculate and account for complex dependence relationships to determine an optimal data layout.

Crashworthiness refers to implementing a strong occupant compartment that resists intrusion and to designing crushable front and rear structures that deform and perform work to dissipate the kinetic energy of the crash. This combination provides controlled vehicle deceleration and survival space in the occupant compartment. Occupant restraint refers to the use of lap-shoulder belts, airbags, and other systems to provide ride-down of the vehicle deceleration, containment on the seat, and distribution of forces on the pelvis, shoulder, chest, and other designated anatomical structures to decelerate the occupant. The effectiveness of current restraint designs for protecting the occupant and reducing the risk of serious injury and death in a crash are well documented. Lap-shoulder belts are approximately 40 % effective in preventing death, with the highest effectiveness of nearly 80 % in rollovers and the lowest of approximately 30 % in near-side impacts [1]. In frontal crashes, the addition of the airbag to the three-point belt system raises the effectiveness level to approximately 50 %. Despite this impressive safety record, belt system performance is continually being refined. For example, recent papers have discussed the development of four-point harnesses for use in production vehicles [2, 3], and devices such as pretensioners and belt load limiters [4] are becoming common features in contemporary vehicles. A pretensioner, which is usually pyrotechnic, triggers from the deceleration characteristic imparted to the vehicle by an impact. The charge winds several centimeters of belt around its storage spool, thereby removing slack in the system, generating a decelerating force on the occupant, and reducing the time required to generate force (tension) in the belt (i.e., the response time). Load-limiters typically involve an element within the belt retractor that yields when a pre-determined belt tension level is reached. This tension may range from 2 to 6 kN, and in the most advanced systems can be transient and programmable. These refinements introduce significant changes in the shape of the restraining force profile (Fig. 5.1), which have been shown to enhance belt performance both in the laboratory and on the road [6-12]. As this technology continues to develop, the characteristics of the restraining force applied to the occupant are becoming increasingly controllable. Continued improvement in restraint performance may be possible by implementing active control as an integral part of the restraint system. Steps have been taken to develop active systems (sometimes referred to as ""smart""restraints) that adapt based on various inputs. For example, dual-stage pretensioners may modulate the magnitude of belt retraction based on the severity of the collision. Other ""smart"" aspects of restraint systems have been discussed by several researchers [4, 13-16].This chapter reviews the biomechanics of restraints. The discussion includes a description of occupant kinematics for belted and unbelted occupants in frontal impacts with and without an airbag.

This tissue is formed from mesoderm during embryonic development and is comprised of several fat depots around the body. It is composed from adipocytes, the cells forming the majority of the tissue when studied in histological sections, as well as several other cell types, namely preadipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes and innate immune cells. In all mammals including humans, two types of adipose tissue are recognized, white and brown adipose tissue (WAT and BAT, respectively), which are engaged in two major distinct and opposite functions: energy storage (in WAT) and energy dissipation (in BAT). White adipocytes are spherical unilocular cells, filled by a large lipid droplet, with all cellular organelles packed in a thin cytoplasmic rim in the vicinity of plasma membrane. Brown adipocytes are polygonal multilocular cells, with cytoplasmic space filled with typical mitochondria containing many cristae. Brown adipocytes are marked by the presence of mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), which mediates cold- and diet-inducible non-shivering thermogenesis that is adrenergically regulated. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944549175

In this chapter, after describing the demands and challenges faced by the memory system, we examine some promising research and design directions to overcome challenges posed by memory scaling. Specifically, we describe three major solutiondirections: (1) enabling new DRAM architectures, functions, interfaces, and better integration of the DRAM and the rest of the system (an approach we call system-DRAM co-design), (2) designing a memory system that employs emerging nonvolatile memory technologies and takes advantage of multiple different technologies(i.e., hybrid memory systems), (3) providing predictable performance and QoS to applications sharing the memory system (i.e., QoS-aware memory systems).

Extensive applications of rGO have been explored ina variety of electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies (e.g., fuel cells, metal–air batteries, supercapacitors, and water splitting devices). In particular, GO/rGO was studied as efficient components in catalysts in fuel cells and metal–air batteries for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), one pair of the most important electrochemical reactions. The promising applications are primarily due to their unique physical and chemical properties, such as high surface area, access to large quantities, tunable electronic/ionic conductivity, unique graphitic basal plane structure, and the easiness of modification or functionalization. Chemical doping with heteroatoms (e.g., N, B, P, or S) into graphitic domains can tune the electronic properties, provide more active sites, and enhance the interaction between carbon structures and oxygen molecules. Meanwhile, GO/rGO has demonstrated excellent performances in electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs, also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors) with excellent volumetric and gravimetric capacitance densities as well as feasibility in design and fabrications. Additionally, rGO holds great promise to be high-performance anode materials in lithium-ion batteries due to its favorable interactions with Li.

However, these complex communication systems can be disturbed by increased levels of inflammation leading to metabolic defects (obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes) that can make successful procreation difficult, and more ominously these metabolic defects can possibly be transmitted to the next generation via fetal programming. The purpose of this opening chapter is to present an overview of how diet-induced inflammation can lead eventually to metabolic syndrome that can have an adverse effect on pregnancy. Inflammation is easy to define but complex to understand at the molecular level. The same is true for insulin resistance. Nonetheless, cellular inflammation induced by hypothalamic and adipose tissue damage that results from a wide variety of dietary factors appears to be a key to understanding and therefore reversing the wide range of the adverse metabolic consequences of insulin resistance. It appears that insulin resistance starts in the hypothalamus causing a disruption in the balance of satiety and hunger signals. This leads to overconsumption of calories. Although excess calories can be theoretically stored safety in the adipose tissue, as the inflammation increases in this organ and insulin resistance develops in the fat cells, the ability to safely store excess fat is compromised. One of the consequences of insulin resistance in the adipose tissue is that excess fat is released into the bloodstream and is sequestered by other organs (liver and skeletal muscles) that are not equipped to safely store this excess fat. This is the start of lipotoxicity. With increased lipotoxicity, the metabolism and energy generation by the body become compromised, and the development of chronic diseases becomes accelerated. Since insulin resistance is primarily caused by the diet, it can also be reversed by the diet, especially an anti-inflammatory diet, as will be discussed later in this book. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943622166

There is substantial genetic variation in the content of each of these compounds among cultivars. The content of carotenoids and phenolics appear to be more sensitive to environmental conditions both pre- and post-harvest. Although the content of certain carotenoids and phenolics can actually increase during suitable conditions of fresh storage, phenolic compounds are more susceptible to loss during processing, especially by leaching from plant tissues into processing water (nixtamalization). Specific environmental conditions appear to increase the level of phenolic compounds but do not affect the content of carotenoids.

For this reason more completely modeling the evolutions inside the material is necessary to consider into the developed standard kinetic model. In this paper the photo-polymerization processes during the large thickness holographic grating formation are analyzed. A 3-dimensional algorithm is present by deriving the system partial differential rate equations governing each associated chemical species, and using the finite difference approximation, these equations can be solved numerically. This extended model describes the time varying behaviors of the non-uniform photo-physical and the photochemical evolutions in photopolymer materials. In this model both dye molecules consumption and light energy absorption are calculated time varyingly, and then the polymer and monomer concentrations distributions are obtained.

However, the development of the battery technology is slow in energy storage capability and cannot meet such requirements. This paper proposed an optimal frame design for a kind of portable piezoelectric stack energy harvesters, with large force magnification ratio and high energy transmission ratio. Two kinds of design approaches have been studied and explored, i.e., flexure compliant mechanism math based and finite element analysis (FEA) based. Prototypes are fabricated and assembled.

However, the development of STT-RAM is facing two major technical challenges—poor write reliability and high write energy, both of which are severely impacted by process variations and thermal fluctuations. The evaluations on STT-RAM design metrics and robustness often require a hybrid simulation flow, i.e., modeling the CMOS and magnetic devices with SPICE and Macro-magnetic models, respectively. Very often, such a hybrid simulation flow involves expensive Monte-Carlo simulations when the design and behavioral variabilities of STT-RAM are taken into account. In this chapter, we will first analyze the prominent process variations and operation uncertainty in STT-RAM design. Then, a fast and scalable semi-analytical method—PS3-RAM will be introduced to enable efficient statistical simulations in STT-RAM designs, followed by its applications on modeling the STT-RAM cell write error rate and write energy distributions.

In total, there are over 1482 dry cask storage system (DCSS) in use at US plants, storing 57,807 fuel assemblies. Nondestructive material condition monitoring is in urgent need and must be integrated into the fuel cycle to quantify the €state of health€ , and more importantly, to guarantee the safe operation of radioactive waste storage systems (RWSS) during their extended usage period. A state-of-The-Art nuclear structural health monitoring (N-SHM) system based on in-situ sensing technologies that monitor material degradation and aging for nuclear spent fuel DCSS and similar structures is being developed. The N-SHM technology uses permanently installed low-profile piezoelectric wafer sensors to perform long-term health monitoring by strategically using a combined impedance (EMIS), acoustic emission (AE), and guided ultrasonic wave (GUW) approach, called multimode sensing, which is conducted by the same network of installed sensors activated in a variety of ways. The system will detect AE events resulting from crack (case for study in this project) and evaluate the damage evolution; when significant AE is detected, the sensor network will switch to the GUW mode to perform damage localization, and quantification as well as probe hot spots that are prone to damage for material degradation evaluation using EMIS approach. The N-SHM is expected to eventually provide a systematic methodology for assessing and monitoring nuclear waste storage systems without incurring human radiation exposure. © 2015 SPIE.","Dry Cask Canister; Nuclear Energy; Piezoelectric; Sensing; Structural Health Monitoring","Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic impedance; Condition monitoring; Crack detection; Damage detection; Fuel storage; Fuels; Intelligent materials; Monitoring; Nondestructive examination; Nuclear energy; Piezoelectricity; Radioactive waste storage; Radioactive wastes; Sensor networks; Storage (materials); Switching circuits; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonic testing; Waste management; Guided ultrasonic waves; Material degradation; Nuclear waste storage; Piezoelectric; Piezoelectric wafer sensors; Sensing; Structural health monitoring systems; Systematic methodology; Structural health monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943394524

The world’s dependence on unsustainable fossil fuels (almost 90%), and the increasing population demand new sources of energy for sustainable human activities. Algae, and particularly microalgae have nowadays become of enormous importance as a new potential source of feedstock for renewable bioenergy production. As photosynthetic microorganisms, microalgae may potentially be produced as carbon neutral and can be produced on non-arable land and cultured in marine and wastewater e?uents. Furthermore, microalgae can be used to produce a range of products such as protein-rich animal feed in aquaculture, high-value products, viz, polyunsaturated fatty acids, bioactive and functional pigments and natural dyes, health foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. In this chapter, an update of the advances in microalgal biotechnology is presented as a new biomass for the potential development of biofuels, and as a realistic source of highly valuable molecules of industrial interest. The potential to harness endogenous carbon storage compounds, triacylglyceride (TAGs) and starch, as products of photosynthesis, including the photoproduction of hydrogen, can contribute to diversify the sources and yields of feedstocks for biofuel production. Even if the production of microalgae for biofuels is highly promissory and clearly has potential for contributing to environmental, social, and economic sustainability, presently this alternative is unsustainable. Definitely, the combination of bio-fuel production by microalgal biotechnology with co-products may contribute to the sustainability of biofuels, a condition with null or less impact on natural resources and biodiversity. The integration of all the components of the uses of microalgae, i. e, high-value compounds, aquaculture, and bioremediation coupled to the production of bio-fuels will play an important role in the near future to make the production of biofuels from microalgae sustainable. The integration of genomics, metabolic engineering, nanotechnology, and other areas to the aforementioned issues shall lead to a wide range of benefits for the tasks demanded by the forthcoming bioenergy industries. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,"Algae; Aquaculture; Biodiversity; Biomass; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Hydrogen storage; Metabolic engineering; Microorganisms; Polyunsaturated fatty acids; Sustainable development; Bioenergy industry; Bioenergy productions; Biofuel production; Economic sustainability; Functional pigments; Photoproductions; Photosynthetic microorganisms; Potential sources; Biofuels",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943391947

Such harvesters can have useful applications in the operation of low power devices, and their relatively small size makes them ideal for use in urban environments over civil infrastructure. One of the areas of focus regarding piezoelectric energy harvesting is the circuit topology used to store the harvested power. This study aims to further investigate the increase in potential energy yield from the piezoelectric harvester by optimizing the circuitry connecting the piezoelectric transducer and the power storage interface. When compared to an optimal resistive load case, it has been shown that certain circuit topologies, specifically synchronized switching and discharging to a storage capacitor through an inductor (SSDCI), can increase the charging power by as much as 400% if the circuit is completely lossless. This paper proposes a strategy for making a self-sufficient SSDCI circuit capable of peak detection for the synchronized switching using analog components. Using circuit simulation software, the performance of this proposed self-sufficient circuit is compared to an ideal case, and the effectiveness of the self-sufficient circuit strategy is discussed based on these simulation results. Further investigation of a physical working model of the new circuit proposal will be developed and experimental results of the circuit€™s performance obtained and compared to the estimated performance from the model. © 2015 SPIE.","Energy Harvesting; Peak Detection; Piezoelectric; SSDCI; Synchronized switching","Aeroelasticity; Computer software; Electric network topology; Energy harvesting; Harvesters; Intelligent materials; Molecular physics; Nondestructive examination; Piezoelectric transducers; Piezoelectricity; Potential energy; Switching; Synchronization; Topology; Transducers; Aeroelastic structures; Civil infrastructures; Peak detection; Piezoelectric; Piezoelectric energy harvesting; Piezoelectric harvester; SSDCI; Synchronized switching; Circuit simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943387066

Carbon-based materials are commonly used as electrode materials for SC. Herein we report a new approach to improve the SC performance utilizing porous carbon /Cerium oxide nanoparticle (PC-CON) hybrid as electrode material synthesized via low temperature hydrothermal method and tetraethyl ammonium tetrafluroborate in acetonitrile as organic electrolyte. Through this approach, charges can be stored not only via electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) from PC but also through pseudo-capacitive effect from CeO2 NPs. The excellent electrode-electrolyte interaction due to the electrochemical properties of the ionic electrolyte provides a better voltage window for the SC.

The chief sources include wind, sun, waves, geothermal energy (energy available from beneath the earth’s surface), tidal power, as well as energy derived from plant and agricultural sources (biomass, biogas and biofuels). Furthermore, it is possible to extract landfill gases from waste disposal facilities. All these sources are at different levels of research, development and commercialisation. Solar energy can be derived from photovoltaic cells (e.g. on rooftops) or from concentrating solar collectors (towers collecting sun rays deflected off a series of mirrors or heliostats, some using molten salt for power storage). This chapter will try and investigate the reasons for this slow uptake in renewable energy. It starts with an analysis of the country’s energy profile in order to inform the reader of current energy and electricity use (Sect. 2). Some time is then spent understanding the nature of South Africa’s current electricity crisis, and the pressures on government and the utility to deliver much more supply (Sect. 3). Existing policy on renewable energy will next be examined (Sect. 4), followed by a brief discussion on climate policy and an attempt at integrated energy planning (Sect. 4). From all the foregoing, the conclusion sets out to return to our initial question and provide a more consolidated understanding of why the country’s commitment to renewable energy remains limited. © Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943338922

Recently, interest in using large battery packs in the oil and gas industry has significantly increased. In particular, there has been an interest in developing subsea power systems, using, rechargeable batteries, for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and measurement while drilling (MWD) applications. Operating a battery with high energy density in a subsea application has several challenges-one of which is how to safely manage potential thermal failures in a harsh high pressure, high temperature environment. In this work, we outline a testing methodology for quantifying thermal hazards and overpressures associated with battery thermal failures. This work provides a framework for analyzing and quantifying thermal failure hazards for battery packs and modules that may be used in subsea power applications. Detailed characterization of the thermal failure and quantifying metrics such as maximum overpressure, rate of pressure rise, and amount of gas generated are necessary to design and implement safety features in subsea power systems to operate these batteries safely and efficiently. Properly addressing these hazards can help reduce the loss of productivity of subsea machinery and instruments, and prevent the development of life threatening conditions when large batteries are used.

This carbohydrate not only serves as the major caloric source for much of the world’s population and as a key feedstock for renewable energy but is also utilized in many food and industrial applications. As the demand for starch as a source of food and energy feedstock will continue to increase in the coming years, increased production of starchy cereals and tuber crops will be needed, a goal that will be moderated by the loss of arable land and unpredictable environmental conditions due to global warming. In this chapter, we provide an update on starch biosynthesis occurring in photoautotrophic and heterotrophic organs, the role of ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase and other enzymes in this process, and the various molecular strategies for increasing starch in cereals. Although extensive efforts have been made, relatively small improvements have been accomplished in enhancing starch content and grain yield, necessitating the employment of new strategies to meet this goal. © Springer Japan 2015.","AGPase; Biotechnological approaches; Crop yields; Starch",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943279751

It is obvious therefore that the transition to sustainable energy systems has to start there. So far, cities are supplied by energy from outside. Any kind of power plants and refineries are situated far from the largest consumer. This system is expensive and volatile. If one discusses the possibilities of energy transition in urban areas, the reduction of the energy demand has to be considered at first. It is not mainly technologies that have to be developed, but also systems. These systems require that distances have to be short, in order to minimize the energy needed for transportation. More than this, houses have to be energy effective (minimum of heating and cooling is required). As a second step, renewable energies have to be harvested onsite. Solar systems on roofs and facades go hand in hand with integrated small-scale wind turbines.

Overall, carbohydrate metabolism in birds is very similar to that in mammals. Small intestine is the major site for the digestion of starch and the absorption of glucose and other monsaccharides. Glucose can be used for energy via glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose pathway. Some tissues that are incapable of using fatty acids use only glucose. Glucose can be stored as the polysaccharide glycogen in the liver, muscles, and other tissues or used as a substrate to produce fatty acids (lipogenesis), which in turn are stored as triglycerides in adipose tissue. Glucose can be synthesized from lactate, amino acids, and other gluconeogenic precursors in the liver and the kidneys. The differences between avian and mammalian carbohydrate metabolism include very high circulating concentrations of glucose in birds, absence of one of the glucose transporters, and major nutrients available to the developing embryo being fats and proteins, together with the liver being the site of lipogenesis. Circulating concentrations of glucose exhibit marked differences across avian species during development and with external environment. Moreover, they are under tight control.

However, emissions from fuel combustion of diesel engine always leave by-products of oxides of nitrogen, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the exhaust gas. Therefore, environmentalists call for cleaner technology to be used in place of conventional diesel engine. The alternative option of diesel-electric engine is an applicable modern technology that generates lower air emissions. The diesel-electric engine for marine vessel offers significantly higher energy efficiency and lower air emissions, compared to the traditional diesel engine. Marine diesel-electric engine is a hybrid engine that uses diesel fuel to generate mechanical torque and transform to electrical power for driving motor and propels the ship. The developed electrical systems, where the diesel engine can be operated on a variable speed giving a huge potential in fuel saving. The Gensets operate in variable speed mode, where the rpm can be adjusted for minimum fuel oil consumption according to the system load. It also allows the integration of energy storage sources like batteries. The energy storage sources reduce the transient loads on the diesel engines. A petroleum company has therefore launched a green logistics program and adopt diesel-electric engine into the marine logistic process to be an initiative of the environmental friendly offshore operation. The Anchor Handling Tug Supply (AHTS) operate in the Gulf of Thailand for supporting offshore petroleum production. Since 2012, more than 50% of AHTS operated by diesel engines have been replaced by diesel-electric engines. By implementation of the green logistics program, in 2013 our marine fleet can decreased up to 7,100 m3 of Marine Gas Oil (MGO) consumption, whilst also reduces totally 22,000 tons of CO2e emission. Divided from overall picture, the replacement power driven of AHTS by diesel-electric engines contributed to the fuel saving at 4,000 m3 of MGO or 56 % of total MGO reduction. In economical perspective, a company has an opportunity to cut off fuel expense for 206 MMTHB or 6.9 MMUSD per annual. This could reflect a company determination to stay at forefront of the industry as the leading petroleum exploration and production company driven by green practices throughout our operation and supply chains.

Most of the fat in chickens is located in adipose depots, which are all late maturing. At the cellular level, preadipocyte differentiation and proliferation are under the control of multiple hormones and transcription factors. The growth of fat tissue is initially due to hyperplasia followed by hypertrophy of the mature adipocytes. The amount of fat deposited is controlled by numerous hormones and depends on genetic and nutritional factors.Dietary fat is transported as portomicrons to the liver, which is also the primary site of the de novo lipogenesis. The newly formed very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) are distributed by the blood to the rest of the body. Lipoprotein lipase is a key enzyme in the further processing of these lipoproteins at the level of various tissues, in particular the lipoprotein metabolism in laying hens. All egg yolk lipids are synthesized mainly by the liver and transported to the ovary in special yolk-targeted VLDL (VLDLy) with an unusual apoprotein (apo) composition (only apoB and apoVLDLII).Recent research has, however, revealed that adipose tissue must now be regarded as a dynamic tissue, which secretes a considerable number of adipokines and hence plays a role in a multitude of bodily processes. © 2015, 2000 Elsevier Inc.

This use of carbohydrates during physical activity likely played an important role during the survival of early Homo sapiens, and genes and traits regulating physical activity, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy storage have undoubtedly been selected throughout evolution. In contrast to the life of early H. sapiens, modern lifestyles are predominantly sedentary. As a result, intake of excessive amounts of carbohydrates due to the easy and continuous accessibility to modern high-energy food and drinks has not only become unnecessary but also led to metabolic diseases in the face of physical inactivity. A resulting metabolic disease is type 2 diabetes, a complex endocrine disorder characterized by abnormally high concentrations of circulating glucose. This disease now affects millions of people worldwide. Exercise has beneficial effects to help control impaired glucose homeostasis with metabolic disease, and is a well-established tool to prevent and combat type 2 diabetes. This chapter focuses on the effects of exercise on carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle and systemic glucose homeostasis. We will also focus on the molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of exercise to increase glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. It is now well established that there are different proximal signaling pathways that mediate the effects of exercise and insulin on glucose uptake, and these distinct mechanisms are consistent with the ability of exercise to increase glucose uptake in the face of insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes.

Analysis is performed on a risk-conscious basis to piping systems based upon failure consequence and uncertainty, contrasting the typical approach of reporting location-specific, time-averaged rates. This investigation leverages actual plant-wide piping inspection data, leak history, repair history, and corrosion monitoring results together to inform integrity decisions based on experience at a reliablyoperating, nuclear power plant. Results can be used to bracket future risks and drive more complete corrosion prediction, evaluation, and mitigation projects while minimizing total operating costs.

SWP cycle has a potential to generate electricity with efficiencies greater than 40% for solar heat collection temperatures above 1250. K. Higher solar heat collection temperatures enable the integration of SWP cycle with ST hydrogen production techniques to coproduce hydrogen and oxygen. When solar energy is unavailable, we propose a turbine based hydrogen water power cycle. For a 100. MW continuous power supply plant, the overall efficiency of the proposed integrated process is estimated to be greater than 34% in spite of the assumed 20% solar energy loss in the solar collector system.

A targeting method has been developed for maximising the amount of integrated thermal energy collected by the required size of solar collector surface area, as well as the size of heat storage. The size of the solar collector area and the heat storage is based on the number of consecutive sunny days and shady days. In the first step the data of the heat demands were collected that could be potentially satisfied from solar sources. In the second step the amount of heat per surface area unit was determined as gained during sunny days (area-specific heat). The collector system and geographical characteristics were taken into account when determining the amount of heat gained. The temperature driving forces were taken into account for heat exchanges between the solar collector medium and storage, and also between the storage and process demands. The required collector surface area has been defined as the heat demands for the sunny and shady days together divided by the product of the area-specific heat of a given collector and the number of sunny days at a given geographical location. The proposed targeting method can be applied for the pre-screening of alternatives in order to eliminate economically non-viable solutions before performing more detailed system synthesis. An illustrative case study has been performed in order to evaluate the applicability of the developed method. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Heat integration; Preliminary analysis; Solar panel; Solar panel area; Solar thermal energy; Storage capacity",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940526046

The identification of the PMS that best exploits the weather variability is crucial for their efficient operation. In this work, this is approached within a framework which exploits the Power Grand Composite Curves (PGCC) method to perform two functions: a) the identification of renewable energy recovery targets within a short term prediction horizon, and b) the temporal reallocation of the grid subsystems within a control horizon based on the PMS that best matches the identified targets. The PGCC is exploited within a model predictive control framework that enables the satisfaction of the system operating goals by ensuring the maintenance of a targeted minimum energy inventory. The desired energy inventory is guaranteed by selecting the appropriate PMS during the control interval that best matches the identified target.

In addition, the development of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies is equally important for transition to low carbon economy. This paper evaluates various integration aspects of energy vectors poly-generation (focussing on power, hydrogen and synthetic fuels) based on chemical looping systems using syngas produced from solid fuel gasification. As illustrative examples, iron-based and calcium-based chemical looping systems were assessed in conjunction with coal gasification plants. The paper presents in details the evaluated plant configurations, focussing especially on operational and mass & energy integration issues. The plant designs were modelled and simulated using process flow modelling software, the results being used to assess the overall performance indicators. For energy integration analysis, pinch method was used to evaluate in details and to find the best energy integration options of available heat generated in the chemical looping unit into overall steam cycle of the power block. Other mass and energy integration aspects, e.g. air flow mass integration between the air separation unit and the gas turbine, plant flexibility in terms of changing generated energy vectors vs. time, were evaluated as well to assess their influence on overall plant energy efficiency. As the results show, the chemical looping-based conversion systems exhibit both higher energy efficiency and carbon capture rate than current state of the art gasification plants with gas-liquid absorption for carbon capture (benchmark case). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon capture; Chemical looping; Energy integration; Energy vectors poly-generation; Utilisation and storage (CCUS)",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940511732

If well planned, these distributed structures are anticipated to increase the efficiency, flexibility and security of energy systems. Many mathematical models have been formulated for aiding the design process and analysis of distributed energy systems such as district heating systems. A search for optimal structures and multi-period operational schemes of district heating networks consisting of supplier, consumer and storage nodes connected via pipelines can be formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and solved using standard algorithms, but as the problem sizes increase, the solution times become too long for practical use. For this reason, a procedure for decomposing such an optimization problem in order to reduce the required computational time is proposed. The procedure is based on dividing the geographical area of the energy system into separate sectors which are treated as nodes in a simplified network. During consecutive iterations, the number of sectors, along with the detail level of the simplified network, is increased. Each iteration reduces the search space of the original problem, thus reducing the time needed for the solution. While reaching global optima cannot be guaranteed, examples are given where the procedure finds better solutions than standard algorithms could find within any reasonable, or even relatively unreasonable, time limits. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Distributed energy systems; District heating; Optimization",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940468388

They were tested as adsorbents of hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde from a gas/vapor phase and as a separation media for salicylic acid, phenols, and dyes from water phase. Testing the application as supercapacitors showed their excellent capacitance, high energy density, and surface stability in charge/discharge processes. The performance of carbons either as adsorbents or as supercapacitors has been shown to be comparable or better than that of commercial activated carbons.

Sol-gel-derived mesoporous silica materials are good candidates for such coatings, owing to their biocompatibility, facile solution-based synthesis conditions, and thin film formation. Diffusion and transport across the coating correlates to long-range microstructural properties, including pore size distribution. porosity, and pore morphology. Here, we investigated collagen-fibril matrices with known biocompatibility to serve as templating systems for directed silica deposition. Type 1 collagen oligomers derived from porcine skin are extensively characterized such that we can predict and customize the final collagen-fibril matrix with respect to fibril density, interfibril branching and viscoelasticity. We show that these matrices template and direct the deposition of mesoporous silica at the level of individual collagen fibrils. We varied the fibril density, silicic acid concentration, and time of exposure to silicifying solution and characterized the resulting hybrid materials by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and rheology. Microstructural properties of the collagen-fibril template are preserved in the silica surface of hybrid materials. Results for three different collagen fibril densities, corresponding to shear storage moduli of 200 Pa, 1000 Pa, and 1600 Pa, indicate that increased fibril density increases the absolute amount of templated silica when all other silica synthesis conditions are kept constant. Additionally, mechanical properties of the hybrid material are dominated by the presence of the silica coating rather than the starting collagen matrix stiffness. © 2015 Materials Research Society.",,"Biocompatibility; Biological materials; Biomechanics; Coatings; Collagen; Deposition; Diffusion coatings; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Interfaces (materials); Mesoporous materials; Molecular biology; Pore size; Scanning electron microscopy; Silica; Sol-gels; Stiffness; Stiffness matrix; X ray spectroscopy; Diffusion and transport; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Mesoporous silica materials; Micro-structural properties; Shear storage modulus; Synthesis conditions; Templating systems; Thin film formation; Hybrid materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938087490

On the basis of worked out functional analysis of freezing, it is possible to optimize regulation possibilities of heat processes for a particular kind of berries and fruits. Fresh raspberries, red currants and black currants grown in Latvia were used in the research. 10.0 cm thick bulk frozen berry layer was chosen for studying the freezing and storage process. The freezing dynamics of berries is characterised by temperature measurements in a layer and on its surface. As a result of the research the developed equipment for the measurements of the heat flow was approbated. Theoretical calculation of the heat flow process is described. It is necessary to investigate suitability of different cultivars for freezing and influence of freezing to the quality of final product. Experimentally verified results will help explain and predict physical processes in berries during the freezing and storage process. The research shows that the influence of the temperature has to be differentiated - if one can ignore the influence of the temperature on the specific heat and heat conductivity of fresh fruit, then regarding the enthalpy of frozen products, the temperature is one of the main factors. Specific cultivars were chosen with already stated chemical content. By processing the experimental data the following thermo-physical parameters of frozen berries are obtained which further help theoretically more precisely mathematically simulate both the process of storage and thawing of frozen berries. The said researches provide additional information on the process kinetics of frozen food products, mass transfer in them, as a result of what it enables more precise projecting of their quality change.","Berries; Freezing; Heat flow; Storage","Data handling; Digital storage; Energy storage; Food products; Freezing; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Regional planning; Specific heat; Temperature measurement; Berries; Chemical content; Heat flow process; Heat transfer process; Physical process; Process kinetics; Theoretical calculations; Thermo-physical parameters; Fruits; freezing; fruit; heat flow; heat transfer; optimization; reaction kinetics; theoretical study; thermodynamics; Latvia; Calluna vulgaris; Ribes hudsonianum; Ribes rubrum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937430955

The collective buys energy as a group through a central coordinator who also decides about the storage and usage of renewable energy produced by the collective. Our objective is to design coordination algorithms to minimize the cost of electricity consumption of the consumer collective while allowing the consumers to make their own consumption decisions based on their private consumption constraints and preferences. Minimizing the cost is not only of interest to the consumers but is also socially desirable because it reduces the consumption at times of peak demand. We develop an iterative coordination algorithm in which the coordinator makes the storage decision and shapes the demands of the consumers by designing a virtual price signal for the agents. We prove that our algorithm converges, and it achieves the optimal solution under realistic conditions. We also present simulation results based on real world consumption data to quantify the performance of our algorithm. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Algorithms; Costs; Digital storage; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Fuel storage; Iterative methods; Renewable energy resources; Coordination algorithms; Cost of electricity; Design coordination; Energy generations; Integration of renewable energies; Realistic conditions; Renewable energy generation; Storage facilities; Storage management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937415824

Brewers' spent grain (BSG) is the major by-product of the brewing industry, representing around 85 % of the total by-products generated. BSG have food characteristics and are available in large quantities throughout the year. While BSG contain significant energy resources from their organic contents, they have some major problems such as high moisture and nutrient content, handling difficulties. Drying has been the most effective method of preserving BSG and to prolong the storage time. Drying also reduces the product volume, and decreases transport and storage costs. In this paper we compared two drying methods: drying by free convection and drying by forced convection (ventilation). The results show that the BSG drying with free convection permitted only a thin layer with a periodical or continuous regular mixing. Ventilation is more efficient BSG drying method and can be applied in a thicker layer with lower temperatures. It is an effective way for BSG drying in small beer brewing companies, particularly if previously free water separated.","Drying; Free convection; Spent grain; Ventilation","Brewing; Byproducts; Energy resources; Fermentation; Natural convection; Regional planning; Ventilation; Waste treatment; Brewer's spent grain; Drying methods; High moisture; Lower temperatures; Nutrient contents; Organic content; Organic solid wastes; Spent grains; Drying; brewing industry; convection; cost analysis; dry matter; energy efficiency; low temperature; moisture; nutrient cycling; research work; solid waste; ventilation; waste treatment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937391732

These factors must be taken into ac-count in the management of the air quality. Thus, a development of an air quali-ty decision support system able to manage these factors and to answer the ques-tions of environmental managers in real-time is imperative. Such system re-quires an advanced modeling and information analyzing and processing tech-niques that should take into account some aspects, such as the integration of a large amount of data, the behavior of the system environment, the available data sources and the emerging paradigm related to the intelligent systems. To this end, we propose an approach based on the use of the agent technology and big data concept. For the air quality data collection and analysis, we use a Hadoop framework: HBase for data storage and a MapReduce based forecasting process; artificial neural network (ANN) based prediction and K-means as clus-tering algorithm. Finally, the approach is validated by a case study in which an air quality management support system for the Marrakech city is presented.

In order to increase the endurance of these mobile robotic platforms, actuation efficiency must be addressed. Since pneumatic systems are rarely more than 30% efficient due to the compressibility of the working fluid, the McKibben muscles are hydraulically powered. Additionally, these McKibben artificial muscles utilize an inelastic bladder to reduce the energy losses associated with elastic energy storage in the usual rubber tube bladders. The largest energy losses in traditional valve-controlled hydraulic systems are found in the valving implementation to match the required loads. This is performed by throttling, which results in large pressure drops over the control valves and significant fluid power being wasted as heat. This paper discusses how these throttling losses are reduced by grouping multiple artificial muscles to form a muscle bundle where, like in skeletal muscle, more elements that make up the muscle bundle are recruited to match the load. This greatly lessens the pressure drops by effectively changing the actuator area, leading to much higher efficiencies over a broader operation envelope. Simulations of several different loading scenarios are discussed that reveal the benefits of such an actuation scheme. © 2015 SPIE.","Efficiency; Energetics; Fluid power; Hydraulic control systems; McKibben muscle; Variable recruitment","Biomimetics; Drops; Efficiency; Energy conservation; Energy dissipation; Hydraulic equipment; Hydraulic machinery; Pressure drop; Robotics; Energetics; Fluid power; Hydraulic control systems; McKibben muscle; Variable recruitment; Muscle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937134572

Future machines will include electromechanical systems that are soft and elastically deformable, lending them to applications such as soft robotics, wearable/implantable devices, sensory skins, and energy storage and transport systems. One key step toward the realization of soft systems is the development of stretchable electronics that remain functional even when subject to high strains. Liquid-metal traces embedded in elastic polymers present a unique opportunity to retain the function of rigid metal conductors while leveraging the deformable properties of liquid-elastomer composites.

One of these challenges is the increased risk for grid congestion issues due to the installation of large amounts of e.g. solar panels and wind turbines to the existing grid.

A key advantage of this configuration is that multiple majority gates can be concatenated together entirely in the magnetic domain without conversion to electric signals. The magnetic majority gates can in turn be concatenated together to form more complex circuits, such as a full magnetic adder circuit described here and simulated with a micromagnetic solver. The dynamics of magnetic polarization propagate through the adder circuit via the motion of magnetic domain walls and correspond exactly to the propagation of information through a ripple adder circuit. The switching speed and energy of the fundamental magnetic switching operation in the magnetic adder is comparable to the same fundamental switching operation in single magnetic gates or nanomagnetic memories. It provides a basis for estimating the operational speed and energy of the more complex magnetic circuits. A non-linear transfer characteristic ensures noise margin and signal restoration after every operation critical for Boolean logic. The most common applications of spintronic devices in production today are non-volatile memories, namely magnetic random access memory (MRAM), which employ field induced switching of magnetic polarization. More recently, however, a much more efficient magnetic switching mechanism, based on current-induced switching, has been introduced and used to fabricate spin transfer torque RAM (STTRAM) memories [1]. It is natural to consider extending the physics of STTRAM to other magnetic logic functions [2], including the spin torque majority gate (STMG) described here. One obvious benefit of magnetic logic circuits is they are non-volatile, and hence do not suffer from standby power dissipation. A related benefit is that they can be turned on instantly since the circuit is non-volatile in the absence of input signals. In spite of these obvious advantages and the fact that numerous spintronic logic devices have been proposed, few of them have been fabricated and none have been demonstrated to function in an integrated circuit. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,"Adders; Domain walls; Logic circuits; Logic devices; Magnetic circuits; Magnetic domains; Magnetic storage; Magnetism; Magnetoelectronics; Majority logic; MRAM devices; Nanomagnetics; Polarization; Random access storage; Reconfigurable hardware; Switching; Tunnel junctions; Fundamental switching; Magnetic polarizations; Magnetic random access memory; Magnetic tunnel junction; Reconfigurable logic; Spin transfer torque; Spintronic logic devices; Standby-power dissipation; Computer circuits",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84935445277

Therefore, a physically-based regional modeling approach of climate change related snow storage variations for these region is desirable. However, snow models in the field of hydrologic engineering have barely incorporated the long-term effects of inter-annual snow storage variations because the time scale of glacier dynamics is much longer than that of river flow and seasonal snowmelt. This study treats inland glaciers as systems in dynamic equilibrium that stay constant under a static climate condition. The snow/ice vertical movement from high to low elevation areas is considered as an equilibrator of the glacier system as it promotes snow/ice ablation. The challenges of regional energy balance modeling of such a dynamic equilibrium snow system will be discussed in this presentation. The developed model has been coupled with a mesoscale numerical weather model (WRF) to compute the snow surface energy balance. © 2015 ASCE.",,"Climate change; Drought; Ecology; Ecosystems; Energy balance; Floods; Snow; Climate condition; Dynamic equilibria; Energy balance equations; Energy balance models; Glacier dynamics; Long-term effects; Numerical weather model; Vertical movement; Water resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84935095623

In order to produce cost-effective piezoelectric nanofibers, the electrospinning process is a good candidate as various materials and nanoparticles have been successfully fabricated as nanofibers and/or nanofibers with embedded nanoparticles. The conventional electrospinning process has been modified for good alignment and position controllability as well as the feasibility to embed nanoparticles. The nanofibers obtained, such as PVDF and PZT for good piezoelectricity, are highly flexible and easy to fabricate for possible integration in implantable and/or flexible devices, as well as textile applications such as electric clothing. This provides tremendous opportunities in various fields for fiber-based nanogenerators. Several groups have demonstrated prototypes of nanofiber nanogenerators as reviewed in this work. Beyond the current feasibility studies mainly from academic institutes, further development of fiber based nanogenerators will be necessary for practical applications. Here, several future prospects/directions are discussed. High power nanogenerators: most of the current nanogenerators (including nanofiber nanogenerators) are limited to low power generation in laboratory environments. Some recent studies have advanced the records to higher power outputs73 as well as using real mechanical actuation sources such as the human heartbeat87 and mice96 to drive active devices such as LEDs.21 Nevertheless, the electrical power generated by current nanogenerators made of nanostructures is often too small to have practical usage for commercial hand-held systems such as an electrical watch, which typically consumes electrical power in the range of a few mW. Therefore, if and when the power generated by the current single nanofiber nanogenerator in the recorded range of 10-11 Watt can be boosted up to the range of 10-6 Watt, probably by multiple-nanofibers, many practical applications could attract strong commercial interest in nanofiber nanogenerators. Energy storage/regulation systems: similar to all electrical power generation devices, suitable energy storage/regulation systems will be required for nanofiber nanogenerators to store the generated energy and to release it at the right time. For example, repetitive deformation of a piezoelectric nanostructure is essential to generate energy and the generated energy could be accumulated in an energy storage system such as a rechargeable battery or supercapacitor for later release. For example, a ZnO-nanowire nanogenerator has been connected to a capacitor and macro scale electrical circuitry for a system demonstration with discrete wires.75 An integrated system that combines an integrated nanowire nanogenerator, integrated circuitry and an integrated battery/supercapacitor on a single chip could be an important technology challenge for future developments. Fundamentals on piezoelectricity: as stated and discussed in the earlier section, the fundamentals of the piezoelectricity of nanofibers have to be investigated systematically in all aspects to produce nanofibers with high piezoelectricity. Specifically, there is still no persuasive evidence to clarify the mechanism of the α → β phase transformation during the electrospinning process and published literature often provides conflicting information. Some groups have attributed this transformation to the whole stretching process of the jet due to the comparatively high fraction of bphase observed in smaller-diameter fibers from lower-concentration solutions, 43,49 while other groups relate the cause of β-phase formation to the solvent evaporation rate97 or the ion current,98 rather than the jet elongation experienced during the electrospinning process, because of a predominant β-phase obtained in films consisting of small (charged) droplets. In addition, some other works remain problematic with regard to identifying the formation of crystalline phases during the electrospinning process, especially the β- and γ-phases. Hence, further systematic studies and characterizations for the electrospun fibers are required. These include optimizations in process parameters such as materials, solvents, concentrations, electrical bias, needle-to-electrode distance as well as electrospinning methodologies. Furthermore, detailed analyses on the electrospun nanofibers have to be fully characterized with tools such as XRD, FTIR, PFM and SHG and Raman spectroscopy. As such, nanofiber nanogenerators with high energy conversion efficiency could be consistently built in the future. Wearable electronics: energy harvesters powered by human motion could be interesting and important as devices for wearable electronics, such as smart watches and displays. Directly charging and powering the wearable electronics via human motion could be advantageous over battery-powered systems, given that the form-factor and weight of wearable electronics are limited. As such, piezoelectric fiber-based nanogenerators could provide a potential breakthrough with the possibility of being integrated with fabrics for these applications. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934765352

GAO’s assessments have focused on, among other things, the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Material Protection, Control and Accounting program in Russia and the Global Threat Reduction Initiative that has been implemented in more than 100 countries. More recently, GAO has assessed federal agencies’ efforts and strategies to implement the President’s initiative to secure all vulnerable material worldwide within a 4-year period. A significant and growing part of GAO’s portfolio, particularly after September 11, focuses on radiological material security, including federal preparedness for and response to a terrorist attack involving either a radiological dispersal device or improvised nuclear device attack in the United State s. An independent, nonpartisan agency, GAO’s mission is to support the Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and ensure the accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the American people. GAO provides the Congress with timely information that is objective, fact-based, nonpartisan, nonideological, fair, and balanced. Within GAO, the U.S. and International Nuclear Security and Cleanup mission group covers a wide range of nuclear issues that include nuclear nonproliferation; nuclear and radiological smuggling and terrorism; and special nuclear material production, consolidation, and storage.

In this study we investigated the feasibility of a noninvasive photoacoustic (PA) approach for characterizing biological tissues. The measurement was performed in the transmission mode with a wideband hydrophone while a tunable Q-switched Nd:YAG pulsed laser was used for illumination. The power spectrum of photoacoustic signal induced by a pulsed laser light from tissue was analyzed and features were extracted to study their correlation with tissue biomechanical properties. For a controlled study, tissue mimicking gelatin phantoms with different densities and equivalent optical absorptions were used as targets. The correlation between gelatin concentration of such phantoms and their mechanical properties were validated independently with a dynamic mechanical analyzer capable of calculating complex loss and storage moduli between two compression plates. It was shown that PA spectrums were shifted towards higher frequencies by increasing gelatin concentration. In order to quantify this effect, signal energy in two intervals of low and high frequency ranges were calculated. Gelatin concentration was correlated with PA energy in high frequency range with R2=0.94. Subsequently, PA signals generated from freshly resected human thyroid specimens were measured and analyzed in a similar fashion. We found that in aggregate, malignant thyroid tissue contains approximately 1.6 times lower energy in the high frequency range in comparison to normal thyroid tissue (p<0.01). This ratio increased with increasing illumination wavelength from 700 nm to 900nm. In summary, this study demonstrated the feasibility of using photoacoustic technique for characterizing tissue on the basis of viscoelastic properties of the tissue. © 2015 SPIE.","Biomechanical features; Photoacoustic; Power spectrum analysis; Tissue characterization","Biomechanics; Characterization; Diagnosis; Mechanical properties; Neodymium lasers; Photons; Power spectrum; Pulsed lasers; Spectrum analysis; Tissue; Ultrasonic applications; Viscoelasticity; Biomechanical features; Biomechanical properties; Characterizing biological tissues; Dynamic mechanical analyzer; Photoacoustic; Photoacoustic techniques; Tissue characterization; Tissue-mimicking gelatin phantoms; Tissue engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928579346

Despite the clear potential for nanofibres to be used in each of these industries, the uptake in terms of the number of commercialised products that use electrospun nanofibre remains very limited, with air filtration being the only sector in which they are used extensively. In this chapter, the current state of the electrospinning industry is discussed, including recent advances in commercial-scale electrospinning and other competing technologies. The challenges that are faced by commercial electrospinning companies are highlighted, helping to explain the limited commercialisation and uptake of electrospinning by industry.

Memory energy is a dominating factor in the overall system energy dissipation. In particular, when performing nonsequential memory access patterns, significant amount of energy is dissipated due to frequent memory row activations. In this paper, we consider the classic stride memory access pattern and evaluate the energy consumption in DRAM. Lower bounds on DRAM energy consumption are derived for this widely used memory access pattern which introduces rowwise writing and column-wise reading memory operations. To achieve the lower bounds of the DRAM energy consumption, we remap data onto DRAM for both row-wise and column-wise memory operations. This significantly reduces the latency brought by frequent DRAM row activations due to column-wise memory operations. We validate experimentally our analysis using 2-D FFT as a benchmark application on FPGA-based system. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed optimizations result in 74.8%∼77.7% reduction in energy consumption of the overall system compared with the baseline for 1024× 1024, 4096× 4096, and 8192× 8192 points 2-D FFTs, respectively. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Activation energy; Benchmarking; Chemical activation; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Reconfigurable architectures; Benchmark applications; Data-intensive application; Dominating factors; Energy optimization; Memory access patterns; Memory operations; Network processing; Stride memory access; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926684159

Instead, a storage orchestrator running as a cloud service distributes erasure-coded file chunks across all available devices to maximize performance and capacity and minimize energy usage at battery-powered clients while meeting configurable backup requirements. Unlike current cloud storage options, PocketLocker is free and will scale as users add devices. We motivate PocketLocker's design by analyzing two months of file access traces taken from 100 smartphones, and evaluate its performance using trace-based simulations to explore design parameters and measurements of a prototype Android implementation to establish real-world performance. By locating content close to where it will be accessed by mobile devices, PocketLocker provides low-latency access to large amounts of content. By exploiting mobility and charging habits, PocketLocker can meet backup requirements without draining the smartphone's battery. © 2014 The Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics, and Telecommunications Engineering (ICST).",,"Electric batteries; Interactive devices; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Smartphones; Battery powered; Design parameters; Limited storage; Measurements of; Personal clouds; Personal devices; Real-world performance; Trace-based simulation; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924365416

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), built around a superconducting magnet is widely used world over for diagnostic purposes like imaging soft tissues of human body. MRI is based on the principle of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). High resolution NMR spectrometers used for studying structure of most complex molecules require high magnetic field, high homogeneity and high temporal stability. Superconducting magnets are run in persistent mode with power supply disconnected and produce field with unprecedented stability. Compensating and shim coils provide high homogeneity. 1 GHz (23.5 T) NMR spectrometers are commercially available with Nb–Ti/Nb3Sn magnets operating at 1.5–1.8 K. Another potential application, though not very popular, is Superconducting High Gradient Magnetic Separator (SHGMS) used to reduce magnetic impurities to ppm level in a variety of minerals. Superconducting Magnet Energy Storage (SMES) is an ideal device to store large amount of energy and releasing it to the grid for load leveling and to balance short duration transient faults. It is used as an attractive pulse power source in strategic applications. Superconducting magnet in persistence mode stores an energy equal to ½LI2. Large SMES with stored energy in TJ range for power network system and medium energy 400 MW (70 GJ) SMES for FEL guided weapons were designed but not built. Micro 5 and 10 MVA SMES have been built and put in use in Japan. All the SMES are designed and built with Nb–Ti superconductors. Attention is now focused on the design of magnets for all the applications based upon 2G REBCO coated conductor which promises high critical current at elevated temperature, 30–50 K. All these HTS devices will be conduction cooled using cryocoolers and will become commercially competitive. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924076345

What the mathematical modeling of time-dependent system behavior offers is a venue in which students can be taught that physical analogies exist between what they likely perceive as distinct areas of study in the physical sciences. We introduce a storyline whose characters are superheroes that store and dissipate energy in dynamic systems. Introducing students to the overarching conservation laws helps develop the analogy that ties the different disciplines together under a common umbrella of system energy. In this book, we use the superhero cast to present the effort-flow analogy and its relationship to the conservation principles of mass, momentum, energy, and electrical charge. We use a superhero movie script common to mechanical, electrical, fluid, and thermal engineering systems to illustrate how to apply the analogy to arrive at governing differential equations describing the systems' behavior in time. Ultimately, we show how only two types of differential equation, and therefore, two types of system response are possible. This novel approach of storytelling and a movie script is used to help make the mathematics of lumped system modeling more approachable for students.

In addition, the high internal temperature of H3+ revealed by experiments at the Max Planck Institute of Nuclear Physics suggests a possibility that the current value of the DR rate constant may still be off by a significant factor.

This contribution discusses several proposed models, collisional radiative, collisional dissociative recombination, resonant electron capture, and angular momentum l-mixing. It appears that none of them provides a satisfactory explanation. There is one observation that points to a possibly efficient route to long-lived collision complexes that may play a role: Several of the so far unassigned peaks in storage ring data occur at energies where rotational resonances have long lifetimes.

One key issue processors face is the problem of erosive wear of conveying tubing, bends, and other equipment subjected to abrasive materials. Another common problem is attrition, or degradation of sensitive raw materials. To reduce velocity, we might be tempted to choose a conveying tube size larger than needed to reduce vacuum. Fewer vacuums will stretch the air less, and air speed will change less from start to finish as a result. Reducing the pump rpm also reduces air speed across the system, with the added benefit of modest energy savings. If the pump package is belt driven, the sheave combination can often be modified to slow the pump to a new target performance point. When overall air speed is reduced, the system vacuum may need to be reduced to ensure enough air speed at the pickup. This can be done at the material source pickup probe by rotating the collar to pull more air through the screen, so less material enters the conveying line.",,"Energy conservation; Pickups; Plastics plants; Pumps; Tubes (components); Tubing; Abrasive materials; Bulk plastics; Erosive wear; Material sources; Performance points; Pneumatic conveying; Processing plants; System maintenance; Speed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922032368

During the period from 2006 to 2013, more than 600,000 CNG cylinder units for vehicles were installed and used for transportation, cars, and trucks in Thailand. The number of cylinder units will be tentatively increased in the future due to the increase in gasoline price. Due to the use of high-pressurization equipment in public, the issue of a risk to public safety has been raised. As of this writing, in 2013, the testing standard from the Thai Department of Energy Business recommends inspection every 5 years using effective inspection methods in order to guarantee safe usage of gas cylinders, including the AE method, following ISO 16148. Normally in Thailand, AE is used in research and petrochemical plants as a special technique. The main applications are testing of pressure vessels, aboveground storage tanks, and university research. Few companies are available to conduct AE for testing natural gas cylinders due to the limited safety of the high-pressure operation and AE equipment and a lack of qualified AE personnel. To develop AE techniques, equipment, procedures, and acceptance criteria of natural gas cylinders are the main focus of AE personnel in Thailand.

The DC-DC converter derives the buss voltages from a standard 13.8 kV to 2300 Y substation cast-core transformer. Energy storage and filtering is provided by self-clearing metallized hazy polypropylene traction capacitors. Three ""H-Bridge"" Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) switching networks are used to generate the polyphase 20 kHz transformer primary drive waveforms. The 20 kHz drive waveforms are chirped the appropriate duration to generate the desired klystron pulse width. PWM (pulse width modulation) of the individual 20 kHz pulses is utilized to provide regulated output waveforms with adaptive feedforward and feedback techniques. The boost transformer design utilizes amorphous nanocrystalline material that provides the required low core loss at design flux levels and switching frequencies. Resonant shunt-peaking is used on the transformer secondary to boost output voltage and resonate transformer leakage inductance. With the appropriate transformer leakage inductance and peaking capacitance, zero-voltage-switching of the IGBT's is attained, minimizing switching losses. A review of these design parameters and the first results of the performance characteristics will be presented. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Bridge circuits; Capacitance; DC transformers; Feedback; Inductance; Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT); Klystrons; Nanocrystalline materials; Nanocrystals; Polypropylenes; Pulse width modulation; Switching frequency; Voltage control; Zero voltage switching; Adaptive feedforward; Boost transformer; Design parameters; Electrical design; Feedback techniques; Leakage inductance; Performance characteristics; Transformer secondaries; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881524341
