A variety of optical and electrochemical measurements have been carried out to determine their suitability to perform as counter electrodes (CE) in electrochromic windows. It has been found that in general, the films containing higher vanadium concentrations have higher charge capacities, which are seen to be easily sufficient to make useful CE layers in electrochromic windows. The electrochromic behaviour of the VzTi1 - zOy films themselves is seen to be quite complicated, and does not fit a first order theory. A simple theoretical model based on electrons being localised preferentially on vanadium atoms is given, which goes some way towards explaining this behaviour. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.","Electrochemistry; Optical properties; Oxides; Sputtering","Composition; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochromism; Electron energy levels; Mathematical models; Optical variables measurement; Sputter deposition; Thermodynamic stability; Vanadium compounds; Charge storage capacity; Counter electrons; Electrochemical measurement; Electrochromic windows; Vanadium titanium oxide; Optical films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031368127

Those tests allowed us to determine, respectively, the friction resistance and the impact resistance. If for pure friction it is not easy to differentiate the Magnesia Partially Stabilized Zirconias (MgPSZ) from the Yttria Tetragonal Zirconia Polycrystal (YTZP), after impact tests, we can conclude that the YTZP have a better wear behaviour than the MgPSZ, especially in the case of attrition applications. These differences can be explained in terms of test severity and also in terms of energy relaxation. In order to evaluate this last contribution we have studied the dielectrical behavior of our materials, i.e., their ability to store and dissipate polarization energy. © 1997 Elsevier Scienbce S.A.","Dielectrical materials; Energy relaxation; Energy storage; Friction; Wear; Zirconia","Dielectric materials; Dielectric relaxation; Friction; Impact resistance; Impact testing; Polarization; Zirconia; Energy relaxation; Friction resistance; Magnesia partially stabilized zirconia; Stabilized zirconia; Yttria tetragonal zirconia polycrystal; Wear resistance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031332571

BOREAS is a multiscale study in which satellite, airborne, stand-scale, and leaf-scale observations were made in relation to the major vegetation types [Sellers et al., 1995]. The eddy covariance system comprised a sonic anemometer mounted 27 m above the forest, a system for transferring air rapidly and coherently to a closed path, infrared gas analyzer and a computer with the Edinburgh EdiSol software. Over the measurement period, closure of the energy balance on a 24 hour basis was good: (H + λE)/(Rn - G - B - S) = 0.97. The midday Bowen ratio was typically in the range 1.0-2.5, with an average value of ∼1.9 in the first Intensive Field Campaign (IFC1) and 1.3-1.4 in IFC2 and IFC3. Daily ecosystem evapotranspiration from moss, understory, and trees followed daily net radiation. Mean half-hourly net ecosystem flux followed photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) closely, reaching -9 μmol m-2 s-1 in June and August. The mean respiratory efflux on nights during which the atmosphere was well mixed (u* &gt; 0.4 m s-1) reached 6 μmol m-2 s-1. The PPFD-saturated biotic CO2 assimilation reached 20 μmol m-2 s-1 and showed little response to air temperature or vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Storage of CO2 in the air column at night did not account adequately for respiration on stable nights, so nighttime efflux was modeled for periods when u* &lt; 0.4 m s-1. There was a net gain of CO2 on most of the 120 days, but on 31 days of high temperature or low PPFD there was a net carbon loss. High PPFD promoted influx of CO2 by the foliage, whereas high temperatures reduced net CO2 influx through high respiration rates by the roots and soil microorganisms, leading to lower net uptake at high PPFD. Over the 120 day period, 95 g m-2 of C were stored (an average of 0.8 g m-2 d-1), and 237 mm of water evaporated (an average of 2 mm d-1).",,"Bryophyta; Picea mariana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5244303933

The observations spanned the growing season (late May to mid-September 1994) and extended the fluxes obtained in two intensive study areas to larger spatial scales to help provide a data set that is useful for comparison with and validation of large-scale models and satellite retrievals. We found the deciduous forests to be more photosynthetically active than nearby coniferous forests. Coniferous forest fluxes across the transect from the BOREAS southern to northern study areas show no apparent spatial trend, though smaller-scale variability is large. The fluxes make a smooth transition from the BOREAS northern study area to the subarctic tundra. Typical midsummer, midday, large-scale net ecosystem exchanges of carbon dioxide were about - 10 μmol m-2 s-1 for primarily deciduous forests, about -6 μmol m-2 s-1 for the primarily coniferous regions between and including the two BOREAS study areas, and about -2 μmol m-2 s-1 for the subarctic tundra. The first two values are similar to those observed by flux towers in the region. Throughout the boreal forest the fluxes are influenced by the presence of lakes. Lake fraction is found to be a dominant source of variability in the fluxes observed along the transect. Lakes are also found to be large sinks of available radiant energy. Regional ground storage of heat is estimated to be about 30% of the net radiation over the forest, and 40% over the subarctic tundra, largely due to the presence of lakes.",,"boreal flux; boreal forest; BOREAS; forest biome; latent heat flux; momentum flux; sensible heat flux; Electra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031463187

The model did a reasonable job of simulating both the seasonal average fluxes and the diurnal cycle of the surface heat fluxes. However, a lag was observed in the simulation of the sensible heat flux, which was attributed to an inadequate representation of the ground heat flux and ground heat storage. It was also noted that direct soil evaporation forms an important part of the latent heat flux simulated by the model.

The experiment was part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), and it ran from May 24 to September 19. The average tree density was 4.4 trees m-2, but there was substantial spatial variation associated with three primary vegetation patterns: dense cover of short trees, sparse cover of tall trees, and a mixture of short and tall trees. The frequency distribution of tree heights was bimodal with peaks at 1 and 2 m and a range from 0.3 to 5.7 m. The average tree height was 2.3 m. The daily average photosynthetically active radiation albedo was conservative, varying from 0.054 under clear-sky conditions to 0.051 under cloudy skies. The shortwave albedo was 0.136 under clear-sky conditions and decreased by 1% following rain; the presence of smoke over the site increased it by 1%. Heat storage in the soil, trees, and air was an important component of the energy balance throughout the season with soil heat flux comprising the bulk of the total storage. On the average, for the whole experimental period, the sensible heat flux was approximately twice the latent heat flux (Bowen ratio ≈ 2). The average daily energy balance closure varied from 85% before day-of-year (DOY) 200 to 95% after DOY 200. As a result of problems with the measurement of the net CO2 flux above the canopy under stable nighttime conditions, all nighttime values were modeled. The typical diurnal pattern of net CO2 flux shows maximum uptake by the surface in the morning and a gradual decrease through the afternoon. For the whole field season of 118 days, the site fixed 224 g m-2 of carbon.",,"boreal forest; BOREAS; carbon exchange; energy balance; energy exchange; forest biome; latent heat flux; pine; sensible heat flux; water vapour transfer; Canada, Manitoba, Thompson; Pinus banksiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031433906

To investigate this hypothesis, we measured fluxes of energy balance components (solar, latent and sensible heat, and soil and canopy heat storage) over and under a boreal jack pine forest in central Canada during the 1994 growing season. Temporal trends of daily-integrated energy fluxes were significant during a 117 day period between spring and autumn. Mean fluxes of net radiation and latent heat peaked near the summer solstice. By the autumnal equinox their magnitudes were half of their peak values. On a day-to-day basis the presence or absence of clouds modulated solar energy fluxes, while evaporation rates were dependent on whether the canopy was dry or wet. When the canopy was dry, daily evaporation was generally less than 2.5 mm d-1. This amount was less than one-half the rate of equilibrium evaporation and was low compared to evaporation from vegetation in temperate zones. When the canopy was wet, daily evaporation approached 3 mm d-1 and exceeded predicted rates of equilibrium evaporation. Evaporation from the dry forest was , weakly coupled to available energy and was restricted by the canopy AEs low-surface conductance. Biotic factors limiting the forest AEs surface conductance include the forest AEs low-leaf area index and partial stomatal closure. Abiotic and physiological factors restricting stomatal opening included a scarce supply of soil moisture, limiting vapor pressure deficits and the low photosynthetic capacity of the needles. The fluxes of solar energy and latent and sensible heat at the floor of the forest were a significant portion of energy exchange between the forest and the atmosphere. Typically, 20 to 40% of the total energy exchange by the jack pine stand originated at the understory. Since a substantial amount of energy occurs under the forest, two-layer, not a big-leaf AE, evaporation models are recommended as a tool for estimating water vapor fluxes from this open forest stand.",,"boreal forest; BOREAS; energy exchange; micrometeorology; pine forest; water vapour flux; Canada, Saskatchewan; Pinus banksiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031433759

The interaction of the particle beam with the gas molecules occurs continuously during storage ring operation. At straight sections of a storage ring, the gas bremsstrahlung contribution from each interaction adds up to produce a narrow monodirectional photon beam that travels down the beamlines. At the Advanced Photon Source (APS), where the stored electron beam energy is 7 GeV, gas bremsstrahlung generated in the straight sections of the insertion device beamlines, which is a total of 15.38 m in effective length, can be significant. This paper presents the results of the bremsstrahlung spectrum and energy measurements from the insertion device beamlines of the APS using a hermetic lead glass calorimeter. The calorimeter consists of 25 lead glass blocks, each 6.3 cm × 6.3 cm × 35 cm, stacked into a 5 × 5 array. Phototubes connected to the lead glass blocks collected the signals. The calorimeter is calibrated using the maximum energy of the observed bremsstrahlung spectrum. The total energy radiated and the bremsstrahlung spectrum were measured as a function of the storage ring beam current for both electrons and positrons of 7 GeV energy. Vacuum in the straight section was continuously monitored, and measurements to determine the nature of the residual gas inside the storage ring were performed. The measured bremsstrahlung spectra are fitted to a function that shows an approximate 1/E behavior. The gas bremsstrahlung rate from the APS undulator beamline straight path of 15.38 m is measured as 60.0 ± 2.0 GeV/s/nT/mA. Significant contribution of bremsstrahlung from sources other than the residual gas molecules is observed. The maximum bremsstrahlung energy measured in a beamline during the experiment is 369.0 ± 22.0 GeV/s/nT/mA.",,"Calorimeters; Electron beams; Functions; Particle beam dynamics; Storage rings; Gas bremsstrahlung; Positrons; X rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031372305

The dynamic loss modulus, storage modulus, tan δ, and surface temperature of the specimens were continuously measured by a viscoelastometer during the fatigue tests. Fatigue lives and analysis of the samples by electron microscopy were also measured. The mechanical work, heat generated, and percent of work that appears as heat (PWAH) were calculated by the equations derived by viscoelastic equations and heat transfer. PWAH was in the range from 40 to 65%. The fatigue lives and PWAH were longer and larger for PPE and PPE-rich alloys than for PS and PS-rich alloys, respectively. The cleavage energy of the polymer chain calculated from the decrease of molecular weight before and after the fatigue test were much smaller compared to the total mechanical work. The entanglement densities observed before and after the test were the same.

Leptin, a fat-derived protein encoded by the ob gene, has been postulated to be a sensor of energy storage in adipose tissue capable of mediating a feedback signal to sites involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Here, we provide evidence for specific effects of leptin on fat distribution and in viva insulin action. Leptin (LEP) or vehicle (CON) was administered by osmotic minipumps for 8 d to pair-fed adult rats. During the 8 d of the study, body weight and total fat mass decreased similarly in LEP and in CON. However, while moderate calorie restriction (CON) resulted in similar decreases in whole body (by 20%) and visceral (by 21%) fat, leptin administration led to a specific and marked decrease (by 62%) in visceral adiposity. During physiologic hyperinsulinemia (insulin clamp), leptin markedly enhanced insulin action on both inhibition of hepatic glucose production and stimulation of glucose uptake. Finally, leptin exerted complex effects on the hepatic gene expression of key metabolic enzymes and on the intrahepatic partitioning of metabolic fluxes, which are likely to represent a defense against excessive storage of energy in adipose depots. These studies demonstrate novel actions of circulating leptin in the regulation of fat distribution, insulin action, and hepatic gene expression and suggest that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of abdominal obesity and insulin resistance.","Gluconeogenesis; Glucose uptake; Hepatic glucose production; Obesity; PEPCK","insulin; leptin; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; article; body composition; body weight; caloric restriction; controlled study; energy balance; gene expression; gluconeogenesis; glucose clamp technique; glucose transport; glycogenolysis; insulin resistance; male; nonhuman; obesity; osmotic minipump; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031439778

For this purpose, the reaction between tertiary aliphatic amines and sodium hypochlorite in alkaline medium containing fluorescein as sensitizer was chosen. The influence of experimental variables such as the addition rate and sodium hypochlorite concentration, pH and fluorescein concentration on the maximum reaction rate was assessed and compared with that observed when using Rhodamine B as sensitizer. The method based on fluorescein exhibited the better analytical features (e.g. calibration graph for trimethylamine was linear over a wide such range as 10-2500 nmol, with relative standard deviation of 2.6%). The proposed method allows the indirect determination of primary amines (viz. methyl- and ethylamine) and compares favourably with recent alternatives to the determination of trimethylamine in fish tissue (mean recovery 101.0% and standard deviation 2.7).

The target area is required to meet a challenging set of engineering system design requirements and user needs. The target area must provide the appropriate conditions before, during, and after each shot. The repeated introduction of large amounts of laser energy into the chamber and subsequent target emissions represent new design challenges for ICF facility design. Prior to each shot, the target area must provide the required target illumination, target chamber vacuum, diagnostics, and optically stable structures. During the shot, the impact of the target emissions on the target chamber, diagnostics, and optical elements is minimized and the workers and public are protected from excessive prompt radiation doses. After the shot, residual radioactivation is managed to allow the required accessibility. Diagnostic data is retrieved, operations and maintenance activities are conducted, and the facility is ready for the next shot. The target area subsystems include the target chamber, target positioner, structural systems, target diagnostics, environmental systems, and the final optics assembly. The engineering design of the major elements of the target area requires a unique combination of precision engineering, structural analysis, opto-mechanical design, random vibration suppression, thermal stability, materials engineering, robotics, and optical cleanliness. The facility has been designed to conduct both x-ray driven targets and to be converted at a later date for direct drive experiments. The NIF has been configured to provide a wide range of experimental environments for the anticipated user groups of the facility.

Hepatocellular neoplasms regularly develop from preneoplastic foci of altered hepatocytes, irrespective of whether they are caused by chemicals, radiation, viruses, or transgenic oncogenes. Two striking early metabolic aberrations were discovered: (1) a focal excessive storage of glycogen (glycogenosis) leading via various intermediate stages to neoplasms, the malignant phenotype of which is poor in glycogen but rich in ribosomes (basophilic), and (2) an accumulation of mitochondria in so-called oncocytes and amphophilic cells, giving rise to well-differentiated neoplasms. The metabolic pattern of human and experimentally induced focal hepatic glycogenosis mimics the phenotype of hepatocytes exposed to insulin. The conversion of the highly differentiated glycogenotic hepatocytes to the poorly differentiated cancer cells is usually associated with a reduction in gluconeogenesis, an activation of the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis, and an ever increasing cell proliferation. The metabolic pattern of preneoplastic amphophilic cell populations has only been studied to a limited extent. The few available data suggest that thyromimetic effects of peroxisomal proliferators and hepadnaviral infection may be responsible for the emergence of the amphophilic cell lineage of hepatocarcinogenesis. The actions of both insulin and thyroid hormone are mediated by intracellular signal transduction. It is, thus, conceivable that the early changes in energy metabolism during hepatocarcinogenesis are the consequence of alterations in the complex network of signal transduction pathways, which may be caused by genetic as well as epigenetic primary lesions, and elicit adaptive metabolic changes eventually resulting in the malignant neoplastic phenotype.","Amphophilic foci; Glycogenotic foci; Hepatic preneoplasia; Hepatocellular neoplasms; Mitochondria; Peroxisomes","insulin; thyroid hormone; animal tissue; bioenergy; glycogenolysis; insulin treatment; liver cancer; liver carcinogenesis; liver mitochondrion; nonhuman; rat; review; Animals; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Energy Metabolism; Glycogen; Humans; Insulin; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Thyroid Hormones; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030691794

However, efficiency depends considerably on synchronism of heat and electricity demand. Using a combined heat and power installation to feed the supplementary lighting in greenhouses leads to great differences with regard to quantity and simultaneity of the heat production and demand. This problem can be solved by storing temporary heat surpluses in a buffer. In an experimental greenhouse, cultivated with supplementary lighted roses, research has been done to study the prospects of temporary heat storage. Storage of temporary heat surpluses from the heat and power installation resulted in an energy saving of 60 kWh/m 2/yr. In case of storing heat surpluses from both combined heat and power installation and boiler (used for CO2 production), an energy saving of 95 kWh/m2/yr was realized.","Buffer; Energy saving; Heat surpluses; Synchronism of heat and electricity demand","Rosa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879099406

Quite often the heat production exceeds the actual heat demand of the greenhouse. Thus combined heat and power induces heat surpluses. However, in a large span of time (yearround), reject heat from combined heat and power is less than the heat demand of an intensive utilized greenhouse. Thus, periods with surpluses must be considered temporary and storage of these surpluses for future use is advantageous. Another potential source of heat surpluses is the boiler, when its exhaust gases are used for carbondioxide enrichment of the greenhouse air. Carbondioxide addition is requested during the day, whereas the heat, associated with this way of CO2-production is mostly not required during the day. A buffer can store the heat produced during the day for use during the night. To determine the energy consumption and canopy growth of a greenhouse with artificial lighting, combined heat and power, CO2-enrichment of the canopy ambient and a heat storage facility a simulation model was built. In this paper the energy saving obtained by heat storage facilities with different dimensions is discussed. Comparison of the benefits with the costs related to the storage facility gives a possibility to determine an optimal storage capacity. It will be demonstrated that the amount of carbondioxide addition has a significant effect on the optimum storage capacity.","Combined Heat and Power; Heat storage; Marginal costs and benefits",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879079586

Rocks of the region can be divided into four basic types: (1) basin-fill deposits - unconsolidated to poorly consolidated sand and gravel interbedded or intermixed with clay and silt; (2) volcanics - primary basalt, including volcanic flow rocks, tuff, and small intrusive bodies; (3) consolidated sedimentary rocks - primarily shale and sandstone, including limestone, gypsum, and salt; and (4) crystalline rocks - intrusive igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks. Structually and hydrologically the 22 basins can be divided into two general types: open basins that have surface-water discharge and closed basins that have no surface-water discharge. The Rio Grande is the primary hydrologic connection among basins that have surface-water discharge. Recharge to the ground-water system is greater in the northern basins. About 3,580 cubic feet per second annually is recharged to the San Luis Basin. Recharge to the Mesilla Basin in southern New Mexico and western Texas annually is 6 cubic feet per second. Basin-fill deposits, including fan deposits, river alluvium, and unconsolidated to consolidated sediments and some volcanics of the Santa Fe Group or Gila Conglomerate are hydraulically connected and form an aquifer system. Coarse-grained sediments were deposited by the relatively high energy ancestral Rio Grande; whereas, fine-grained lake or playa sediments were deposited in topographically closed basins. Simulation of ground-water flow in the San Luis Basin indicates that of the 535 cubic feet per second of water that was withdrawn from the basin-fill aquifer system in 1980, 80 percent was from salvaged evapotranspiration, 14 percent was from aquifer storage, and 6 percent was from streamflow capture. The total saturated thickness of sediments penetrated by wells in the Albuquerque-Belen Basin is made up of a muxture of clay, silt, and sand. Ground water in the southeastern pan of the Albuquerque-Belen Basin contains calcium and sulfate as primary ions. Calcium generally is the dominant cation: bicarbonate is the dominant anion along the northeast side of the basin. Ground water in the flood plain of the Rio Grande generally is of a calcium sulfate type A sodium chloride brine is found in the extreme southwestern pan of the basin. The ground-water flow model of the Albuquerque-Belen Basin shows that from 1976 to 1979 ground-water withdrawals outside the flood plain were composed of 36 percent intercepted ground-water discharge to the flood-plain system, 32 percent induced recharge from the flood plain; 25 percent aquifer storage; and 7 percent underflow from the Santo Domingo Basin, to the north. Ground water cast of the Rio Grande valley in the Socorro Basin contains large percentages of calcium, magnesium, and sulfate. Ground water in the southern part of the Rio Grande valley generally has a larger percentage of sodium and a smaller percentage of sulfate than ground water in the northern part of the valley. Water is a calcium bicarbonate type in the La Jencia Basin, in the principal recharge area to the east. The increase in the percent of sodium downgradient from the recharge area is significant. The total saturated thickness of sediments penetrated by wells in the Mesilla Basin is made up of a mixture of clay, silt, and sand. Ground water is a sodium and sulfate type water along the northeast basin margin. Along the southwest basin margin one water type contains dominant ions of sodium and bicarbonate; another type contains dominant ions of sodium and chloride. West of Las Cruces chloride generally is the dominant anion in ground water. Shallow ground water in the Rio Grande flood plain in the Mesilla Basin generally has a larger specific conductance than water deeper in the aquifer. Ground water associated with Mesozoic and Paleozoic rocks north and east of Las Cruces has a larger percentage of sulfate and chloride and greater specific conductance than water associated with volcanic rocks east of Las Cruces. The ground-water flow model shows that for nonirrigation ground-water withdrawals in the Mesilla Basin, 80 percent is from the surface-water system, including streamflow capture; 10 percent is from aquifer storage; and 10 percent is from salvaged evapotranspiration. Ground-water movement in the study area is generally from west and east to the center of the valley and then southward. Through much of the study area the Rio Grande flood plain acts as a drain for the basin-fill aquifer system. Temperature of ground water from the San Luis Basin south to the northern end of the Albuquerque-Belen Basin generally ranges from 5 to 15 degrees Celsius. South of the northern end of the Albuquerque-Belen Basin the ground-water temperature generally ranges from 15.1 to 25 degrees Celsius. Ground water generally has a specific conductance less than 750 microsiemens per centimeter at 25 degrees Celsius, north of the Albuquerque-Belen Basin. East of the Rio Grande and south of the Albuquerque-Belen Basin the specific conductance of water is usually in the range of 751 to 2,250 microsiemens per centimeter at 25 degrees Celsius. Chemical processes affecting ground-water quality are dissolution of calcite, dolomite, gypsum, and halite; precipitation of calcite and dolomite; exchange of calcium for sodium; and mixing of local recharge, geothermal, or inflowing ground water from adjacent basins with ground water in the area of study. Recharge water from the east and west, in basins north of the Albuquerque-Belen Basin, is a calcium bicarbonate type; the principal chemical process is dissolution of calcite. Chloride water is found in the Albuquerque-Bekn Basin and basins to the south.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6444222752

The model simulates the hydrologic processes of infiltration, soil water storage, deep percolation or recharge to the water table, evapotranspiration, and evaporation from the soil surface. The soil water-balance model was developed using the theory of water flow in unsaturated soil and empirical and heuristic arguments to account for evapotranspiration and plant uptake of soil water. Atmospheric boundary conditions, which include both constant flux and constant potential components, are computed using net radiation, subsurface heat flux, air temperature and vapor pressure, and precipitation. The lower boundary condition is a constant potential at the water table. Field measurements and laboratory analysis of samples collected from the study site were used to determine or estimate the soil physical and plant properties used in the model. The soil profile was divided into three depth intervals on the basis of morphological characteristics. Saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, air-entry soil water-pressure potential, soil water-characteristic function, and particle-size distribution were determined or estimated for each depth interval. Fractional interception of incoming shortwave radiation by the plant canopy was sampled, and depth of the root zone was estimated by observation. Two hypothetical profiles of root activity were used for the simulations. The Priestley-Taylor equation was calibrated to predict evapotranspiration using measurements of evapotranspiration made by the eddy correlation technique on rainless days during a 16-month period. The Priestley-Taylor multipliers obtained from the calibrations, which were 0.72 and 0.73 for hourly and daily periods, respectively, were almost 30 percent less than the theoretical minimum multiplier of 1.0 that can be expected for a wet surface under conditions of minimal advection. This result was interpreted to indicate that evapotranspiration was substantially water limited on rainless days. Transient and steady-state simulations of the soil water balance were performed. The transient simulations were performed for four periods of about 2 weeks in duration. Measured depth to the water table ranged from 0.58 to 1.52 meters among the simulation periods. Initial profiles of volumetric soil water content for the simulations were determined using gravimetric and neutron-scattering techniques. Simulated evapotranspiration differed from evapotranspiration measured by the energy-balance Bowen ratio technique by as much as 24 percent during the four transient simulation periods. The difference between simulated and estimated evapotranspiration was attributed to the inability of the model to account for the variation in the Priestley-Taylor multiplier that was observed in conjunction with energy-balance Bowen ratio measurements. Variation in the multiplier, however, did not appear to be related to variation in depth to the water table or to volumetric soil water content in the root zone. Simulated and measured volumetric soil water content at the end of the transient simulation periods generally agreed to within 4 percent, although the two differed by as much as 9 percent in lower half of the second uppermost soil-depth interval and by as much as 7 percent in the uppermost soil-depth interval following intense precipitation events. Simulated and measured changes in soil water storage agreed to within 10 percent for three of the four simulation periods, and they differed by 50 percent for one simulation period. Simulated recharge to the saturated ground-water system ranged from -1.4 to O millimeter per day among the four simulation periods, indicating that the saturated ground-water system discharged water to the unsaturated zone during most of the simulations. Simulated recharge to the saturated ground-water system was sensitive to variations in either air-entry soil water-pressure potential or depth to the water table. Steady-state simulations of the soil water balance were performed to aid in identification and examination of major controls of evapotranspiration. Steady-state evaporation from the soil surface was simulated for the study site assuming the soil surface was bare. The simulations indicated that evaporation would not become water limited unless depth to the water table exceeded a critical depth that ranged from 0.8 to 1.0 meter. Actual measurements of evapotranspiration for the densely vegetated site, however, indicated that evapotranspiration was water limited even when the water table was at the soil surface. The implication of these results is that a plant canopy might limit total evaporative loss from a soil with a shallow water table under some conditions, and it is suggested that this hypothesis could be tested by future study.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5944246231

The particular sensor under study includes a spatially-varying weighting of the ground values within overlapping, large, low-resolution image pixels. Thus the problem is one of estimating sub-pixel information from a low resolution observation. The observation process involves interaction with an unknown atmosphere, realistic modeling of which requires sophisticated and computationally expensive algorithms. These make it difficult to specify likelihood functions for use in a fully Bayesian approach to the inversion and so we work with atmospherically-corrected data in a penalized least-squares framework. We formulate realistic physical models for the observation process which can then be inverted using a forward modeling approach. This can be solved by using a stochastic optimization algorithm on a suitably chosen energy function, which regularizes the accuracy of reconstruction of the observed satellite data with our prior beliefs about spatial smoothness of the ground reflectance. A further complication is introduced as the sensor views the same ground point from two viewing angles at closely-spaced times. As the surface property of reflectance intrinsically varies with viewing angle, depending on the vegetation or ground cover, these two views allow us to jointly estimate two parameters of a suitable physical model for this variation. From this we can also derive other functionals of interest to environmental applications. This estimation can be considered as a form of image fusion, via the forward model of the observation process. We consider practical aspects of the smoothness priors, the forward model and its implications for the design of an energy function and stochastic inversion algorithms in this application. We compare their performance with an existing method, on some synthetic data, generated with the important sensor properties. We discuss a 'stochastic refinement' algorithm, which improves on starting estimates, and is a computationally-cheap and effective alternative to full stochastic optimization when images are smooth. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Bidirectional reflectance; Forward modelling; Statistical data fusion; Stochastic refinement","Algorithms; Bayesian networks; Data fusion; Digital image storage; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Functions; Image fusion; Image processing; Imaging systems; Information fusion; Models; Parameter estimation; Pixels; Probability density function; Random processes; Reflection; Sensors; Surface chemistry; Surface properties; Bayesian approaches; Bidirectional reflectance; Energy functions; Forward modelling; Functionals; Ground cover; Ground point; Ground reflectance; Inversion algorithms; Least squares (LS); Likelihood functions; Low resolution (LR); Optimization algorithms; Physical model (PM); Practical aspects; Resolution imaging; Sensor properties; Statistical data fusion; Stochastic refinement; Sub pixels; Viewing angles; Stochastic models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58749101155

Many investigators have suggested an energy-based metric, and have used such metrics to analyze craniofacial growth and anatomic variation. A strict dependence on homology is the primary disadvantage of this energy functional for generalized biological structures; many shapes do not have obvious landmarks. Some tentative solutions to the problem of landmark dependency for patterned injury analysis are presented. One intriguing approach comes from recent work in axiomatic vision. This approach has resulted in the development of a multiresolution medial axis for the extraction of shape primitives which can be used as the basis for registration. A scale-based description of this process can be captured in structures called cores, which can describe object shape and position in a highly compact manner. Cores may provide a scale- and shape-based method of determining correspondences necessary for determining the number and position of landmarks for some patterned injuries. Each of the approaches described are generalizable to higher dimensions, and can thus be used to analyze both two- and three- dimensional data. Together, they may represent a reasonable way of measuring shape distance for the purpose of matching objects and wounds, and can be combined with texture measures for a complete description. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Cores; Multiresolution; Pattern analysis; Patterned injury; Thin plate spline","Digital image storage; Image processing; Imaging systems; Plates (structural components); Splines; Three dimensional; Cores; Multiresolution; Pattern analysis; Patterned injury; Thin plate spline; Multiresolution analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149234771

The activator luminescence during a 10 s under UV-light or electron irradiation and, after it, the pulsed photostimulated luminescence on a phosphorescence background were investigated. The obtained results allow us to conclude that the main host lattice excitation relevant to both the luminescence processes mentioned above is a very mobile excitonic excitation including a photon phase and the self- trapped exciton in its composition. The photon phase, as we suppose, represents a free exciton luminescence at room temperature. In this phase, via multiple reabsorption in the low-energy exciton absorption band, the excitonic excitation can overcome large distances. In the phase of the self- trapped exciton, the induced decay within a perturbed region around the activator hole center takes place. As a result, the pairs of F-type electron and activator hole centers, contributing to the photostimulated luminescence under stimulation with light in the F absorption band, are formed. The above-mentioned defect formation process is dominant over the excitation of activator ion at low activator concentration. At high activator concentration, when strong competition between reabsorption in the exciton absorption band and absorption in the local center band connected with the activator takes place, the activator luminescence prevails. The activator luminescence spectrum is found to be sensitive to the F or F-aggregate centers formation in the region near the activator hole center. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Doped alkali halides; Eelectron-hole defect pairs; Energy storage mechanism; Excitonic excitation; Optically stimulated luminescence; UV-light reabsorption","Absorption; Data storage equipment; Electron irradiation; Energy storage; Excitons; Flywheels; Light; Light emission; Light sources; Luminescence; Photons; Radiation effects; Reduction; Single crystals; Doped alkali halides; Eelectron-hole defect pairs; Energy storage mechanism; Excitonic excitation; Optically stimulated luminescence; UV-light reabsorption; Dielectric materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149147586

By exploiting (silicon) photodiode array as a photodetector, the detective quantum efficiency of 0.1 for IP (KBr:In) can be achieved. A very wide dynamic range, 1010:1 for UV (6.35 eV) and 1011:1 for x-ray (44 kV tube voltage) OSL recording at the spatial resolution of 1 mm 2, is favorable for digital imaging and considerably improves image quality. These possibilities are illustrated by presenting available information capacities, energy consumption per bit as a function of the spatial resolution, and signal contrast ratio as a function of the input energy if using the KBr:In material with optimum characteristics (the activator concentration of 10 17 cm-3, the 245 nm UV-light sensitization of UV detecting, minimum concentration of Ca+2 ions, etc.). Both the radiation dose storage is stable only up to 18 degrees Celsius and 200 s after an x-bremsstrahlung write at this temperature.

We employ a 2D triangular mesh to represent each video object, which allows us to describe the motion of the object by the displacements of the node points of the mesh, and to describe any intensity variations by the contrast and brightness parameters estimated for each node point. Using the temporal history of the node point locations, we continue tracking the nodes of the 2D mesh even when they become invisible because of self-occlusion or occlusion by another object. Uncovered parts of the object in the subsequent frames of the sequence are detected by means of an active contour which contains a novel shape preserving energy term. The proposed shape preserving energy term is found to be successful in tracking the boundary of an object in video sequences with complex backgrounds. By adding new nodes or updating the 2D triangular mesh we incrementally append the uncovered parts of the object detected during the tracking process to the one of the objects to generate a static mosaic of the object. Also, by texture mapping the covered pixels into the current frame of the video clip we can generate a dynamic mosaic of the object. The proposed mosaicing technique is more general than those reported in the literature because it allows for local motion and out-of-plane rotations of the object that results in self-occlusions. Experimental results demonstrate the successful tracking of the objects with deformable boundaries in the presence of occlusion.",,"Communication; Digital image storage; Image communication systems; Image processing; Imaging systems; Motion estimation; Video cameras; Video recording; Visual communication; Active contours; Complex backgrounds; Current frames; Deformable boundaries; Intensity variations; Local motions; Mosaicing; Object tracking; Plane rotations; Point locations; Static mosaics; Texture mappings; Tracking processes; Triangular meshes; Video clips; Video Objects; Video sequences; Motion compensation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749111896

Our coder is built on the observation that the motion field associated with typical image sequences can be segmented into component motion subfield 'clusters' associated with distinct objects or regions in the scene, and further that these clusters can be efficiently captured using morphological operators in a 'backward' framework that avoids the need to send region shape information. Regions segmentation is performed directly on the motion field by introducing a small 'core' for each cluster that captures the essential features of the cluster and reliably represents its motion behavior. Cluster matching is used in lieu of the conventional block matching methods of standard video codecs to define a cluster motion representation paradigm. Furthermore, a region-based pel-recursive approach is applied to find the refinement motion field for each cluster and the cluster motion prediction error image is coded by a novel adaptive scalar quantization method. Experimental results reveal a 10-20 percent reduction in prediction error energy and 0.5-2 dB gain in final reconstructed PSNR over the standard MPEG-12 coder at typical bitrates of 500 kbits/sec to 1 Mb/sec on standard test sequences.","Morphology; Pel-recursive; Region-based; Segmentation; Video coding","Communication; Digital image storage; Image communication systems; Image compression; Image processing; Image segmentation; Imaging systems; Motion compensation; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Particle size analysis; Programming theory; Recursive functions; Standards; Visual communication; Block matching methods; Cluster motions; Essential features; Image sequence.; Image sequences; Morphological operators; Motion behaviors; Motion correspondences; Motion fields; Pel-recursive; Prediction errors; Recursive approaches; Region shapes; Region-based; Scalar quantizations; Segmentation; Standard tests; Video codecs; Video coding; Video compressions; Image coding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749099030

An investigation of wavelet decomposition reveals the cross-correlation among subimages at different resolutions. To exploit this cross-correlation, a new scheme using classified vector quantization to encode wavelet coefficients is proposed in this paper. The original image is first decomposed into a hierarchy of three layers containing ten subimages by discrete wavelet transform. The lowest resolution low frequency subimage is scalar quantized since it contains most of the energy of the wavelet coefficients. All high frequency subimages are vector quantized to utilize the cross-correlation among different resolutions. Vectors are constructed by combining the corresponding coefficients of the high frequency subimages of the same orientation at different resolutions. Classified vector quantization is used to reduce edge distortion and computational complexity. Computer simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.","Classified vector quantization; Image compression; Wavelet transform","Communication; Computational complexity; Digital image storage; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image communication systems; Image compression; Image processing; Imaging systems; Motion compensation; Vectors; Visual communication; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Classified vector quantization; Edge distortions; High frequencies; Image and video compressions; Low frequencies; Multi resolution representations; Original images; Wavelet coefficients; Vector quantization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749094043

The objective function to be minimized by the network is defined based on the criteria that integrates region growing and edge detection for the image segmentation. The energy of the network tends to converge on a local minimum, sot hat pyramid images are used to avoid such local minima and to achieve fast convergence. Moreover, the active region segmentation algorithm is applied to a sequence of color images to track an object region that change in appearance through complex and nonstationary background/foreground situations.

Many fast algorithms available for the DCT optimize various parameters such as additions and multiplications but they are input independent and thus require the same number of operations for any inputs. In this paper we study the benefits of input- dependent algorithms for the DCT which are aimed at minimizing the average computation time by taking advantage of the sparseness of the input data. Here, we concentrate on the inverse DCT (IDCT) part since typical input blocks will contain a substantial number of zeros. We show how to construct an IDCT algorithm based on the statistics of the input data, which are used to optimize the algorithm for the average case. We show how, for a given input and a correct model of the complexity of the various operations, we can achieve the fastest average performance.","Average complexity; Discrete cosine transform; Distortion/complexity trade-off; JPEG; Knowledge-based; Minimum operation","Clutches; Commerce; Communication; Compaction; Cosine transforms; Digital image storage; Image coding; Image communication systems; Image compression; Image processing; Imaging systems; Knowledge based systems; Motion compensation; Visual communication; Average complexity; Distortion/complexity trade-off; JPEG; Knowledge-based; Minimum operation; Discrete cosine transforms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749090188

In contrast to other extrapolation approaches described in the literature, the proposed method is computationally simple and specifically adapted to the needs of real-time video coding.

For this purpose, we present a non-linear registration method for SPECT brain studies that is independent of any other imaging modalities or head fixation devices. The registration of two brain SPECT volumes is carried out in two main steps. First the SPECT volumes must be aligned along a unique coordinate system; in this study, the standard Talairach and Tournoux's reference system is adopted. Second, a ""fine tuning"" registration is needed to better take to account individual brain sizes and morphologies. In order to validate the algorithm quantitatively, a set of 64 x 64 x 64 SPECT Monte-Carlo simulations were produced with numerical brain phantoms as input, obtained from segmented MRI brain images. The intercomisural line which defines the main axis of the Talairach and Tournoux's reference system was detected accurately in both position and angulation with errors typically less than 0.15 pixel and 2.5 degrees respectively. As for the second step, results show that an optical flow approach can be used successfully to match precisely two brains and that a difference map can be computed at the same time for statistical inference with RMS differences being essentially due to noise or activity differences peculiar to each brains.","Brain; Brain atlas; Image processing; Medical imaging; Nuclear medicine; Optical flow; Registration; SPECT; Stereotactic normalization","Digital image storage; Image processing; Imaging systems; Mathematical models; Nuclear energy; Nuclear medicine; Optical data processing; Optical flows; Radioactive tracers; Three dimensional; Accurate registrations; Brain atlas; Brain images; Brain phantoms; Brain studies; Coordinate systems; Fine tuning; Fixation devices; Imaging modalities; Linear registration methods; Linear registrations; Monte-carlo simulations; Reference systems; Registration; SPECT; SPECT imaging; Statistical inferences; Stereotactic normalization; Medical imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649237775

The proposed technique has yielded correct segmentation of complex scene of sputum prepared by ordinary manual staining method in most of the tested images selected from our database containing thousands of sputum color images.","Hopfield neural network; Lung cancer diagnosis; Optimization; RGB images; Segmentation; Sputum cells","Biological organs; Color; Cytology; Debris; Digital image storage; Hopfield neural networks; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image segmentation; Imaging systems; Medical imaging; Metropolitan area networks; Optical properties; Optimization; Automatic segmentations; Color image segmentations; Color images; Complex scenes; Efficient algorithms; Energy functions; Global minimums; Lung cancer diagnosis; Raw images; Regions of interests; RGB images; Segmentation; Sputum cells; Staining methods; Sum of squared errors; Neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649198140

We are developing a segmentation scheme based on collections of active surface templates embedded within an active volume. This composite system encodes high-level anatomical knowledge of both cortical surface and interior brain structures in a self-assembling model of a reference, or atlas brain. Following initialization of the surface templates in the test brain volume, the cortical surface templates deform to achieve a segmentation of the surface of the brain. The displacements of the cortical surface templates cause an increase in the potential elastic energy of the active volume, and a subsequent minimization of this elastic energy is used to define a volumetric warp between the reference brain and the test data. This warp is used to deform the active surface models of the deep structure in the brain to their approximate final configurations, after which a further energy minimization step achieves a final segmentation of the deep structures. The method uses the results of the surface segmentation step as a-priori information regarding the likely deformation of the deep surface models. Initial tests illustrate the potential of the system in regard to the segmentation of cortical surface and deep brain anatomy. Results are analyzed in terms of improvements that will increase the efficacy of the system.","Active surfaces; Active volumes; Deformable brain atlases; Deformable surfaces; Image segmentation","Deformation; Digital image storage; Image processing; Image segmentation; Imaging systems; Linguistics; Medical imaging; Military operations; Model structures; Optimization; Weaving; Active surface models; Active surfaces; Active volumes; Advanced applications; Anatomical informations; Brain anatomies; Brain structures; Brain volumes; Composite systems; Cortical surfaces; Deep structures; Deformable brain atlases; Deformable surfaces; Elastic energies; Energy minimizations; Initial tests; Neurosurgical planning; Priori informations; Segmentation schemes; Surface models; Surface segmentations; Surface templates; Test datums; Volumetric warps; Brain models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649153272

Only one calibrated camera is used in the approach which can handle the mothion of objects with known geometry. Information in 2D images from the camera would conduct motions in 3D space. The useful image features are contour edges of object to be tracked. The matching process includes two aspects of:(l)feature extraction using local minimum energy and (2)global matching of known 3D Models against the projected features. The algorithm is robust to change in lighting and background. The small motion hypothesis is used for fitting feature energy which is defined as the negative absolute value of the edge strength. An autoregressive AR(1) model is employed for detecting incorrect matches in terms of the feature energy. We have found a new invariance-based method to eliminate false matches caused by strong shadow or occlusion. The invariance is the ratio of trigonometric functions of the angles formed by a polygon. Both performance analysis and real object tracking show that the proposed algorithm is effective and robust.","Ar model; Computer vision; Cross-ratio; Gaussian blur; Image processing; Motion tracking; Snake","Cameras; Computer vision; Control theory; Digital image storage; Edge detection; Feature extraction; Function evaluation; Holograms; Image processing; Imaging systems; Instruments; Mathematical models; Three dimensional computer graphics; Trellis codes; Ar model; Cross-ratio; Gaussian blur; Motion tracking; Snake; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649130686

The EC detector is actually a weighted wavelet detector, weighted by the scattering function that describes the medium and/or model. The wavelet detector is the optimum detector for point objects but it does not incorporate knowledge of the scattering environment. However, when imaging distributed objects, it is advantageous to take a priori information into account. The EC incorporates this information as a weight on the wavelet image and formulates an estimated spreading function which essentially achieves recombination of highlights and multipath energy. It can be shown that the EC reduces to the the wavelet detector when a point object is being imaged.","Classification; Detection; Estimator correlator; Scattering function model; Weighted wavelet","Classification; Detection; Estimator correlator; Scattering function model; Weighted wavelet; Blood vessel prostheses; Digital image storage; Electric conductivity measurement; Functions; Image processing; Imaging systems; Probability density function; Scattering; Wavelet transforms; Detectors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649129117

Wavelet shrinkage using thresholding is asymptotically optimal in a minimax mean-square error (MSE) sense over a variety of smoothness spaces. However, for any given signal, the MSE-optimal processing is achieved by the Wiener filter, which delivers substantially improved performance. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm for wavelet denoising that uses a wavelet shrinkage estimate as a means to design a wavelet-domain Wiener filter. The shrinkage estimate indirectly yields an estimate of the signal subspace that is leveraged into the design of the filter. A peculiar aspect of the algorithm is its use of two wavelet bases: one for the design of the empirical Wiener filter and one for its application. Simulation results show up to a factor of 2 improvement in MSE over wavelet shrinkage, with a corresponding improvement in visual quality of the estimate. Simulations also yield a remarkable observation: whereas shrinkage estimates typically improve performance by trading bias for variance or vice versa, the proposed scheme typically decreases both bias and variance compared to wavelet shrinkage.","Denoising; Estimation; Subspace; Wavelets; Wiener filter","Adaptive filtering; Applications; Digital image storage; Image processing; Imaging systems; Mean square error; Signal analysis; Strain energy; Wavelet transforms; Wireless telecommunication systems; Asymptotically optimal; Bias and variances; Denoising; Do-mains; Improved performances; MiniMax; New algorithms; Optimal processing; Signal compressions; Signal estimations; Signal subspaces; Simulation results; Square errors; Subspace; Thresholding; Visual qualities; Wavelet basis; Wavelet denoising; Wavelet shrinkages; Wavelets; Wiener filter; Wiener filtering; Shrinkage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649123263

ORNL and Mechanical Technology, Inc., performed final acceptance testing of the TMS during the next eight months. The TMS was calibrated and characterized during this period. This paper covers the calibration, characterization, and acceptance testing of the TMS. Development of the TMS and the ICERVS was initiated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the purpose of characterization and remediation of underground storage tanks (USTs) at DOE sites across the country. DOE required a 3-D, topographical mapping system suitable for use in hazardous and radiological environments. The intended application is the mapping of the interior of USTs as part of DOE's waste characterization and remediation efforts and to obtain baseline data on the content of the storage tank interiors as well as data on changes in the tank contents and levels brought about by waste remediation steps. Initially targeted for deployment at the Hanford Washington site, the TMS is designed to be a selfcontained, compact, and reconfigurable system that is capable of providing rapid, variable-resolution mapping information in poorly characterized workspaces with a minimum of operator intervention.","Hazardous environment; Radiological environment; Structured-light; Topographical Mapping System; Underground storage tank","Hazardous environment; Radiological environment; Structured-light; Topographical Mapping System; Underground storage tank; Computer systems; Computer testing; Computer vision; Conformal mapping; Density (optical); Diffractive optical elements; Functional electric stimulation; Health hazards; Image processing; Intelligent materials; Intelligent robots; Materials handling; Materials handling equipment; Optical properties; Plant layout; Pollution; Robotics; Storage (materials); Tanks (containers); Three dimensional; Trucks; Hazardous materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649096591

Given two different views of some 3D objects, and a virtual 3D plan set by an external operator, the method we propose allows to recover the 2D projections, in the two images, of the 3D planar curves corresponding to the intersection of the virtual plan with the different objects in the scene. To this end, an arbitrary curve is first initialized in one of the two images. This curve, and its associated homographic curve in the second image are then designed to move under the influence of internal and external image dependent forces while minimizing an energy functional. Following the work on geodesic active contours by Caselles et al and Malladi et al, we then transform the problem of minimizing this functional into a problem of geodesic computation in a Riemannian space, according to a new metric. The Euler- Lagrange equation of this new functional is derived and its associated PDE is then solved using the level set formulation scheme of Osher and Sethian by viewing it as a front propagating with internal and external image correlation dependent speed. The curves to be matched are therefore modelized as geodesic active contours evolving toward the minimum of the designed functional. Using this level set based approach, complex curves can be matched and topological changes for the evolving curves are naturally managed. The final result is also relatively independent of the curve initialization. Promising experimental results have been obtained on real images and some of these results are illustrated in the experimental section of this paper. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Curve evolution; Deformable contours; Energy minimization; Front propagation; Geodesic Active Contour; Level-set approach; PDE; Stereo","Aircraft engines; Deformation; Differential equations; Digital image storage; Equations of motion; Experiments; Geodesy; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image segmentation; Imaging systems; Level measurement; Mathematical operators; Optimization; Partial differential equations; Curve evolution; Deformable contours; Energy minimization; Front propagation; Geodesic Active Contour; Level-set approach; PDE; Stereo; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57549097763

The containers were designed primarily for the transportation and storage of 30- or 55-gallon drums of remote handled transuranic solid waste (RH-TRU). Two identical lids are used allowing the containers to be loaded from either end. The use of recycled construction materials fulfills two purposes; 1) waste transportation and storage, and 2) a reduction in the quantity of contaminated metals that require both storage and disposal. Currently, the DOE complex has millions of pounds of contaminated lead and stainless steel. Non-linear, dynamic finite element analyses were used to simulate the drop tests onto a rigid surface required for U.S. Dept. of Transportation (DOT) certification. During and after these tests, the container contents must remain within the container and shielding must not be reduced. Loads in the major connections and strains in the stainless steel and lead were monitored as a function of time during dynamic impact analyses for three simulated drop orientations. Results were used to optimize the final design. The stainless steel and lead have maximum strains well below ultimate levels except at an impact corner where additional deformation is acceptable. The predicted loads in the connections indicate that some yielding will occur but the containment and shielding will remain intact. The results provide assurance that the containers will pass the required DOT certification tests. The methods used can be applied to other waste shipping containers allowing for optimization of designs without the expense of actual impact testing.",,"Computer simulation; Deformation; Dynamic loads; Finite element method; Impact testing; Lead; Nonlinear equations; Radiation shielding; Radioactive waste storage; Recycling; Stainless steel; Strain; Dynamic impact analysis; Recycled contaminated metals; Transuranic solid wastes; Containers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3643124126

We wished to pursue the question of anoxic tolerance and the physiological limits thereof. Anoxic tolerance may be limited by a combination of the high energy requirements of glycolytic ATP production and glycogen storage limitations. Awake unrestrained catheterized frogs were exposed to four hours of submergence anoxia at 15C. We infused insulin into (R. catesbeiana) to augment glucose uptake into cells. We simultaneously infused glucose solutions to either maintain or raise plasma glucose relative to untreated frog levels. We evaluated the effect on anoxic tolerance by quantifying the appearance of lactate in blood and by quantifying cardiac performance (i.e., systolic and diastolic pressure, pulse pressure, HR. dP/dT). With the exception of blood glucose levels, we found no consistent differences between control animals and those with glucose and insulin infusion.

It was demonstrated that initiation of DR in adulthood (DRA) was as effective as DRW in delaying the appearance of age-related diseases and increasing the longevity of laboratory rodents. Initiation of DR after the developmental period of life circumvents the interference with growth and maturation processes inherent to the classic DR model. We thus studied retinol hepatic storage and transport in aged (20-22 months) female and male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to a 40%-DR implanted at 8 months of age. Plasma retinol levels were decreased by 50% in DRA rats when compared to ad libitum-fed rats. The decrease was observed in both male and female rats and was of the same magnitude as that seen in DRW. These low levels of retinol would be indicative of vitamin A deficiency. However, retinoid hepatic concentration (per g liver) and content (per whole liver) were significantly higher in DRA and DRW than in ad libitum-fed controls, despite similar daily intake of vitamin A. These data suggest that restriction of the energy intake, from weaning or after the growth period, results in a similar perturbation of plasma retinol regulation, which appears to be sex-independent.

Leptin, the protein encoded by the recently cloned ob gene, has the properties of a hormone regulating appetite and energy expenditure. Alterations in leptin concentration during pregnancy and lactation may interact with prolactin to mediate shifts in substrate utilization. The objective of the present studies was to determine if changes in serum leptin levels occurred during pregnancy and lactation and if the changes were related to prolactin. Serum leptin and prolactin were measured longitudinally in 8 women through pregnancy and lactation. In a second experiment, leptin and prolactin were measured 4 days and 1 month postpartum in 21 lactating women. Radioimmunoassay was used to quantify leptin and prolactin. Body Mass Index (BMI) was determined. Serum leptin concentrations in pregnancy were significantly higher by 41% (29.5+\-4.2 ng/ml) when compared to lactation (17.4+\-4.6 ng/ml) and 67% higher than controls (9.8+\-1.4 ng/ml).

The genes for all of the single gene defects that produce obesity in experimental animals have now been cloned. The new insights from these models are one spur for the examination of possible links to human obesity. In thinking about the biology of obesity produced by single gene defects, it must be kept in mind that adrenalectomy can prevent the phenotypic expression in all of the single gene models of obesity. Thus, nongenetic components can play a major role in regulating even single gene models of obesity. Transgenic mice have also expanded our understanding of obesity. Transgenic models that both increase and decrease body fat have been published. Of particular interest from the perspective of the physiological control of obesity is the destruction of the uncoupling protein in brown adipose tissue, which is followed by hyperphagia and obesity, suggesting that the sympathetic nervous system is involved in both modulation of food intake and energy storage. Gene mapping using quantitative trait loci and studies of candidate genes have been applied to experimental models of animals with differing susceptibilities to dietary fat and have been applied to the human genome in more detail. © 1997 American Society for Nutritional Sciences.","Besity; Defects; Food; Gene; Intake",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749119580

The SMES unit is located near the generator bus terminal in a power system. A nonlinear feedback control law is found which linearizes and decouples the power system. An adaptive control law is used to design the controller for the generator excitation and SMES system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller can ensure transient stability of a single-machine-infinite-bus system under a large sudden fault which may occur near the generator bus terminal.","Adaptive control; Excitation control; FACTS; Nonlinear systems; SMES; Transient stability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747809693

The task of quickly and accurately evaluating the merits of this supply option is becoming an important function of utility system planners and operators. Furthermore, the reliability performance of the composite generation and transmission system together with the reliability indices of service supplied to customers constitute one of the major aspects that are taken into account in the power system planning and operating phases. North American Electric Reliability Council has developed a reference document containing the planning and the minimum operating considerations that both the utility and nonutility generating facilities must follow to assure the continued reliability of the bulk electric system. The most important considerations that affect the reliability assessment of the composite generation and transmission power system are the load-following capability, generation schedule, fuel supply and storage capabilities, maintenance requirements, emergency availability and restoration procedures. An improved computational method has been developed considering the main features of the Monte-Carlo sequential approach and its objective is to calculate an appropriate set of indices that quantify the operational and reliability performance of a power utility system incorporating NUG facilities together with the respective indices for each NUG facility under consideration. The basic improvements of this method are die following: 1) The generation rescheduling and branch overloading techniques have been extended to include the particular operating characteristics of NUG units. 2) A fuel supply control technique has been developed incorporating all the operating characteristics of two alternative models (constant order size or time interval). A particular model is assigned to each NUG plant by the user indicating the fuel order policy being applied. 3) The overall performance of the power system being analyzed is quantified by calculating the following indices: • Expected total energy supplied by all system generating units. • Expected energy supplied by all NUG units. • Expected average production cost of all system generating units. • Expected average production cost of all NUG units. • Expected total cost of energy purchased by the utility. • Expected damage cost of interruptions due to failures in the entire system. • Expected damage cost of interruptions due to failures in the NUG plants. 4) The operational performance of NUG plants is quantified by taking into account the events which occur when the NUG units fail to produce their output capacity agreed due to limitations existing in the NUG plants (failures, maintenance, fuel supply limitations) and utility system (split system, overloaded branches). Another category of events is also considered which cause the operation of NUG plants outside of their agreed time schedule (over-supply while in operation, continue to supply, start to supply while not in operation, continue to supply while there are fuel supply limitations). The following four indices are calculated for all the above categories of events: • Frequency of events being occurred. • Expected annual duration of events being occurred. • Expected energy not supplied (or supplied accordingly) during the events being occurred. • Penalty charges paid by the NUG plants (or the utility accordingly). 5) A technique has been developed that calculates the Long-Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) of integrating a NUG plant into a utility system for the time period under study. This cost is related to the expected energy supplied by the NUG plant and takes into account the capital cost of the investment and the operating cost of the plant units. 6) The Interrupted Energy Assessment Rate (IEAR) for the entire system (SIEAR) is calculated by taking into account the IEAR indices of all system load-points and their contribution to the total system load demand. The method developed has been implemented efficiently into the self-sufficient and easy to use computer program RANUG which can be used for analyzing alternative system configurations and establishing the impact of various system parameters. The data required for both the utility power system and the NUG facilities are inputted in a very simple way considering the respective single line diagram and the operating features being applied. Furthermore, the paper presents the results obtained from the analysis of a system based on the IEEE Reliability Test System and incorporating NUG facilities that were added at selected buses.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747759774

Therefore, we studied the effect of low glycogen stores on fat oxidation after a switch from a reducedfat diet to a high-fat diet. Twelve healthy, nonobese males and females (age: 22 ± 1 yr, body mass index: 21.0 ± 0.7, maximal power output: 254 ± 11 W) consumed a reduced-fat (RF) diet (30, 55, and 15% of energy from fat, carbohydrate, and protein, respectively) three times a day at home for 3 days (days 1-3). On two occasions subjects came to the laboratory on day 3 at 1500 to perform an exhaustive glycogen-lowering exercise (EX), after which they went into the respiration chamber for a 36-h stay. On one occasion, subjects directly entered the respiration chamber at 1800 for a 36-h stay. In the respiration chamber they were given either a high-fat (HF) diet (60, 25, and 15% of energy from fat, carbohydrate, and protein, respectively) or a RF diet. In both cases they were fed at energy balance. All diets were consumed as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two or more snacks per day. On the HF treatment, fat oxidation was below fat intake, indicating the slow change of oxidation to intake on a HF diet. After the HF+EX treatment, however, fat oxidation matched fat intake. In conclusion, lean subjects are capable of rapidly adjusting fat oxidation to fat intake when glycogen stores are lowered by exhaustive exercise.

Many of the symptoms of AF are poorly tolerated by patients and if not properly managed, may lead to fatal conditions like embolic stroke. The atrial electrograms during AF show a high degree of non-stationarity. AF being progressive in nature, we aim to link the the degree of non-stationarity of the atrial electrogram to the stage of advancement of the disease, the duration of episodes of AF, possibility of spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm and the defibrillation energy requirement. In this paper we describe a novel algorithm for classifying bipolar electrograms from the right atrium of sheep into four groups - normal sinus rhythm, atrial flutter, paroxysmal AF, chronic AF. This algorithm uses features derived from a wavelet transform representation of the signal to train an artificial neural network which is then used to classify the different arrhythmia. The success rates achieved for each subclass indicates that this approach is well suited for the study of atrial arrhythmia.","Artificial neural networks; Atrial fibrillation; Kurtosis; Non-stationary signal analysis; Pattern recognition; Wavelet transform","Backpropagation; Digital image storage; Image processing; Imaging systems; Pattern recognition; Signal analysis; Signal processing; Vegetation; Wavelet transforms; Artificial neural networks; Atrial arrhythmias; Atrial electrograms; Atrial fibrillation; Atrial flutters; Bipolar electrograms; Embolic strokes; Energy requirements; Four groups; Heart diseases; High rates; Kurtosis; Neural Network techniques; Non-stationary signal analysis; Normal sinus rhythms; Novel algorithms; Older populations; Sinus rhythms; Stationarity; Neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645205612

The active detector consists of a computer controlled x-ray generator that produces two, fast voltage switched x-ray pulses, with the high voltage pulse first. An image acquisition unit contains two storage phosphor screens arranged in a 'sandwich'. The screen nearest the x-ray tube is in an optical chamber coupled to high intensity flashlamps. These lamps produce a short duration light pulse during the inter-exposure period that erases the high voltage x-ray data from the front screen but not from the back screen. The active detector is thus able to acquire the high and low voltage images fast enough to minimize patient motion artifacts with no mechanical motion of the storage phosphor screens. The voltage switched x-ray spectra are much better conditioned for dual energy image processing than the effective spectra produced by conventional, single exposure 'sandwich' detectors. The processed dual energy images with the active detector have much lower noise for the same patient dose as single exposure detectors. We experimentally characterized the performance of the active detector and show initial human subject images. We measured the following parameters: (1) speed of tow exposure image acquisition, and (2) repeatability of x-ray spectra and flux. We characterized the imaging performance by making images of a chest phantom with our detector and a conventional sandwich detector using the same incident exposure.

A heart rate versus oxygen uptake regression was developed for backpacking by submaximal testing with simultaneous measurement of heart rate and oxygen uptake. Heart rate was measured using a Polar Vantage XL monitor and physical activity was assessed using the Tritrac-R3D. The average VO2 values while hiking uphill were measured as 49% VO2max and ranged from 39% to 66%, while hiking downhill the average VO2 values were measured as 28% VO2max and ranged from 22% to 35%. The Tritrac activity monitor underestimated the energy expenditure hiking on the downhill gradient and vastly underestimated the energy expenditure hiking on the uphill gradient. The analysis of caloric expenditure during the two days revealed that backpacking requires a moderate level of energy expenditure. Average caloric expenditure during the uphill hike was calculated to be 9.85 kcal/ min. In addition, the average caloric expenditure during the downhill hike was calculated to be 5.64 kcal/min.

Obesity is associated with many chronic diseases and alterations in physiologic function including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease and certain types of cancer. Much attention regarding dietary influences on obesity development or prevention has focused on high fat diets. Many studies have confirmed that high fat feeding leads to an expansion of adipose tissue mass through an increase in fat cell size and/or number and to the subsequent development of obesity. However, there is little definitive information on the effect of type of dietary fat, especially palm oil, on adipose tissue cellularity and the development of obesity. These studies were designed to determine whether dietary fat of different sources vary in their ability to produce obesity and to begin to elucidate the mechanism by which such divergence occurs. Male Osborne-Mendel rats were fed either a low fat (15% calories) or one of three high fat diets (65% calories) for 12 weeks. The predominant fat source in the high fat diets was either soybean oil, tallow, or palm-olein (a fraction of palm oil). Final body weight was not influenced by fat level or type; however, percent carcass lipid and fat pad weight were higher in soybean oil and tallow fed rats than in low fat and palm-olein fed rats. Fat pad specific increases in cell size and cell number were observed for tallow and soybean oil fed compared to low fat and palm-olein fed rats. Serum triglycerides were higher in the tallow and palm-olein fed rats compared to low fat fed rats; no significant effects of dietary fat type on serum cholesterol were observed. These results indicate that palm-olein, unlike tallow and soybean oil, were comparable to a low fat diet concerning fat pad weight, body composition and adipose tissue cellularity when fed for twelve weeks as 65% of energy intake. The lower fat storage in the palm-olein fed rats is perhaps associated with a slower rate of triglyceride uptake and/ or a reduced fat cell proliferative capacity. The influence of dietary fat type on the proliferative capacity of the pre-adipocytes and on the production of a local or systemic adipogenic factor is being determined in subsequent studies.","Fat cell number; Fat cell sizes; Palm oil; Rats",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21744455758

Nitride LEDs exhibit brightness levels and longevity well in access of what is required for outdoor applications. Combined with the available red LEDs, one can, for the first time, have full color all semiconductor displays. Very recently, pulsed room temperature operation of 410 nm semiconductor laser, the shortest wavelength ever from a semiconductor, has been reported. If used for traffic lights, in office, automobile, aircraft, airport, run-ways, ships and home illumination, these devices can outlast and outperform the incandescent light bulbs while saving precious energy. This material system is also intrinsically germane to short wavelength semiconductor lasers for increased data storage. Nitrides are also conductive for high power devices/circuits, and sensors and detectors with applications in high temperature and unfriendly environments. Estimates show that substantial weight savings can be had in aircraft and spacecraft. In aircraft, the devices can replace the bulky hydraulics rendering the craft more reliable and lighter while avoiding costly coolers. Moreover, AlGaN alloy with bandgaps above 5.5 eV shows negative electron affinity surface with applications to cold cathodes in general and flat panel displays in particular. GaN and related materials are rich in defects, certainly to a large extent due to the lack of native substrates, whose characteristics have been analyzed both structurally and electronically. Recent data indicate that the large background electron concentrations encountered in early stages of development are due to nitrogen vacancies. The p type doping incorporation is a very complex process in that the presence of p type impurities in the growth environment can result in defect formation. However, when the conditions are favorable, the p type dopant incorporation follows the side selection criteria meaning conditions favoring Ga vacancies appear to be desirable.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18844391012

We investigated the dose- and time-dependent effect of iron intake on IRP activity as well as on the abundance of two targets of IRP action, ferritin and mitochondrial aconitase (m-acon), the TCA cycle enzyme converting citrate to isocitrate. Weanling male rats were fed diets containing 2, 11, 20, 37 (control), 72 and 107 mg Fe/kg diet for 3 wk. RNA binding activity of liver IRPs increased by as much as 2-fold in rats fed diets containing less than the dietary iron requirement for rats (35 mg Fe/kg diet). Compared to controls, liver ferritin abundance declined by 90% in rats fed the diet containing 20 mg Fe/kg diet and was undetectable at lower levels of iron intake. In contrast, m-acon abundance declined by 20% in rats fed 20 mg Fe/kg diet and by 50% in rats fed 2 mg Fe/kg diet. Thus, although both ferritin and m-acon abundance were down-regulated in iron deficiency ferritin was regulated over a broader range suggesting that IRPs selectively modulate the translation of ferritin and m-acon mRNAs in response to changes in iron status. To further define the role of IRPs in modulating ferritin and m-acon abundance we fed rats either a control or iron-deficient (2 mg Fe/kg diet) diet for 2 to 7 d. RNA binding activities of liver IRP1 was increased 200, 220 & 240% of control values and IRP2 was increased 160, 210 & 240% of control values in rats fed the iron-deficient diet for 2, 5 and 7 d, respectively.

Our results support the hypothesis that different functional classes of IREs exist which permit selective regulation of IRE containing mRNAs. In addition, IRP-mediated changes in m-acon abundance may modulate TCA cycle function, thereby influencing cellular energy and citrate metabolism.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15444338987

If poorly planned, they can also lead to environmental degradation. Solutions to these problems must be found - solutions that are technically feasible, sustainable, environmentally appropriate, and acceptable to the people who are resettled. Such solutions demand an ecological view - a view of reservoirs as ecological resources with far more value than as mere water storage units. The formation of a reservoir is a dramatic reordering of nature that creates a suite of complex, dynamic aquatic ecosystems. With proper planning, these new ecosystems can make potentially much more valuable contributions than those to national energy or to agricultural production. Indeed, they offer to the people who can adapt to living and working with them new opportunities for employment, and they can dramatically increase the production of aquatic protein. This paper explains how the planned, integrated development of fisheries ecosystems in reservoirs not only can mitigate the negative social consequences of dam construction, but also can enhance the economic benefits from hydropower and irrigation projects in many developing countries. The use of integrated reservoir fisheries and aquaculture development as a tool in large-scale resettlement and environmental rehabilitation has received little attention despite reports from a growing number of projects showing unexpectedly high returns from fisheries. In some years the total income from fisheries in reservoirs has exceeded the income generated from electricity sales. The Saguling-Cirata reservoir project in West Java, Indonesia, was the first to demonstrate the potential of a planned, ""ecosystems"" approach to resettlement fisheries. This environmentally oriented resettlement effort fully utilized the new water surface for aquaculture and capture fisheries and developed supporting production, economic, and marketing infrastructure. More new jobs were created in the support industries for reservoir fisheries than in the fisheries themselves. The development of fisheries is complex, however, since it requires a great deal of preparation and planning not only for the water-based fisheries systems, but also for the land-based infrastructure, seed, feed, and other market and agricultural support systems that are vital components. But as the Saguling-Cirata project shows, if the right conditions are in place, the planned development of reservoir fisheries can be an effective way to create alternative livelihoods for people displaced by a reservoir, greatly enhancing the economic and social benefits from hydropower and irrigation projects.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11344294048

Through its superior heat management, the process is ultimately suitable to handle synthesis gas generated through gasification of coal, petroleum coke, natural gas, residual oil, wastes, and other environmentally disadvantaged hydrocarbon feedstocks. Apart from production of chemical grade methanol, the process provides economic advantages in the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power generation application. Co-production of power and methanol via the IGCC and the LPMEOH™ process provides opportunities for energy storage for peakshaving of electrical demand and/or clean fuel for export. The LPMEOH™ technology has been developed by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. since the 1980's, extensively proven in a Department of Energy (DOE) - owned process development unit in LaPorte, Texas and selected for demonstration under the DOE Clean Coal Technology Program. The slurry reactor being demonstrated is also suitable for other exothermic synthesis gas conversion reactions, like synthesis of dimethyl ether and other alcohols/oxygenates.

It is assumed that images are acquired from an optical sensor located in the interceptor nose cone. This imagery is used by the algorithm to steer the course of interception. The algorithm proposed in this paper is based on continuous spatio-temporal wavelet transforms (CWTs). Two different energy densities of the CWT are used to perform velocity detection and filtering. Additional post-processing is applied to discriminate among objects traveling at similar velocities. Particular attention is given to achieving robust performance on noisy sensor data and under conditions of temporary occlusions. First we introduce the spatio-temporal CWT and stress the relationships with classical orientation filters. Then we describe the CWT- based algorithm for target tracking, and present results on synthetically generated sequences.","Continuous wavelet transform; Motion estimation; Target detection and tracking","Ballistic missiles; Continuous wavelet transform; Continuous wavelets; Detection and tracking; Energy densities; Missile warheads; Noisy sensors; Orientation filters; Paper addresses; Post-processing; Robust performances; Spatio temporals; Target detection and tracking; Velocity detections; Ballistics; Communication; Digital image storage; Image communication systems; Image processing; Imaging systems; Mathematical transformations; Military operations; Missiles; Motion compensation; Motion estimation; Optical data processing; Sensors; Target drones; Target tracking; Targets; Visual communication; Wavelet transforms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343974305

The PET image is then modeled as a piece-wise smooth function through a Gibbs prior. Within homogeneous tissue regions the image intensity is assumed to be governed by a thin plate energy function. Rather than use the anatomical information to guide the formation of a binary process representing region boundaries, we use the segmented anatomical image as a template to customize the Gibbs energy in such a way that we apply thin-plate smoothing within homogeneous tissue regions while enforcing zeroth corder continuity as we transition from homogeneous to partial volume regions. Discontinuities in intensity are allowed only at transitions between two different homogeneous regions. We refer to this model as segmented thin-plate regression with controlled continuities.

The following properties of color spaces that influence compressibility have been studied: energy distribution among color planes, plane bandwidth, DCT energy compaction, and impact of gamma correction. We also compared the compressibility of low resolution images, which have been used for most of the compression results reported in literature, with high resolution images, which are becoming increasingly important for modern imaging applications. The findings of this research have been illustrated by comparing the actual JPEG compression results for YCbCr and CIELab spaces.","Color spaces; Compression; DCT; JPEG","Clutches; Communication; Compaction; Compressibility; Cosine transforms; Digital image storage; Discrete cosine transforms; Image communication systems; Image enhancement; Image processing; Imaging systems; Motion compensation; Optical properties; Visual communication; Color imaging; Color planes; Color spaces; Compression; DCT; Energy compactions; Energy distributions; Gamma corrections; High resolutions; Imaging applications; JPEG; JPEG compressions; Low resolutions; Color",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041445387

Mask blanks with reduced film thickness, good control of film thickness uniformity, and resistance to pinholes are now commercially available. The reduction in the amount of forward scattering with these reduced film stacks is primarily responsible for improvements in CD uniformity and CD linearity. CD uniformity, CD linearity, and CD control (mean to target) were measured using 6"" x 0.25"" PBS substrates and exposing them with MEBES® 4500 and 4500S machines. Both thick and thin resists were studied. The thin PBS process was modified by changing developer solvents. This was done to keep the development time in the desired range for the best CD control. Both processes use puddle develop with a reduced temperature postbake and exposure at 2.0 μC/cm2. Blanks from two vendors were examined and compared. Results show a significant improvement (&gt; 30%) in CD uniformity over a 132 mm2 array. In addition, an improvement in CD linearity and in the ability to maintain mean-to-target CD control were also noted. Modeling and experimental results were compared. We conclude that adoption of a thin resist process has significant advantages in commercial maskmaking. The lithographic properties of thin (200 nm) and standard (400 nm) PBS were modeled using ProBEAM/3D. ProBEAM/3D uses a Monte Carlo model to predict the energy deposited in the resist during exposure and a development rate model to predict the resist profile and CD size after development. Results from modeling were compared to experimental results. As expected, modeling confirms the hypothesis that reduced forward scatter is the dominant mechanism to improve CD performance.","CD control; CD linearity; CD uniformity; Modeling; PBS; Photomasks; ProBEAM/3D","CD control; CD linearity; CD uniformity; Modeling; PBS; ProBEAM/3D; Arsenic; Data storage equipment; Experiments; Linearization; Magnetic films; Molecular beam epitaxy; Photomasks; Process control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038432326

This probabilistic interpretation is demonstrated using a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) technique, which permits one to generate configurations that populate the prior. One of may uses for deformable models is to solve ill-posed tomographic reconstruction problems, which we demonstrate by reconstructing a two-dimensional object from two orthogonal noisy projections.

The method of active contours (snakes) is proposed here as good solution to the node segmentation problem. Optimum parameterization and search strategies for using a two-dimensional snake to find node cross-sections are described, and an energy normalization scheme which preserves important spatial variations in energy is introduced. Three-dimensional segmentation is achieved without additional operator interaction by propagating the 2D results to adjacent slices. The method gives promising segmentation results on both simulated and real node images.","Active contours; Lymph node segmentation; Snakes","Body fluids; Digital image storage; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image segmentation; Imaging systems; Three dimensional; Active contours; Automatic methods; Dimensional segmentations; Energy normalizations; Lymph node segmentation; Search strategies; Segmentation results; Snakes; Spatial variations; Volume analysis; Medical imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037505104

Above and below ground phytomass was collected monthly from selected plots in an edaphic savannah (ES) and a managed meadow (MM). Above ground phytomass was sorted by species and then by organs. Above and below ground plant material was separated into dead and live tissue. Leaf area, dry weight, and calorific values were determined consecutively. Climatic data showed that grasslands were exposed to two major types of stress factors: drought and water logged soils. In addition the first year, 1992, was 'dry' with a negative water balance, whereas 1993 was 'wet' with 21 weeks during which precipitation exceeded evaporation. The two rainy seasons each year determined productivity of both grasslands. Fertilising the edaphic savannah with the ashes from burned plant material and the managed meadow with mineral fertiliser in 1992, both grasslands responded with comparable productivity of 15 t ha-1 ·y-1. However, the growth pattern was rather different: accumulation of phytomass occurred in the MM mostly in the first 1992 rainy season, whereas the ES accumulated phytomass during both wet seasons in that year. Surprisingly, the MM changed carbon allocation pattern in such a way that below ground phytomass was reduced in favour of above ground phytomass. During the second, wet year, without any fertilisation, this shift was observed in both grasslands. Below ground necromass decomposition and mineralisation probably supported new growth. In poor soils root growth is promoted, in wet soils microbial activity is enhanced, but in water logged soils both processes are strongly reduced. In the water logged soils the ES was still able to produce above ground yield supported by below ground phytomass, whereas the MM showed strongly reduced productivity. Both grasslands lost sequestered carbon during these changes, but with 3,600 kg ha-1 y-1 MM productivity was seven times higher than that of the ES. During adaptation to changing stress patterns, periods with high sink capacity and low source capacity (photosynthesis) and vice versa can be traced by studying calorific values and calculating the storage index. It was found that these oscillations mirrored changes of carbon allocation to above or below ground biomass. Our results suggest that careful management of below ground phytomass by grasses could be seen as a strategy to cope with stress factors like drought and water logged soils. As expected, the natural (edaphic) savannah was able to follow this strategy with more success than the managed meadow.","Biomass allocation; Environmental stress; Eulalia; Grassland; Srachiasia; Thailand; Tropical environment","biomass allocation; environmental stress; grassland; tropical environment; Thailand; Brachiaria; Eulalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031544296

Other plants were directly incubated in enriched sea water. Chemical analyses showed that the total phosphorus content of fresh and starved plants remained stable, reflecting the nutritional status of the plants. The predominant acid-soluble phosphate fraction was larger in fresh than in starved plants.

Lehm. Rchb.) with plants from habitats with only a low risk of oxygen shortage (Senecio jacobaea L., Myosotis arvensis (L.) Hill.). Whilst the amounts of glucose, fructose and sucrose changed only slightly following hypoxia and peaked at a maximum approximately double that of the aerated control specimens, the fructan content increased fivefold to tenfold. In nearly all the plants studied, fructan became the main polysaccharide reserve. For example, the flooding-tolerant Senecio aquaticus accumulated the highest amount, in particular fructans with a degree of polymerization up to 35 compared with 10 under control conditions. Nearly 70% of the soluble carbohydrates were fructans, compared with 30% under aerated conditions. In all species tested the starch fraction marginally increased or remained constant. Fructans were found to accumulate as a response to oxygen deficiency in both flooding-tolerant and intolerant species but with higher absolute values and ratios between fructan and starch in the flooding-tolerant species. At 24 h after the onset of hypoxic treatment, the sugar content rose, in spite of the diminished photosynthetic rates. The ability to accumulate fructans seems to vary in plants coping with oxygen shortage but could be interpreted as advantageous in comparison to starch synthesis in terms of (i) the location of the fructan metabolism in the vacuoles, with no negative feedback in the photosynthetic apparatus and (ii) the possibility of storage of sucrose in the form of fructose polymers without the intermediate stages and energy-using processes which are indispensable for starch synthesis. These results might indicate that fructan metabolism could play a role in the tolerance of oxygen deficiency.","Flooding; Fructan; Myosotis palustris/M. arvensis; Oxygen deficiency; Senecio aquaticus/S. jacobaea",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031436481

The energy required for ovarian development was greater than the one for testes development. During the period of gonad growth, a decline in the nutrition stage of the adult fish as well as in the average somatic energy content of both in males and females was observed. Somatic energy content was linearly related to the condition (K) and nutrition (NS) indices. In mature fish, gonad energy content was correlated to the gonadosomatic index (GSI).

The cafeteria diet-obese rats were infused for 28 days (using miniosmotic pumps) with oleoyl-estrone in liposomes (Merlin-2) at a dose of 3.5 mmol/day kg. Treatment resulted in loss of body weight: 11.6% (32 g), mainly due to fat: 20.0% (8.8 g), protein 5.2% (2.0 g) and water, preventing further increases in body weight and fat storage. Untreated rats increased their body weight: 7.6% (20 g), lipid: 10.5% (4.2 g) and protein: 13.2% (4.8 g). Plasma glucose, urea, triacylglycerols and cholesterol practically did not change with treatment. Merlin-2 decreased energy intake (to 83. 7%) and energy output (to 87.7%, oxygen consumption). Decreases in nitrogen intake were partly compensated by higher digestive efficiency in treated rats. The size of the nitrogen gap was higher in treated rats than in controls. Essentially, protein balance was maintained and slimming was achieved with a minimal loss of body protein. Treated rats selected less carbohydrate, in particular sugars, in their diet than controls, but consumed practically the same protein and lipid. Treatment of cafeteria diet-fed rats with oleoylestrone in liposomes results in sustained loss of body weight-mainly lipid-for up to 28 days. Nitrogen balance is maintained overall. This is achieved through lower food intake-mainly of sugars-and less marked changes in energy output.","Body weight; Cafeteria diet; Energy balance; Nitrogen balance; Obesity; Oleoyl-estrone; Slimming","estrone; oleic acid; animal experiment; article; body composition; body weight; caloric intake; controlled study; dietary intake; drug effect; female; lipid storage; nitrogen balance; nonhuman; obesity; rat; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Body Weight; Diet; Drug Carriers; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Estrone; Female; Liposomes; Oleic Acids; Rats; Rats, Zucker; Animalia; Cafeteria; Falco columbarius",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031431453

The high concentration of ammonia interferes with oxidative metabolism in the brain through an inhibitory effect on the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Inhibition of the TCA cycle may result in depletion of ATP. Due to the involvement of astrocytes in brain detoxification of ammonia, these cells are good candidates for studying ammonia's effect on energy stores in the brain. C6-glioma cells, which have altered glycolytic rates, may show greater sensitivity to the toxicity of ammonium chloride than astrocytes. To study the effect of ammonium chloride on energy storage of both astrocytes and C6-glioma, we observed the acute and chronic effects of NH4Cl (7.5 or 15 mM) on the metabolism of isolated astrocytes and C6- glioma cells. Primary astrocytes were isolated from the cerebral hemispheres of 1-2 day old Sprague Dawley rats, and C6-glioma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Following treatment of the cells with ammonia, glucose, lactate, glutamate, ATP, and PCr were assayed. Our data showed that at 15 min following treatment with NH4Cl, there were no significant differences in the concentration of metabolites measured in astrocytes. However, following 15 min of treatment with NH4Cl, the concentration of some metabolites, for example, ATP and lactate, changed significantly in C6- glioma cells. We have shown that 24 h of treatment was sufficient time to see significant biochemical changes but not morphological changes in either cell type. Simultaneous biochemical and morphological changes were observed 48 h following treatment in C6-glioma cells and at 9-10 days following treatment in primary astrocytes. In primary astrocytes at 24 h following treatment, glucose utilization increased. This high utilization of glucose was in accordance with the increase in lactate and glutamate production and the decrease in ATP and PCr formation. In C6-glioma cells the utilization of glucose increased but this high utilization of glucose was consistent with a significant decrease in the concentration of lactate, glutamate and ATP.","Ammonia; Astrocytes; C6-glioma cells; Energy metabolism; Glucose metabolism; Hepatic encephalopathy","adenosine triphosphate; ammonium chloride; creatine phosphate; glucose; glutamic acid; lactic acid; animal cell; animal tissue; article; astrocyte; cell metabolism; energy metabolism; fetus; glioma cell; glucose utilization; hepatic encephalopathy; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; rat; Adenosine Triphosphate; Ammonium Chloride; Animals; Astrocytes; Energy Metabolism; Glioma; Glucose; Rats; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031431084

Surface engineering, which is concerned with all aspects of engineering related to the modification of surface properties of the components, is the ideal solution to combat hot corrosion effectively and prolong the life of the components to their designed life. Therefore, surface engineering must now be considered as an integral part of the energy components, providing both their environmental resistance and the development of appropriate strength capabilities for the base material. This paper is concerned with the problems faced by many energy systems, in particular gas turbines, and the improvements in the surface property of hot-corrosion resistance by a variety of surface-modification techniques. Different surface coatings and their processes related to gas turbines are surveyed and brief mention is made of other systems. To achieve optimum properties for a given energy-system environment, the combination of diffusion and overlay coatings to a suitable thickness can offer significant advantages. The paper also reviews some different techniques currently available for the evaluation of materials and coatings for hot-corrosion resistance. It also covers the advantages and disadvantages each technique, and the importance of electrochemical techniques. Further, the work carried out at the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory relating to hotcorrosion activity, the recent results obtained with CM 247 LC superalloy, and the surface coatings developed for hot-corrosion resistance are also reviewed. Finally, a best suitable coating pattern is suggested for the efficient and effective functioning of gas-turbine engines, which in turn enhances their operational life.",,"Diffusion; Gas turbines; Protective coatings; Service life; Surface properties; Surface treatment; Hot corrosion resistance; Surface engineering; Corrosion resistance; corrosion resistance; gas turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031430484

The forthcoming millennium will set new demands for more energy production at lower cost and reduced environmental impact. Ecological problems have become more severe primarily because of steadily increasing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning plants, including those used for power production, transport, and industry. The ultimate global warming effect can cause dangerous climatic changes on Earth. Steadily increasing emissions of other atmospheric pollutants such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides are also very damaging to the environment. Therefore reduction of all emissions from the energy sector is of the utmost importance. These concerns create new challenges in the area of energy technology. The existing power production technology cannot fulfill these requirements in the most sensitive areas of efficiency and pollutant emissions. At present, energy technology is marked by tremendous efforts aimed at achieving higher efficiencies in energy conversion with reduced environmental impact and at lower costs. Therefore advanced energy systems that have been developed in the last decades become mature contenders to the conventional energy technology based predominantly on coal-fired central steam power stations. Although conventional energy technologies have been consistently improving in terms of efficiency, economics, and reduction of environmental impact in the last decade, modern power stations have achieved the ultimate degree of intrinsically limited efficiency. Further improvements are possible only by revolutionary changes of the energy technology. The 21st century will drastically change energy production and will become the era of more efficient combined power plants. The development trends are directed at the changeover from basically steam power technology to combined-cycle power based on such plants as gas turbines, fuel cells, MHD generators, as well as the advanced energy systems based on the utilization of renewable energy sources. The book deals with all those advanced energy systems that have reached a sufficiently mature state of development to conform to the requirement for commercial application before the end of this century. These are predominantly combined-cycle gas turbine and steam turbine power plants, various improved gas turbine configurations, second- and third-generation gas turbines with intercooling, reheat, water/steam injection, air-conditioning, etc., coal-based low-emission power systems such as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and fluidized bed combustion (including second-generation pressurized bed combustion, i.e., PFBC), means of reduction of environmental impact of energy systems, low-emission combustors and furnaces, advanced cogeneration plants, advanced solar and wind systems, as well as advanced energy storage systems.",,"energy; fluidized bed; gas turbine; pollution; power supply",Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031430298

The concept of the system is presented in detail together with the investigations carried out, including a brief outline of modeling, optical experiments on PCM samples and long-term experiments on a prototype wall as well as numerical simulations. The results indicate a promising thermal-optical behavior of the system. For instance in a Swiss lowland climate (Zurich-airport) a mean energy flux of 13 W m-2 (system efficiency 0.27) was calculated through a south facing TIM-PCM wall into the building during the month with the lowest irradiation (December). The parameters of the prototype wall with a mean melting temperature of the PCM of 26.5°C were assumed. When considering the percentage of time in which the building does not lose energy through the south facing TIM-PCM wall, a maximum can be reached with a mean melting temperature of approximately 20 to 21°C. In this case energy losses through the facade occur only during 1% of the time.

Oxidation of chalcopyrite may take place due to various factors, e.g., geological environment, mining/comminution, and storage. In this work oxidation of chalcopyrite has been investigated through interfacial electrokinetics. The characteristics of samples obtained from different geological locations as well as the effects of ageing and laboratory oxidation have been delineated. Variation of the solid-liquid ratio was found to have a significant effect on the zeta-potential characteristics of chalcopyrite. The role of constituent metal ions, namely copper and iron, has been studied in the absence and presence of externally added metal ions. The results indicated that the ratio of Cu/Fe on the surface of oxidized chalcopyrite determines the Stern layer potential and under appropriate solution chemistry conditions influences charge reversals. The mineral surfaces, thus, could be either copper-rich or iron-rich as reflected by a shift in pH(iep)(s). The observed charge reversals have been explained on the basis of a model proposed by James and Healy.","Chalcopyrite; Electrokinetics; Metal ions; Oxidation","chalcopyrite; copper; iron; metal ion; mineral; oxygen; unclassified drug; water; article; electrophoretic mobility; energy; kinetics; oxidation; priority journal; spectroscopy; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031426210

Seasonal variations in the formation of white spots and the influence of shrimp size, production time, chemical treatment, and storage temperature on white spot formation was determined. A significant effect (P = 0.003) of day of catch was observed and shrimps caught in the summer period showed a greater tendency of white spot formation than shrimps caught during the rest of the year. Treatment in a sulphite, a phosphate or a phthalate solution prior to freezing retards calcium carbonate crystallisation (P &lt; 0.05) while treatment in a borax solution promotes crystallisation (P &lt; 0-05). Prolonged time from catch to chemical treatment and increased storage time increase the risk of white spot formation. Storage temperature has a significant effect on white spot formation for which process the rate at different temperatures was described by the Arrhenius equation with a high energy of activation of 90 kJ mol-1. The size (age) of the shrimps did not influence white spot formation (P = 0-69).

The importance of plutonium as a source of energy can easily be understood by a simple fact that the amount of energy produced from one gram of plutonium is equal to the energy produced from 100 g of uranium and/or one ton of oil. Plutonium poses little or no problem as a high level waste. This can be predicted from our earlier studies on Th in man which has indicated that the general population of the United States exposed to insoluble Th throughout the life times accumulates the amount of Th contained in 1-6 g of soil. Furthermore, the vitrification process can prevent the translocation of Pu into the environment from the waste storage site quite effectively. Plutonium is a great asset to the human race only if they are civilized and use this great element for their prosperity as a source of energy. However, if the people and/or their leaders become barbaric, inhumane, crazy and misguided, then Pu could be the greatest threat to the survival of human race. Therefore, man himself could become the greatest threat to the human race.",,"oil; plutonium; plutonium 239; plutonium 240; uranium; conference paper; energy resource; environmental exposure; environmental radioactivity; nuclear energy; radioactive waste disposal; united states",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031407144

The illumination of an azo-containing LC bulk with polarized light is found to induce both stable (in time and temperature) high-resolution alignment onto the rigid surface and dynamic sliding of the director over the surface. Typical times of the director sliding over the aligning surface are of the order of 1 ms. Both effects are characterized by extremely small light intensities (as low as 10-1 J/cm2) and seem to be very promising for the development of optical devices for information processing and high density information storage. Light-induced surface memory effects are also observed in these systems as a consequence of induced anchoring of the molecular director. This technique has been applied to record both stationary and dynamic holograms with a spatial resolution of 7 μm. The surface memory effects have been applied to record both binary and gray scale images. As compared to other methods used in these materials the highest sensitivity and spatial resolution can be achieved: energy densities as low as 10-1 J/cm2 were sufficient to write gratings with a resolution better than 100 lines/mm.","Aligning surface; Anchoring of the molecular director; Surface memory effect","Crystal orientation; Doping (additives); Dyes; Holograms; Light polarization; Shape memory effect; Photoregulation; Liquid crystals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031391987

In many of these programs, the price of electricity changes on an hourly basis to reflect the projected cost of providing electricity to the consumer during that hour. Real-time pricing of electricity will become more prevalent in the future as competitive spot markets or power exchanges for electricity are developed. Real-time pricing can provide industrial energy consumers with new opportunities to reduce energy costs. Under real-time pricing, it may prove cost-effective to reschedule operations from high-price periods to low-price periods, reschedule maintenance activities, or endure voluntary curtailments in electricity service during high price periods. Investments in standby generation, energy storage devices, and control systems may prove attractive. Successfully exploiting this option requires the development of an effective strategy for responding to changing electricity prices. A number of reports and guides have been prepared under the sponsorship of the electric utility industry to assist utilities and regulators in designing effective real-time pricing tariffs. Yet, industrial energy consumers wishing to exploit real-time pricing have been provided little guidance. This paper examines the potential benefits and costs of real-time pricing programs from the perspective of industrial energy consumers in hopes of filling some of this gap. This paper outlines how industrial energy consumers can develop effective energy cost reduction strategies to take advantage of real-time pricing programs. Typical pricing algorithms and program design features are first described. Common measures and operating strategies for energy cost reduction under real-time pricing are discussed. Practical advice is provided to assist energy managers in analyzing cost reduction opportunities from real-time pricing programs.",,"Algorithms; Cost effectiveness; Electric rates; Electric utilities; Energy management; Real time systems; Strategic planning; Real time pricing tariffs; Energy conservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031389639

A program was established with the aim of reducing dust emissions from this plant to acceptable levels as specified by the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Energy (MOEE). Emission rates were determined through measurements and/or calculated with the use of emission factors. Initial measurements included extensive stack tests and determination of road silt loadings. AP-42 and other emission factors were used to determine emissions from handling, wind erosion and road emissions, requiring the measurement of other parameters such as material moisture. The MOEE's air dispersion model was run to determine dust concentrations at the receptors adjacent to this plant. It was determined that controls were required on a number of sources, and an iterative process was undertaken to determine predominant sources and control effectiveness. Wind tunnel tests were conducted on various storage piles to determine the potential effectiveness of surface compacting. Dust suppressants were recommended and applied to the roads and piles. Operational controls, including rerouting traffic, paving roads, and limiting and/or relocating certain operations, were established. In the end, compliance with the 100 ug/m3 Ontario 1/2-hour point-of-impingement total suspended particulate standard was shown to be achievable at this plant.

Several possible ways of applying the ice storage cooling source are described. By using the proposed methodology, a case study via computer simulation is conducted. In this simulation, the validity criterion is so chosen that the improvement to the chiller system would be economically equivalent to increase a chiller efficiency from 0.55 kW/ton to 0.47 kW/ton. A discussion of the simulation results is given. Under the assumed working conditions, to apply the cooling resources to the condensation process or to the liquid line sub-cooling is difficult to be economically feasible. The only better way to use the cooling resource is to cool the chilled water directly.

The verification methods are discussed and the results of analysis and testing accomplished to date are summarized. Single panel thermal and modal tests have been conducted. Ambient deployment testing and thermal vacuum deployment/thermal performance tests have also been successfully conducted. Additional testing planned include a repeat of the single panel thermal vacuum test for the silver Teflon coating, a stowed acoustic test, a qualification test of the heater system and an acoustic and modal test of three of the units installed on the Flight 4A launch package.

These loads often utilize supply chilled-water temperatures in the range of 34°F (1.1°C) to 36°F (2.2°C). The low water temperatures can be supplied from conventional 'on-demand' chillers, such as falling film water chillers or shell-and-tube chillers using a brine solution. The low water temperatures can also be supplied from thermal energy storage (TES) systems, such as static ice builders, or dynamic ice systems, such as an ice harvester or slurry ice maker. The benefits of using a TES system in industrial processes, versus an 'on-demand' chiller, include smaller refrigeration equipment, 'reserve' cooling capacity, lower electrical capacity requirements, and lower energy costs. This paper outlines a unique type of dynamic slurry ice system applied to a cheese processing plant. Dynamic ice systems separate the manufacture of ice from the storage of ice. These systems are capable of satisfying very large loads of short duration by rapidly melting stored ice. Rapid melting of ice is achievable with dynamic ice-type TES systems because the warm water returning from the load comes in direct contact with the ice in storage.",,"Cooling; Ice; Temperature; Thermal load; Chillers; Thermal energy storage; Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031387456

Discussed in this paper is a comparison of three basic resonant dc-dc converter circuits when used as the converter with such a capacitor bank. Simple equivalent circuits are developed for each converter using a single frequency approximation of the various converter waveforms.

A SEA model of a linear elastic vibration isolation mount is developed here which enables SEA analysis of elastically isolated systems for the first time. A vibration isolation mount model has been absent from SEA models because of the lack of an SEA formulation. Linear elastic vibration isolation mount SEA equations are developed here for the first time. The basis of SEA theory is energy sharing among vibrational mode groups. Traditionally, vibration isolation mounts were thought of as compliant elements with no modes suitable to SEA analysis. An example mount is defined and the number of energy storage modes computed. The results show that a linear elastic vibration isolation mount should be modeled in SEA analysis and provide the equations for a SEA isolation mount model.

An alternative to this approach is to design MEMS with integral microscopic distributed power supplies. This paper examines the feasibility of creating micro power supplies by considering three functions common to MEMS power systems: 1) capture energy; 2) store energy; and 3) drive actuation. Of these, only the capture energy function is highly dependent on the specific application. For each of the three functions, a table is presented which compares various means of performing the function. This information makes it possible to determine what design alternatives are feasible for the creation of a micro power supply for any specific application of MEMS. We use smart bearings with active surface features as an example application and develop a design for a micro power supply suitable for this work.

This paper discusses an operational triggered vacuum switch which holds off voltages to 20 kV for several minutes duration. It can be triggered reliably over a range from 2 kV to 20 kV, discharges at peak current as high as 1 MA, and operates with a charge transfer of up to 50 coulombs for hundreds of discharges without requiring maintenance. Triggering is accomplished by irradiating a dielectric flash-over surface from a low voltage (2-5 kV) spark source. Triggering delay is less than 600 ns at 10 kV or higher. The switch design is derived from an earlier high power vacuum flash-over switch prototype originally developed as a 40-kV isolation switch within a closed vacuum inductive energy store. Modifications include re-design of the flash-over dielectric to serve both as a vacuum enclosure and discharge cable support, reduction of the number of vacuum to atmospheric interface surfaces to improve sealing, use of aluminum electrodes with ceramic lining to reduce size and weight while minimizing conductor erosion during discharge, and designing small expendable electrode inserts for simple, low cost replacement.

Existing analytical models have been modified to incorporate piezo-actuation in anisotropic and 3-layered thin plates, using the variational energy method. The 3-layered sandwich consists of anisotropic face- plates with surface bonded piezo-electric actuators, and a viscoelastic core. The analysis includes the membrane and transverse energies in the face plates, and shear in the viscoelastic core. A constant, complex shear modulus was used for the dissipative core, thus frequency and temperature dependence of viscoelastic properties is neglected in this model. Simplified forms of the equations are stated based on neglecting shear in face-plates. Experiments were conducted on sandwich plates with aluminum face-plates under clamped boundary conditions to validate the simplified model. Symmetric and asymmetric sandwiches were tested. The maximum error in the first eight natural frequency predictions obtained via the assumed modes solution is less than 10%. Analytical studies on the influence of the number of assumed modes in the Galerkin approximation, and the core storage modulus variation, were conducted. The importance of the in- plane extension modes in sandwich plate analysis was demonstrated.

Water heater stocks and typical hot water needs to be taken into account are generally well defined at a certain stage of DSM studies. The remaining problem is to take into account real operating conditions to determine power demand and energy consumption. This study provides elements with which to answer the following questions: How are the intrinsic parameters of a water heater linked to global consumption or peak demand? How to compute field standby losses, which are generally far from laboratory test measurements? How much energy and peak demand can be transferred through night/day control? How does this influence overall energy consumption of ESWH? A model has been developed to perform simulations. Influential parameters have been tested to produce practical correlations.

SimSET (Simulation System for Emission Tomography), which previously modeled only photoelectric absorption and Compton scatter, has been extended to include coherent scatter. The current implementation uses form factor and anomalous scattering amplitude data from the Livermore Evaluated Photon Data Library. Interaction probability and angular distribution tables for several human tissues and common detector materials were calculated using the independent atoms approximation and human-tissue composition data from the ICRP Reference Man. These data were also used to generate new tables for photoelectric absorption and Compton scatter, significantly improving the accuracy of SimSET and extending its photon tracking capability to lower photon energy (from 50 keV to 1 keV). The form, content, and structure of the tables were carefully designed for efficient data storage, access, and use by the software.

Heat transfer with melting and freezing of PCM in a capsule is quite complicated because of two heat transfer modes occurring within a capsule, i.e. one is close-contact melting mode between PCM and capsule material, and another is natural convection heat transfer in melt pool under or above the solid PCM. Owing to this complicated nature, there has been reported no detailed analysis up to date. In comparison with the cylindrical capsule type unit, the spherical capsule unit has a great advantage from the viewpoint of the thermal performance and care of installation. In this article, we will present a mathematical formulation and the numerical results on the transient melting (charging) heat transfer in a spherical heat storage capsule under inner wall temperature distribution. In recent years, efforts have been devoted to clarify the mechanism of close-contact heat transfer for a single enclosure with various shapes. However, there is no theoretically exact numerical simulation considering both close-contact and natural convection melting processes within a spherical capsule. Three years ago, the world largest district heating and cooling (DHC) system was opened in Yokohama, near Tokyo, in which about six million spherical ice balls (diameter: 80mm) were installed in two vertical storage tanks with height of 28 meters. The results of the present analysis can be effectively applicable to the practical plant for a thermal design.",,"Energy storage; Mathematical models; Melting; Natural convection; Numerical analysis; Temperature distribution; Close contact melting; Natural convection melting; Thermal energy storage spherical capsule; Heat transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031365209

Mainly companies and inventors participated in the competitions with no other universities except for a few in Japan. The same situation existed in 1993. In 1994, initiated by Marquette through the Solar Energy Division of ASME, the world's first international intercollegiate solar boat regatta was held in Milwaukee, named Solar Splash and attracted ten universities from the U.S. and Japan. Solar Splash has been held annually in Milwaukee since 1994 with about sixteen universities now participating in the two-hour endurance races and the 300 m sprints. The rules for the maximum 6 m long boats allow for 480 watts of solar collectors and 1000 watt-hrs of battery storage such that in the two-hour endurance race, approximately 50 percent of the power is from solar directly and the other 50 percent from stored solar energy. Marquette also has continued to race in Japan every year since 1992 and has been the only team from outside of Japan to compete.

This paper describes the design and verification of a dual-volume 60 K TSU, which uses nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) as the working fluid. The dual-volume design divides the TSU into a cryogenic temperature heat exchanger volume and an ambient temperature storage volume. This approach increases TSU energy storage capacity and thermal stability while reducing total weight and volume. The TSU heat exchanger has a beryllium shell to ensure CTE compatibility with beryllium focal planes. The heat exchanger core is constructed of a 40 ppi, 6101 aluminum foam, compressed to 35% relative density. Developmental testing has shown that the aluminum foam core, which is vacuum furnace brazed to the beryllium end-caps, tends to suppress NF3 single-phase supercooling. Also, by virtue of its slight capillary wicking capability, the foam core eliminates concerns over heat exchanger filling in 0-g. The TSU will be tested on-orbit in a Hitchhiker GAS Canister flight experiment (designated as CRYOTSU) on the STS is late-1998. In this flight experiment, the TSU storage tank will be made of thin-walled stainless steel and the system will be pressurized to less than 100 psi to minimize safety concerns.",,"Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Nitrogen compounds; Thermal expansion; Thermodynamic stability; Nitrogen trifluoride; Thermal storage unit (TSU); Cryogenic equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031364767

The effective capacitance of metallic interfaces depends on the ratio between the apparent contact area (which is optically determined) and the effective contact area (which injects the electronic charges). Silver contacts having series resistance values significantly less than the contact resistance were subjected to a.c. high current densities (up to 500 A/mm2). The obtained i(t) and v(t) profiles were further analyzed to obtain I-V curves. Due to the phase shift between i(t) &amp; v(t) profiles the I-V curve within a single period of the stimulating current will produce a closed loop. The area of the loop determines the interfacial electrical energy. According to the obtained results the electrical energy storage at a given metal contact, increases at: a) higher ampacity values, b) lower operating temperatures and c) higher clamping forces between the joints (elastic deformation regime) each of the above parameters acting independently. The experimental results were obtained for AgSnO2 and OFHC contacts operated in a wide temperature range, varying between -130 °C and +40 °C. The observed response of the electrical contacts is mainly characterized by the implications of the asperity contact model and dominating charge transport processes across the metallic interfaces. When standard simple equivalent circuits are used to determine contact impedance, the effective capacitance of current carrying metal contacts acquires exceptionally high values.",,"Capacitance; Charge transfer; Current density; Current voltage characteristics; Electric impedance; Equivalent circuits; Interfaces (materials); Interfacial energy; Silver; Thermal effects; Apparent contact areas; Effective contact areas; Electric contacts",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031359763

Li-polymer batteries possess some definite advantages over Ag/ZnO batteries: namely, an increase in energy density while retaining a similar specific energy, a reduction in the amount of liquid electrolyte, and a greatly extended `wet' shelf life. This combination of factors makes the Li-polymer battery a very attractive energy storage medium. In addition, Li-polymer batteries can be recharged if needed; in fact, 1.1 Ah test cell packs fabricated for this Air Force program have been cycled more than 10 times. Thus, if a launch needs to be scrubbed for any reason after the batteries have been partially or fully discharged, they need not be replaced. In an effort to address space power systems concerns, Phillips Laboratory has contracted with SAFT America and Binrad Industries, Inc. to develop a 150 Ah Li-polymer cell with a specific energy of 150 Wh/kg and a power density of 100 W/kg.

Products such as Personal Digital Assistants, pagers with integrated data services, and smart phones have fixed performance requirements but unlimited appetites for reduced cost and increased battery life. Program compression is one technique that can be used to attack both of these problems. Compressed programs require less memory, thus reducing the cost of both direct materials and manufacturing. Furthermore, by relying on compressed memory, the total number of memory references is reduced. This reduction saves power by lowering the traffic on high capacitance buses. This paper will discuss a new approach to implementing transparent program compression that requires little or no hardware support. Procedures are compressed individually, and a directory structure is used to bind them together at runtime. Decompressed procedures are explicitly cached in ordinary RAM as complete units, thus resolving references within each procedure. This approach has been evaluated on a set of 25 embedded multimedia and communications applications, and results in an average memory reduction of 40% with a runtime performance overhead of 10%.",,"Buffer storage; Computer architecture; Congestion control (communication); Energy utilization; Random access storage; Response time (computer systems); Subroutines; Procedure based program compression; Data compression",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031353221

A realistic geometry that closely approximates the Decade Module 1 (DM1) was used in conjunction with a switch opening model to simulate power-flow in an inductive energy store pulsed-power system. Several assumptions were made concerning the emission of ions from the high density POS plasma (n to approximately 1015 cm-3) and the downstream anode, as well as, the distribution of plasma in the POS-to-load region to assess the role of ion space-charge on the delivery of energy to the diode load. It is found that ion emission from the POS plasma allows a low density plasma (n to approximately 1012 cm-3) to propagate down the transmission line between the POS and load at about 1 cm/ns. The simulations also show that a large fraction of the current arrives at the load coincidentally with the arrival of this low density plasma. However, the load currents predicted from simulations are too low to explain the measured radiation on DM1. When ion emission is allowed from the anode between the POS and load, additional electron current can propagate along the anode and into the load. When plasma is placed in the POS-to-load region it is found that current transfer is enhanced by the presence of ion space-charge in the POS-to-load region. The enhancement is evident only in regions where the plasma density is highest and goes away as plasma ions are removed.",,"Anodes; Computer simulation; Electric currents; Electric energy storage; Electric lines; Electric power systems; Electric space charge; Mathematical models; Plasma density; Plasma diodes; Vacuum technology; Inductive energy store pulsed power systems; Particle in cell (PIC) simulations; Plasma opening switches (POS); Electric switches",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031348694

A design-oriented temperature distribution model for vertically stratified thermal storages that facilitates the evaluation of storage energy and exergy contents is utilized.

A wide range of realistic storage-fluid temperature profiles is considered, and for each the relative increase in exergy content of the stratified storage compared to the same storage when it is fully mixed is evaluated. The results indicate that, for all temperature profiles considered, the exergy storage capacity of a thermal storage increases when it is stratified, and increases as the degree of stratification, as represented through greater and sharper spatial temperature variations, increases. Furthermore, the percentage increase in exergy capacity is greatest for storages at temperatures near to the environment temperature, and decreases as the mean storage temperature diverges from the environment temperature (to either higher or lower temperatures).

These simulations employed existing UAV experimental data and associated weight and power algorithms, state-of-the-art propulsion and energy storage conversion efficiencies, and a range of PV cell efficiencies and array mass-densities. It was found that for a given payload weight and set of flight conditions, both the weight and size (wing-span) of the UAV are not only dependent on PV cell performance, but to an even greater extent, on the performance of energy storage systems. The primary intent of conducting the simulations was to provide insight into the remaining power system deficiencies that currently limit solar-powered UAVs. It was concluded that an energy storage specific energy (total system) of 250-500 Whr/kg is required to enable most useful missions, and that PV cells with efficiencies greater than approximately 12% are suitable for use in lower latitudes. Improve PV cell efficiencies can work to extend the operating regime to more northerly climes.

To solve these power quality problems, a highly reliable, low-cost battery solution, the AC Battery PQ2000, developed with Department of Energy and Sandia National Laboratories assistance, is now available to eliminate these short duration power quality problems. Incorporated in this system is a communications interface which allows remote access over the telephone network using RS-232 protocol. The system is designed for standalone function without an operator present; however, because of the limited experience of utilities in the use of this type of battery energy storage system, capabilities have been incorporated to allow for datalogging and remote system control of the unit.

These caches are typically implemented with static RAM cells and often occupy a large portion of the chip area. Not surprisingly, these caches often consume a significant amount of power. In many applications, such as portable devices, low power is more important than performance. We propose to trade performance for power consumption by filtering cache references through an unusually small L1 cache. An L2 cache, which is similar in size and structure to a typical L1 cache, is positioned behind the filter cache and serves to reduce the performance loss. Experimental results across a wide range of embedded applications show that the filter cache results in improved memory system energy efficiency. For example, a direct mapped 256-byte filter cache achieves a 58% power reduction while reducing performance by 21%, corresponding to a 51% reduction in the energy-delay product over a conventional design.",,"Filter caches; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Microprocessor chips; Random access storage; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031336708

This study gives an approximation of the amount of control that can be exerted passively over a mass system of fluid. By using cylinders of various sizes and shapes that are coated with various substances, in various patterns, containers along with baffles, a demonstration of the force of attraction between fluid and coating can be observed. The properties studied in this experiment are of great use to the aerospace industry. The control of fluids in a microgravity environment is of major concern to any space project. In the case of a rocket or similar launch vehicle, the fuel of the spacecraft can make up to 70 percent of the weight. If this fluid were to start oscillating, the results would be catastrophic. If the fluid, drifted away from the side of the fuel tank that the fuel need to be drawn from while in orbit, the spacecraft would have no way of using the fuel. Life support systems can also benefit from this technology. Water must be stored aboard just like fuel. In fact, the storage of water might be considered even more crucial because it is carried throughout the entire flight, where fuel is usually spent in the initial stages of the flight. Water and other life supporting fluids are a direct necessity for astronauts and cosmonauts and must be readily available.

However, as well known, processing in the nanometer range with laser radiation is not possible by lenses or mirrors due to diffraction limitation. Resent research work has shown, that ""focusing"" of laser radiation down to a few nanometer can be obtained by using lasers in combination with nearfield technology (e.g. SNOM - Scanning Nearfield Optical Microscopy, SPM - Scanning Probe Microscopy). Lateral externally illumination of SPM probe tips with laser radiation can cause tremendous intensity enhancement in the nearfield underneath the tip. A brief theoretical consideration of this effect and results of calculations based on boundary element method (BEM) is done. This kind of field energy concentration we named FOLANT-technique (FOcusing of LAserradiation in the Nearfield of a Tip). The interaction area with nanometer scale can be applied for material processing even down to atomic dimensions. Using FOLANT-technique hillocks, pits and grooves with lateral dimensions down to 10 nm have been obtained on conductive substrates as well as on dielectric materials (for example polycarbonate). Our experiments have shown, that FOLANT-technique is a promising tool for various applications in nanometer material processing.","Laser material processing; Nanostructuring; Near field optics; Scanning probe technology","Boundary element method; Data storage equipment; Dielectric materials; Electromagnetic wave diffraction; Laser beam effects; Machining; Microelectronics; Near field scanning optical microscopy; Robotics; X ray optics; Scanning probe microscopy; Nanotechnology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031310714

LM-CL was low in fresh blood and disappeared after it storage for 3 hours. LC-CL was already high in fresh blood and was steadily increasing with blood storage. Serial dilution of blood with saline after addition of chemiluminescence indicators resulted in elevation of LM-CL, but decrease in LC-CL. LM-CL elevation after the initiation of respiratory burst (RB) in blood with zymosan was observed only in aerated samples and immediately dropped down when air supply to a blood sample was ceased. On the contrary, LM-CL did not depend on air supply to a blood sample for about 30 min. after RB initiation. The results suggest that there are at least two mechanisms for reactive oxygen species production in nondiluted blood. The first one is reflected predominantly by LMCL. It is activated during RB and uses prevalently oxygen dissolved in cell medium. Another one is reflected predominantly by LC-LM.

In order to determine the absolute incoming photon flux at the calibration facility a High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector and an identical spare detector have been choosen as flux monitor of the HRMA X-ray Detection System (HXDS). The detectors must thus be calibrated in the photon energy range between 700 eV and 10 keV. The calibration and characterization of the detectors was performed at the radiometry laboratory of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) at the electron storage ring BESSY. Two methods have been applied for the determination of the detection efficiency. Firstly, the undispersed calculable synchrotron radiation emitted by a bending magnet of the primary source standard BESSY has been used. Secondly, the detection efficiency has been determined using monochromatized radiation and Si photodiodes as transfer detector standards. The photodiodes have been calibrated with a relative uncertainty of 0.5% in the photon energy range from 50 eV to 1500 eV against a cryogenic electrical substitution radiometer which is a primary detector standard. It will be shown that the determination of the detection efficiency in the whole desired spectral range is possible with a relative uncertainty between 1% and 2%, even in the photon energy range where the detection efficiency is affected by the x-ray absorption finestructures of the Al light blocking filter of the detector.","Detector calibration; HPGe detector; Primary radiometric standards; Soft X-ray; Synchrotron radiation","Astrophysics; Photodiodes; Photons; Radiometers; Synchrotron radiation; X ray analysis; High resolution mirror assembly (HRMA); Mirrors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031289025

The implementation of fluorescence lifetime measurements in flow cytometric systems allows to monitor large cell and particle populations with high statistical significance. In our system, a modulated laser beam (by acousto-optical modulation) is used for excitation and the phase shift of the fluorescence signal recorded with a fast computer controlled digital oscilloscope (up to 1 GHz) is processed digitally to determine the phase shift with respect to a reference beam by fast fourier transform. Total fluorescence intensity (peak and area) as well as other parameters can be determined simultaneously from the same fluorescence signal. We use the epi-illumination design to allow the use of high numerical apertures (up to N.A. = 1.25) to collect as much light as possible to ensure detection of even weak fluorescence. Data storage and processing is done comparable to slit-scan flow cytometric data using our Data Analysis System (DAS V4.36).

This paper presents an augmented network architecture with a new form of interconnection between neurons giving a more general energy function containing both discrete and continuous terms. A comprehensive cost function for the unit commitment problem is developed and mapped to this energy function. Results show that this technique outperforms previous neural network methods.

The research was carried out at the BLNE5A bending magnet beam line of the Tristan Accumulation Ring in KEK, Japan. An acrylic cylindrical phantom of 20mm diameter containing a cross-shaped channel was imaged. The channel was filled with a diluted iodine solution with a concentration of 200 /ugl/ml.

By measuring the electrical characteristics of memory cells and MOS capacitors, a close relationship was found between the memory cell data retention and Stress Induced Leakage Current (SILC). Lowering the phosphorus density in the FG suppresses SILCand prolongs the data retention. Applying amorphous Si (a-Si) to the FG, in addition, is also found to improve SILC. Thus, the memory cell data retention characteristics is expected to be improved when a-Si is applied to the FG. This a-Si FG advantage is investigated by C-V characteristics, SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy) and EDX (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy) analysis. In spite of the high impurity activation ratio, the phosphorus concentration at the FG/tunnel oxide interface was confirmed to be lower for the a-Si FG than for the poly-Si FG. Applying a-Si therefore, is confirmed to have the same effect as lowering the phosphorus concentration in the FG but preventing the gate depletion effect. This attractive phenomenon for a-Si may be resulting from the lower phosphorus diffusion along the grain boundary. a-Si therefore will be considered as the promising material for high reliability FLASH memories.","Amorphous Si (a-Si); FLASH; Floating gate; Gate oxide; Poly-Si; Reliability; Retention","Amorphous silicon; Capacitors; Cellular arrays; Composition effects; Gates (transistor); Interfaces (materials); Leakage currents; MOS devices; Phosphorus; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Silica; X ray spectroscopy; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy (EDX); Floating gates; Memory cell data retention; Data storage equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031250452

The design concept of the wet systems is to realize a low bouncing height of sliders by using the meniscus attractive force of the lubricant between slider and disk. The lubricant offered high wear performance at the same time. It was found that lubricants with high surface energies suppressed the bouncing height of contact sliders. A bouncing height of 3 nm was achieved for a combination of 30 % contact sliders and lubricants of maleic anhydride modified polybutene. A contact slider design, with a meniscuscontrolled contact pad, is proposed for contact sliders using wet systems. The bouncing of the slider was suppressed by regulating the etching depth of the meniscus-controlled contact pad. High wear performance of the in-contact recording system was confirmed by both the drag test for disks and the seek test for heads.

This allows the entire SMES facility to be placed in a high density environment where both personnel and equipment can be located closer to the magnet. In the past, this concept has been resisted due to the increased magnet cost for a large toroid over a solenoid storing an equivalent amount of energy. Preliminary studies have indicated that when the entire system cost is considered, the penalty may not be so excessive in systems storing a few MWh as is the case for applications like transmission stability and spinning reserve. The author is developing a cost model for the toroidal SMES system which will assist in selecting the optimum architecture, shape, and aspect ratio for toroidal coil modules which can be used for systems storing from 1 to 20 MWh. The global optimization model includes detailed magnetic, structural, and thermal considerations and provides cost analysis for all aspects of construction.

This paper presents an approach to schedule loads which do some storage of thermal or kinetic energy by use of an evolutionary strategy. The idea is to optimize the economic efficiency of power generation by scheduling appropriate parts of those loads in a way that they do consume energy when it is available at lower costs of generation and distribution. Since the evolutionary strategies themselves do not consider special cases, where the direction to search next in the search space is obvious a knowledge base is integrated into the evolutionary strategy.

This paper is aimed at developing the system design philosophies of electric and hybrid vehicle propulsion systems. The vehicles' dynamics are studied in an attempt to find an optimal torque-speed profile for the electric propulsion system. This study reveals that the vehicles' operational constraints such as initial acceleration and grade can be met with minimum power rating if the power train can be operated mostly in the constant power region. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the importance of the constant power operation. Operation of several candidate motors in the constant power region are also examined.

Soft switching is provided at the expense of a limited increase of the circuit complexity as compared to usual hard-switching solutions. A discussion of the soft commutation process is presented. By a proper switching sequence, overvoltages across the converter switches can fully be eliminated. Moreover, light-load operation can be achieved.

In particular, we discuss photo-induced effects in supramolecular assemblies containing azobenzene molecules (e.g. Langmuir-Blodgett-Kuhn structures and ultrathin silane layers). Reorientation of azobenzenes in these structures is compared to that observed in spin-cast films. Photoisomerization and photo-induced orientation of azobenzene molecules is studied at the molecular level by means of azosilane molecules chemisorbed on silicon oxide substrates. The study of the thermal back isomerization reaction of the azobenzene molecules in these layers reveals steric hindrance at the molecular level. These ultra-thin photochromic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) exhibit persistent dichroism upon linearly polarized light irradiation. This dichroism could be both written and erased by irradiation with light of an appropriate wavelength. In addition, the sign of this dichroism can be inverted by choosing the appropriate polarization of the irradiating light, thus showing a ""smart communication"" between the light polarization and the ultra-thin photochromic layers. Photoisomerization also induces reversible changes in the optical thickness of these molecularly thin SAMs. Langmuir- Blodgett-Kuhn (LBK) multilayer assemblies of ""hairy-rod"" polyglutamates with stiff main chains and flexible side chains containing photochromic azo units exhibit a highly optically anisotropic structure when the azo molecules are in the trans form, and a nearly optically isotropic structure when the azo molecules are in the cis form. The trans ⇔ cis photoisomerization of the azo molecules switches them between a highly oriented trans configuration and a bend cis configuration, thus turning the anisotropy ""on"" and ""off."" In contrast to spin-cast polymer films containing azobenzene units, photoselection under polarized light irradiation does not occur in these LBK structures. The study of the electronic density distribution of these films show that a remarkable variation in the LBK structures' stability comes with a seemingly small change in the side-chain structure. All the structures described here, form thin films that can be very sensitively characterized, by using surface plasmons and guided optical waves as electromagnetic modes bound to an interface. ©2005 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Langmuir-Blodgett-Kuhn multilayer assemblies; Photoisomerization and photo-induced orientation; Self assembled monolayers; Surface plasmons and guide; waves","Anisotropy; Azobenzene; Chemical reactions; Chemisorption; Dichroism; Electron energy levels; Film preparation; Irradiation; Isomerization; Light polarization; Light sensitive materials; Molecular orientation; Molecules; Multilayers; Optical data processing; Optical data storage; Optical materials; Photochromism; Photosensitivity; Plasmons; Polarization; Polymer films; Semiconducting silicon compounds; Silanes; Silica; Silicon compounds; Spin dynamics; Surfaces; Azobenzene molecules; Azobenzene units; Back isomerization; Cast (undoped) films; Chain structures; Data storage; Density distributions; Langmuir-Blodgett-Kuhn multilayer assemblies; Light irradiations; Main chains; Photoisomerization and photo-induced orientation; Side chains; Silane layers; Silicon oxide substrates; Surface plasmons and guide; waves; Self assembled monolayers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012207212

A new UHV cleaning process, which has to be environmentally and personnel safe, is needed to replace the harsh, unfriendly process which is still in use. Dow Advanced Cleaning Systems was contracted to develop a replacement process without the use of harsh chemicals and which must clean vacuum surfaces as well as the existing process. Acceptance of the replacement process was primarily based on photon stimulated desorption (PSD) measurements of beam tube samples run on NSLS beam line U10B. One meter long beam tube samples were fabricated from aluminum, 304 stainless steel, and oxygen-free copper. Initially, coupon samples were cleaned and passed preliminary testing for the proposed process. Next, beam tube samples of each material were cleaned, and the PSD measured on beam line U10B using white light with a critical energy of 487 eV. Prior to cleaning, the samples were contaminated with a mixture of cutting oils, lubricants, vacuum oils, and vacuum grease. The contaminated samples were then baked. Samples of each material were also cleaned with the existing process after the same preparation. Beam tube samples were exposed to between 1022and 1023 photons per meter for a PSD measurement. Desorption yields for H2, CO, CO 2, CH4, and H2O are reported for both the existing cleaning and for the replacement cleaning process.

SDM is a free form manufacturing process currently under development at Carnegie Mellon University, which consists of selective deposition and machining of layers allowing multi-material structures to be formed. One of the applications of SDM is to rapidly build electronic housings and simultaneously embed circuitry and electronics to form a rugged, compact system. Embedded electronics are specially suited for wearable computer applications, where stringent requirements in performance, functionality and custom application demand a multidisciplinary approach within a short design cycle. A new generation of wearable computers, named the Technical Information Assistant (TIA), is being currently designed, which incorporates speech recognition and simultaneous translation -all in a small envelope. The TIA displays a high power dissipation to external area ratio. Due to its working environment, a fully sealed housing is required. Furthermore, only natural convection and radiation serve as the external means for dissipating about 7 Watts with a maximum surface area of 300 cm2. It is therefore unfeasible to accomplish an adequate thermal design that will satisfy the electronic components reliability and the user's ergonomic requirements at steady state operation. Since battery life and field applications also limit the operation time of these wearable systems, this paper proposes transient thermal management of the TIA wearable computer using Phase Change Materials (PCMs) and enhanced heat conduction internal paths. PCMs provide a viable alternative for transient energy storage, delaying steady state operating conditions. Experimental measurements and numerical simulations are performed to investigate the performance of these PCMs under different geometric layouts using aluminum foam structures embedded in a polymer matrix manufactured with SDM. The effect of using PCMs with different melting temperatures is also investigated. These simulations predict the performance of the embedded systems and determine the time to reach limiting temperatures. It is shown that the PCM melting temperature has an important effect in increasing the time to reach the maximum allowable temperature at the surface of the wearable computer.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0006599249

The proposed SA-DWT can be used for object-oriented image coding. The number of coefficients after SA-DWT is identical to the number of pels contained in the arbitrarily shaped image objects. The locality property of wavelet transform and self-similarity among subbands are well preserved throughout this process.For a rectangular region, the SA-DWT is identical to a standard wavelet transform. With SA-DWT, conventional wavelet based coding schemes can be readily extended to the coding of arbitrarily shaped objects. The proposed shape adaptive wavelet transform is not unitary but the small energy increase is restricted at the boundary of objects in subbands. Two approaches of using the SA-DWT algorithm for object-oriented image and video coding are presented. One is to combine scalar SA-DWT with embedded zerotree wavelet (EZW) coding technique, the other is an extension of the normal vector wavelet coding (VWC) technique to arbitrarily shaped objects. Results of applying SA-VWC to real arbitrarily shaped texture coding are also given at the end of this paper.","Arbitrarily shaped object coding; Embedded zerotree wavelet coding; Object-oriented image coding; Shape-adaptive vector wavelet coding; Shape-adaptive wavelet transform; Shapeadaptive DCT; Vector wavelet coding","Clutches; Communication; Cosine transforms; Digital image storage; Discrete cosine transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image communication systems; Image processing; Imaging systems; Military photography; Motion compensation; Programming theory; Simulated annealing; Textures; Vectors; Visual communication; Wavelet transforms; Arbitrarily shaped object coding; Embedded zerotree wavelet coding; Object-oriented image coding; Shape-adaptive vector wavelet coding; Shape-adaptive wavelet transform; Shapeadaptive DCT; Image coding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005077844

In this paper, different Sb and In implantation conditions (various implant energies and doses) were used before BF2 and As HDD implant to study their effects on pMOS and nMOS characteristics, respectively, such as Lgmin (the gate length at Ioff=1nA/μm at Vg=0, |Vd|=1.5V), Idrive (drive current when |Vg|=|Vd|=1.5V), and diode leakage. These characteristics will also be compared with those obtained from devices without the pre-amorphization. TEOS 1st spacer in different thickness and various final RTA temperatures were also used to study their effect on the drive current. The key results are as follows. (1) A 4% improvement in Idrive(strong) (from 185μA/|μm to 193μÅ/μm; the drive current at Ioff=1nA/μm at supplying voltage of 1.5V and tox≈39A) and ∼0.02μ reduction in Lgmin (from ∼0.16μm to ∼0.14μm) were observed for the pMOS devices with Sb pre-amorphization when the same thickness of the 1 st spacer was used. These improvements are due to the formation of a more shallow and abrupt HDD when pre-amorphization is used. (2) With the requirement of Lgmin= ∼0.16μm, a p-channel I drive(strong)=211μA/μm at Lgmin= ∼0.16μm were obtained with a thin 1st spacer and with Sb pre-amorphization in this study. For the same Lgmin requirement, a thick 1st spacer (150Å thicker than the thin one) had to be used for a device without the pre-amorphization, which resulted in a higher Rsd and thus degraded the drive current to Idrive(strong)=185μA/μm. (3) The Sb implant conditions do not form an effective pocket implant doping for either case studied. A similar improvement in Lgmin is observed for different annealing temperatures studied. (4) In contrast to the L gminof a pMOS, the junction diode leakage is sensitive to the Sb implant condition. The diode leakage increases with Sb implant energy and dose. (5) Contrary to the Sb pre-amorphization cases, no significant improvement in either 1drive and Lgmin is observed in the nMOS devices with In pre-amorphization.","CMOS; Diode leakage; Pre-amorphization; Shallow junction","Annealing temperatures; CMOS; Cmos technologies; Diode leakage; Drive currents; Gate lengths; Implant energies; Implantation conditions; Junction diodes; Pocket implants; Pre-amorphization; RTA temperatures; Shallow junction; Source/drain extensions; Antimony; CMOS integrated circuits; Diodes; Directional drilling; Hard disk storage; Technology; Theorem proving; Amorphization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004637479

Physical experiments are performed to determine appropriate boundary conditions and to validate Spectral Element numerical simulations. These studies show the need of transient thermal management to comply with the performance goals for the wearable system.

However, limited channel bandwidth is, as for monocular images, the main bottleneck for realizing 3D systems. As a result, an efficient compression algorithm will be essential to reduce the bandwidth requirement while maintaining the perceptual visual quality at the decoder. In this paper, we will focus on compression of stereo images. When it comes to stereo image coding, we can take advantage of binocular redundance by using disparity compensation. The most popular disparity compensation method approaches so far have ben block based methods, due mostly to their simplicity. Block based methods, however, may suffer from blocking artifacts at low bit rates due to the uniform disparity assumption within a fixed block. Meanwhile, if we reduce the block size, the disparity estimation may suffer from various noise effects which result in increases of bit rates for the disparity. Considering these observations, we estimate disparity based on a small block or a pixel with thee energy equation derived from the MRF model. In order to prevent oversmoothing across boundaries, we use the combined intensity edges of two images as an initial disparity boundary. Then, we segment the resulting smooth disparity field. Finally, the disparity and the starting position are encoded using DPCM and the corresponding boundary is encoded using Run Length Chain coding. At the end of this paper, we present experimental results.","Disparity estimation; Markov Random Field (MRF); Segmentation; Stereo image coding","Bandwidth compression; Communication; Digital image storage; Edge detection; Hidden Markov models; Image communication systems; Image compression; Image enhancement; Image matching; Image processing; Image segmentation; Imaging systems; Motion compensation; Programming theory; Structural frames; Telecommunication systems; Three dimensional; Visual communication; 3D imaging; 3d systems; Autostereoscopic displays; Bandwidth requirements; Bit rates; Block sizes; Blocking artifacts; Chain coding; Channel bandwidths; Compression algorithms; Disparity compensations; Disparity estimation; Disparity fields; Energy equations; Low bit rates; Markov Random Field (MRF); Monocular images; MRF models; Noise effects; Perceptual visual qualities; Recent developments; Segmentation; Stereo image coding; Stereo image compressions; Stereo images; Image coding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001764752

When white light is incident on a metal/air/metal structure, under appropriate conditions, surface plasmon waves are excited at one metal/air material interface. Those photons in the surface plasmon resonance wavelength range will be converted into the energy of free electrons in the metal, then coupled into the other metal film which re-radiates light at the identical resonant wavelength. This surface plasmon resonance depends on the dielectric constant of the metal and the thickness of the air gap. When the thickness of the air gap changes, the surface plasmon resonance spectrum shifts from one wavelength to another, and the device functions as a tunable filter. The SPTF is a light weight, low power device, which can be integrated with a solid state image sensor to form a spectrometer-on-a-chip. Theoretical calculation has shown that this image spectrometer can also work in IR range up to at least 10 micrometers. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Electro-optics; Spectrometer; Surface plasmons; Thin film; Tunable filter","Internal combustion engines; Light; Optical data storage; Plasmons; Resonance; Spectrometers; Spectrometry; Surface plasmon resonance; Surfaces; Temperature control; Thickness measurement; Thin film devices; Thin films; Electro-optics; Spectrometer; Surface plasmons; Thin film; Tunable filter; Air filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001730624

The x-ray tube is a glass-enclosed hot-cathode triode and is composed of the following major parts: an anode rod made of copper, a tungsten plate target, an iron focusing electrode, a tungsten hot-cathode (filament), a tungsten grid, and a glass tube body. The electron beams from the cathode are accelerated by both the grid and anode electrodes and are roughly converged to the target by the focusing electrode. In the present work, the storage condenser is charged up to 70 kV by the power supply, and the electric charges in the condenser are discharged repetitively to the x-ray tube by the grid pulser. Because the cathode current is increased by increasing the positive grid voltage, high-dose-rate repetitive x-rays are then produced. In this generator, the cathode current which is almost equivalent to the tube current is primarily regulated by the filament temperature (filament voltage). The pulse widths of x-rays were about 600 ns, and the maximum repetition rate was about 50 kHz. The cathode current was less than 3.1 A, and the x-ray intensity had a value of 35.2 nC/kg at 0.5 m per pulse with a charging voltage of 70 kV and a filament voltage of 12 V.",,"Condenser tubes; Condensers (liquefiers); Copper; Electric power distribution; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Electron beams; Electron tubes; Filaments (lamp); Glass; High speed cameras; High speed photography; Magnetrons; Measurements; Photography; Triodes; Tubes (components); Tungsten; X ray tubes; X rays; Anode electrodes; Cathode currents; Charging voltages; DC power supplies; Essential components; Filament temperatures; Focusing electrodes; Glass tubes; Grid voltages; Power supplies; Pulse widths; Repetition rates; Tube currents; Tungsten plates; Voltage power supplies; X ray radiography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000607008

This imaging system, which has a high spatial resolution and high x-ray quantum efficiency, suffers in the normal diagnostic x-ray energy range from added noise due to the secondary light photon quantum sink. For each x-ray photon absorbed, less than one electron is produced in a CCD pixel. However in the x-ray energy range used in radiation therapy the light output per absorbed x-ray photon is much higher, making the transparent scintillator technique more practical. Also the dose applied in radiation therapy is high anyway, allowing the use of higher dose to give better image quality. The 16-bit resolution of the cooled CCD allows very accurate x-ray absorption data to be acquired compared to the 8-bit CCDs used in commercially available portal imagers.

The thin detectors are made as p-i-n diodes in thin etched membranes in 280 μm thick silicon wafers. The membranes are made with anisotropic etching using 25 w% tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution. The etch speed of this solution is very uniform across a wafer. As a result detectors with uniform thickness can be produced. The etch depth varies with less than ±0.3 μm over a wafer and the surface microroughness is in the range from 2 to 4 nm.

At the DOE Hanford Site, a field-scale prototype surface barrier was constructed in 1994 over an existing waste site as a part of a CERCLA treatability test. Design considerations included stability, soil water balance, protective sideslopes, and durability of the asphalt layer. The barrier is currently in the final year of a three-year test designed to answer specific questions related to stability and long-term performance. One half of the barrier is irrigated such that the total water applied, including precipitation, is 480 mm/yr (three times the long-term annual average). Each year for the past two years, an extreme precipitation event (71 mm in 8 hr) representing a 1000-year return storm was applied in late March, when soil water storage was at a maximum. While the protective sideslopes have drained significant amounts of water, the soil cover (2 m of silt-loam soil overlying coarse sand and rock) has never drained. During the past year there was no measurable surface runoff or wind erosion. This is attributed to extensive revegetation of the surface. In addition, the barrier elevation has shown a small increase of 2 to 3 cm that is attributed to a combination of root proliferation and freeze/thaw activity. Testing will continue through September 1997. Performance data from the prototype barrier will be used by DOE in site-closure decisions at Hanford.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030708754

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a related pathway regulates metabolism, development and longevity. Wild-type animals enter the developmentally arrested dauer stage in response to high levels of a secreted pheromone, accumulating large amounts of fat in their intestines and hypodermis. Mutants in DAF-2 (a homologue of the mammalian insulin receptor) and AGE-1 (a homologue of the catalytic subunit of mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase) arrest development at the dauer stage. Moreover, animals bearing weak or temperature-sensitive mutations in daf-2 and age-1 can develop reproductively, but nevertheless show increased energy storage and longevity. Here we show that null mutations in daf-16 suppress the effects of mutations in daf-2 or age-1; lack of daf-16 bypasses the need for this insulin receptor-like signalling pathway. The principal role of DAF-2/AGE-1 signalling is thus to antagonize DAF-16. daf-16 is widely expressed and encodes three members of the Fork head family of transcription factors. The DAF-2 pathway acts synergistically with the pathway activated by a nematode TGF-β-type signal, DAF-7, suggesting that DAF-16 cooperates with nematode SMAD proteins in regulating the transcription of key metabolic and developmental control genes. The probable human ortholognes of DAF-16, FKHR and AFX, may also act downstream of insulin signalling and cooperate with TGF-β effectors in mediating metabolic regulation.

Lithium- ion batteries tend to be the systems of choice as they offer higher energy densities and longer operational lifetimes than other rechargeable battery systems. But commercially available lithium-ion batteries make use of layered LiCoO2 cathodes, and the high cost and toxicity of cobalt therefore motivate the development of cheaper and environmentally benign cathode materials. In this regard, manganese oxides are attractive alternatives, and the spinel LiMn2O4 has been investigated intensively as a cathode; however, the fading on cycling of its energy-storage capacity poses problems. More recently, attention has been focused on the synthesis of layered LiMnO2 as a cathode material, but its cycling characteristics remain to be established(7-9).

Our material exhibits a high reversible capacity of 260mAhg-1 in the range 1.5- 4.3V with excellent cycling characteristics.

Via projectile fragmentation a large variety of exotic nuclei can be produced, which can be separated in flight by the Fragment Separator (FRS) prior to being injected into the ESR. A special time-pick-off-detector has been developed, which uses secondary electron emission from a thin foil, which is penetrated by the ions under investigation. This detector has been designed for use in the ESR-vacuum of 10-11mbar and has an intrinsic time-resolution of ≈ 85ps.

During storage times of up to four hours, several hundred 187Os75+ ions were produced via bound state β- decay of 187Re75+ ions and circulating on almost the same orbit. To separate the 187Os ions from their mother nuclei, an internal Ar gas jet target was used to strip off the last electron and produce 187Os76+. As a result of the higher charge state the 187Os ions now were stronger deflected by the following dipole magnet, and detected in a position sensitive microstrip-gas-counter. The determined half-life is T1/2 = 31.2+3.0-2.5 yr. With the now measured 187Re half-life the 187Re/187Os cosmochronometer can be recalibrated.

The measurements are performed by non-destructive detection and frequency analysis of the beam noise, the well-established Schottky diagnosis technique. Schottky mass spectrometry was applied for the first time at the Experimental Storage Ring ESR at GSI using electron-cooled, highly charged (mainly bare, H- and He-like) heavy ions at relativistic energies of up to 370 MeV/u. The performance of the method at the ESR is shortly reviewed and an overview of the results from our first mass measurements of radioactive neutron-deficient gold and bismuth fragments is given. Relative accuracies down to 3 x 10-7 were achieved for the measured masses, corresponding to absolute uncertainties of 50 to 150 keV/c2 for these heavy isotopes (135 ≤ A ≤ 209). The typical mass resolving power of about 350000 allows even the resolution of isomeric from ground state masses in some cases. Due to the required cooling time, the method is applicable, so far, to nuclei with half-lives of at least a few seconds.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031576498

Due to its high intrinsic energy resolution this detector type promises to be a useful tool for nuclear physics experiments with cooled heavy ion beams from storage rings. Detector tests performed with relativistic heavy ions from the SIS synchrotron at GSI yielded relative energy resolutions of 2 - 4 · 10-3 for 20Ne and for 209Bi ions, limited in this case by the energy spread of the beam. In a first application of such detectors the excitation of the giant resonance in lead nuclei via the reaction natPb (20Ne, 20Ne′) natPb* was investigated by separating inelastically from elastically scattered 20Ne ions in the energy spectrum. At a scattering angle of Θ Lab = 3° the excitation energy and the strength of the giant resonance were found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions. In a recent experiment calorimetric detectors were bombarded with cooled 238U ions at E = 360 MeV/u, extracted from the storage ring ESR.

When the incident electron energy exceeds 1.64 ± 0.05 eV, fragments are observed with a kinetic energy of only 120±50 meV. The energetics suggest that this low-energy channel derives from either recombination of the X 3Σ- state or recombination of the metastable a 1Δ state. High-quality ab initio calculations have been used to obtain the a 1Δ state vibrational relaxation time (10 ms), excitation energy (2.25 eV) and radiative lifetime (0.030 s). The a 1Δ dissociative recombination cross section has been obtained in a model calculation. The results imply that the a 1Δ state has too small a recombination cross section and too short a radiative lifetime to explain the experimental results, which were obtained after 15 s of storage in CRYRING. We conclude that the 120 meV channel is due to recombination of OH+ X 3Σ- into the Q(3P) + H(n = 2) asymptotic limit.

A three-orthogonal Hall probe and a long-loop-coil measurement system are also implemented to take the field measurements. The multipole field and electron trajectory correction are made by shimming, the magic finger, and the active end pole coil corrector. After the field measurements, the vertical integral strength of HAPU is markedly smaller than that of the Hybrid Adjustable Gap Undulator (HAGU) and confirm that no obvious distinction arises between HAPU and HAGU in terms of the spectrum flux. The electron beam dynamic performance in the storage ring indicates that the vertical tune shift of HAPU is three times smaller than that of HAGU. Meanwhile, the energy dynamic tuning with the digital global feedback turned on, the photon position and flux in the bending chamber beam line is invariant. In addition, the injection efficiency remains unaffected at any phase position and the electron beam lifetime does not change when HAPU is in the dynamic tuning.",,"Electron beams; Magnetic field measurement; Particle beam dynamics; Photons; Storage rings; Hall probes; Hybrid adjustable gap undulators; Hybrid adjustable phase undulators; Accelerator magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031270803

These cells were shown to grow under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on media containing nitrate or ammonium. The energy metabolism of C. utilis grown on nitrate under aerobic conditions was studied at the cellular and mitochondrial levels. The cells were shown to conserve the highly efficient mitochondrial type of energy storage. All three sites of energy coupling operate in the respiratory chain. However, cell growth was still possible, although at lower rates, due to glycolysis when the system of oxidative phosphorylation was blocked by ethidium bromide, an inhibitor of mitochondrial transcription. The ultrastructure of cells grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on nitrate was examined. In both cases, mitochondrial structures had no signs of destruction. No nitrate reduction or nitrite formation was observed during balanced growth with varying concentrations of oxygen (aerobic, microaerophilic, or anaerobic conditions). In organic nitrogen-deficient media (0.02-0.002% yeast extract), unbalanced growth under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions resulted in the accumulation of considerable amounts of nitrite in the medium (up to 15% of nitrate added).

The rates of honey granulation were calculated from ΔH values at the four temperatures. A linear relationship was found between the enthalpy of melting (ΔH) and the absorbance at 660 nm. The activation energy for the melting of coarse crystals was also determined with DSC.","Differential scanning calorimetry; Honey; Honey granulation","crystal; differential scanning calorimetry; energy; food analysis; granulation; honey; light absorption; melting point; pasteurization; storage; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031371423

Analytical expressions are obtained for the coefficient of performance, the cooling capacity, the entropy production and the second-law efficiency of the system. The results obtained for cycles with external heat transfer irreversibilities and for fully reversible cycles are compared with those obtained by detailed simulation of the absorption machine.

In general, EBM systems consist of an electrolyser, water and gas (hydrogen and, optimally, oxygen) storage and management systems and a means of (re-) generating electricity, e.g. a fuel cell. Such systems achieve their management via energy conversion and storage this operational principle being referred to as electricity supply-and-demand management (ESDM). Implementation of this principle offers significant advantages in the utilisation of variable and/or intermittent renewable resources, as it permits electricity generated during periods of high-availability/low-demand to be 'time-shifted' for subsequent re-supply during periods of low-availability/high-demand. Furthermore, EBM systems have the important advantage over other ESDM systems that the stored form of energy is readily utilisable as a pollution-free gas supply for thermal end-uses. This reconversion route significantly enhances the overall energy-conversion efficiency. Electrolyser find fuel cells based upon proton-exchange membrane technologies are preferred because these afford considerable operational advantages over any alternatives.

This suggests that hovering locomotion scales unfavourably with size. Is the hovering performance of larger hummingbird species more constrained by size than that of smaller ones? Maximal load-lifting capacities of the two largest species of hummingbirds found in the United States, the blue-throated (Lampornis clemenciae, 8.4g) and magnificent (Eugenes fulgens, 7.4g) hummingbird, as well as the two other local small species, the black-chinned (Archilochus alexandri, 3.0g) and rufous (Selasphorus rufus, 3.3g) hummingbird, were determined under conditions of short-burst performance. The power reserves of hummingbirds are substantial relative to normal hovering performance. The two large species lifted maximal loads close to twice their body mass for a very brief duration of over 0.4s. The small species lifted maximal loads approximately equal to their own mass with a longer duration of over 0.6s. For the two large species under maximal loading, estimates of burst muscle mass-specific mechanical power output assuming perfect elastic energy storage averaged 309Wkg-1, compared with 75Wkg-1 during free hovering without loading. For the two small species, these values were 228 W kg-1 and 88 W kg-1, respectively. The differences in aerodynamic force production and power output between the large and small size classes occur despite their similar wing stroke velocity. This indicates that, during burst performance in these hummingbirds, the larger ones had a higher load-lifting capacity and generated more muscle power. In spite of the twofold difference in body mass, both large and small hummingbirds have evolved to become potent aerial competitors in order to exploit their common food resource, nectar. Both size classes have evolved to cope with the multi-dimensional effects of size constraining their aerodynamics, muscle mechanics, metabolism and ecology.","Body size; Hovering; Hummingbird; Load-lifting; Maximal burst performance; Muscle power output; Scaling; Serodynamics; Wing stroke velocity","animal; article; bird; flying; physiology; Animals; Birds; Flight, Animal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031281411

The numerical simulation model is employed to study the performance of a passive solar outdoor test-room with different amounts of thermal mass under various control strategies with constant and sinusoidal room thermostat setpoints. A satisfactory thermal mass is determined based on energy savings, reduction of room temperature swings, and prevention of floor surface overheating.

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution after prolonged cold storage with that of the conventional glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) and University of Wisconsin (UW) solutions in experimental heart preservation. GIK solution was chosen as a control to mimic current clinical regimens. Variables of cardiac function, myocardial tissue water, and adenine nucleotide pool metabolites were used to assess prolonged myocardial preservation in the isolated rat heart model. Methods. Hearts isolated from male Wistar rats were mounted on a Langendorff apparatus to estimate baseline cardiac function. The hearts were divided into three groups (n=6 per group) according to each preservation solution used: group 1, GIK solution; group 2, UW solution; and group 3, HTK solution. The hearts were then arrested and stored in each solution for 6, 8, and 12 hr at 4°C. After storage, the hearts were reperfused and recovery of cardiac function and myocardial tissue water content were evaluated. Myocardial adenylate contents just after storage in each group (n=5 hearts/group) were also measured. Results. The hearts stored in HTK solution showed maintenance of cardiac function at up to 8 hr of almost 80% of prepreservative baseline function; however, recovery of cardiac function of the hearts stored in UW solution revealed an initial loss of function at 6 hr of almost 60% and a decline to 50% at 8 hr. Furthermore, recovery of cardiac function of the hearts stored in GIK solution revealed a progressive loss of function at 6 hr of storage of almost 50% and a decline to 30% at 8 hr of storage. The myocardial ATP/ADP ratios after 6 hr of storage in HTK and UW solutions were significantly higher than the ratio found in GIK solution. Although the myocardial ATP/ADP ratio after 8 hr of storage in HTK solution was maintained above 50%, the ratios in GIK and UW solutions declined to 15%. In addition, the myocardial energy charge values of the hearts stored in HTK solution were sufficiently maintained until 8 hr of storage, whereas the values in UW and GIK solutions declined to below 50% at 6 hr of storage and 20% at 8 hr of storage. Although there were no significant differences in tissue water contents after 6 and 8 hr of storage among the three groups, the water contents of the hearts after 12 hr of storage in HTK and UW solutions were significantly lower than that of the hearts stored in GIK solution. Conclusions. Our results suggest that HTK solution is much more effective than UW and GIK solutions for isolated rat heart preservation; however, successful cold storage of the heart is highly energy-dependent, and a dramatic breakdown of myocardial energy level, which causes a crucial decline in cardiac function, occurs between 8 and 12 hr of storage.",,"2 oxoglutaric acid; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; histidine; tryptophan; university of wisconsin solution; animal model; animal tissue; article; heart function; heart muscle metabolism; heart preservation; heart transplantation; hypothermia; isolated heart; male; nonhuman; organ preservation; priority journal; rat; Adenosine; Adenosine Diphosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Allopurinol; Animals; Body Water; Glucose; Glutathione; Heart; Heart Arrest, Induced; Insulin; Male; Mannitol; Myocardium; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Potassium; Potassium Chloride; Procaine; Raffinose; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030773965

The power of similarity has been often used to strengthen search methodology and to help reaction prediction systems, but seldom to optimise reaction classification. A hierarchical classification by similarity measures is proposed. It is based on electronic energy and chemical potential descriptors and on a general description of reactions. Using a main division into three reaction sets, additions, eliminations, and substitutions, followed by two successive subdivisions by number and types of reactive atoms it is possible to arrive at a hierarchy of groups containing homogeneous reaction classes. In addition, inside each set the reactions can be ordered. Some simple examples are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the classification and its overall consistency. The application of the final system to more complex examples is further proof of its efficiency. The reported classification can also be used in synthesis planning.",,"organic compound; article; classification; drug synthesis; methodology; priority journal; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030881321

Furthermore, a single gene defect can produce regulatory deficits in multiple modes of energy expenditure. The most severe forms of genetic obesity involve multiple pathogenic processes. It is significant that regulatory defects in any single component of caloric intake or energy expenditure appear to be sufficient to produce obesity.

This effect of ABA might be related to its natural function as an endogenous inhibitor of precocious germination during seed formation. In this work, we studied how ABA affects the germination of mature seeds and the growth of nascent seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Our findings were as follows: (i) inhibition by ABA was gradual, dose-dependent, and did not disappear after germination; (ii) inhibition of germination was relieved by the addition of metabolizable sugars or amino acids to the plating media; (iii) the effect of sugars and amino acids was cooperative, indicating that these two groups of metabolites relieve different deficiencies; (iv) ABA caused appreciable alterations in energy and nitrogen metabolism; and (v) ABA prevented the degradation of the seed storage proteins. In summary, ABA appears to inhibit seed germination by restricting the availability of energy and metabolites. This mechanism seems consistent with other known effects of ABA.","Abscisic acid; Arabidopsis; Carbon metabolism; Germination; Nitrogen metabolism; Storage protein","abscisic acid; ammonia; nitrogen; vegetable protein; Arabidopsis; article; carbohydrate metabolism; dose response; drug effect; energy metabolism; metabolism; physiology; plant seed; time; Abscisic Acid; Ammonia; Arabidopsis; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Energy Metabolism; Nitrogen; Plant Proteins; Seeds; Time Factors; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031259502

A number of requirements are formulated for the successful application of this recently developed in situ quantitative type of analysis. A demonstration of the procedures is given. By application of the technique it is established that there are no significant differences in the average iron loading of structures analysed in liver parenchymal cells of a patient with an iron storage disease, before and after phlebotomy. This supports the hypothesis that the process of iron unloading is an organelle specific process. Measurement of the binary morphology, represented by the area and contour ratio of the iron containing objects revealed no information about differences between the objects. This finding contradicts the visual suggestion that ferritin clusters are more irregularly shaped than the other iron objects. Also, no differences could be found in this sense between the situations before and after phlebotomy. With respect to the density appearance, objects that have an inhomogeneous iron loading averagely contain more iron.

For transmission to occur, the larvae must have sufficient energy to (a) migrate onto grass, where they are ingested by their equine host (host finding), and (b) penetrate into the host gut. This study is designed to test the hypothesis that L3 larvae of S. vulgaris partition their energy stores between locomotory activity (used in host finding) and infection activity (penetration). Chronic locomotory activity was stimulated by incubating S. vulgaris L3 larvae at a constant temperature (38 C). After 8 days of treatment, locomotory activity ceased (exhaustion). Exhausted L3 larvae had significantly decreased total lipid when compared to controls (P < 0.05), but there was no decrease in levels of protein or carbohydrate. Lipids of S. vulgaris L3 larvae are comprised of 9 fatty acids, some of which are depleted in exhausted worms (14:0, 14:1, 16:0, 16:1, 18:1, 18:2), whereas others (18:0, 20:4, 24: 0) remain unchanged. These data suggest that specific fatty acids provide the energy source for locomotory activity in S. vulgaris. Exhausted L3 larvae were also less able to penetrate host cecal tissue in in vitro penetration assays when compared to controls (P < 0.05), suggesting that the depletion of individual fatty acids during locomotory activity also reduced infectivity. These data do not support the hypothesis that S. vulgaris L3 larvae partition their energy stores between host-finding and infection activities. A comparison of lipid storage profiles in the L3 larvae of 4 nematode species with similar transmission strategies (S. vulgaris, Strongylus edentatus, Strongylus equinus, and Haemonchus contortus) revealed similarities in the fatty acid composition of these species.

From November 1991, to November 1994, microscopic examination of the ovaries and measurement of the tissue concentrations of glycogen, total proteins and total lipids in these five body tissues were made monthly on ten female dog cockles originating from the sea area around Douarnenez (south Brittany, France). Morphological studies revealed that in the population investigated the annual cycle is characterised by three major periods: a first period of vitellogenesis extending from February/March to April/May and preceding a spawning in spring; a second period of vitellogenesis extending from May/June to September/October and leading to either no spawning, a single autumnal spawning event, or to two spawning events in summer and autumn; and a third period extending from October/November to February/March and characterised by a high level of oocyte lysis. In the muscular body tissues of the dog cockle, i.e. the adductor muscles, the foot and the tunic coat (the muscular envelope containing the visceral mass), the concentrations of glycogen, total proteins and total lipids underwent very similar variations during the annual cycle. During each stage of vitellogenesis, a typical glycogen-protein-lipid sequence was observed in the muscular tissues that was characterised firstly by a peak of glycogen concentration 2 to 3 mo before spawning, followed by a peak in total proteins 1 mo before spawning, and finally by a peak in lipid content just before spawning. A similar glycogen-protein-lipid sequence was also recorded in the first half of the winter period. However, these events were followed by general atresia affecting all oocytes in the gonad. Maximum energetic value of biochemical constituents in females coincided with peaks in lipid content in the visceral mass and mantle. These biochemical events occurred principally immediately before and at the end of oocyte lysis (December/January). A drop in the total energetic value, affecting mainly the visceral mass and the mantle, was recorded each year during the period January to March, coinciding with the period of shell growth in this species. Our data clearly indicate that in female G. glycymeris all muscular tissues contribute to the storage of glycogen and proteins, and suggest that glycogen may be the source of energy triggering vitellogenesis. Biochemical and microscopic observations revealed that oocyte development takes place during the first half of winter, but that these oocytes undergo atresia in December/January.

Indian Ocean. Fishes were collected monthly from November 1989 to August 1990 in order to examine their stomach and gut contents. The temporal variability of the diet of S. nigricans was investigated on (1) a seasonal scale for the various size-classes and (2) a daily scale within two seasons. On average, algae accounted for 69.4% of the total weight of the stomach contents, all sizes combined. The total weight of all prey, and both the weight and the percentage of algae in stomach contents decreased in winter. This pattern was more pronounced for large (&gt; 8 cm total length) and medium (4-8 cm) than for small individuals (&lt;4 cm). Small S. nigricans also fed on invertebrates such as polychaetes, ascidians and copepods, whereas medium and large individuals had a very low invertebrate consumption. Daily variations of diet were recorded, with two maxima of food intake in summer: between 0600 and 0930 and between 1430 and 1900. In winter, only one peak of consumption was observed between 1200 and 1700. An estimate of food intake of 2488 g · m-2 · year-1 (dry weight) for the S. nigricans population was determined from stomach and intestine contents. The seasonal variation in the diet of S. nigricans may be related to several interacting factors, such as availability of food resources, high rate of consumption of food in summer for energy storage to offset the lean winter period, and high energetic needs for summer reproductive activities. The ontogenic shift in diet appeared to be a response of small individuals to both a transition phase between larval and benthic phases, and a need for protein-rich prey in order to promote their growth. The daily variation in the diet is probably due to diurnal variations in the nutritional value and/or palatability of algal food.",,"protein; damselfish; diet; reef fish; temporal variation; temporal variations; alga; animal tissue; article; circadian rhythm; diet; energy; fish; food intake; intestine; invertebrate; nonhuman; nutritional value; palatability; seasonal variation; stomach; summer; winter; Reunion; Stegastes nigricans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030701570

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are induced in the liver after warm ischemia/reperfusion and are thought to be markers of hepatocellular injury and oxidative stress. Methods. The influence of variable periods of cold storage followed by reperfusion on the expression of HSP70 was studied in the isolated perfused pig liver. Organs were harvested and stored in histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution at 4°C and then perfused (210 min) in a closed water bath (38°C), which subjects the liver to fluctuating outer pressure. The role of energy depletion, reactive oxygen intermediates, Kupffer cells, and circulating leukocytes in HSP70 expression was determined. Results. HSP70 expression was not detectable in liver tissue before explantation or before reperfusion by Northern blot analysis using a pig HSP70 gene probe. HSP70 expression was observed after reperfusion depending on cold storage time. Kinetics of HSP70 expression monitored by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed a rapid increase of mRNA within 1 hr, which was closely associated with delayed recovery of hepatocellular energy charge, as assessed by the ketone body ratio. The inactivation of Kupffer cells, the presence or absence of leukocytes, and the suppression of oxidative stress with the antioxidant idebenone, given during reperfusion, had no influence. However, feeding the animals with idebenone over 7 days before explantation led to a faster recovery of ketone body ratio, paralleled by a substantial suppression of HSP70 expression. Conclusions. Our data show that HSP70 expression during reperfusion is mainly dependent on the preceding cold storage time and the consecutive delayed recovery of the hepatocellular energy charge.",,"antioxidant; heat shock protein 70; idebenone; ketone body; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; cryopreservation; energy transfer; graft survival; intraarterial drug administration; kupffer cell; liver cell damage; liver ischemia; liver preservation; liver transplantation; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein induction; reperfusion injury; swine; Animals; Base Sequence; Benzoquinones; Cold; Conserved Sequence; DNA Primers; Energy Metabolism; Female; Gadolinium; Glucose; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Hypertonic Solutions; Ischemia; Ketone Bodies; Kinetics; Kupffer Cells; Liver; Male; Mannitol; Organ Preservation; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Potassium Chloride; Procaine; Reperfusion; RNA, Messenger; Swine; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142591284

The influence of reproductive cycle on somatic changes was also investigated and discussed. Measurements of condition factor (K), somatic index (SI), gonadosomatic index (GSI) and somatic and gonad energy content (J g-1 dw) were made in individual specimens taken from the Guadalete River monthly for 12 months. This freshwater ecosystem is characterised by strong seasonal fluctuations in water and flow level, temperature and food supply. It was found that in general juveniles, males and females of barbel exhibited a similar condition, nutrition and somatic energy cycle throughout the year, with the highest values in spring and the lowest in summer. Depletion of K, SI and somatic energy storage from spring until mid-summer seems to be associated with high metabolic demands during this period, and in adult fish also with spawning-related activity. The gonad index and energy content of the gonad were the highest in April and the lowest in summer for both sexes. Spawning took place during late spring - early summer, with fish quiescent by mid summer. The energy required for ovarian development (3970 J g-1 dw) was greater than the one for testes development (2763 J g-1 dw). Data on gonad energy content indicated a period (March to April) of intense energy accumulation (64% males and 37% females) which was related to the decline in the average somatic energy content in males and females. The somatic energy content was linearly related to K and SI. In the same way, GSI correlated positively with gonad energy. Linear trends were found between somatic parameters (K, SI and energy content) and gonad parameters (GSI and energy content).","Energy storage; Life-history styles; Reproduction","body condition; energy content; gonad maturation; nutrition; Sclater's barbei; seasonal variation; seasonality; Spain, Cadiz, Guadalete River; Barbus barbus; Barbus sclateri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030774589

Filtered states localized in the energy domain can be generated during the Lanczos iteration by forward substitution which formally corresponds to a Green function filter. Eigenstates in the energy range of interest are then obtained by diagonalizing a small Hamiltonian matrix in a subspace spanned by the filtered states. It is shown that the accuracy of this approach is affected neither by the loss of orthogonality among the Lanczos states nor by the instability in the forward substitution. Since the filtered states are assembled while the Lanczos states are generated, no storage of the Lanczos states is needed. The computational savings can be significant in calculating high energy eigenstates of large systems. The proposed scheme is shown numerically to have comparable accuracy with the basic Lanczos method. © 1997 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031572071

The range in reported activation energies is very wide (48-194 kJ mol-1) because of improper deconvolution of the first and second stages of UO2 oxidation and because of the complex temperature dependence of the reaction kinetics. A general method is then presented for quantitative analysis of nucleation-and-growth kinetics by using X-ray diffraction to measure the rate of product formation on a flat surface. This quantitative method is then used to analyze the kinetic data for the formation of U3O8 on the surface of UO2 disks over the range 168-300°C. The resulting Arrhenius plot is linear, and the activation energy for U3O8 formation was found to be 146 ± 10 kJ mol-1 (90% confidence interval). The quantitative procedure developed herein can be used to estimate the rate of U3O8 formation at low (&lt; 175°C) temperatures, and thus makes an important contribution to the safe dry air storage of used nuclear fuel. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",,"Activation energy; Nucleation; Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; Temperature; X ray diffraction analysis; Arrhenius plot; Improper deconvolution; Uranium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031549441

Absorption of methane in solvents can be used to enhance this density. In this 3 paper the solubility of methane in a total of 46 various solvents has been calculated based on the predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state (PSRK model). The results show that among these solvents, neopentane, n-butane, n-pentane, i-pentane, methylethylether and diethylether show the best results. When methane is dissolved in the C5 fraction, the liquid phase at storage possesses a large expandability so it is easy to liberate through a flash separator. The calculation results of this paper show that the storage pressure can be reduced to 15 MPa, and due to the storage condition in the liquid phase, the energy density is increased and a total 20.9 kg fuel mixture including 6.93 kg of methane can be stored by a 50 L tank. From this amount 20 kg fuel gas can be liberated through a heated flash separator (compared with 15.3 kg natural gas stored at 25 MPa by the CNG method). Through these investigations, the importance of this study has been illustrated. In Section 4 of this paper, based on the investigation of existing experimental data and the calculated results, an application for measuring P-x-y-® diagrams of three systems was proposed at the University of Oldenburg.The solubility of methane in 46 various solvents was calculated based on the predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state to study the energy storage density at ambient temperature for adequate driving range.

Inst. of Pharmaceutical Sci., Taipei Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan","In stability testing, the mean kinetic temperature (MKT) and relative humidity (RH) are two important factors which have an impact on the determination of the shelf-life of a drug product. This report presents the MKT and RH of Taiwan based on climate data from different areas of Taiwan between the years of 1991 and 1995. The data used in the calculation is from the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan. Activation energies of 10 to 30 Kcal/mol are considered. The results show that the MKT of Taiwan is 24.5°C given a typical activation energy of 20 Kcal/mol, and the RH is 77%. Drug products degrade faster under higher MKT and RH. Based on analogous safety margins for MKT and RH in climatic zones I (19.7°C/43.9%, MKT/RH) and II (22.8°C/52.9%) as specified in the international conference on harmonization (ICH) stability testing guideline, the long-term storage test conditions for Taiwan would be 28 ± 2°C and 90 ± 5% for temperature and humidity, respectively. These derived storage conditions are in fact 3°C and 17% higher than those in the ICH guideline specified for the tripartite countries (EC, Japan and USA). For a 3°C increment in MKT, the degradation rate constant will actually increase by about 34%. In consequence, a product marketed in Taiwan will only have about 75% of the shelf-life that it would have in the tripartite countries. In this communication, the implications of the climatic conditions of Taiwan are examined. Appropriate storage test conditions for drugs and products stability testing in Taiwan are also proposed.","Mean kinetic temperature; Relative humidity; Stability test; Taiwan",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042948781

External physical stimuli flowing into the brain are shown to generate macroscopic condensates of evanescent photons which can be interpreted as memory storage of the information carried by the incoming stimuli. Each macroscopic condensate manifests two different types of quantum dynamics; creation-annihilation dynamics of a finite number of evanescent photons requiring microscopic amount of energy, and that of an infinite number of them requiring macroscopic amount of energy. The former is a fundamental process of memory retrieval by which the macroscopic condensate of evanescent photons (memory storage) itself is kept unchanged. It can be induced by even a very small physical stimulus flowing into the brain. The latter is a macroscopic phase transition process in which the macroscopic condensate is deformed into another one, thus resulting in the development of memory storage. This can be induced only by large physical stimuli, and superposition of the information carried by such an external stimulus and the information previously stored in the macroscopic condensate is maintained in the new macroscopic condensate. Consciousness (and unconscious if necessary) can be understood as arising from those creation-annihilation dynamics of evanescent photons, thus mind lives in memory and by memory.","Condensate; Consciousness; Evanescent photons; Goldstone boson; Memory; Mind; Ordered water; Quantum brain theory","Brain; Information retrieval; Photons; Quantum theory; Consciousness; Goldstone boson; Information theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031224392

In this region, a persistent upwelling during summer is characterised by intermittent pulses of variable intensity, and increased nutrient concentrations in the surface layer. The main effect of an upwelling pulse on phytoplankton distribution is the shifting of the chlorophyll a and primary production maxima to near the surface. When the upwelling relaxes, thermal stratification of the water column occurs, and a distinct subsurface chlorophyll maximum develops below the production maximum. An accumulation of intracellular nitrate characterized the early phases of upwelling (mean== μmol N m-3), maximum concentrations being attained at depths where biomass and production values were moderate. In contrast, phytoplankton cells from non-upwelling situations contained significantly lower concentrations of intracellular nitrate (mean = 0.17 μmol N m-3). The variations in the intracellular pool of nitrate may result from the differential allocation of resources within the cell as a result of variations in the energy available, since the uptake and assimilation of nitrate is a relatively expensive process involving several enzymatic systems. We hypothesize that nitrate storage by phytoplankton cells is characteristic of early phases of upwelling and is linked to patterns of carbon fixation. Average nitrogen budgets for upwelling and non-upwelling situations indicate that intracellular nitrate reserves are not responsible for maintaining high phytoplankton growth rates, since they only account for &lt;2% of daily primary production during upwelling events.",,"coastal upwelling; intracellular storage; nitrates; nitrogen cycle; phytoplankton; Spain, (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030883207

The geometry, which views the stockpile to be sealed from all sides except the top (which is exposed to the ambient conditions), is of interest in the transport of coals in barges or in cars by rail. Semi-analytical solutions are developed with the assumption that the coal pile is isothermal. Finite-difference numerical calculations show that the steady-state temperature at the exposed surface from a nonisothermal model is approximately the same as that from the isothermal formulation. Based on this approximation, the maximum temperature in the nonisothermal stockpile is linked analytically to the temperature calculated from the isothermal formulation. This approximation also permits rapid evaluation of the critical behavior of the nonisothermal stockpile in terms of the isothermal formulation. Detailed numerical solutions are necessary, however, to evaluate the transient behavior of the nonisothermal stockpile. Results in previous literature suggest that diffusion in a one-dimensional stockpile can lead to a maximum temperature rise of ≃ 80 K. This conclusion is shown to be a consequence of the unrealistic boundary conditions imposed on the oxygen and energy balance equations-diffusion alone can lead to dangerous self. heating. It is also shown that inclusion of the radiation at the boundary is extremely important in determining the stability of the stockpile. Finally, the maximum temperature within the pile at steady state, as well as the safe transit time, are calculated for the transport of coal in barges. These calculations confirm the importance of bed compaction in enhancing the safety of the coal pile.",,"coal; article; combustion; energy balance; geometry; heating; mathematical analysis; oxygen diffusion; priority journal; radiation; steady state; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030877686

Carvone only scores better with regard to human toxicity and ozone depletion.

The costs of plant establishment, production, harvest, storage and transport have been investigated as components in various chains of primary production of miscanthus to compare those chains and to calculate the price for which the processing industry could buy the crop if it would be introduced in the north-east provinces of the Netherlands. All parameters concerning contractor costs, transport distances, crop rotation and best farming practice have been chosen according to the up-to-date situation of this area. Three possible scenarios were investigated on the basis of farm labour input and the use of the margin in the cost calculation. Costs for eight different chains were compared from soil preparation until transport to the processing plant. Planting was evaluated with plantlets and rhizomes. For harvesting, existing choppers and balers were chosen, in addition to prototypes for a compact roller and whole stem harvester. To reduce transport cost of chopped material, an adapted recycling paper compacting machine was included in the calculations. With regard to transport, different systems were analysed and some calculation on costs, correlated to transport distances, were carried out. Drying costs are not included in the calculations since they depend too much on the variable weather conditions. It was concluded that costs of chopped and baled products do not differ much for the farmers scenario. Chopped product is cheapest when production is performed by the Miscanthus company. Costs then are 126 ECU/ton. Storage and transport costs are lowest when density of the product is high, so compact rolled and compacted materials are cheapest for larger transport distances. The whole stem harvester should have a higher capacity than assumed to further decrease costs. This harvest method however also offers a long harvest period without drying costs.","Biomass crop; Costs; Mechanisation; Miscanthus x giganteus; Production chains","Miscanthus; Miscanthus x giganteus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030849019

Six rats were initially killed and served as baseline (BASE), then 15 rats underwent severe energy restriction for 80 days. Seven of these restricted rats (RESTRICT) were then killed and assessed while the other eight rats (REHAB) were fed a dry rehabilitation diet that provided 100% of the recommended energy and 1.5 times the recommended protein for growth. Once the REHAB rats had recovered approximately 45% of their original mass loss, these animals were then evaluated. Within 20 min after being killed, the plantaris muscles from each animal in each group had been removed, weighed, and frozen. Analyses included total plantaris mass, as well as differences in fiber diameters, esterase activity, and fiber type distributions between three groups (BASE, RESTRICT, and REHAB). The extreme body mass loss of 64% in genetically obese Zucker rats resulted in significant tissue weight loss and reduced fiber diameters in the plantaris muscle. Refeeding resulted in larger muscle fiber diameters that approached baseline values but an 11% difference in muscle weight remained and may be due to a decreased fiber number. Esterase activity seemed to indicate an initial fat utilization for the RESTRICT group, followed by suppressed esterase activity in the REHAB group, suggesting increased fat storage. No significant differences were found in fiber type distribution between BASE, RESTRICT, or REHAB animals.","Genetic obesity; Lean body mass; Muscle plasticity; Starvation","enolase; esterase; muscle enzyme; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body mass; body weight; caloric intake; caloric restriction; controlled study; diet restriction; enzyme activity; female; lean body weight; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; muscle cell; muscle mass; muscle tissue; nonhuman; obesity; plantaris muscle; priority journal; rat; refeeding; weight reduction; Animals; Body Composition; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Esterases; Female; Muscle Fibers; Muscle, Skeletal; Obesity; Rats; Rats, Zucker",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030829014

The objective of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of a high concentration liquid formulation of AG337 intended for intravenous administration. The solubility of A G337 in pure water was above 100 mg/mL at pH <3. The drug's solubility decreased precipitously as the solution pH increased above 3 upon titration with 0.1 N NaOH. The solubility of AG337 in water as a function of temperature (ranged from 2-40°C) was determined. As anticipated, the drug's solubility increased somewhat linearly as the solution temperature increased. Degradation kinetics of 15% and 10% AG337 solutions at elevated temperatures was determined to assess the feasibility of a liquid formulation as opposed to previously developed lyophilized powder for injection. Only one major degradation product was detected in the HPLC as a result of chemical hydrolysis of AG337 to AG408. Arrhenius plot (i.e., k(abs) versus 1/T) revealed an activation energy of 25 kcal/mol. The shelf life (t(95%) of 10% AG337 solution of pH 2 at 25°C was predicted to be roughly 8 years. Various terminal sterilization methods, which include moist/dry autoclaving (121°C), e-beam, and γ-irradiation, were evaluated for the 10% AG337 solution. Autoclaving cycles, ranged from 20 to 90 minutes, caused instantaneous degradation of AG337 solution and induced further degradation upon long-term storage. Again, AG408 was the major degradation product following autoclaving. On the other hand, irradiation techniques induced very little degradation, but turned clear glass vials to brown upon irradiation.",,"ag 408; antineoplastic agent; drug metabolite; nolatrexed; parenteral solution; unclassified drug; article; autoclave; controlled study; drug degradation; drug formulation; drug solubility; drug sterility; electron beam; gamma irradiation; intravenous drug administration; liquid; pH; preformulation; temperature dependence; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic; Drug Compounding; Drug Stability; Pharmaceutical Solutions; Quinazolines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030695834

Box 17, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Although cyanobacteria are oxygenic phototrophic organisms, they often thrive in environments that become periodically anoxic. This is particularly the case in the dark when photosynthetic oxygen evolution does not take place. Whereas cyanobacteria generally utilize endogenous storage carbohydrate by aerobic respiration, they must use alternative ways for energy generation under dark anoxic conditions. This aspect of metabolism of cyanobacteria has received little attention but nevertheless in recent years a steadily increasing number of publications have reported the capacity of fermentation in cyanobacteria. This review summarizes these reports and gives a critical consideration of the energetics of dark fermentation in a number of species. There are a variety of different fermentation pathways in cyanobacteria. These include homo- and heterolactic acid fermentation, mixed acid fermentation and homoacetate fermentation. Products of fermentation include CO2, H2, formate, acetate, lactate and ethanol. In all species investigated, fermentation is constitutive. All enzymes of the fermentative pathways are present in photoautotrophically grown cells. Many cyanobacteria are also capable of using elemental sulfur as electron acceptor. In most cases it seems unlikely that sulfur respiration occurs. The main advantage of sulfur reduction seems to be the higher yield of ATP which can be achieved during fermentation. Besides oxygen and elemental sulfur no other electron accepters for chemotrophic metabolism are known so far in cyanobacteria. Calculations show that the yield of ATP during fermentation, although it is low relative to aerobic respiration, exceeds the amount that is likely to be required for maintenance, which appears to be very low in these cyanobacteria. The possibility of a limited amount of biosynthesis during anaerobic dark metabolism is discussed.","Cyanobacteria; Dark metabolism; Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway; Fermentation; Lactate dehydrogenase; Lactate fermentation; Mixed acid fermentation; Sulfur reduction","lactic acid; oxidoreductase; sulfur; bacterial metabolism; biosynthesis; cyanobacterium; darkness; electron; energy; evolution; fermentation; nonhuman; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030669394

Both parameterizations of surface-atmosphere exchanges may be considered as complex but represent the soil hydrology and the role of vegetation in very different ways. The global impact of the change in land surface scheme on the simulated climate appears to be small. Changes are smaller than those obtained when comparing either one of these schemes to the fixed hydrology used in the standard CCM2. Nevertheless, at the regional scale, changing the land-surface scheme can have a large impact on the local climate. As one example, we detail how circulation patterns are modified above the Tibetan plateau during the monsoon season. Elsewhere, mainly over land, changes can also be important. In the tropics, during the dry season, Sechiba produces warmer surface temperatures than does BATS. This wanning arises from differences in the soil hydrology, both storage capacity and the dynamics of soil water transport.

The Ti1.0Mn1.0V0.5 alloy was sintered with nickel powder in vacuum at 900 °C for 10 min for the surface modification by which the alloy could be electrochemically hydrogenated successfully. It was found that TiNi phase was formed during sintering from the X-ray and SEM (EDS) analysis. Because the reversible hydrogen storage capacity of TiNi is so small, the theoretical capacity of the electrode decreases with the formation of TiNi phase. By comparing the exchange current densities of the electrodes which were sintered with different ratios of nickel and TiNi powders, it was found that the electrochemical catalytic effect of TiNi was greater than that of nickel.

This enzyme is localized at the lipid storage organelles and oxygenates their storage triacylglycerols. We have isolated this lipid body lipoxygenase from cucumber seedlings and found that it is capable of oxygenating in vitro di- and trilinolein to the corresponding mono-, di-, and trihydroperoxy derivatives. To investigate the in vivo activity of this enzyme during germination, lipid bodies were isolated from cucumber seedlings at different stages of germination, and the triacylglycerols were analyzed for oxygenated derivatives by a combination of high pressure liquid chromatography, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We identified as major oxygenation products triacylglycerols that contained one, two, or three 13S- hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoic acid residues. During germination, the amount of oxygenated lipids increased strongly, reaching a maximum after 72 h and declining afterward. The highly specific pattern of hydroperoxy lipids formed suggested the involvement of the lipid body lipoxygenase in their biosynthesis. These data suggest that this lipoxygenase may play an important role during the germination process of cucumber and other plants and support our previous hypothesis that the specific oxygenation of the storage lipids may initiate their mobilization as a carbon and energy source for the growing seedling.",,"lipid; lipoxygenase; article; cucumber; enzyme isolation; lipid metabolism; oxygenation; plant growth; plant seed; priority journal; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cucumis sativus; Helianthus; Linoleic Acid; Linoleic Acids; Lipid Metabolism; Lipid Mobilization; Lipid Peroxides; Lipoxygenase; Seeds; Triglycerides; Cucumis sativus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030772986

Sustained performance levels of up to 3.8 Gflops have been achieved using 128 processors for J = 3. The algorithm uses a direct product discrete variable representation (DVR) basis and the implicitly restarted Lanczos method (IRLM) of Sorensen to compute the eigenvalues of the polyatomic Hamiltonian. Since the IRLM is an iterative method, it does not require storage of the full Hamiltonian matrix - it only requires the multiplication of the Hamiltonian matrix by a vector. When the IRLM is combined with a formulation such as DVR, which produces a very sparse matrix, both memory and computation times can be reduced dramatically.

This is especially true for enzymes involved in the storage of energy, such as the lipogenic and glycolytic enzymes in liver and adipose tissue. Transcription of the genes for lipogenic and glycolytic enzymes is stimulated by glucose in adipose tissue, liver, and pancreatic β-cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that glucose must be metabolized to glucose-6-phosphate to stimulate gene transcription. In adipose tissue, insulin increases the expression of lipogenic enzymes indirectly by stimulating glucose uptake. In the liver, insulin also acts indirectly by stimulating the expression of glucokinase and, hence, by increasing glucose metabolism. Glucose response elements have been characterized for the L-pyruvate kinase and S14 genes. They have in common the presence of a sequence 5'-CACGTG-3', which binds a transcription factor called USF (upstream stimulatory factor). Another glucose response element, which uses a transcription factor named Sp1, has been characterized in the gene for the acetyl-coenzyme A carhoxylase. The mechanisms linking glucose-6-phosphate to the glucose-responsive transcription complex are largely unknown.","Adipose tissue; Carbohydrate response element; Fatty acid synthase; Glucose-6-phosphate; Liver","glucose 6 phosphate; transcription factor; animal cell; carbohydrate analysis; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; glucose metabolism; glycolysis; lipogenesis; mammal; nonhuman; nutritional health; priority journal; review; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; Animals; Base Sequence; Dietary Carbohydrates; Fatty Acid Synthetase Complex; Gene Expression Regulation; Glycolysis; Humans; Lipids; Molecular Sequence Data; Pyruvate Kinase; Animalia; Mammalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030877118

Different neuroregulators may affect different stimuli that impact eating behavior. For example, neuropeptide Y may initiate feeding for energy needs, opioid peptides may provide the rewarding aspects of eating, and corticotropin releasing factor may affect stress-induced eating. We know that the neural networks regulating feeding also impact other components of energy balance. Neuropeptide Y not only increases eating, it also decreases energy expenditure in brown fat and increases enzymatic activity associated with fat storage in white fat, resulting in a more obese animal. What the sites of action are of these neuroregulators and how they interact with regulators at other sites are of utmost importance.

At still higher energy (approximately 10 eV and higher) entire series of dissociative Rydberg states with repulsive ion core cause very broad (a few eV) composite resonances which dominate the process.

This decline in fertility occurs irrespective of whether the sperm are stored at 5°C or at 15°C, bnt the rate is greater once storage temperatures exceed 25°C. Sperm motility can be maintained for extended periods in an environment where the extracellular oxidative stress is minimized by reducing the oxygen tension, by addition of antioxidants and chelating agents; however, this will not prevent a significant drop in fertility after five days of storage at ambient temperature. The requirement of energy by the sperm-motility apparatus demands a high level of respiratory activity. This system is very active and the free radicals produced in vivo during this process could lead to chromatin damage. As no internal repair mechanism exists in sperm, an extraneous supply of protectants, or an environment where damage is minimized, is essential to maintain its fertilizing potential. The lack of extended storage potential of sperm, even in the presence of antioxidants, seems to suggest that although oocyte-penetrating ability of the sperm could still be intact, the high rate of intracellular metabolic activity could lead to mitochondrial DNA damage and chromosomal abnormalities that would compromise the viability of the resulting conceptus.","antioxidants; liquid semen","antioxidant; ascorbic acid; catalase; chelating agent; deferoxamine; deferoxamine mesylate; edetic acid; egtazic acid; pentetic acid; animal cell; bull; cell aging; conference paper; controlled study; cryopreservation; fertility; male; nonhuman; spermatozoon; spermatozoon motility; Animals; Cattle; Cell Aging; Culture Media; DNA, Mitochondrial; Dogs; Female; Male; Mutation; Oxidative Stress; Semen; Semen Preservation; Sperm Motility; Sperm-Ovum Interactions; Spermatozoa; Temperature; Time Factors; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030797876

The maximum design temperature should be 90-95°C and the long term cost goal is 100 DM m-3 for a storage volume larger than 10 000 m3 water equivalent. Three pilot projects are presently under construction and planning in Germany with 600, 4500 and 12 000 m3 volume. The storage medium in all three cases is water. A first pilot heat storage with about 600 m3 volume is being built in Rottweil. This small scale project will be applied as short term storage in connection with a combined heat and power (CHP) plant. The storage container is made of concrete, water tightness is achieved by a stainless steel liner and mineral wool is used as insulation. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of the technology and to gain practical experience for the construction of larger stores. During 1995/96 two full scale central solar heating plants with seasonal storage (CSHPSS) of this type will be built in Hamburg, North Germany and Friedrichshafen, South Germany, with 4500 and 12 000 m3 storage volume, respectively.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342460499

We measured egg production, dry wt, somatic lipid and carbohydrate storage, and metabolic rate in response to changing amounts of live dietary yeast. These variables were measured in five replicate populations selected for postponed aging and five replicate short lived control populations. We find that all ten populations show an overall increase in egg production and decrease in the amount of stored metabolites in the presence of increasing amounts of yeast. All populations increase metabolic rate in response to increasing amounts of live dietary yeast. The energetics of this phenomenon suggest that increased egg production results from increased acquisition of nutrients available in yeast with only a small redirection of resources from storage to egg production.","Dietary yeast; Drosophila melanogaster; Resource allocation","fecundity; longevity; reproduction; resource allocation; starvation resistance; trade-off; article; caloric intake; diet; dietary intake; drosophila melanogaster; egg production; energy metabolism; metabolic rate; nonhuman; resource allocation; yeast; Diptera; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophilidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031215096

Natural gas applications have been extensively developed globally and include town gas, electricity generation by gas turbine or gas engine, and vehicle fuel. Natural gas is a more environmentally friendly fuel than liquid fuel and extends engine life.

Transpiration by trees in windbreak, consequently, can be expected to deviate substantially from the equilibrium rate as a result of advection and vertical entrainment, which may therefore influence water budgets for windbreak systems and competitive interactions between trees and crops. To quantify the effects of advection and entrainment on transpiration by windbreak trees, the energy budgets of canopies of Azadirachta indica A. Juss. windbreaks at a site in southern Niger were measured at four different times of year. Each component of the energy budget was determined independently and expressed per unit of windbreak length: net radiation (R(n)) was measured using an array of eight linear net radiometers enclosing the windbreak foliage; latent heat fluxes (λE) were determined by scaling sap flow, measured using the heat pulse technique, from tree to windbreak length on the basis of leaf area: sensible heat fluxes (H) were determined from measurements of the difference in temperature between the crown of a windbreak tree and ambient air, using aerodynamic conductances estimated by scaling up in situ measurements of leaf boundary layer conductances; the change in heat storage by the canopy (ΔS) was estimated from changes in wood temperature over time. ΔS was found to be a negligible component of the energy budget of windbreak canopies and comparison of λE + H with R(n) showed good agreement. R(n) was mostly dissipated as λE during the rainy season and early dry season but as H during the driest period of the year. Examination of exchange fluxes for the windbreaks showed that partitioning of energy by windbreak canopies was strongly affected at all times of year by exchanges of energy between sensible and latent heat at canopy surfaces as a result of advection and entrainment. During moist periods of the year, advection and entrainment enhanced λE relative to λE(eq), the latent heat flux at equilibrium, by up to 60%, but depressed λE during the driest time of year, so that λE was as low as 40% of λE(eq). Depression of λE relative to λE(eq) by advection and entrainment occurred when surface conductantes of the windbreaks were reduced by lack of moisture, whereas λE was enhanced when surface conductances were high. The effects of advection and entrainment on water use by windbreak trees must be accounted for when assessing the water budgets of windbreak systems, because any reductions in evapotranspiration by crops resulting from shelter may be offset by enhancement of tree transpiration.","Canopy; Energy budget; Sahel; Windbreak","aerodynamics; turbulence; wind; boundary layer; energy budget; transpiration; tree canopy; wind break; Africa, Sahel; Niger, Sahel; Azadirachta indica; Azadirachta juss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030858626

To understand why wood production decreases in the final stages of stand development, the influence of increasing tree size on foliage chemical composition and substrate requirement for foliage construction in terms of glucose [CC, g glucose (g dry mass)-1] was investigated in the evergreen conifer Picea abies (L.) Karst. Because it was already known that irradiance affects both foliage morphology and chemistry in this species, and it was expected that the foliage in large overstory trees would intercept on average more light than that in saplings in understory, irradiance was measured in the sampling locations and included in the statistical models. CC of needles increased with increasing total tree height (TH) and was independent of relative irradiance. A major reason for increasing CC with increasing TH was a greater proportion of carbon-rich lignin in the needles in large trees. However, lignin did not fully account for the observed changes in CC, and it was necessary to assume that certain other carbon-rich secondary metabolites such as terpenes also accumulate in the foliage of large trees. Enhanced requirements for needle mechanical strength as evidenced by greater lignin concentrations in large trees were attributed to increased water limitations with increasing tree height. Because water relations may also control the sink capacities for assimilate usage, apart from the mechanical requirements, they may provide an explanation for the accumulation of other energetically expensive compounds in the needles as well. Biomass partitioning within the shoot was another foliar parameter modified in response to increasing tree size. The proportion of shoot axes, which serve to provide needles with mechanical support and to supply them with water, decreased with increasing TH. This may limit water availability in the needles, and/or manifest a lower water requirement of the needles containing proportionally more supporting and storage substances, and consequently, less physiologically active compounds such as proteins. Probably the same factors which caused CC of the needles to depend on TH, were also responsible for greater CC of the shoot axes in larger trees. These results collectively suggest that increasingly more adverse water relations with increasing tree size may provide a mechanistic explanation for the decline in foliar biomass and its functional activity during stand ageing.","Carbon concentration; Construction cost; Irradiance; Lignin concentration; Needle morphology","Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030849810

Methods: After 2 weeks of partial outlet obstruction, rabbit bladders were stimulated in vitro both isovolumetrically [field stimulation (FS)] and to empty (FS, bethanechol, and KCl). Results: The obstructed bladders were separated into two groups according to their ability to empty when stimulated with FS. Compensated bladders were those that could empty as much as controls. Decompensated bladders emptied significantly less than controls. With FS and bethanechol, the compensated obstructed bladders showed no difference from the control bladders in their ability to empty. In contrast, with KCl, the compensated bladders generated significantly less pressure, performed less work, and emptied less than controls. When the decompensated bladders were stimulated with all three types of stimulation, all parameters, including emptying ability, were significantly decreased. Conclusions: The reduction in the response of compensated bladders to KCl stimulation suggested that the initial defects to the bladder after an outlet obstruction involved the interaction of smooth muscle proteins with calcium and ATP. In contrast, the response of decompensated bladders to all three forms of stimulation was equally reduced, suggesting that the degenerative processes were directly related to significant cellular damage to metabolic processes involved in energy synthesis, storage, and utilization.","Bladder; Function; Obstruction; Rabbit; Stimulation; Work","adenosine triphosphate; bethanechol; calcium; muscle protein; potassium chloride; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bladder contraction; bladder obstruction; controlled study; electrostimulation; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rabbit; Animals; Bethanechol; Electric Stimulation; Male; Parasympathomimetics; Potassium Chloride; Rabbits; Stimulation, Chemical; Urinary Bladder Neck Obstruction; Urodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030766251

To record data using volume holographic storage, data is encoded on a laser beam with a spatial light modulator (SLM). The object beam is directed into an optically sensitive material, typically a photorefractive crystal, and superimposed with a coherent reference beam, forming interference gratings. The material reacts to the interference pattern by spatial modulation of its optical absorption or refractive index. During data retrieval the reference beam alone illuminates the modulated region, causing diffraction of a beam that is modulated as if it were generated by the original object beam incident on the SLM; that is a duplicate of the original object beam. This beam is imaged onto a photodetector array for capture and decoding. Because the data are stored and retrieved as a two- dimensional matrix, a volume holographic storage system is inherently parallel. Consequently, data is read many bits (conceivably in the range of megabits) at a time, so that this approach offers the potential of high data retrieval rates, on the order of tens of gigabits per second and access times of much less than a millisecond. Data recording speeds are very dependent on the choice of storage material and energy of the laser. System capacity and capability are a consequence of three major interrelated factors: (1) the time -energy requirement of the storage material and the permanence of the stored data; (2) the capacity and efficiency of the spatial light modulator; and (3) the laser's power, physical size, and coherence properties. When compared with traditional flat surface magnetic or optical storage, volume holographic data storage has the potential of advantageous capacity, speed, weight, power, and physical size. While these are attractive attributes, they are particularly useful for space applications. This paper presents an assessment of the past, present, and future of holographic memories by consideration of the various developments since the initial concept of volume holographic data storage. © (1997) 2017 SPIE.","Holographic data storage; Mass data storage; Page-Access memory; Volume holography","Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Holography; Laser beams; Light absorption; Light modulation; Light modulators; Magnetic storage; Nonvolatile storage; Optical design; Photorefractive crystals; Refractive index; Space applications; Storage (materials); Holographic data storage; Mass data; Spatial light modulators; Volume holographic data storage; Volume holographic memory; Volume holographic storage; Volume holographic storage system; Volume holography; Optical data storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037524738

Other studies indicate that prolonged dietary restriction can attenuate many of the detrimental effects of age. We have shown previously using in vivo electrochemistry that K+-evoked striatal DA overflow decreases as a function of age. This was a regional effect that appeared to be due to functional changes in DA neurons, rather than a decrease in the storage and synthesis of DA. In the present studies, we used in vivo electrochemistry to investigate the effects of caloric restriction on age related decreases in K+-evoked DA overflow along a dorsal to ventral axis in the striatum of aged female Fischer 344 rats. Aged (26-28-month-old) diet restricted animals (DRF) showed evoked DA overflow that was significantly greater in amplitude and duration compared to aged (26-28-month-old) ad lib fed animals (ALF). These results provide additional evidence that decreased DA neuronal function resulting from age is improved by caloric restriction.","Aging; Caloric restriction; DA overflow; Electrochemistry; In vivo; Mesolimbic; Mesostriatal","aged; aging; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; binding affinity; caloric restriction; diet restriction; electrochemistry; evoked response; limbic cortex; neurochemistry; nonhuman; nucleus accumbens; priority journal; rat; receptor binding; senescence; Aging; Animals; Corpus Striatum; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Diet; Dopamine; Electrophysiology; Energy Intake; Female; Neurons; Nucleus Accumbens; Potassium; Potassium Channels; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342275259

PC with higher molar mass, notch radius, or rubber-modification possesses a higher critical strain rate when the ductile-brittle transition occurs. Whether a notched specimen will fail in a ductile mode or a brittle mode is already decided before the onset of the crack initiation. If size of the precrack plastic zone exceeds a critical level prior to onset of crack initiation, the crack extension developed later will propagate within the plastic zone and result in a ductile mode fracture. The precrack elastic storage energy, the input energy subtracting the hysteresis energy, is the main driving force to strain the crack tip for crack initiation. The precrack hysteresis energy (directly related to the precrack plasticity) increases with the decrease of the applied strain rate. Therefore, the strain rate is also closely related to the size of the precrack plastic zone. If the strain rate is lower than the critical strain rate, the specimen is able to grow a precrack plastic zone exceeding the critical plastic zone and results in a ductile mode fracture. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Ductile-brittle transition; Hysteresis; Polycarbonate; Strain rate","Brittleness; Crack initiation; Ductility; Fracture; Hysteresis; Molecular weight; Strain rate; Ductile brittle transition; Polycarbonates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031191109

The product reverted to 1 upon heating in solution or in the solid state, under the latter conditions with an enthalpy change of -29.8 (1.5) kcal mol-1. Mechanistic studies with a mixture of 1 and 1-d8 revealed the absence of label scrambling, pointing to intramolecular pathways. The quantum yield (0.15) was unaffected by the presence of CC14, and no chlorination products were observed under these conditions. Irradiation of solutions of 1 or 2 with 300 nm light provided Fv(μ2-η1:η5-cyclopentadienyl)2Ru4(CO)6 (6) or, in the presence of alkynes, the adducts FvRu2(CO)3(RCCR) (8-10, R = H, C6H5, CO2CH3). Heating 1 and PR3 (R = CH2CH3, CH3, or OCH3) yielded FvRu2(CO)3(PR3) (12-14), in which a fluxional process occurs characterized by intramolecular terminal to bridging carbonyl exchange. While 12 and 13 were inert, compound 14 rapidly and reversibly afforded the P(OCH3)3- substituted analog of 2 (15) upon irradiation with UV-light. The-two diastereomeric 3,3'-di-tert-butyl-substituted fulvalene analogs of 1 (19) underwent the same reaction sequence with complete retention of stereochemistry, via the diastereomeric photoproducts 20. A double regiochemical labeling experiment proceeded with retention of connectivity and stereochemistry. A concerted mechanism for the photoisomerization is consistent with the experimental observations, but a biradical pathway cannot be ruled out. Kinetic data for the isomerizations of 2, 15, 20a, and 20b to their respective metal-metal-bonded Fv precursors were determined. The entropies of activation (+7 to +21 eu) suggested a disordered transition state. A sequence involving reversible CO loss was ruled out through a crossover experiment with 2-13CO. Kinetic and labeling experiments point to a change in mechanism when the thermal reversion of 2 to 1 was run under CO(~l atm). The occurrence of ligand-induced C-C coupling was indicated through studies of the reactivity of 2 with P(CH3)3. Photoisomer 2 reacts with excess CCl4 to give FvRu2(CO)4C12) by yet another mechanism. As in the potoisomerization of 1, the thermal reversion of 2 may follow a concerted pathway, although biradical intermediates cannot be excluded.",,"alkyne; carbon tetrachloride; fulvalene; organometallic compound; ruthenium complex; unclassified drug; article; entropy; irradiation; isomerism; photochemistry; stereochemistry; ultraviolet radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030760141

The theory is based on a statistical approach to the storage of dislocations. This approach predicts that the slip length, L, scales with the inverse square root of the stored dislocation density, ρ-1/2, and also, predicts a substructure evolution which is consistent with the concept of microstructural scaling (similitude) at zero degree Kelvin, at stress τ &lt; τIII. The model provides a solution to the basic 'dislocation-book-keeping-problem' by defining a differential equation which regulates the storage of dislocations into (i) a cell interior dislocation network, (ii) increases in boundary misorientation and (iii) the creation of new cell boundaries. By combining such a solution for the dislocation storage problem with models for the dynamic recovery of network dislocations and sub-boundary structures, the result becomes a general internal state variable solution which has the potential of giving the flow stress as a function of strain for any combination of strain-rate and temperature. The theory predicts that the dislocation density ρi inside the cells saturates at the end of the Stage II-III transition, a saturation effect which regulates the subsequent stress-strain behaviour which is then controlled by the continuous refinement of the cell/subgrain structure. The characteristic features of Stages III and IV are well accounted for by the model. The present work hardening model also provides the necessary basis for the construction of constitutive laws for the saturation stresses; τIII, τIIIs and τs and steady-state creep. Beyond Stage II breakdown only two rate controlling dynamic recovery mechanisms are involved, relating to dislocation network growth and subgrain growth. The activation energy of both growth reactions is that of self diffusion. Steady-state creep laws are presented covering the entire range from low temperature creep to Harper-Dorn creep. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The importance of this relationship has been shown in black prepubescent females, who consumed more calories as fat than white females. Moreover, black adult females are heavier and have significant higher cardiovascular disease mortality rates than white females. THE INFLUENCE OF DIETARY FAT ON FOOD INTAKE: An overview of animal and human studies has indicated that high-fat diets induce greater food intake and weight gain than high-carbohydrate diets. Several factors such as caloric density, satiety properties, palatability and post-absorbtive processing can contribute to this different response to high-fat diets. Accordingly, the satiating effects after meals with a high fat:carbohydrate ratio is less than for meals with a lower ratio. Some authors have reported that the most important variable influencing meal size is not the level of hunger but the nutrient content of the range of foods consumed. Thus dietary fat has a weak effect on satiety and we suggest that periodic exposure to a high-fat meal, particularly when hunger is high, may be sufficient to lead to overconsumption of energy as fat in obese patients. DIETARY FAT AND FAT BALANCE: Energy balance is well correlated with fat balance in lean controls, whereas there is no correlation with either carbohydrate or protein balances. Several authors have shown that carbohydrate and protein storage is closely regulated by adjusting oxidation to intake, whereas fat is almost exclusively used or stored in response to day-to-day fluctuations in energy balance. The positive relationship between fat intake and lipid oxidation seen in lean controls appears not to be present in obese patients. On high-fat diets, post-obese women failed to increase the ratio of fat to carbohydrate oxidation appropriately. Increasing dietary fat results in preferential fat storage in post-obese women, impaired suppression of carbohydrate oxidation and reduction of 24 h energy expenditure. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary fat induces overconsumption and weight gain through its low satiety properties and high caloric density. Obese and post-obese subjects do not appear to adapt appropriately to dietary fat, and therefore fat storage is increased.","Dietary; Fat; Obesity","caloric intake; cardiovascular disease; conference paper; disease severity; energy balance; energy expenditure; fat intake; food intake; human; hunger; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; mortality; nutrient; obesity; oxidation; palatability; priority journal; satiety; weight gain; Adult; Animals; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dietary Fats; Energy Intake; Female; Humans; Male; Obesity; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030914304

The simultaneous exposure to the pulsed laser light in resonance with the 0-0 S1 ← S0 transition and the continuous blue light absorbed by the Tn ← T1 transitions leads to a much faster hole burning than the irradiation with the laser light alone. This photon gating effect is observed in many reactive solvent glasses or the mixtures of a reactive component and the inert diluent. In solvent glasses containing electron acceptors (alkyl halogenides, tert-butyl peroxybenzoate, ethyl diazoacetate) the two-quantum photooxidation results in the bleaching of porphyrin absorption bands and formation of cation radical absorption at 650-700 nm (in the case of MgOEP). In the presence of electron donors (triethylamine) and alkenes the photoreaction can be observed only in the hole-burning regime because upon broad-band irradiation the intensity and position of the 0-0 band remain unchanged. The hole burning in these systems stems from sensitized photoprocesses leading to the rearrangement of pigment environment. The microscopic solvent shift of the zero-phonon transition frequency of the pigment following cis-trans isomerization of the alkene molecules or reversible electron transfer results in the formation of a dip in absorption. In this case ""antiholes"" are observed as a result of intensity redistribution within the 0-0 band. Depending on the height of the triplet level of the alkene the sensitization can take place by means of triplet energy transfer from either the Tn or T1 state (to cyclooctatetraene) of the pigment. The influence of concentration, chemical structure, reduction potential, and the height of triplet energy level of activators as well as the matrix properties on the efficiency of gated hole burning has been investigated. The reactivities of aliphatic halocarbons and amines, aromatic electron acceptors and donors, cyclic and linear olefins with and without electron-accepting substituents, and other compounds have been studied. The most efficient sensitizers have been selected and doped in the polymer films which are more convenient for the applications of spectral hole burning in optical data storage.",,"Charge transfer; Composition effects; Electron energy levels; Isomerization; Laser pulses; Light absorption; Magnesium compounds; Molecular structure; Olefins; Photons; Solvents; Zinc compounds; Magnesium octaethylporphine; Photon gating effect; Zinc tetrabenzoporphine; Organometallics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031551143

Evaporation from both water bodies is calculated using Penman-Brutsaert formulation in which atmospheric buoyancy is calculated based on the semi-empirical theory of Monin-Obukhov formulation. A new iterative procedure is presented in this paper to solve for the water temperature. The present model attains a rapid convergence and compares favorably with temperature and evaporation observations obtained for a hypersaline pond and deep sunken pans. Calculations show that the average daily evaporation rates from the hypersaline pond during January and July are 0.5 and 6.4 mm day-1. Corresponding values for the freshwater pond are 2.4 and 10.45 mm day-1, respectively. Salinity suppresses evaporation strongly during winter because of its coupling effects on net radiation and saturation vapor pressure. During summer, energy availability accounts for 74% and 64% of total diurnal evaporation from the hypersaline pond and freshwater, respectively. In winter, however, the aerodynamic term accounts for about 80% of evaporation from both water bodies. Heat storage/release within the underlying sediments appears to be negligibly small and may be neglected with very little loss of accuracy when formulating the energy balance of shallow lakes.

Energy mobilization was induced by a 3 d fast and the changes in body content of fat and lean tissues were used to estimate the fasting P ratio (P(fast)). Tissue storage was subsequently effected by 17 d of refeeding and the corresponding ratio (P(refed) was calculated from the amounts of lean and fat tissue regained. The same experimental protocol was used for measuring P(fast), and P(refed) in weanling (30 d) and adult (130 d) rats. Weight-matched individuals were assigned to three groups. All animals in group 1 were killed at the beginning of the experiment. Animals in group 2 were fasted for 3 d and then killed. Group 3 animals were first fasted for 3 d, then had free access to a stock diet for a further 17 d before being killed. During fasting, a close linear relationship was found between weight change and body energy changes (r 0.985, and r 0.92, P < 0.001 for weanlings and adult rats respectively) and between carcass N loss and urinary N loss (r 0.933, P < 0.001). These relationships were used to estimate the body energy and N content of each animal at the end of the initial fasting period. Hence, both P(fast) and P(refed) values could be calculated for all individuals at both ages. When P(fast), and P(refed) were calculated for adult rats, the mean values were similar (0.138 (SE 0.002) and 0.130 (SE 0.006) respectively). Individually, the P(fast) and P(refed) values were correlated (r 0.54, P = 0.058). In weanling rats, the mean P(refed) value was about 2.5 times the P(fast) (0.421 (SE 0.0113) v. 0.156 (SE 0.004)). Despite the differences in P(fast) and P(refed), the individual values were again correlated (r 0.668, P < 0.05). These results support the suggestion made by Payne and Dugdale, that particular P-ratio values are characteristic of individuals and describe the extent to which protein is mobilized or stored during fasting or refeeding. These observations are discussed in relation to the predictions made by the Payne-Dugdale model.","Energy-protein mobilization; Energy-protein storage; P ratio","nitrogen; protein; adipose tissue; animal experiment; article; body weight; controlled study; diet restriction; energy balance; energy transfer; lean body weight; male; mobilization; nitrogen urine level; nonhuman; rat; tissue distribution; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Energy Transfer; Fasting; Feces; Female; Growth; Male; Models, Biological; Nitrogen; Proteins; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Weaning; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030845508

We hypothesized that a preterm infant formula with a higher protein:energy (P:E) ratio would promote accretion rates of fat, fat-free mass, and minerals closer to those of the fetus. Methods: As part of a larger study to determine whether accretion rates of fat and fat-free mass closer to those of the fetus can be achieved with a higher P:E ratio, we present a descriptive analysis of 72-h nutrient balance studies performed on a subset (n = 15/30) of the infants randomly assigned to be fed formula with a P:E ratio of either 3.2 g/100 kcal or 2.6 g/100 kcal. Results: Despite the higher intake and net absorption of nitrogen by infants fed the higher P:E formula, there was no statistically significant difference in net nitrogen retention between groups. There also were no statistically significant differences between groups in digestible energy, metabolizable energy, energy expenditure, or energy storage. Thus, partitioning of stored energy as protein and fat did not differ between groups. The retention of calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, copper, and zinc also did not differ between groups, and nitrogen intake did not affect mineral retention. Conclusions: In this study, formula for preterm infants with a P:E ratio of 3.2 g/100 kcal vs. 2.6 g/100 kcal provided no apparent benefit in terms of the proportion of fat to lean tissue accretion as determined from nutrient balance data.","Energy; Formula; Minerals; Nitrogen; Nutrient balance; Protein infants","calcium; copper; nitrogen; phosphorus; potassium; sodium; zinc; article; artificial milk; body fat; clinical article; human; human cell; human tissue; infant; infant feeding; nitrogen metabolism; prematurity; priority journal; protein calorie malnutrition; weight gain; Calcium; Cohort Studies; Copper; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant Food; Infant Nutrition Physiology; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Magnesium; Male; Minerals; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; Sodium; Zinc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030834250

The incidence of Arg64 allele was 0.21; no age- dependent decrease of the allele frequency was observed, suggesting that the mutation was not associated with early mortality. The genotype was not significantly correlated with body mass index or the thickness of visceral fat estimated by ultrasonography. Glucose tolerance and glucose-induced insulin secretion were not significantly different among subjects with Trp/Trp, Trp/Arg and Arg/Arg at codon 64. Although in obese persons the ratio of heterozygotes for the mutation tended to be higher in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance than in subjects with normal glucose tolerance, the tendency was not observed in non-obese persons. Furthermore none of 39 non-obese individuals homozygous for the mutation was diabetic, whereas two out of six obese homozygous persons were diabetic. These observations suggest that the missense mutation may not be a main determinant of obesity in populations taking low fat/low energy Japanese-style diet and it may not be deleterious at least in non-obese individuals.","β3-adrenergic receptor; Impaired glucose tolerance; Obesity; Visceral fat","adult; aged; article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; dna polymorphism; female; human; impaired glucose tolerance; japan; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; obesity; Adipose Tissue; Body Mass Index; Codon; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Glucose Tolerance Test; Homozygote; Humans; Insulin; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Point Mutation; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Genetic; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-3; Sex Characteristics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030796945

Its freshwater systems are dominated by a low energy environment and cold region processes. Central northern areas are almost totally influenced by arctic air masses while Pacific air becomes more prominent in the west, Atlantic air in the east and southern air masses at the lower latitudes. Air mass changes will play an important role in precipitation changes associated with climate warming. The snow season in the region is prolonged resulting in long-term storage of water so that the spring flood is often the major hydrological event of the year, even though, annual rainfall usually exceeds annual snowfall. The unique character of ponds and lakes is a result of the long frozen period, which affects nutrient status and gas exchange during the cold season and during thaw. GCM models are in close agreement for this region and predict temperature increases as large as 4°C in summer and 9°C in winter for a 2 × CO2 scenario. Palaeoclimate indicators support the probability that substantial temperature increases have occurred previously during the Holocene. The historical record indicates a temperature increase of &gt; 1°C in parts of the region during the last century. GCM predictions of precipitation change indicate an increase, but there is little agreement amongst the various models on regional disposition or magnitude. Precipitation change is as important as temperature change in determining the water balance. The water balance is critical to every aspect of hydrology and limnology in the far north. Permafrost close to the surface plays a major role in freshwater systems because it often maintains lakes and wetlands above an impermeable frost table, which limits the water storage capabilities of the subsurface. Thawing associated with climate change would, particularly in areas of massive ice, stimulate landscape changes, which can affect every aspect of the environment. The normal spring flooding of ice-jammed north-flowing rivers, such as the Mackenzie, is a major event, which renews the water supply of lakes in delta regions and which determines the availability of habitat for aquatic organisms. Climate warming or river damming and diversion would probably lead to the complete drying of many delta lakes. Climate warming would also change the characteristics of ponds that presently freeze to the bottom and result in fundamental changes in their limnological characteristics. At present, the food chain is rather simple usually culminating in lake trout or arctic char. A lengthening of the growing season and warmer water temperature would affect the chemical, mineral and nutrient status of lakes and most likely have deleterious effects on the food chain. Peatlands are extensive in region 2. They would move northwards at their southern boundaries, and, with sustained drying, many would change form or become inactive. Extensive wetlands and peatlands are an important component of the global carbon budget, and warmer and drier conditions would most likely change them from a sink to a source for atmospheric carbon. There is some evidence that this may be occurring already. Region 2 is very vulnerable to global warming. Its freshwater systems are probably the least studied and most poorly understood in North America. There are clear needs to improve our current knowledge of temperature and precipitation patterns; to model the thermal behaviour of wetlands, lakes and rivers; to understand better the interrelationships of cold region rivers with their basins; to begin studies on the very large lakes in the region; to obtain a firm grasp of the role of northern peatlands in the global carbon cycle; and to link the terrestrial water balance to the thermal and hydrological regime of the polar sea. Overall, there is a strong need for basic research and long-term monitoring. ©1997 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Arctic and subarctic North America; Climate change; Freshwater; Global warming","Salmonidae; Salvelinus alpinus; Salvelinus namaycush; Freshwaters; General circulation models (GCM); Limnology; Drying; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Global warming; Hydrology; Ice; Lakes; Permafrost; Rain; Rivers; Snow; Thermal effects; Surface waters; cabon dioxide doubling; caron budget; climate change; climatic change; freshwater ecosystem; hydrological response; hydrology; limnology; Arctic; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031158604

By definition, emergy i the solar energy directly and indirectly required to generate a flow or a storage. Exergy is a property of a system, measuring the maximum work that can be extracted from a system when it goes towards the thermodynamic equilibrium with a reference state. The concept of emergy contains the history, the time and all the different processes involved up to the present state of the system, while exergy is a measure of the actual state, of the level of organization and of the information content. These two approaches are very suitable for describing self-organizing systems such as ecosystems. The ratio of the emergy flow to the exergy can give further information on the state of a system, showing what concentration of solar energy equivalent, space and time (emergy) is required to maintain or create a unit of organization (exergy). The proposed index is related to the efficiency with which a system organizes itself or, if steady, maintains its complexity. To test this approach we considered three coastal lagoons. Two of them are artificial, built by man to purify sewage. One is a control pond fed with estuarine water and 'clean' water from the local sewage treatment plant, and one is a 'waste pond' fed with estuarine water mixed with more 'polluted' (i.e. richer in nutrients) effluent. The third system is the lagoon of Caprolace (Italy) a 'natural' system, placed in a national park.

Ga is a bistable center in CdF2 crystals. Illumination by visible and UV light below 500 nm causes phototransformation of these centers from a deep-localized to a shallow-hydrogenic state. They are separated by a vibronic barrier that causes metastability below 250 K. The phototransformation changes the local polarizability. and thus, the local refractive coefficient. This, in turn, allows writing a phase hologram with a diffraction efficiency and decay time being temperature dependent with the activation energy Eact= 0.65±0.1 eV. A spontaneous decay of the grating is caused by a thermal recovery of the Ga impurity from the metastable hydrogenic state to the localized ground state.

One particular aspect of this process is concerned with the fact that compared to a linac plus storage ring or synchrotron configuration, a given proton beam power can be achieved at substantially lower costs by using a linear accelerator only with long pulses in the ms range. Long pulses also make it possible to deliver higher proton beam energies per pulse, which primarily determines instrument performance in low wavelength resolution applications such as small-angle scattering. Monte-Carlo simulation results also show that the long pulse approach is also superior to the short pulse option in a category of thermal neutron experiments, such as medium-resolution powder diffraction. Short pulses are only required for best use of the epithermal neutron spectrum and for the highest wavelength resolution thermal neutron work. Long pulse sources can be either conceived as stand-alone facilities or as one of the target stations at a combined short pulse-long pulse installation, and have the potential to offer higher neutron intensities by more than an order of magnitude in comparable experiments than the best existing high-flux reactors.","Instrument simulation; Long pulse sources; Neutron sources; Spallation","Computer simulation; Linear accelerators; Monte Carlo methods; Neutron diffraction; Particle beams; Protons; Neutron spallation sources; Neutron sources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031548239

This is not seen in other steinernematid species so we proposed that carbohydrate may be important for infectivity in aging IJs of S. carpocapsae. The present study investigated glycogen utilization in IJs of 4 entomopathogenic nematodes, S. calpocapsae, S. riobravis (Biosys 355), S. feltiae (UK76) and S. glaseri (NC), stored in distilled water at 25°C. The 4 species had appreciable amounts of glycogen; from ca. 8% dry weight in S. riobravis to ca. 18%, in S. glaseri. Infective juveniles of S. caprocapsae and S. riobravis survived for 120-135 days and utilized ca. 90% of their glycogen reserve at an almost Constant rate during a 112-day storage period. Steinernema feltiae and S. glaseri lived for much longer (&gt; 450 days) and during a 250-day storage period their glycogen content decreased by 27 and 40%, respectively. In contrast to the other 3 species, the rate of lipid decline preceded that of glycogen in S. carpocapsae. The rate of glycogen decline in S. carpocapsae IJs incubated with the glycolytic inhibitor, iodoacetamide (10-4 M) was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) compared with untreated nematodes, and the infectivity of inhibitor-treated aged (&gt; 80 days) IJs was reduced compared with controls. Incubating aged (80-day) IJs of S. carpocapsae (mean neutral lipid content ca. 10% of initial level) with 10-4 M iodoacetamide for 24 h significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.5) their infectivity compared with freshly harvested inhibitor-treated IJs and untreated controls. Following an 11-day recovery period, the infectivity of inhibitor-treated aged IJs recovered significantly (P &lt; 0.05). The evidence suggests that glycogen is an important source of energy for maintaining infectivity in aged IJs of S. carpocapsae.","Entomopathogenic nematodes; Glycogen; Infectivity; Iodoacetamide; Utilization","glycogen; age; article; controlled study; energy metabolism; energy resource; nematode; nematodiasis; nonhuman; parasite virulence; priority journal; Animals; Culture Media; Glycogen; Iodoacetamide; Moths; Rhabditoidea; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030958029

Although energy storage contributes to the efficiency of locomotion, tendons are not perfectly elastic and some energy is lost in the form of heat. Recent studies have shown that the central core of equine SDFT reaches temperatures as high as 45 °C during high-speed locomotion. In this study, we test the hypothesis that hyperthermia causes tendon cell death and results in tendon central core degeneration. Tendon fibroblasts cultured from the core of the equine SDFT were subjected to a temperature of 45 °C in an in vitro system for 0-180 min, and cell survival fraction was measured and compared with that for equine dermal fibroblasts and a commercial rat kidney fibroblast cell line (NRK 49F). Tendon fibroblasts were significantly more resistant to hyperthermia than NRK 49F cells after 30, 45 and 60 min of heating and significantly more resistant than dermal fibroblasts after 45 and 60 min of heating. After 10 min of heating at 45 °C, the tendon fibroblast cell survival fraction was 91±4 %, whereas heating for 10 min at 48°C resulted in a drop in the cell survival fraction to 22±4 %. In conclusion, while temperatures experienced in the central core of the SDFT in vivo are unlikely to result in tendon cell death, repeated hyperthermic insults may compromise cell metabolism of matrix components, resulting in tendon central core degeneration.","Cell biology; Cell culture; Cell death; Cell proliferation; Degeneration; Exercise; Horse; Hyperthermia; Tendon; Tendon injury; Tendon mechanics","animal; animal experiment; article; cell culture; cell death; cytology; fever; horse; physiology; rat; tendon; Animals; Cell Death; Cells, Cultured; Fever; Horses; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Rats; Tendons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031172719

Aboriginals were less trusting, exhibited less faith in science and technology, and perceived the costs associated with the repository to be higher than their nonaboriginal counterparts.

The proposed design is a compact system, in which collectors and water storage tank are integrated together into one unit. The frustum of pyramid is used as an external shape for collecting the solar radiation and as a container for hot water storage tank. It has five surfaces, four surfaces represent liquid flat-plate collectors as roof and three sides which receive all the solar radiation incident on them. The roof and one of the sides are facing the south direction, while the other sides are facing the south-east and south-west directions, respectively. The total surface area of the collectors is about of 1.68 m2 and the capacity of the water storage tank is about 150 liters. The absorber consists of copper tubes formed as a serpentine shape which are connected to the tank by two openings (inlet &amp; outlet). A regulator is connected to the pipe line to control the hot water consumption and the reverse flow after the sunset. The thermal analysis of the liquid flat-plate collector and the performance of the solar water heater are derived based on the steady state analysis. A comparison between this compact unit and another elevated tank type is done. The results show that the proposed solar water heater gives a good performance and can provide a quantity of hot water of about 175 liters/day at an average temperature ranges from 40° - 60°C depending on the weather conditions and solar intensity.",,"Containers; Flow control; Heating; Performance; Piping systems; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Surfaces; Thermal effects; Thermoanalysis; Tubes (components); Water tanks; Absorber; Pyramid frustum; Steady state analysis; Solar water heaters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031161343

These storage systems are known as packed bed storage systems. This paper presents the thermal response of a packed bed used for thermal energy storage. The performance of the bed at different design conditions such as solid particles material and diameter, bed diameter and bed length are presented. Moreover, variation of the operating conditions such as: fluid mass velocity and inlet fluid temperature are considered.

The four ribs of the tymbal buckle inwards in sequence from posterior to anterior. Sound pulses were produced by pulling the tymbal apodeme to cause the tymbal to buckle inwards. A train of four sound pulses, each corresponding to the inward buckling of one rib, could be produced by each inward pull of the apodeme, followed by a single pulse as the tymbal buckled outwards after the release of the apodeme. Each preparation produced a consistent sequence of pulses. Each of the pulses produced had its maximum amplitude during the first cycle of vibration. The waveform started with an initial inward-going rarefaction followed by a larger outward compression, followed by an approximately exponential decay, as is typical of a resonant system. The mean dominant frequencies of the pulses produced during the inward movement were 4.37, 4.19, 3.92 and 3.17 kHz respectively. The pulse produced during the outward movement had a mean resonant frequency of 6.54 kHz. This suggests that the mass-to-stiffness ratio that determines the resonant frequencies of the various pulses differs from pulse to pulse. If succeeding pulses followed rapidly, the next pulse tended to start on the inward-going half-cycle of its predecessor and to produce a coherent waveform. Coherence was lost if the preceding pulse had decayed to below approximately one-tenth of its peak amplitude. When the tymbal plate was loaded by a 380 μg wire weight, the resonant frequency of all sound pulses was reduced. Pulses produced later in the inward buckling sequence were less affected by the loading than earlier ones. This suggests that the effective mass determining the resonance in the later pulses is greater than that in the earlier pulses. The frequency of the pulses produced in the outward movement was affected most, suggesting that the mass involved was less than that in any of the pulses produced by the inward movement. The quality factor, Q, of the pulses produced by the inward buckling of the unloaded tymbal was approximately 10. For the outward buckling, Q was approximately 6. The Q of loaded tymbals was higher than than that of unloaded tymbals. The Q of the resonances varied approximately as the reciprocal of the resonant frequency. Experimental removal of parts of the tymbal showed that the thick dorsal resilin pad was an important elastic determinant of the resonant frequency, but that the mass and elasticity of the tymbal ribs were also determinants of the resonant frequency. The major element of mass is the tymbal plate. The integrity of the tymbal ribs was essential if the buckling movement were to occur. The force required to cause inward buckling of the tymbal was approximately 0.25 N. The force required to hold the tymbal in the buckled-in position was approximately 0.05 N. This asymmetry in the tymbal compliance, together with the different masses involved in inward and outward buckling, may account for the difference between the resonant frequencies of the inward-going and outward-going clicks. The tymbal appears to act as an energy storage mechanism that releases energy as the tymbal ribs buckle inwards in sequence. Each pulse provides a large initial impulse to the abdominal resonator, followed by a sustaining resonant vibration at, or close to, the song frequency. Subsequent pulses maintain the coherent resonance of the song pulse.","Biomechanics; Cicada; Cyclochila australasiae; Energy storage; Insect; Resonance; Song","Cyclochila australasiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030975141

N6A 5B7, Canada","Copper is an essential metal ion to many living organisms, including mammals, as it mediates a wide variety of important biochemical processes. At elevated concentrations, copper is extremely toxic to host cells. This paradoxical nature of copper has necessitated a highly regulated procedure for its cellular accumulation, transport, and excretion. One important group of proteins involved in eukaryotic copper speciation is the protein metallothionein. Luminescence microscopy data, emission, and circular dichroism spectral data are reported as copper is incorporated into metallothionein by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These techniques provide information on the mechanism of copper uptake by S. cerevisiae. A two-stage kinetic mechanism for the uptake of copper from the growth medium by the yeast cells is observed. The first stage displays an uptake rate that is dependent on the initial copper concentration of the growth medium, and lasts for approximately 6 h. The second stage has a slower rate of copper uptake than the first, but the kinetics are independent of the initial copper concentration. Emission spectra recorded directly from the intact yeast cells (at 77 K) show that the cellular incorporation of copper proceeds via several species, eventually leading to storage of the copper in the form of Cu- metallothionein. The photomicrographs of yeast cells grown in a copper- containing medium clearly show an orange luminescence, indicating the formation of a Cu(I)-thiolate species. The identification of this species as copper-metallothionein was confirmed by measurement of the circular dichroism and emission properties following excretion and isolation of the copper- containing protein from the yeast cells. Analysis of the emission spectrum from S. cerevisiae Cu-metallothionein at 77 K reveals two emission bands, centered at 570 and 700 nm. The high-energy emission band exhibits a two- component decay, with excited state lifetimes of 4.70 and 48.5 μs. The low- energy emission exhibits one major decay component with a lifetime of 1.13 μs. A high-molecular-weight, copper-containing species is also isolated from the yeast cells and is characterized spectroscopically.",,"copper ion; metallothionein; article; binding kinetics; cell transport; emission tomography; metal binding; microscopy; molecular weight; reaction analysis; saccharomyces cerevisiae; Carrier Proteins; Circular Dichroism; Copper; Ion Transport; Kinetics; Luminescent Measurements; Metallothionein; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Spectrophotometry; Eukaryota; Mammalia; Mus; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030958567

On-site measurements in five households each of Hong Kong and Heshan showed that sun- or air-dried phytomass fuel significantly increased moisture, but decreased calorific value and nutrient concentration with storage time. The consumption of phytofuel depends on seasons, cooking habits, its availability and the prices of alternative fuels. Surveys were conducted in 70 households of Heshan, Shenzhen and Hong Kong to quantify the consumption of phytomass for fuel. On average, the Heshan households had a phytomass consumption of 1.77 (summer) or 2.15 kg per capita per day (winter); the Shenzhen households 1.37 (summer) or 1.72 kg per capita per day (winter); and the Hong Kong households 1.07 (summer) or 1.42 kg per capita per day (winter).

The lines were developed by directional selection for epididymal fat pad weight as a percentage of body weight (EFP%) which is highly correlated with body fat percentage. The HF line exceeded (P < 0.05) LF in weight gain, feed intake, feed efficiency, body weight, EFP% and serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Body water percentage, a measure of lean tissue percentage, and liver weight as a percentage of body weight were greater (P < 0.05) in the LF line compared to HF.

These systems consist of buried pipes circulating air for storing and removing heat from the soil. First, a transient fully three-dimensional heat transfer model resting on the coupled conservation equations of energy for the soil and the circulating air is presented. The model is validated with experimental data taken from a SHESS installed in a commercial type greenhouse. Next, the model is used to examine the effect of various design and operating parameters on the performance of SHESSs. Results indicate that the total amount of energy stored or recovered daily per volume Q(v) decreases exponentially with the pipe center-to-center distance and the pipe length. It increases with the air velocity and this effect is enhanced as the pipe center-to-center distance diminishes. Nevertheless, as a compromise between cost and performance, it appears that an air blowing velocity of 4 m s-1 is nearly optimal. As the moisture content of the soil increases, Q(v) augments but its effect becomes negligible for large pipe lengths and small blowing velocities. Adding side insulation improves the performance of the SHESS but the beneficial effect of insulation underneath the bottom pipe row is significant. Finally, burying pipes deeper underground allows more energy to be stored during the day but less is recovered at night through the ground surface and the overall performance declines.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030759850

The visual index was found to be a reliable and rapid method for determining the relative neutral lipid content of individual IJs and was validated quantitatively by gas chromatography. The relationship between neutral lipid utilization and infectivity of IJs stored in distilled water at 25°C was also investigated and the first quantitative results on neutral lipid utilization in entomopathogenic nematodes are reported. Neutral lipid contents of freshly harvested IJs of S. carpocapsae, S. riobravis, S. feltiae and S. glaseri were 31, 31, 24 and 26% dry wt, respectively. Steinernema carpocapsae showed a sigmoidal pattern for neutral lipid utilization while S. riobravis used neutral lipids at an almost constant rate. Survivorship of these two species ranged between 120 and 135 days, whereas S. feltiae and S. glaseri lived > 450 days and had a slower rate of lipid utilization during a 260 day storage period. Oil Red O staining showed that individual IJs in each population utilized lipids at different rates, even though they had the same initial lipid index. The infectivity of S. riobravis, S. feltiae and S. glaseri declined with lipid utilization. In contrast, S. carpocapsae maintained a high level of infectivity even at relatively low lipid levels. Therefore, neutral lipid content was found to be a suitable indicator of infectivity for S. riobravis, S. feltiae and S. glaseri but not for S. carpocapsae.","entomopathogenic; infectivity; nematodes; neutral lipid; Oil Red O; Steinernema spp.","lipid; article; controlled study; energy metabolism; gas chromatography; host parasite interaction; nematode; nonhuman; parasite virulence; priority journal; quantitative assay; Animals; Azo Compounds; Coloring Agents; Lipid Metabolism; Moths; Rhabditoidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030994569

After using such devices from different factories, we decided to build our own tube. Our choice is motivated by the great fragility of the tube, consequent to both bad vacuum during the experiment and moisture due to frequent air launching, and by the mastery of the technology which is necessary to repair rapidly sudi apparatuses. The characteristics of the tube, particularly shutter time and spectral response, must be known as exactly as possible. Consequently we describe in these pages the method used to measure a shutter time of about 75 ps and we appraise the errors due to the FWHM and the spatial unstability of the UV laser pulse employed to illuminate the front side of the MCP.

Its results, however, may be influenced by the dynamic properties of the equipment, if they are not much faster than those of the subject. When performing direct calorimetry at living beings, the dynamic properties of the system chamber-interior-subject must be taken into account. A simple model is known to correct for the dilution of metabolic gases in the chamber. Heat, however, is not simply diluted; it is stored in the chamber's interior and the subject's body too. A two-compartment-model was shown to correct heat storage effects in a furnished human calorimetric chamber. A method was established to estimate proper model parameter from alcohol combustion as calibration experiments. Heat storage resulted in 7.8 + 1.1% of all heat measured after extinguishing the flame. The 'wake period' lasted more than 3 h. Using the two-compartment-model this was overcorrected to -1.6 + 1.9% with the 'wake period' being less than 15 min. Humans or animals in the chamber would change the model parameter dramatically due to their large heat capacity.

Two experimental methods have been established which allow the determination of the cooling force for relative ion velocities from zero to 107 m/s. At low velocities the equilibrium between cooling and longitudinal heating with rf noise is used. For high relative velocities the cooling force is deduced from the momentum drift of the ion beam after a rapid change of the electron energy. Measurements for several ion species are presented which show a pronounced deviation from the expected q2 scaling in the regime of the magnetic cooling force. Further investigations have been performed to study the influence of magnetic field strength and beam energy on the longitudinal cooling force.","Electron cooling; Ion beam","Cooling; Electron beams; Ion beams; Magnetic field effects; Paramagnetic resonance; Electron cooling; Storage rings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031146319

The MI is to be completed in 1998, and it is planned to install the Recycler by the end of 1997 to reduce interference during the final rush of MI installation. Although the Recycler will employ stochastic cooling initially, its potential for contributing an order of magnitude to Tevatron collider luminosity is tied to electron cooling. The short time scale and Fermilab's limited familiarity with low energy electron beams has given rise to a two-phase development plan. The first phase is to build a cooling system based on an electron beam of ≥200 mA before the year 2000. The second phase of about three years is planned to reach an electron current of 2 A or more.

Thus, a tenfold increase in luminosity could be achieved by putting five times more protons on the antiproton production target and gaining an additional factor of two from recycling antiprotons left over from the previous store. Stacking and storing ten times more antiprotons puts an unbearable burden on the stochastic cooling system of the existing accumulator ring. Thus, one is led to consider an additional stage of antiproton storage, the so called recycler ring. Electron cooling of the 8 GeV antiprotons in the recycler could provide an attractive way around the problems of large stacks. Such a system would look much like the IUCF proposal to cool 12 GeV protons in the SSC medium energy booster [1]. Although electron cooling has now become a routine tool in many laboratories, its use has been restricted to lower energy accelerators (<500 MeV/ nucleon).

A series of experiments is being performed in the low-energy ring LEAR to test this technique. First results were already reported at the Beam Crystallisation Workshop in Erice in November 1995. Two more recent runs to complement these investigations were concerned with: further study of the beam lifetime; the dependence of the cooling time on optical settings of the storage ring and on neutralization of the electron beam; and tests in view of multiturn injection. New results obtained in these two runs in December 1995 and in April 1996 will be discussed in this contribution.","Charge exchange; Electron cooling; Ion accumulation; LHC; Multiturn injection; Storage ring","Charge transfer; Colliding beam accelerators; Cooling; Electron beams; Ion beams; Linear accelerators; Particle beam injection; Electron cooling; Ion accumulation; Large hadron collider (LHC); Multiturn injection; Storage rings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031144337

A longitudinal magnetic field for the focusing system and electron cooling of the positrons are essential features of the ring. The general limitations of the storage ring parameters are determined by the relation between scattering and cooling processes. The positron beam energy is determined by physics processes which are to be studied; it lies in the range from 5 up to 30 keV. The positron lifetime is about 100s at a vacuum pressure of 100 pTorr. The generation of slow antihydrogen atoms by using electrostatic deceleration of positrons and antiprotons is described. The lowest antihydrogen energy in such a scheme is about a few eV and the generation rate is about 1 atom per second. The positron storage ring design is described. The general parameters of the positron storage ring, which is under design in JINR, are presented. The main purpose of the proposed machine construction is the performance of experimental studies of intense positron beam storing, electron cooling and deceleration in a straight section.","Antihydrogen; Electron cooling; Positronium; Slow positrons","Cooling; Electron beams; Magnetic fields; Antihydrogen; Electron cooling; Low energy positron storage rings; Positronium; Storage rings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031143586

The reason of this interest has many aspects: knowledge either of a completely new research field or of some of the applicative potentialities, connected with crystalline beams, would justify a careful investigation of this subject. After the successful exploitation of electron cooling in several heavy ion storage rings the possibility of generating crystalline ion beams became more realistic. New cooling methods, like laser cooling, give a further opportunity to reach an ultracold system of particles necessary for the state transition to the crystalline configuration. The conceptual design of a low-energy heavy-ion storage ring, called CRYSTAL, proposed for the experimental demonstration of crystalline beams at Legnaro Laboratories is presented. The physics of crystalline beams as well as the main criteria to design a storage ring suitable to crystallize ion beams are discussed. The effects of instabilities for space charge dominated beams, shear forces in dipole magnets and lattice periodicity breaking are also discussed in detail.","Crystalline beam; Electron cooling; Storage ring","Accelerator magnets; Cooling; Electric space charge; Electron beams; Ion beams; Laser applications; Crystalline beams; Electron cooling; Storage rings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031140237

In contrast to the widely used Ni-Cd batteries they display up to 50% higher storage capacity and, due to the absence of Cd, an improved environmental compatibility. The electrochemically active material at the negative electrode is a hydrogen storage alloy. In most commercial applications so-called AB5 alloys having a CaCu5 type crystal structure have been used so far. These commercial AB5 alloys are usually of the type Mm(Ni,Co,Al,Mn)5, containing typically 10 wt% Co. Mm denotes Mischmetal, a cost-effective mixture of the rare earths La, Ce, Pr and Nd. The large amount of Co is added to produce an alloy with a reasonable cycle life, but increases the alloy cost considerably. The Ni-MH system is considered as a promising energy source for pure electric vehicles and hybrid cars. However for this application it is necessary to decrease the Co content in these alloys without diminishing the cycle life endurance. Hydrogen storage alloy production by gas atomisation represents a promising way to achieve this goal.","AB5 alloys; Cycle life; Gas atomisation; Low Co content","Atomization; Cobalt; Cost effectiveness; Crystal structure; Electrochemical electrodes; Mixtures; Secondary batteries; Cycle life; Gas atomisation; Hydrogen storage alloy; Mischmetal; Rechargeable nickel metal hydride battery; Nickel alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031130544

Previous experimental results showed that there was a hydrogen adsorption phenomenon on the alloy surface and the activation energy barrier of the electrochemical reaction process should be reduced by hydrogen adsorption. Therefore, the hydrogen adsorption is of benefit in improving the electrocatalytic activity of the alloy electrode. In this work, the hydrogen adsorption performance on the surfaces of Zr(V0.2Mn0.2Ni0.6)2.4, MmNi3.6Mn0.4Co0.75Al0.25 alloy electrodes and carbonyl nickel electrode was measured by means of cyclic voltammetry. In addition, the hydrogen adsorption performance of the metal nickel ribbon was performed by electrochemical impedance spectra. The results showed that the Ni sites on the surface of the metal hydride electrodes play an important role in the hydrogen adsorption.","Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemical impedance; Hydrogen adsorption; Metal hydride electrode","Adsorption; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemical electrodes; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Nickel; Surface structure; Surfaces; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Metal hydride electrode; Metal nickel electrode; Alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031130543

To this end, the dissolution rate of compressed halite powders was measured using the rotating disk method as a function of temperature, solute saturation state and the concentration of aqueous trace metals. The results of these experiments were used to generate dissolution and transport rate constants, as well as activation energies for these processes at temperatures from 25° to 80°C. Results indicate that in the absence of trace metals, constant-temperature halite dissolution rates vary linearly with the overall mineral saturation state. The presence of trace quantities of Fe and Zn were found to negligibly affect halite dissolution, while trace quantities of Co, Cr, Cd and Pb significantly lowered halite dissolution rates. At constant trace-metal concentration, halite dissolution rates were found to vary in the order: Fe ≈ Zn > Co > Cr > Pb > Cd. A combined transition state theory/Langmuir adsorption model was developed and demonstrated to effectively describe measured rates as a function of solution composition.","Experimental studies; Halite dissolution; Kinetics; Saturation state; Trace metals","dissolution; halite; radioactive waste storage; reaction kinetics; saturation state; trace metal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030767118

A group of 7 control subjects (C), matched groupwise for sex, age and BMI with PO(II) patients, was also studied. The M value at PO(I) was significantly higher than at Ob (49.12 ± 8.57 vs 18.14 ± 8.57 μmol · kg-1 · min-1). No statistical difference was observed between the PO(II) and C groups. Similarly, glucose oxidation rate was significantly increased at PO(I) with respect to Ob (24.2 ± 7.23 vs 9.42 ± 3.91 μmol · kg-1 · min-1) and was not significantly different between PO(II) and C. Basal levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) decreased significantly both from Ob to PO(I) and from PO(I) to PO(II) (1517.1 ± 223.9 vs 1039.6 ± 283.4 vs 616.0 ± 77.6 μmol · l-1). The same applied to basal plasma triglycerides (2.07 ± 0.77 vs 1.36 ± 0.49 vs 0.80 ± 0.19 g · l-1). Weight decreased mainly in the late postoperative period (PO(I) to PO(II) 124.28 ± 11.22 to 69.71 ± 11.78, 83% of total decrement), rather than in the early postoperative period (Ob to PO(I) 135.25 ± 14.99 to 124.28 ± 11.22 kg, 17% of total decrement). We also report the clinical case of a young woman of normal weight, who underwent BPD for chylomicronaemia (secondary to familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency), whose M value, plasma insulin and blood glucose levels were normalized upon normalization of serum NEFA and triglyceride levels as determined by the therapeutic lipid malabsorption. In conclusion, in obese diabetic patients lipid malabsorption induced by BPD causes a definite enhancement of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. This improvement in metabolism is noticeable before the surgery has major effects on body weight. These observations suggest that lowered plasma lipids, rather than weight loss per se, are the cause of the reversibility of insulin resistance.","bilio-pancreatic diversion; glucose oxidation; glucose storage; insulin resistance","human insulin; protaphane hm; unclassified drug; adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; glucose oxidation; human; insulin resistance; lipid blood level; male; obesity; priority journal; surgery; Adult; Biliopancreatic Diversion; Body Composition; Diabetes Mellitus; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glucose; Glucose Clamp Technique; Glycolysis; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Male; Obesity; Obesity, Morbid; Reference Values; Time Factors; Triglycerides; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030978265

This suggested the possibility of a new cost-effective production process of hydrogen storage alloy with energy/time saving.","Combustion synthesis; Hydriding; Hydrogen storage alloy; Magnesium nickel","Hydrogen; Nitrogen; Powder metals; Synthesis (chemical); Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; Compaction; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Heating; Hydrides; Mixing; Pressure effects; Combustion synthesis; Hydrogen storage alloy; Magnesium nickel hydride; Hydriding combustion synthesis; Hydrogen storage alloys; Magnesium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031554029

The dominant factors in the formation of the complex appear to be extramembranous hydrogen bonds (suggesting that each apoprotein must achieve a fold close to its final structure in order to oligomerize), protein-pigment and pigment-pigment interactions within the membrane-spanning region. The pigment molecules are known to play an important role in the formation of bacterial light-harvesters, and their extensive mediation of structural contacts within the membrane bears this out. Amino acid residues determining the secondary structure of the apoproteins influence the oligomeric state of the complex. The assembly of the pigment array is governed by the apoproteins of LH2. The particular environment of each of the pigment molecules is, however, influenced directly by few protein contacts. These contacts produce functional effects that are not attributable to a single cause, e.g. the arrangement of an overlapping cycle of chromophores not only provides energy delocalisation and storage properties, but also has consequences for oligomer size, pigment distortion modes and pigment chemical environment, all of which modify the precise function of the complex. The evaluation of site energies for the pigment array requires the consideration of a number of effects, including heterogeneous pigment distortions, charge distributions in the local environment and mechanical interactions.","Light-harvesting; Membrane protein; Photosynthesis; Pigment; X-ray structure","apoprotein; article; chemical environment; hydrogen bond; nonhuman; photosynthesis; priority journal; protein assembly; protein protein interaction; protein secondary structure; protein structure; Rhodopseudomonas; Bacteria (microorganisms); Miletinae; Rhodoblastus acidophilus; Rhodopseudomonas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031547979

The key results obtained are as follows. 1) For formation of a MOSFKT shallow junction, which suppresses threshold voltage (V T) variation and offset voltage of sense amplifiers, reduction in ion-implantation energy and process temperature is essential. Also, the keys in terms of area, speed, stable cell operation, and ease of fabrication are use of low-resistivity multilevel metal wiring and high permittivity materials and three-dimensional memory cells to reduce a difference in height between the memory cell array and the surrounding peripheral circuits. 2) For creation of a high speed, the keys are memory-subsystem technology such as pipeline operation, wide-bit I/O. low-voltage interfaces, and high-density packaging. Embedded DRAM further enhances the speed and throughput by using massively parallel processing of signals on a large number of data-lines and reducing internal bus capacitances. 3) For power reduction, the key continues to be reduction of the data-line dissipating charge through both partial activation of multidivided data-lines and lowering of the data-line voltage. Ultralow-voltage operation, essential to drastic power reduction, can be achieved by subthreshold-current reduction circuits such as source-gate backbiasing, mult-V T, dynamic V T, and node-boosting schemes.","DRAM chip; Embedded DRAM; I/O; Low-voltage circuits; Memory array; Memory cell; Packaging","Cellular arrays; Electronics packaging; Integrated circuit layout; Ion implantation; MOSFET devices; Parallel processing systems; Pipeline processing systems; Semiconductor junctions; Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips; Random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031139365

These molecules include free fatty acids, which decrease the rate of glucose oxidation by peripheral tissues; adipsin and other complement factors involved in host defense; tumor necrosis factor alpha, which may be an important determinant of insulin sensitivity; and angiotensinogen, which appears to promote terminal differentiation of preadipose to adipose cells. Leptin, a 167 amino acid polypeptide encoded by the obese gene, is a recently described adipocyte secretory product that communicates the status of the body's energy reserve to the central nervous system, apparently for the purpose of regulating body composition. Plasma leptin levels are exponentially related to total adipose mass. Daily injection of leptin into ob/ob mice leads to decreased food consumption and increased energy expenditure, both of which result in loss of adipose mass. Leptin-treated animals also have lower circulating insulin and glucose levels than pair fed controls. Finally, leptin corrects the infertility of ob/ob mice by restoring gonadotropin secretion to normal. These observations indicate that the adipocyte plays a key role in energy balance, insulin action, host defense, and reproduction, and suggest new approaches for understanding several important human diseases.","appetite; energy balance; obesity; satiety","leptin; adipocyte; energy balance; human; insulin metabolism; obesity; review; satiety; Adipocytes; Animals; Central Nervous System; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Leptin; Mice; Neurosecretory Systems; Proteins",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030924252

One way to detect underlying trade-offs, at least in organisms that rely on stored energy for reproduction ('capital breeders'), may be to monitor an individual's energy stores before and after reproduction. We analysed energy stores and reproductive output in Eulamprus tympanum, a viviparous scincid lizard that stores energy for reproduction in its tail. One predicted trade-off (that between the size and number of offspring in a litter) is consistently observed, and is detectable with minimal information. Another predicted trade-off (that between offspring size and subsequent energy reserves) is not apparent in our data, perhaps because of constraints imposed by correlations among other traits. Finally, tradeoffs between reproductive output and subsequent energy stores are evident in this species, but are only detectable with information on the extent of pre-reproductive as well as post-reproductive energy stores. For 'capital breeders', non-destructive measurement of pre- and post-reproductive energy stores may greatly enhance our ability to detect significant life history trade-offs.","'Capital' breeding; Energy storage; Life history; Trade-offs","energy store; life history; reproductive output; trade-off; Eulamprus tympanum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030613508

As a result, the decrease in fluorescence intensity is proportional to the concentration of ammonia. To improve sensitivity we make use of fluorescence energy transfer using donor-acceptor complexes. Ion pairs consisting of a fluorophore (rhodamine B or tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester) and an absorber (bromophenol blue) were immobilized in PVC and in sol-gel. Response times of the optode layers are in the order of 2 to 8 min depending on the ammonia concentration and the matrix used. Limits of detection are as low as 0.1 μg ml-1 ammonia.

Capillary forces were observed for samples which were subjected to a relative humidity of 75 or 95%. The resulting strong adhesion forces between drug and carrier particles cannot be reduced by a restorage of the samples at a low relative humidity. An equilibrium value of the capillary force was reached within 72 h.

If a minimisation of the adhesion strength is sought, the interfacial energies between the surfaces should be as small as possible when Lifshitz-van der Waals' forces are the main adhesion force component, whereas in the case when capillary forces dominate the adhesion process, the interfacial energy between the contiguous surfaces should be large.","Adhesion force; Adhesion samples; Air relative humidity; Dry powder aerosols; Lactose monohydrate surfaces; Salmeterol xinafoate; Storage","excipient; lactose; salmeterol xinafoate; adhesion; aerosol; article; contact angle; dry powder; force; humidity; particle size; priority journal; storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031001329

N.W. Spain) were studied over 16 months in relation to environmental conditions and reproductive events. Pecten maximus in the Ria de Arousa showed a clear cycle of energy storage and utilisation. Between March April and October carbohydrates and proteins were accumulated in the striated adductor muscle and lipid in the digestive gland. From October to March of the following year there was a loss of such energy reserves. In the ovary there were two annual periods (winter and spring) of increase in the energy content owing to the gonad recovery, which were characterised mainly by the rise in the percentage of lipid. This correlated positively with the gonad condition index and with the mean diameter of the oocytes. The energy necessary for the gametogenesis in late autumn and winter (from October to March) was supplied by the reserves of the striated adductor muscle and the digestive gland; the energy provided by the adductor muscle was double that supplied by the digestive gland. Part of this energy was also used to support the basic metabolic maintenance requirements. The contribution to the energy loss (from October 1990 to March 1991) of the striated adductor muscle carbohydrate and protein and digestive gland lipid was similar (32.45, 27.06 and 29.15 kJ respectively). In spring the gametogenesis took place at the expense of the available food which was also sufficient to allow concurrent energy storage in the adductor muscle and the digestive gland.","Biochemical composition; Condition index; Environmental conditions; Pecten maximus; Suspended culture","carbohydrate; lipid; protein; animal tissue; article; chemical composition; controlled study; digestive system; energy metabolism; environmental factor; female; gonad; male; mollusc; nonhuman; reproduction; seasonal variation; skeletal muscle; spain; Pecten maximus; biochemical composition; condition factor; environmental factors; scallop culture; seasonal variations; Spain, Galicia, Ria de Arousa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030618458

It consists of an approximately 6 m diam carbon fiber composite hoop with permanent magnetic bearings and a linear motor/generator system with solid-state cycloconverter circuits for the energy conversion between kinetic energy and electric energy. With a vacuum chamber and strong tensile strength structure for nonresistive high-speed rotation, the HESS is expected to have a large capacity of energy storage. The optimization of magnet arrangement through the analysis of the magnet's characteristics was suggested to reduce the power loss and instability. By the measurement of magnetic-field configuration and numerical calculations with a three-dimensional code (TOSCA), it is proved that NdFeB magnets have sufficient magnetic-field strength to support the levitation of the hoop. This analysis also led to minimum drag force and eddy-current loss to make use of the uniform field.

These studies indicate cure-heterogeneity due to fast curing as well as degradation of CR with dicumyl peroxide (DCP) at 170°C, which facilitates easy liberation of acidic HCl. The low temperature curing of unfilled blends at 145°C reduces the rate of curing as well as liberation of HCl, leading to lower cure heterogeneity and improved physical properties compared to those cured at 17°C. The high specific component of surface energy of carbon black (N110) leads to better filler-polymer interaction with more polar CR and causes lowering in effective occluded volume measured from storage modulus. Carbon black suppresses the cure heterogeneity of the blends and improves their physical properties considerably. CR, which shows higher minimum rheometric torque compared to EVAc-28, is more viscous and hence carbon black incorporation is relatively difficult. This also leads to higher agglomerate structure causing higher networking factor. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Carbon black (N110); Cure mismatch; Effective occluded volume; EVAc-28/CR blends","Carbon black; Curing; Mechanical properties; Physical properties; Polymers; Cure mismatch; Dicumyl peroxide; Polychloroprene; Polyethylene vinyl acetate; Polymer blends",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031118201

The energy gained by allowing the electron to localize in these sites is of the order of 4-5 eV, agreeing well with the results of the space charge model. Displacements of the neighboring ions due to the implanted charge are shown to be localized in a small region of about 5 Å. Detrapping is observed at 250 K.

This model calculates the effective heat transfer coefficient and the heat capacity of the soil depending on water content, mineral composition, dry bulk density and shape of soil components. The computer simulation was validated by a number of laboratory and field experiments. Based on this theoretical work a pilot plant was designed for seasonal storage of industrial waste heat. A heat and power cogeneration unit (174 kW(th)) delivers waste heat during summer to the ground storage of about 15 000 m3 with 140 vertical heat exchangers of 30 m depth. About 418 MWh/a will be charged into the ground at a temperature level of 80°C, about 266 MWh/a should be extracted at temperatures between 40°C and 70°C and delivered directly to the space heating system.

Length-tension relationships and work output were investigated in the intact, dorso-ventral flight muscle of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. The muscle is an asynchronous muscle. Like other asynchronous flight muscles, it has high resting stiffness and produces relatively low active force in response to tetanic stimulation. 2. The muscle shows shortening deactivation and stretch activation, properties that result in delayed force changes in response to step changes in length, a phase lag between force and length during imposed sinusoidal strain and, under appropriate conditions, positive work output during oscillatory length change. 3. Work loops were used to quantify work output by the muscle during imposed sinusoidal oscillation. The curves relating net work per cycle with muscle length, oscillatory strain and oscillatory frequency were all roughly bell-shaped. The work-length curve was narrow. The optimum strain for net work per cycle was approximately 3%, which is probably somewhat greater than the strain experienced by the muscle in an intact, flying bumblebee. The optimum frequency for net work output per cycle was 63 Hz (30 °C). The optimum frequency for power output was 73 Hz, which agrees well with the normal wing stroke frequency if allowance is made for the elevated temperature (approximately 40 °C) in the thorax of a flying bumblebee. The optimal strain for work output was not strongly dependent on oscillation frequency. 4. Resilience (that is the work output during shortening/work input during lengthening) for unstimulated muscle and dynamic stiffness (=Δstress/Δstrain) for both stimulated and unstimulated muscles were determined using the strain (3%) and oscillation frequency (64 Hz) which maximized work output in stimulated muscles. Unstimulated muscle is a good energy storage device. Its resilience increased with increasing muscle length (and increasing resting force) to reach values of over 90%. The dynamic stiffness of both stimulated and unstimulated muscles increased with muscle length, but the increase was relatively greater in unstimulated muscle, and at long muscle lengths the stiffness of unstimulated muscle exceeded that of stimulated muscle. Effectively, dynamic stiffness is reduced by stimulation! This is taken as indicating that part of the stiffness in an unstimulated muscle reflects structures, possibly attached cross bridges, whose properties change upon stimulation.","Bombus terrestris; bumblebee; flight muscle; muscle; resilience; stiffness; strain; work",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030959215

The superiority of the artificial oxygen carrier perfluorocarbon emulsion FC43 over blood solution is known, therefore, in this paper we examined the temperature-dependence of this substance. Method: The changes of the high energy phosphates phosphocreatine (PCr) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) were documented in 29 isolated pig hearts, employing a 4.7 Tesla magnetic-resonance-spectroscope (MRS). After 15 min warm ischemia, reperfusion with warm blood and a cardioplegic ischemia period of 45 min, these hearts were reperfused with either 11 or 25°C hypothermic oxygenated perfluorocarbon emulsion FC43, both under continuous spectroscopy. MRS is able to directly measure PCr as well as Pi. Their relation expresses the state of myocardial energy stores. Results: Reperfusion with 11°C hypothermic FC43 (n = 14) caused an increase of the relation PCr to Pi by a factor of 9, compared to an increase by a factor of 4 with 25°C emulsion (n =]15) (P < 0.05). During 80 min of reperfusion with 11°C cold FC43 emulsion the average flow rate was 90 ± 12 and 96 ± 11 ml/min during reperfusion with 25°C hypothermic FC43 emulsion. Both rates fell only slightly in the course of time. Conclusion: We conclude that reperfusion with 11°C hypothermic oxygenated FC43 in isolated ischemic porcine hearts leads to a clear increase of the index PCr/Pi compared with reperfusion at 25°C. The correlation between the synthesis of myocardial high energy phosphates with postcardioplegic ventricular function is questionable. If further studies will show an improvement of myocardial function after perfusion with hypothermic oxygenated perfluorocarbon emulsion FC43, this solution may find clinical application in the storage of explanted human hearts for transplantation, during transportation to the recipient.","Artificial oxygen carrier; Cardiac ischemia; Heart preservation; Myocardial metabolism; Perfluorcarbon emulsion","fluorocarbon; perfluorotributylamine; animal experiment; animal model; article; controlled study; emulsion; heart disease; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle metabolism; intravenous drug administration; isolated heart; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; organ preservation; priority journal; swine; Animals; Blood Substitutes; Energy Metabolism; Fluorocarbons; Hypothermia, Induced; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; Myocardium; Phosphates; Phosphocreatine; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030936519

Internal standards consisting of 18O2-labeled analogs of 9- and 13- HODE are added to pulverized frozen tissue prior to extraction with ethanol. Nonlipid materials are removed in a chloroform/methanol/water extraction step. The remaining lipid material is methylated with ethereal diazomethane, and much of the nonoxygenated fatty acid methyl esters are removed via silica solid-phase extraction. Samples are either further derivatized with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide to form the trimethylsilyl ethers for quantitative analysis by GC-MS or are analyzed as the methyl esters by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the enantiomeric distribution of the 9- and 13-HODE. The extraction and quantitation protocol was applied to the analysis of mammary glands for free 9- and 13-HODE from mice fed isocaloric diets containing 20% corn oil, 5%, corn oil, or 20%, beef tallow. Chiral analysis of the products showed higher production of 13(S)- HODE relative to 13(R)-HODE; the enantiomeric excess is most likely due to enzymatic production of 13-HODE superimposed on a background of autoxidative production of 13(R)- plus 9(S)- and 9(R)-HODE. In addition, the effect of sample handling and storage conditions on the formation of 9- and 13-HODE in the samples was assessed by exposing aliquots of a common pool of rat mammary gland tissue to specified conditions prior to analysis.

In this article, we describe a biologically inspired analog very-large-scale integration (VLSI) architecture for real-time classification of acoustic transients. Judicious normalization of time-frequency signals allows an elegant and robust implementation of a correlation algorithm. The algorithm replaces analog-analog multiplication with binary multiplexing of analog signals. This removes the need for analog storage and analog multiplication. Simulations show that the resulting algorithm has the same out-of-sample classification performance (about 93% correct) as a template-matching algorithm based on conventional analog correlation. This development paves the way for intelligent acoustic processing in low-power applications such as cellular telephones and debit cards.","Acoustic transients; Analog VLSI; Matched filters; Neural computation; Speech recognition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009606386

In an effort to understand this mechanism of energy transduction, we have used pre-steady-state methods to study the kinetics of ATP binding and hydrolysis by an important intermediate in the DNA unwinding reaction the asymmetric Rep dimer state. P2S, where ss DNA [dT(pT)15] is bound to only one subunit of the Rep dimer. To differentiate between the two potential ATPase active sites inherent in the dimer, we constructed dimers with one subunit covalently cross-linked to ss DNA and where one or the other of the ATPase sites was selectively complexed to the tightly bound transition slate analog ADP-AlF4. We found that when ADP-AlF4 is bound to the Rep subunit in trans from the subunit bound to ss DNA, steady-state ATPase activity of 18 s-1 per dimer (equivalent to wild-type P2S) was recovered. However, when the ADP-AlF4 and ss DNA are both bound to the same subunit (cis), then a titratable burst of ATP hydrolysis is observed corresponding to a single turnover of ATP. Rapid chemical quenched-flow techniques were used to resolve the following minimal mechanism for ATP hydrolysis by the unligated Rep subunit of the cis dimer: E + ATP ⇆ E-ATP ⇆ E'-ATP ⇆ E'-ADP-P(i) ⇆ E-ADP P(i) ⇆ E-ADP + P(i) ⇆ E + ADP + P(i), with K1 = (2.0 ± 0.85) x 105 M-1, k2 = 22 ± 3.5 s-1, k-2 &lt; 0.12 s-1, K3 = 4.0 ± 0.4 (k3 &gt; 200 s-1), k4 = 1.2 ± 0.14 s-1, k-4 &lt;&lt; 1.2 s-1, K5 = 1.0 ± 0.2 mM, and K6, = 80 ± 8 μM. A salient feature of this mechanism is the presence of a kinetically trapped long-lived tight nucleotide binding state, E'-ADP-P(i).

Current lung preservation consists of flushing of the donor organs, with successive hypothermic storage in an inflated state. Recently, hypothermic storage alone was reported to be superior in terms of functional recovery. This study was designed to investigate the metabolic, morphologic, and functional consequences of hypothermic storage alone, in experimental lung preservation. Methods. Orthotopic left-sided lung transplantation was performed in pigs. Donor lungs were flushed with Euro-Collins solution (n=6) or simply explanted (n=6) and stored for 18 hr at 4°C. After this, left- sided single lung transplantation was performed. Sham-operated animals (n=6) served as control. Morphology and metabolism were analyzed in normal lungs, after ischemia and at the end of reperfusion. Gas exchange and pulmonary hemodynamics of the transplanted organs were measured, after exclusion of the native lung from perfusion and ventilation. Results. Metabolic and morphologic evaluation did not show a significant difference between the groups at the end of ischemia. Lungs preserved by hypothermia alone showed a functional recovery close to sham-operated animals and superior to flushed organs. Conclusions. Hypothermia alone is a sufficient means of preservation for explanted lungs for at least 18 hr.",,"euro collins solution; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; cryopreservation; explant; female; lung biopsy; lung gas exchange; lung hemodynamics; lung transplantation; lung weight; male; nonhuman; organ preservation; priority journal; reperfusion; swine; Animals; Cold; Energy Metabolism; Female; Hemodynamic Processes; Lung Transplantation; Male; Organ Preservation Solutions; Organ Size; Swine; Tissue Preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343417071

We have previously proposed that, in contrast to other fat storing cells, hepatic stellate cells are not involved in energy storage, but they represent a particular cell population specialized in storage of lipid-soluble substances, the major one being probably retinol. In agreement with this hypothesis, induction of the lipocyte phenotype in stellate cells is not under the control of insulin, but responds to retinoids and other molecules that modify the gene expression program in these cells. In the present study we have monitored the activity of the two major enzymes involved in lipid synthesis during the induction of the lipocyte phenotype in hepatic stellate cells: glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) that mediates the de novo lipid synthesis, and lipoprotein lipase that mediates incorporation of plasma lipids. In early stages of lipocyte induction, both pathways of lipid synthesis are activated. When lipocytes have already constituted the lipid droplets, lipoprotein lipase pathway is downregulated, while GPDH activity remains high. Adult liver has been reported to lack lipoprotein lipase, but under stress, lipase activity was detected around and at the surface of the intrahepatic vasculature. We have now shown that the lipase activity can be induced in the hepatic stellate cells, located in the Disse's space. The high lipoprotein lipase activity under acute induction of lipocyte phenotype, followed by the low activity under conditions of metabolic equilibrium, are in compass with the increased activity of this enzyme under stress, and its low activity in adult liver parenchyma under normal conditions.","Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Hepatic stellate cells; Indomethacin; Lipid metabolism; Lipoprotein lipase; Retinol","glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; lipid; lipoprotein lipase; article; cell differentiation; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme induction; lipogenesis; liver cell; phenotype; stellate cell; Cell Line; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase; Hydrolysis; Lipid Metabolism; Lipoprotein Lipase; Liver; Phenotype",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031040684

After 2 to 3 months of dietary therapy all horses showed moderate to marked improvement of performance, despite frequent markedly increased post-exercise concentrations of serum muscle enzymes. Blood concentrations of Vitamin E and selenium determined before and during the dietary trial did not support the hypothesis that a deficiency of Vitamin E or selenium was responsible for the myopathy in these horses.

Fertilisation was made in liquid form on a weekly basis during the vegetation period with 100 kg N ha-1 year-1 during each year. The fertiliser also included a balanced composition of P, K, Ca, Mg and S as well as of micronutrients. Irrigation was carried out as soon as a 20 mm water storage deficit developed. It is concluded that there is a large potential to improve Norway spruce production through liquid fertilisation with irrigation. Stem and branch production of Norway spruce was almost doubled due to this treatment. Also, stand needle dry mass and litterfall were markedly increased in comparison with the control. Water and N availability were the two most limiting growth factors. During the experimental period, irrigation had a greater effect on growth than N addition. The gross N uptake increased by 450 kg ha-1 as a result of 600 kg ha-1 fertiliser addition. Needle retention was increased for irrigated trees but needle litterfall remained unchanged. Changing the forest management of Norway spruce to intensive cultivatation results in transitional carbon sequestration in both stand and soil compared with an untreated ecosystem. The largest long-term environmental value is, however, achieved if this cultivated renewable biomass is used as a substitute for fossil fuels. Wood utilisation options of intensively cultivated Norway spruce are discussed.","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Fertilisation; Green house effect; Irrigation; Nitrogen uptake; Norway spruce; Renewable energy; Sequestration; Yield","Picea abies; fertilization; forest; growth; management; Norway spruce; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031466089

Research Institute, PO Box 2072, Balboa, Panama","Maximal load-lifting capacities of six ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) were determined under conditions of burst performance. Mechanical power output under maximal loading was then compared with maximal hovering performance in hypodense gas mixtures of normodense air and heliox. The maximal load lifted was similar at air temperatures of 5 and 25°C, and averaged 80% of body mass. The duration of load-lifting was brief, of the order of 1 s, and was probably sustained via phosphagen substrates. Under maximal loading, estimates of muscle mass-specific mechanical power output assuming perfect elastic energy storage averaged 206 W kg-1, compared with 94 W kg-1 during free hovering without loading. Under conditions of limiting performance in hypodense mixtures, maximal mechanical power output was much lower (131 W kg-1, five birds) but was sustained for longer (4s), demonstrating an inverse relationship between the magnitude and duration of maximum power output. In free hovering flight, stroke amplitude and wingbeat frequency varied in inverse proportion between 5 and 25°C, suggesting thermoregulatory contributions by the flight muscles. Stroke amplitude under conditions of maximal loading reached a geometrical limit at slightly greater than 180°. Previous studies of maximum performance in flying animals have estimated mechanical power output using a simplified actuator disk model without a detailed knowledge of wingbeat frequency and stroke amplitude. The present load-lifting results, together with actuator disc estimates of induced power derived from hypodense heliox experiments, are congruent with previous load-lifting studies of maximum flight performance. For ruby-throated hummingbirds, the inclusion of wingbeat frequency and stroke amplitude in a more detailed aerodynamic model of hovering yields values of mechanical power output 34% higher than previous estimates. More generally, the study of performance limits in flying animals necessitates careful specification of behavioral context as well as quantitative determination of wing and body kinematics.","aerodynamics; Archilochus colubris; hovering; hummingbird; load-lifting; maximal locomotor performance; muscle power output; temperature","animal; article; biomechanics; bird; exercise; flying; muscle; physiology; Animals; Biomechanics; Birds; Exertion; Flight, Animal; Muscles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031104948

Measurements are usually made with passive transducers that transform the vertical soil heat flux into an e.m.f.. Measurement errors or bias result from differences between the calibration coefficients provided by the manufacturer and those determined in the field. These differences result from bad thermal contact between the soil and the fluxmeter and/or changes in soil thermal conductivity. New printed circuit heat fluxmeters are very thin (0.2 mm) and they provide a better thermal contact with the soil because they have an external copper layer instead of an insulating resin. We carried out a theoretical analysis to identify properties of the transducers (geometrical, thermal or electrical) most important for reducing the calibration variability. The transducer thickness was found to reduce the calibration variability due to large soil thermal conductivity variations. Transducer thermal conductivity is also important when the soil thermal conductivity is accurately known. The printed circuit transducers and classical soil heat flux transducers (thermopiles) where then compared in three different soils, a sandy loam, a loamy and a chalky soil under changing climatic conditions in spring. The outputs of both transducers were compared to reference soil heat flux measurements obtained by the heat storage method. The thermopile transducers were more sensitive (4.1 μV W-1 m2) than the printed circuit transducers (1.6 μV W-1 m2). Both transducers gave similar responses when the soil thermal conductivity varied over a narrow range. The total variation of the calibration coefficients of the printed circuit transducer was smaller for all three soils and for days where the soil thermal conductivity varied widely. We conclude that the printed circuit transducers should be used when field calibration is not possible, or when the calibration is not stable following large soil thermal conductivity variations. The experiment also showed that the theory does not completely describe the interaction between calibration coefficients and soil properties. We have therefore developed a new interpretation of the experimental data that takes into account the thermal contact between the soil and the transducer.","Calibration; Measurement; Soil heat flux; Thermal conductivity","bare soil; calibration; flux meter; soil heat; thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031082068

However significant amounts of fossil energy carriers are used for the production of synthetic organic materials like plastics. Carbon is stored in these materials and only released when they are incinerated. Consequently, it is necessary to estimate carbon storage in synthetic organic materials and products for proper CO2 accounting. This storage-the so-called potential emissions-is discussed in this article. First, the IPCC method for calculation of potential emissions is discussed and then results for The Netherlands are compared with results of an alternative approach, based on material flow analysis. This material flow approach shows a potential emission for The Netherlands ranging from 17.4 to 19.5 Mt CO2 in 1992, whereas the IPCC approach results in a lower estimate of 14.7 Mt CO2. The difference is caused by the inadequacy of the feed-stock data from the energy statistics for the purpose of carbon storage accounting and by the neglect of international trade in synthetic organic materials in the IPCC approach. Because the potential emissions are related to a key problem in the current emission reduction negotiations-namely carbon leakage due to relocation of industries to other countries-accurate emission figures are required and therefore the material flow approach seems more appropriate.",,"carbon dioxide emission; carbon storage; potential emission; synthetic material; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030708797

For all samples the storage and loss components of the dynamic shear modulus. G′(ω) and G″(ω), were measured at different temperatures. The zero-shear viscosity, η0, for each composition was correlated to the weight-average molecular weight, Mω by the equation: η0 = KMωa and the exponent a was found to increase as the content of isophthalate units was increased. Also, increases in the activation energy for viscous flow were observed as the isophthalate unit content was increased. The dynamic viscoelastic behavior of the copolymers was studied in terms of the complex compliances; curve fitting results on data of J′(ω) and J″(ω) vs. ω showed that such curves can be accurately reproduced by the following equation: J*(ω)= Jg + (Jco - Jg,)/[1 + (iωT2)β2] + i/ωηo. It was concluded that, in the investigated frequency and temperature ranges, a single retardation phenomenon in the terminal zone provides a satisfactory description of the viscoelastic behavior of the copolymers. The values of the viscoelastic parameters were found to vary monotonically with composition, as expected in the case of statistical copolymers. © 1997 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.","Copolyesters; Poly (butylene adipate); Poly(butylene isophthalate); Random copolymers; Viscoelasticity","Activation energy; Composition; Curve fitting; Molecular weight; Viscoelasticity; Viscosity; Viscous flow; Polybutylene adipate; Polybutylene isophthalate; Shear modulus; Copolymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031076793

The recrystallised microstructure is often very coarse and highly anisotropic, characterised by columnar grains. Such a microstructure is often referred to as being 'directionally recrystallised'. This and other features of these unique alloys are reviewed. It is found that many of the observed peculiarities can be attributed to the ultra-fine grained structure present prior to the recrystallisation heat-treatment. In some cases the manufacturing process tends to align the dispersoid particles along the principal fabrication direction.

In many cases use is made of micro organisms capable of accumulating phosphorus as polyphosphate inside the cell. The main characteristic providing the competitive advantage to these polyphosphate accumulating bacteria is the capability to use polyphosphate, in the absence of external electron accepters, as energy source for the uptake and storage of acetic acid in the form of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). The reduction equivalents for the formation of PHB are derived from the conversion of glycogen to PHB. Despite the widespread use and study of enhanced biological phosphorus removal no pure culture, having the above mentioned characteristics, has been isolated yet. All ecophysiological studies on these type of cultures have therefore been performed by enrichment cultures. This paper reviews the research on these type of organisms, and shows that it is possible to understand a complex microbial process on a metabolic level, both stoichiometrically and kinetically, without the availability of a pure culture.","Acinetobacter sp.; Biological phosphorus removal; Glycogen; Metabolic modelling; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Polyphosphate","acetic acid; glycogen; phosphorus; poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid); polyphosphate; aerobic metabolism; anaerobic metabolism; bacterial metabolism; bacterium culture; conference paper; electron; energy metabolism; kinetics; nonhuman; physiology; priority journal; reduction; stoichiometry; waste water management; Acinetobacter; Aerobiosis; Anaerobiosis; Bacteria; Bacteriological Techniques; Ecosystem; Oxidation-Reduction; Phosphorus; Polyphosphates; Sewage; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Acinetobacter sp.; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031017551

The results obtained show that the extraction kinetics can be modeled with a simple law. For full compounds a correction for nonrubber extractable ingredients must be applied; but it is demonstrated that compounding ingredients do not affect the bound rubber level of a given formulation, providing that the optimum mixing energy level has been achieved during the preparation procedure and that the compound maturation processes have been completed. Macromolecular characteristics of labile rubber species were analyzed versus extraction; and a simple equation, implicitly referring to a Fickean process, is offered to model the observed effects. It is so demonstrated that the polydispersity of labile species varies during the extraction process and that the largest molecular weight fractions are involved in the rubber-filler interaction, as predicted by theory.

Furthermore, the PS-GVB-LMP2 method is applicable to an arbitrary molecule in an automated fashion (although specific protocols for resonance interactions must be incorporated) and hence constitutes a well-defined model chemistry in contrast to some alternative multireference methodologies. A calculation on the alanine dipeptide using the cc-pVTZ(-f) basis set (338 basis functions total) is presented as an example We then apply the method to the calculation of 36 conformational energy differences assembled by Halgren and co-workers [J.

Our previous version would first produce a small set of adapted basis functions by applying the Chebyshev polynomial expansion of the Green's function on a generic initial vector χ. The small Hamiltonian, H, and overlap, S, matrices would then be evaluated in this adapted basis and the corresponding generalized eigenvalue problem would be solved yielding the desired spectral information. Here in analogy to a recent work by Wall and Neuhauser [J. Chem. Phys. 102, 8011 (1995)] H and S are computed directly using only the Chebyshev coefficients cn=〈χTn(Ĥ)\χ〉, calculation of which requires a minimal storage if the Ĥ matrix is sparse. The expressions for H and S are analytically simple, computationally very inexpensive and stable. The method can be used to obtain all the eigenvalues of Ĥ using the same sequence {cn}. We present an application of the method to a realistic quantum dynamics problem of calculating all bound state energies of H3+ molecule. Since the sequence {cn} is the only input required to obtain all the eigenenergies, the present method can be reformulated for the problem of spectral analysis of a real symmetric time signal defined on an equidistant time grid. The numerical example considers a model signal C(tn)=Σkdk cos(tnωk) generated by a set of N=100 000 frequencies and amplitudes, (ωk,dk). It is demonstrated that all the ωk's and dk's can be obtained to very high precision using the minimal information, i.e., 200 000 sampling points. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001360015

Key design features include the use of large-diameter cyclotron rings having low magnetic fields and the coaxial nesting of several cyclotron stages. The proposed Coaxial-Ring Cyclotrons (CRC) accelerator system has several advantages as compared to conventional cyclotrons. It has wide turn-to-turn separation of orbits, high energy gains per turn with small number of turns in each cyclotron stage, to produce high space-charge-limited beam current, simplified beam injection and extraction at low loss, an ability to inject and simultaneously accelerate multiple independent beams, and to extract different energy beams from the intermediate orbits of cyclotron stages. One or several Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) injectors are used to provide the necessary high brightness injection. Thus, a high-current, 1.5-GeV highly-efficient and cost-effective accelerator system is conceived, specifically to serve as the proton driver in several applications of the Accelerator Driven Transmutation Technologies (ADTT), and also to serve as a photon cancer therapy source, a materials processing source, as well as to act as a high-quality accelerator for the conduct of fundamental research in physics with intense beams of neutrons, neutrinos, muons and mesons.

The standard Trombe wall has two main drawbacks. During cold and cloudy winter days, it causes important heat losses and thus discomfort to the occupants. In summer it creates important and undesired inputs. These drawbacks can be eliminated by a more complex design such as the composite Trombe wall. In connection with architects such as J. Michel, we designed a massive solar wall, with an insulating panel located just behind it. A ventilated air layer exists between this panel and the wall. Vents located at the top and the bottom of the insulating panel allow air circulation and thus energy inputs to the building. A prototype was built into a test cell at Cadarache and was tested for 2 years. This allowed various climatic conditions and operation modes to be examined. We used tangential gradient type heat fluxmeters to determine the thermophysical properties of the massive wall and we quantified the heat transfers in the ventilated layer and to the building.

The following interesting results were obtained. First, the initial yields of ortho-H2- anions in the γ-irradiated solid parahydrogen were 3 times as large as those of para-H2- anions. Second, the yields of para-H2- anions decrease faster than those of ortho-H2- anions upon storage of the irradiated samples at 4.2 K. Third, the decay rate of H2- anions is accelerated by the addition of HD and D2 molecules. Fourth, H2- anions at 2.2 K decay faster than at 4.2 K. According to the parity conservation rule in a homonuclear diatomic molecule, the energy of ortho-H2- anions at the ground state is lower than that of para-H2- anions, whereas that of ortho-H2 molecules is higher than that of para-H2 molecules at low temperatures. The first and second results are ascribed to para → ortho conversion of H2- anions. The third result indicates that nearby HD and D2 accelerate the decay of H2- anion or broaden the spectra by superhyperfine interactions. The fourth result suggests a coherent tunneling mechanism of decay of H2- anions in the solid parahydrogen.",,"Composition effects; Deuterium; Electron energy levels; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Electron tunneling; Gamma rays; Ions; Molecular structure; Reaction kinetics; Thermal effects; Anions; Homonuclear diatomic molecules; Solid parahydrogen; Superhyperfine interactions; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031077962

Leptin is synthesized by white adipose tissue (WAT) under conditions of high energy availability and insulin stimulus. Glucocorticoids enhance this synthesis and catecholamines hamper leptin production. Leptin diminishes insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cells and induces insulin resistance. In fact leptin hampers insulin action on WAT itself in a negative feedback loop. The evidence acquired in studies on diabetics, starvation, refeeding and insulin and glucose clamps supports this interpretation, which may also explain part of the difficulties encountered by the current postulate that links leptin to WAT mass size signalling to the brain. Leptin may be, essentially, a counter-regulatory hormone limiting the insulin drive to store energy in the form of fat, its effects reaching from a decrease in food intake to lower insulin secretion and increased resistance to insulin and lower glucose uptake and fat synthesis by WAT.","Insulin; Leptin; Obesity","catecholamine derivative; glucocorticoid; insulin; leptin; appetite; body weight; diabetes mellitus; glucose clamp technique; insulin release; insulin resistance; lipid storage; negative feedback; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; review; starvation; weight gain; white adipose tissue",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031023645

Previous research revealed that northern silversides are subject to strong size-dependent winter mortality, while southern fish suffer no appreciable winter mortality. To examine whether there was geographic differentiation in allocation strategies, we compared temporal patterns of energy storage and utilization among three populations along this gradient in seasonality. The comparative design used monthly or biweekly samples of fish collected in the wild, as well as samples of fish from each population reared in a common environment, where genetic differences can be clarified. Somatic energy stores were quantified via gravimetric analysis of neutral storage lipids and lean tissue. Analysis revealed that small individuals maintained relatively low levels of lipid reserves, which may account for their lower survival in winter. Wild fish in the north rapidly accumulated large somatic reserves, which were depleted over the winter and then increased again during the subsequent spring breeding season. In wild southern fish, relatively small reserves accumulated slowly until breeding commenced in the spring. The common-environment comparison of somatic storage patterns revealed a genetic basis for among-population differences in reserve accumulation rates, but no differences in the amount of reserves stored. We conclude that the overwinter depletion of somatic reserves has a significant selective impact on energy accumulation and allocation strategies in seasonal environments.","Adaptation; Allocation strategy; Allometry; Energy reserves; Geographic variation","Menidia menidia; acclimation; acclimatization; Atlantic silverside; bioenergetics; estuarine fish; latitudinal variation; seasonality; seasonality latitudinal variations; somatic energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030621060

Electron Spectrosc. Rel. Phenom., 60 (1992) 1) an optical arrangement of three zone-plates (a combination of a monochromator for synchrotron radiation and focusing elements). The present paper reports on the first experimental tests of this proposed device, performed at a dipole-magnet beamline of the electron storage ring BESSY in Berlin. The photon energy resolution (ΔE ≈ 2.0 eV) and the focus diameter (Δx ≈ 15 μm) obtained at photon energies ℏω = 500-600 eV are in quantitative agreement with ray-tracing calculations that take into account the electron beam parameters within the storage ring. This demonstrates clearly that, at present, the resolution is limited by the synchrotron radiation source, but so far not by the quality of the zone plates used. The intensities observed will permit the first microspectroscopical investigations using core-level photo-emission at photon energies of approx. 500-900 eV. We will also consider improvements with respect to future applications at undulator sources. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","Microspectroscopy; Soft-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Spatial resolution; Synchrotron radiation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346614486

Underground storage of natural gas is of considerable interest and demand in Turkey where it is not practiced yet. With the gas imported from Russia, underground storage becomes desirable, necessary, and essential for Turkey. The data for Ankara city were used to set up the future needed storage and transportation system. Thus, this will yield a customer satisfaction at the end point of service line under possible interruption or decrease in natural gas supplied from main transportation system, due to cold weather conditions in winter period, which cause a boost in natural gas demand of weather sensitive consumption.

Since the majority of studies have tested Cr in the form of Cr picolinate (CrPic), this 12-week study contrasted the effects of three available forms of dietary Cr {300 ppb Cr as CrPic, Cr nicotinate (CrNic), or Cr chloride (CrCl)}, as well as no added dietary Cr, upon growth and body composition in the rat. Sixty male Harlan Sprague-Dawley weanling rats arrived in three groups of 20 animals (referred to as Blocks 1, 2, and 3). Five animals from each block were assigned to each treatment, resulting in a 4 x 3 (treatment x block) Randomized Block Design. Body composition was assessed at Weeks 5 and 10 via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Significant treatment X block interactions were found for fat weight and percent body fat at both time points (P ≤ 0.05). These interactions reflected decreases in body fat with all forms of Cr supplementation for the Block 1 animals. No treatment interactions or effects were seen for growth rate, lean body mass, or tissue weights, but most block effects were highly significant (P ≤ 0.01), reflecting possible genetic differences between blocks. Since feed intake did not vary between dietary treatments, the reduced body fat levels for the Cr-supplemented animals of Block 1 may have been due to an enhancement of insulin-induced thermogenesis.","Body Composition; Chromium; Growth; Rat","chromium; animal experiment; article; body composition; body growth; controlled study; diet; food composition; lean body weight; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031081311

These ions have been isolated in a quadrupole ion trap operated with helium bath gas at a pressure of 1 mtorr and subjected to resonance excitation (i.e., conventional ion trap collisional activation). Collisional activation of the even-electron species of the same charge state formed directly via electrospray was also performed by using essentially identical conditions. The collisional activation data can be compared directly without ambiguity arising from differences in parent ion internal energies and/or dissociation time frames. Both the odd- and even-electron anions yield extensive sequence-informative fragmentation but show significant differences in the extent of nucleobase loss and in the relative contributions from the various sequence diagnostic dissociation channels. The results of this study indicate that radical anions derived from multiply deprotonated oligo-deoxynucleotides that survive the electron transfer process are stable with respect to fragmentation in the ion trap environment under normal storage conditions and that the unimolecular dissociation behavior of these ions differs from the even-electron anions of the same charge state. These findings suggest, therefore, that odd- and even- electron anions might be used to provide complementary sequence information in cases in which neither ion type provides the full sequence.",,"anion; carbon tetrachloride; polyadenylic acid; anion transport; article; decomposition; dissociation constant; electron transport; mass spectrometry; molecular dynamics; polyadenylation; sequence analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031081180

In the computationally expensive part of the calculation, wave packet propagation is used to obtain the time-dependent wave function ψ(t) up to some time τ at which direct scattering is over. This part is made efficient by using a recently introduced modification for the absorbing boundary conditions evolution operator which allows the use of real operator algebra if the initial wave function is chosen real. In the second part of the calculation, filter diagonalization is used to efficiently obtain the energies, widths, and expansion coefficients of resonances needed to describe the long time behavior of the scattering wave function. This part is made efficient by using a recently introduced algorithm which avoids the storage of energy-dependent basis functions.

The occurrence of similar lesions has been studied in a series of 67 explanted and 2 resected human livers using histological and histochemical approaches. A high incidence of FAH was found in the liver of patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, 14/14) and liver cirrhosis (21/42). FAH were also detected in one patient each with inborn hepatic glycogenosis type 1 a, and cholangiocellular carcinoma. Two patients with focal nodular hyperplasia had FAH-like enzymatic changes within these lesions. No FAH were found in 5 donor livers. FAH excessively storing glycogen including clear and mixed cell foci predominated in most cases with these lesions. The local hepatic glycogenosis was associated with a significantly increased cell proliferation compared to the extrafocal parenchyma, and with alterations in the activity of various enzymes. In the 175 FAH studied by enzyme histochemistry, two enzymes involved in glycogen breakdown, namely glycogen phosphorylase and glucose-6-phosphatase, showed the most consistent changes, being reduced in 98% and 95%, respectively. In addition, the activities of adenosine triphosphatase and γ-glutamyltransferase were reduced in 46% and 53% of FAH, respectively. Inconsistent changes were observed in FAH concerning a number of other enzymes. The 14 HCCs investigated histochemically often contained clear cell populations rich in glycogen in well differentiated portions, but were poor in glycogen in moderately and poorly differentiated tumors or tumor components. There were some similarities in the enzyme histochemical pattern of HCC and FAH but also important differences were evident. In contrast to FAH, all HCCs (except one carcinoma of the fibrolamellar type) showed an increase in the activity of the mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 50% of the cases had increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. The activities of glucose-6-phosphatase and γ-glutamyltransferase usually showed a reactivation, or even an increase compared to the extrafocal parenchyma, in moderately and poorly differentiated HCCs. Our results indicate that the focal hepatic glycogenosis is a putative preneoplastic lesion in human beings similar to laboratory animals. The local hepatic glycogenosis appears to be a frequent initial step in neoplastic transformation of hepatocytes, a process associated with a fundamental shift in energy metabolism.","hepatic glycogenosis; liver cirrhosis; liver neoplasia","glucose 6 phosphatase; glycogen; glycogen phosphorylase; article; carcinogenesis; cell proliferation; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; glycogen storage disease type 2; histochemistry; histology; human; human cell; human tissue; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; neoplasm; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031052692

The measurements were based on an initial sampling scheme and included profile soil water content, surface soil water content, soil water potential, infiltration rates, additional measurements on core samples, and grain size analysis. The measurements were used to categorize the state of the surface and profile soil water regimes during the experiment and to derive functional relationships for the soil water characteristic curve, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function, and infiltration function. Sample results for different supersites and different vegetation covers are presented showing soil water profiles and total soil water storage on days corresponding to the experimental 'Golden Days'. Sample results are also presented for spatial and temporal distribution of surface moisture content and infiltration tests. The results demonstrate that the major experimental objective of monitoring the supersites during the most rapid vegetative growth stage with the largest change of the surface energy balance following the rainy season was very nearly achieved. Separation of the effects of probable root activity and drainage of the soil profile is possible.

In this paper we address the issues of storage scalability in relation to the real-time, storage capacity and throughput requirements of multimedia data types (audio, video, text) and the effect these demands have on the level of scalability required. We describe a multimedia storage architecture that exhibits a high degree of scalability by exploiting the scalable properties of fast packet switched networks such as ATM. Storage scalability is achieved through the dynamic replication of both storage servers and data objects. This is performed within our ATM networking environment in order to support the continually changing requirements of heterogeneous end-systems and also as a means of providing efficient load balancing and real-time resource expandability. By utilising scalable compression technologies, the typical overheads incurred when copying between storage servers can be reduced to a minimum. A key feature of our storage architecture centres around storing continuous media files as a number of compressed components that can be re-located and re-combined at optimal locations within the distributed environment, using mixing agents; enabling efficient use of dynamically changing server, network and clients resources. © 1997 SPIE.

Thermodynamic cycles are investigated to estimate aqueous one-electron reduction potentials for the redox indicators p-benzoquinone and p-duroquinone, as well as chloro-substituted p-benzoquinones. Gas-phase reduction free energy differences are approximated from electron affinities calculated by using the hybrid Hartree-Fock/density-functional B3LYP method, a semiempirical quantum chemical method that expresses a molecule's exchange-correlation energy as a weighted sum of Hartree-Fock, local, and gradient-corrected density-functional energies. Free energy perturbation theory was used with molecular dynamics simulations (at constant temperature, pressure, and number of atoms) to estimate hydration free energy differences. Calculated one-electron reduction potentials for the quinones are within 10-190 meV of experimental values. An exceptionally accurate reduction potential was calculated for p-benzoquinone (Ecalc0 = 4.51 eV and Eexpt0 = 4.52 to 4.54 eV) and least accuracy was obtained for p-duroquinone (Ecalc0 = 3.99 eV and Ecalc0= 4.18-4.21 eV). Radial distribution functions show that more hydrogens contact the oxygens of the p-benzosemiquinone anions than the oxygen atoms of the neutral quinones. The strengths and numbers of water hydrogen bonds to the semiquinone anions also correlate with hydration free energy differences between the quinones and their semiquinone anions, implying that models of water solvation designed to reproduce hydration free energy differences or reduction potentials should somehow incorporate the effects of specific solute-water interactions.",,"Approximation theory; Computational methods; Computer simulation; Correlation methods; Free energy; Hydration; Hydrogen bonds; Mathematical models; Molecular dynamics; Perturbation techniques; Thermal cycling; Water; Benzoquinones; Electron affinities; Hartree Fock/density functional B3LYP method; One electron reduction potentials; Radial distribution functions; Ketones",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030734212

To determine whether increasing the activity of the β1-adrenergic receptor (AR) in adipose tissue would affect the lipolytic rate or the development of this tissue, we used the enhancer-promoter region of the adipocyte lipid-binding protein (aP2) gene to direct expression of the human β1AR cDNA to adipose tissue. Expression of the transgene was seen only in brown and white adipose tissue. Adipocytes from transgenic mice were more responsive to βAR agonists than were adipocytes from nontransgenic mice, both in terms of cAMP production and lipolytic rates. Transgenic animals were partially resistant to diet-induced obesity. They had smaller adipose tissue depots than their nontransgenic littermates, reflecting decreased lipid accumulation in their adipocytes. In addition to increasing the lipolytic rate, overexpression of the β1AR induced the abundant appearance of brown fat cells in subcutaneous white adipose tissue. These results demonstrate that the β1AR is involved in both stimulation of lipolysis and the proliferation of brown fat cells in the context of the whole organism.

Fracture energies were determined by the use of a T-Peel geometry (two polypropylene films bonded with model EVA adhesives). The rosin has only one glass transition temperature, but the C5-C9 resin has two glass transition temperatures, indicating phase separation. The rosin has better compatibility with EVA than does the C5-C9 resin. The bond strength of tackified EVA to polypropylene depends not only on compatibility, but also on viscoelastic properties. A higher storage modulus results in a higher T-Peel strength. Under certain test conditions, glassy C5-C9-rich domains act as reinforcing filler, resulting in a higher storage modulus.

The tropical rocky shore crab, Grapsus albolineatus, feeds selectively on filamentous algae through the year but the abundance of these algae and foliose algae is greatly reduced during the summer when encrusting algae dominate the shores and the crab's diet. This switch in diet may have implications for the reproductive output of this crab. Standing crop of algae varied greatly through the year, peaking in March and April, when the nutritional quality of the algae was also highest. On the shore, available algal protein and energy were both lowest in July. The crab selected an algal diet rich in nutrients than that available to it on the shore for all months of the year except September to December for protein, and July and August for energy. The input of animal matter considerably increased the protein content of the diet, but made little difference to the energy content. Growth and body condition were greatest during March and June, coinciding with the peak in algal biomass. Storage of nutrients in the hepato-pancreas of G. albolineatus commenced in November, coinciding with the increase in biomass and quality of algae on the shores, and then, peaking in May and June, these nutrients were utilised by the reproductive organs during the reproductive season which ran from April to November. The middle of the reproductive season coincided with the period when the standing crop of algae on the shore was at its lowest levels and poorest quality. Cycles of growth, reproduction and storage in G. albolineatus appear to be directly influenced by seasonal patterns of algal food availability. Nutrient storage in the hepato-pancreas, during periods when food is nutritionally rich and is most abundant, does not guarantee reproductive success of the crab, but appears to be a prerequisite. Selection of an optimal diet (energy- and protein-rich) in a seasonal environment by ingesting abundant nutrient-rich algal species and the opportunistic consumption of animal matter strongly influences growth and reproductive output of G. albolineatus.","Crab herbivory; Growth; Macroalgal availability; Optimal diet; Reproductive seasonality","Grapsus albolineatus; Decapoda; Grapsus albolineatus; body condition; crab; food availability; herbivores; herbivory; macroalgae; reproductive success; rocky shore; rocky shores; seasonal patterns; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030621244

Inulin is a water-soluble linear polysaccharide mixture of fructosaccharides of the same type, but with different chain lengths. It can be used in food, feed, medicine and non-food applications. As a raw material it can be used as feedstock for further modification, e.g. for the production of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Inulin is an abundant natural carbohydrate. It is the energy storage carbohydrate in many well-known vegetables and crops. Chicory has been shown to be the most promising inulin producer under moderate climate conditions. At the Research Station for Arable Farming and Field Production of Vegetables (PAGV) at Lelystad (The Netherlands) researches been conducted to fill in gaps in knowledge on crop management to ensure an optimal production of inulin.

The improvement occurs because of efficient regenerative braking and the practicality of decoupling the engine operation from the driving cycle demands. The concept under study uses an engine-driven pump supplying hydraulic power to individual wheel pump/motors (P/M's) and/or an accumulator. Available P/M's have high efficiencies (e.g., 95%) at the ideal point of operation, but the efficiency falls off considerably at combinations of pressure, speed, and displacement that are significantly away from ideal. In order to maximize the fuel economy of the automobile, it is necessary to provide the proper combination of components, system design, and control policies that operate the wheel P/M's as close as possible to their maximum efficiency under all types of driving and braking conditions. This is accomplished by using four individual wheel P/M's with planetary gear reducers (with different displacements for the front and rear units) along with an innovative accumulator design that can provide hydraulic pressure at three alternative levels. The system control policy continuously optimizes the system pressure, the location and number of wheel P/M's being used, the operating parameters of the active P/M's, the charge level of the accumulator, and the operation of the engine/pump subsystem.

Hydrogen in a spark-ignited engine can be burned at very low equivalence ratios, so that NOx emissions can be reduced to less than 10 ppm without a catalytic converter or EGR. HC and CO emissions may result from oxidation of engine oil, but by proper design are negligible (a few ppm). Lean operation also results in increased indicated efficiency due to the thermodynamic properties of the gaseous mixture contained in the cylinder and due to reduced heat transfer. The high effective octane number of hydrogen allows the use of a high compression ratio, further increasing engine efficiency. In this paper, a time-dependent engine model is used for predicting hydrogen engine efficiency and emissions. The model uses basic thermodynamic equations for the compression and expansion processes, along with an empirical correlation for heat transfer, to predict engine indicated efficiency. A friction correlation and a supercharger/ turbocharger model are then used to calculate brake thermal efficiency. The model is validated with many experimental points obtained in a recent evaluation of a hydrogen research engine. The validated engine model is then used to calculate fuel economy and emissions for three hydrogen-fueled vehicles: a conventional, a parallel hybrid, and a series hybrid. All vehicles use liquid hydrogen as a fuel. The hybrid vehicles use a flywheel for energy storage. Comparable ultra capacitor or battery energy storage performance would give similar results. This paper analyzes the engine and flywheel sizing requirements for obtaining a desired level of performance. The results indicate that hydrogen lean-burn spark-ignited engines can provide a high fuel economy and Equivalent Zero Emission Vehicle (EZEV) levels in the three vehicle configurations being analyzed.

These advantages are particularly relevant when considering advanced concept vehicles such as flying automobiles. Research and development in this technology has primarily focused on the fuel economy improvements that can be achieved in automobiles using a hydrostatic transmission and hydropneumatic accumulator energy storage. The accumulator permits the engine power to be uncoupled from the road load, thus enabling the engine to be operated at a more efficient point. By using wheel drive units that can operate as either motors (when driving) or pumps (when braking), regenerative braking can also be achieved, with the energy stored in the accumulator. In addition to improved fuel economy, several other significant design opportunities can be exploited. The drivetrain concept that has been most extensively studied would facilitate incorporation of additional attractive features such as antilock braking and traction control. The availability of hydraulic power also facilitates the incorporation of active suspension in the vehicle. Opportunities also exist for size and weight reductions, particularly by utilizing an auxiliary hydrostatic drive unit for accessories such as the air conditioning compressor and the alternator. By operating these units at a constant (relatively high) speed, they can be much smaller and lighter that those found in conventional vehicles. The electric motor which drives the radiator fan can be replaced with a more compact, lighter hydraulic unit, and the power steering pump can be eliminated altogether. When considering even more advanced vehicle concepts, such as airplanes that could be operated as roadable vehicles, hydrostatic drive once again offers some unique advantages. The technical challenges associated with practical roadable aircraft include propulsion system weight and vehicle performance for both ground and air modes of operation. When compared to conventional drivetrains, the compact size of hydrostatic pump/motors and the relative ease of distributing the power permits significant design flexibility in locating the principle powertrain components.

Mean weight of fish in the two groups did not differ beyond the first month of feeding; however, the early-maturing group had significantly greater variation in weight, significantly higher triacylglycerol content in the first sample taken, and maintained higher triacylglycerol content throughout the experiment. Thus, we describe fat storage differences in early-maturing salmon and in salmon that do not mature early, at a far younger age than has been reported previously. In addition, glycogen content and the activities of several enzymes involved in energy storage were examined. Seasonal trends in energy storage show an overall reduction in fat storage in both groups and some differences in glycogen storage dynamics between the groups in late spring.

Conventional electric propulsion systems require power processing units to convert electrical energy from the spacecraft power source to the levels required for thruster operation. One possible option to simplify electric propulsion system is the elimination of a portion or all of the power processing unit with a direct connection of the thruster to a solar array. A joint NASA/NRL effort has been initiated to experimentally determine the efficacy of this approach. To facilitate this direct drive experimentation, a concentrator solar array testbed was installed at the NASA Lewis Research Center. In the initial experiments discussed in this paper, a Stationary Plasma Thruster (SPT), was operated directly from the solar array with a peak power of 1 kW at approximately 250 VDC output. Auxiliary power to energize the thruster magnets and ignite the thruster discharge was provided by laboratory-type power supplies. Data were taken with both laboratory power supply and solar array drive to compare electrical characteristics. The thruster was observed to operate with reduced current oscillations with solar array drive when compared to data taken with laboratory power supplies. Some differences in system volt-ampere characteristics were also noted. While operating on the solar array, the thruster discharge current was increased to the point of solar array voltage collapse without extinction of the discharge. Recovery from this condition was possible by the reduction of anode flow rate. In general the thruster operated nominally in the direct drive configuration which indicated that this is a viable option for thruster operation if mission and cost analyses indicate an overall benefit from this configuration. © by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Digital storage; Electric discharges; Electric power systems; Electric propulsion; Image coding; NASA; Propulsion; Solar cell arrays; Spacecraft; Spacecraft power supplies; Spacecraft propulsion; Current oscillation; Discharge currents; Electric propulsion systems; Electrical characteristic; Power processing units; Spacecraft missions; Stationary plasma thruster; Volt-ampere characteristics; Hall thrusters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027213793

The designs are similar to previous receivers having axial distribution of concentrated solar input flux, but differ in utilizing axial conduction in the storage material for attenuation of the solar flux ""signal"", in having convective heat removal at the base of the receiver, and in employing two concentric absorber elements. One-dimensional, time-dependent heat transfer equations are formulated for energy storage and conduction in the two elements, including linearized losses to the environment, and general heat exchange effectiveness boundary conditions at the base. The orbital periodic input solar flux is represented as the sum of steady and oscillating components, with the steady component solved analytically subject to specified receiver thermal efficiency. For the oscillating components the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm (FFT) is applied, and the complex transfer functions of the absorbers are obtained and evaluated as filters for the input flux spectrum. Inverse transformation results in the amplitudes and mode shapes of the oscillating temperatures at the base of the receiver. By adjustment of design parameters the steady state performance is matched to a previously published single element receiver. With these parameters the amplitude of the oscillating component of the outlet gas temperature for the two element receiver is reduced by a factor of approximately two when the two elements operate out-of-phase. © 1997, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The algorithm shifts the water heater load, when possible, from the periods of high demand for electricity to the periods when the wind-generated electric power is available, or it will shift the load to the periods when demand for electricity is low and stored electric energy is abundant. Such DSM strategies, which can be made an integral part of the wind generating system, can help make the stand-alone generating unit more independent of the back-up generation.

Results are given for a previously designed stand-alone wind generating system, and the benefits and limitations of the proposed DSM strategy are discussed. © 1997 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. © 1997 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

They range from systems with no energy storage to those with many hours worth of energy storage. There has been little consensus among wind-diesel system developers as to the appropriate role and amount of energy storage in such systems. Some researchers advocate providing only enough storage capacity to supply power during the time it takes the diesel genset to start. Others install large battery banks to allow the diesel(s) to operate at full load and/or to time-shift the availability of wind-generated electricity to match the demand. Prior studies indicate that for high penetration winddiesel systems, short-term energy storage provides the largest operational and economic benefit. This study uses data collected in Deering, Alaska, a small dieselpowered village, and the hybrid systems modeling software Hybrid2 to determine the optimum amount of short-term storage for a particular high penetration wind-diesel system. These findings were then generalized by determining how wind penetration, turbulence intensity, and load variability affect the value of short term energy storage as measured in terms of fuel savings, total diesel run time, and the number of diesel starts. © 1997 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. © 1997 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

These advantages are particularly relevant when considering advanced concept vehicles such as flying automobiles. Research and development in this technology has primarily focused on the fuel economy improvements that can be achieved in automobiles using a hydrostatic transmission and hydropneumatic accumulator energy storage. The accumulator permits the engine power to be uncoupled from the road load, thus enabling the engine to be operated at a more efficient point. By using wheel drive units that can operate as either motors (when driving) or pumps (when braking), regenerative braking can also be achieved, with the energy stored in the accumulator. In addition to improved fuel economy, several other significant design opportunities can be exploited. The drivetrain concept that has been most extensively studied would facilitate incorporation of additional attractive features such as antilock braking and traction control. The availability of hydraulic power also facilitates the incorporation of active suspension in the vehicle. Opportunities also exist for size and weight reductions, particularly by utilizing an auxiliary hydrostatic drive unit for accessories such as the air conditioning compressor and the alternator. By operating these units at a constant (relatively high) speed, they can be much smaller and lighter that those found in conventional vehicles. The electric motor which drives the radiator fan can be replaced with a more compact, lighter hydraulic unit, and the power steering pump can be eliminated altogether. When considering even more advanced vehicle concepts, such as airplanes that could be operated as readable vehicles, hydrostatic drive once again offers some unique advantages. The technical challenges associated with practical readable aircraft include propulsion system weight and vehicle performance for both ground and air modes of operation. When compared to conventional drivetrains, the compact size of hydrostatic pump/motors and the relative ease of distributing the power permits significant design flexibility in locating the principle powertrain components. This design flexibility inevitably leads to easier achievement of a more aerodynamic design. Also, the flexibility of hydrostatic drive allows optimal load matching of the engine and propeller over a range of operating conditions, supporting minimal weight designs. © 1997, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Air conditioning; Automobile engines; Availability; Braking; Electric drives; Energy storage; Engines; Fighter aircraft; Fuel economy; Fuel storage; Hydraulic accumulators; Hydraulic drives; Hydraulics; Hydrostatic pressure; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Powertrains; Propulsion; Pumps; Regenerative braking; Traction control; Traction motors; Vehicle performance; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Air conditioning compressors; Hydraulic drive system; Hydropneumatic accumulators; Hydrostatic transmission; Power steering pumps; Powertrain components; Research and development; Technical challenges; Automobiles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976595958

Researchers all over the world are searching for the alternative energy resources to supplement the present energy needs and to conserve the conventional resources from depletion which are less costly and environmentally friendly. Harnessing the wind power and its utilization is one of the best possible answers. Investigations for recent years have revealed that wind energy has been the great deals to the rural farmers for their water pumping. Wind power can be used effectively in maintaining livestock, water supply, fish & ice farming, water desalination, sawing wood, irrigation, electrification, agricultural operations etc. If all possible considerations are given in exploiting wind energy, in the coming 4 to $ decades it can meet 30% to 45% of the world's total energy demand contributing no unwanted emissions into the atmosphere. It can adjust more jobs and occupies fewer lands. It is cheaper than any other sources. Bangladesh possesses flat terrain, hilly & mountainous regions, open river banks & harbors, and a vast lengthy coastal belt by the sea ""the Bay of Bengal"" where reasonable wind flow round the year available. For most of the said areas, electricity supply from the mother grid is almost inaccessible due to various difficulties and limitations. Moreover, a total of 2105 MW national generation capability absolutely unable to meet the present suppressed peak demand of 2114 MW for the consumers already in the grid. This continuously causing a severe regular load shedding up to 30% of the peak demand. The large sized population of the above areas is being maintained over decades mostly from fuel wood, charcoal, plant & agricultural residues, dung and very few from imported petroleum and derivatives as the only energy sources. The energy scarcity let the locality remained economically backward and noncontributing to the GDP. In some of the areas namely Chittagong Harbor, Coastal belts & City periphery, from recent observations the monthly mean wind speeds (m/s) ranging between 4.5 and 8.5 are recorded which show the genius prospect of reaping wind power in Bangladesh. Despite a promising future of this free fuel, benefits for utilizing this energy in Bangladesh are being missed because too little is known about either the resource or the technology. Wind energy can successfully be utilized in utility for supplementing our generation and to meet decentralized needs or wind-solar hybrids for Bangladeshi modern multistory buildings which are now meeting their energy deficit by individual diesel generators at higher money and environmental costs. In the context of Bangladesh, wind power to come to use, this paper is an attempt to describe the methodologies for site selection; wind data collection & regime modeling power availability, conversion & storage; turbine performance. monitoring & augmenting wind speed using cloth scoops including casts and environmental impact Assessment.

The pure argon working fluid was supplied at a stagnation pressure of 8 bar and a stagnation temperature of 500 K and expanded to high speed in a 4:1 area ratio nozzle. The axisymmetric nozzle design incorporated a high-voltage igniter and an electrical discharge rail heater for forming high-temperature plasma pistons in the working fluid. The rail discharge was supplied from an LRC circuit utilizing a 440 µF energy storage capacitor bank. Initial experiments were conducted without an MHD channel to evaluate rail heater performance and to quantify T-Layer plasma piston parameters of engineering interest near the rail heater exit. For a total thermal energy input of 276 J per T-Layer, measurements 6 cm downstream from the rail electrode indicated a minimum breakdown potential of 25 volts, a bulk electrical conductivity exceeding 500 S/m, a mean plasma piston speed of 525 m/s, and a nominal T-layer thickness of 3 cm. It was also observed that the primary current layer was separated from an electrically conductive precursor by a distance of 6 to 7 cm. Follow-on power extraction experiments were conducted with a 30.5 cm Faraday channel inside a permanent magnet assembly having a nominal magnetic induction of 0.6 Tesla. For this arrangement, the near-electrode potential drop over the major portion of the Faraday MHD channel was found to be approximately 150 volts, far exceeding the maximum u × B induced potential of 10 volts. An active loading circuit was introduced to overcome this limitation and permit current passage over the full length of the channel, but MHD interaction remained extremely weak due to facility limitations. © 1997 by the authors.

The main concept on which the system is based is the separation of the greenhouse structure into two sections: a ""crops section"" and a ""solar energy section."" The crops section, where the crop is grown, is equipped with a movable screen to reduce heat losses, mainly during the night, and ventilation windows covered with insect-proof nets and movable plastic curtains that are rolled down over the windows to regulate greenhouse temperature. The solar energy section comprises one or two solar cells attached on each side of the crop section. Each solar cell consists of a battery of plastic sleeves (placed horizontally or vertically) filled with water. The solar cells are isolated from the outside air by a double layer of transparent plastic. In addition, a reflective outer plastic film is rolled over the cells at sunset to reduce heat losses to the environment. The two sections are separated from one another by a movable plastic sheet coated with a reflective material facing inwards. The heat transfer between the two sections is facilitated by ""on/off positioning of the barrier curtain between them, as determined by the difference between the air temperatures in the two sections. This paper presents the experimental results on the thermal aspect of this method, which were performed on two prototype structures, placed at different orientations. The greenhouse with the north-south orientation was equipped with two solar cells, on the sides facing east and west, and the greenhouse with the east-west orientation had one solar cell on the south-facing side. The main modification to be made as a result of the study are also described. The results showed that under the climatic conditions of Beer-Sheva, Israel (31°15' N, 45°34' E, 315 m above MSL), the proposed method could be used successfully for growing crops that can tolerate minimum night air temperatures of 11 °C and less, such as tomatoes.","Temperature control; Thermal energy storage; Thermal screen; Water sleeves","Hexapoda; Lycopersicon esculentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879208829

The mass transfer of steam in the reactor was enhanced by spreading the steam way between the particle -tray and the reactor wall, and the heat-generation was promoted. It is also considered that high steam pressure due to the lower inlet of the reactor enhances the reaction and the heat generation. The temperature of the heat-exchanging medium in the reactor was found to affect both the reactivity of CaO and the reaction-equilibrium pressure, and the balance of them decides the generated-temperature-level and the heat-generating rate. © 1997, The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.

Specifically, a physical and numerical model of the solar heat receiver component of NASA Lewis Research Center's Ground Test Demonstration (GTD) project was developed and results compared with available experimental data. Multi-conjugate effects such as the convective fluid flow of a low-Prandtl-number fluid, coupled with thermal conduction in the phase change material, containment tube and working fluid conduit were accounted for in the model. A single-band thermal radiation model was also included to quantify reradiative energy exchange inside the receiver and losses through the aperture. The eutectic LiF-CaF2 was used as the phase change material (PCM) and a mixture of He/Xe was used as the working fluid coolant. A modified version of the computer code HOTTube was used to generate results for comparisons with GTD data for both the subcooled and two-phase regimes.

The control results depend on the values of coefficients of learning rate in fuzzy neural network. Therefore, it is desired to obtain better control results that the coefficients of learning rate are tuned to the optimum value. In this paper, the control strategy based on an auto-tuning of scaling factors with neural network and tuning of coefficients of teaming rate of neural network with genetic algorithm is proposed for leveling load fluctuation. Encoding and decoding of coefficients of learning rate and selection, crossover and mutation of genetic operation are shown and crossover rate, mutation rate is discussed.

The advantages of batteries are their high degree of modularization, low losses during float charging and, not least, their widespread use. Disadvantages are their weight, high maintenance costs and high price if storage times of less than a minute are required and are adequate. The typical ride through time of a battery backed up UPS is 15 minutes. This time was related to the power down period of computers. According to the statistics of the utility companies of today breaks last either a few seconds or exceed the 15 minute period that a diesel back up is required. In applications of today, in data centres or industrial areas, the UPS has to override short outages within seconds only. Other energy storage arrangements than batteries operating in the short-time range of 10 to 20 seconds are compact and economical and have been under discussion recently. This time period is adequate to avoid nuissance start up because it allows a time delay of a few seconds before the diesel engine is started and it allows the use of standard generation sets. This talk compares different storage media, describes the state-of-the-art, explains their mode of operation and compares the advantages and disadvantages in the UPS application.

Each row line is connected to row-MIS electrodes. Each MIS in a given row can interchange charge with only one column MIS well with each of the column MIS wells in a row being attached to a different column output line.• The advantages of charge-injection-device (CID) and charge-coupled-device (CCD) technologies for the development of monolithic HgCdTe infrared image sensors for the 3-5 μm wavelength band are presented by Richard A. Chapman et al. in IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, ED-27(1), January 1980, pp. 134-145, ""Monolithic HgCdTe Charge Transfer Device Infrared Imaging Arrays"".• The invention of US-A-4259576 refers to a CID in which each detector element includes a x-electrode portion and a y-electrode portion. The rows of y-electrode portions are covered with an opaque covering. The arrangement permits read-out of individual detector elements with a reduced risk for blooming by nearby detector elements at low inputs.• The imager of US-A-4360732 comprises integrating electrodes which are connected together in columns, transfer electrodes which are connected together in rows and drain wells. After an integration period, accumulated charge is transfered from wells under the integrating electrodes to the drain wells. The column voltages are sampled before and after the transfer of charge and the voltage difference is proportional to the intensity of infrared radiation. A field plate, which covers the area between active areas, is used to prevent light from creating minority carriers in the regions between detector elements and to provide channel stop by permitting accumulation of the surface between the detecting areas thereby preventing carriers from moving from one detector element to another. A MIS electrode is formed on an insulating layer which separates the MIS electrode from the field plate.u• The provision of a field plate next to a MIS electrode establishes an electric field at the edge of a column-read well next to the field plate. This electric field produces an increased tunnel current. This problem is solved in EP-A-0044610 by either having an increased thickness of an insulating layer between the field plate and the MIS electrode or by placing the field plate and the MIS electrode on the same level.• Each pixel of the imager presented in JP-A-57010986 comprises a storage electrode, a detecting electrode and a control electrode. The control electrode allows the signal charge to be skimmed off from the total amount of charge which includes charge generated from the background.• The elementary cells of the imager in US-A-4583108 are arranged in a staggered configuration. The arrangement permits the number of rows to be doubled without increasing the number of cells connected to a reading amplifier. Guard electrodes which are disposed below addressing and reading conductors are provided in order to prevent signals for addressing and reading the cells to interfere with charges of other cells.• Leakage-current is reduced and the speed is improved in the imager of JP-A-59047759, in which a thin layer of n-type is formed at the surface of a p-type substrate.• The interface between an n-type HgCdTe layer and an insulating layer of a MIS type photosensor is improved in JP-A-59061080 by forming an anodic oxide film on the surface of the n-type layer.• In JP-A-60074568 the problem of tunnel currents, which are generated when a large voltage is applied to an electrode in order to generate a deep storage well, is reduced by forming transparent electrodes over photo-absorbing HgCdTe regions having a narrow energy bandgap and forming storage electrodes over HgCdTe regions having a large energy bandgap.• The imager disclosed in JP-A-60103666 is similar to the imager presented in JP-A-60074568 discussed above. An HgCdTe layer having a large energy bandgap is formed on a CdTe substrate in this structure.• The imager of JP-A-60180162 comprises active regions corresponding to detector elements which are surrounded by resistance layers buried in the substrate. The resistance layers allow stored signal charges which are injected in the direction of the substrate to recombine at high speed.• In JP-A-60193375 HgCdTe regions having a narrow energy bandgap are formed below charge injection electrodes. When reset is performed, signal charges recombine at high speed in these HgCdTe regions.• A thin recombination layer is employed between a substrate and a photodetective layer in the imager of JP-A-61067958. The lattice constant of the recombination layer is different from the lattice constant of the substrate and the photodetective layer. To prevent misfit dislocation, the thickness of the recombination layer is chosen to be thinner than a critical value.• The design of the imager presented in US-A-5171994 eliminates previously used optical windows consisting of a conductive thin semi-transparent chromium layer. The elimination of the chromium optical window results in an increased pixel-to-pixel uniformity, fabrication with only four mask levels and an increase in wafer yield.

A significant feature of the liquid crystal surface energy incorporated in the model is the elastic storage due to deviations of the macroscopic orientation and of the orientational order from the preferred equilibrium values. The model predicts that thin LCP fibers are unstable to periodic surface perturbations that eventually would produce fiber break-up and lead to an array of LCP droplets, as in the case of Rayleigh's fiber instability. The additional liquid crystalline elastic storage modes incorporated in the model, but not present in isotropic melts, tend to increase the magnitude of the critical wave-length for fiber break-up over that given by the Rayleigh criteria (i.e., fiber circumference) by a relatively small factor that depends on the ratio of the interfacial tension and the nematic anchoring energy.",,"Composite materials; Crystalline materials; Crystals; Fibers; Liquid crystal polymers; Liquid crystals; Liquids; Anchoring energies; Fiber circumference; Macroscopic orientation; Orientational orderings; Simplifying assumptions; Stability analysis; Thermodynamic model; Thermoplastic polymer; Crystal orientation; Composites; Elasticity; Energy; Polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5244343850

The psophometrically weighted noise, in accordance with C.C.I.T.TN. o 1, must not exceed 2 mV r.1n.s. The function of the power system is to charge the system batteries, as an energy storage according to the demands of the telecommunication equipment. The power system works without human supervision at their installation places, so these would have remote Power Management System [PMS] to monitor the operation.

J. Durian, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 4780 (1995)]. Here, a more complete account of the model is presented, along with results for linear rheological properties as a function of the latter two important physical parameters. It is shown that the elastic character vanishes with increasing liquid content in a manner that is consistent with rigidity percolation and that is almost independent of polydispersity. As the melting transition is approached, the bubble motion becomes increasingly nonaffine and the relaxation time scale appears to diverge. Results are also presented for nonlinear behavior at large applied stress, and for the sudden avalanchelike rearrangements of bubbles from one tightly packed configuration to another at small applied strain rates. The distribution of released energy is a power law for small events, but exhibits an exponential cutoff independent of system size. This is in accord with multiple light scattering experiments, but not with other simulations predicting self-organized criticality. © 1997 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4244173692

The use of this O(N) algorithm is very effective since, otherwise, we have to calculate a large number of eigenstates, i.e., the occupied one-electron states up to the Fermi energy and the unoccupied states with higher energy.

Nitride LEDs exhibit brightness levels and longevity well in access of what is required for outdoor applications. Combined with the available red LEDs, one can, for the first time, have full color all semiconductor displays. Very recently, pulsed room temperature operation of 410 nm semiconductor laser, the shortest wavelength ever from a semiconductor, has been reported. If used for traffic lights, in office, automobile, aircraft, airport, run-ways, ships and home illumination, these devices can outlast and outperform the incandescent light bulbs while saving precious energy. This material system is intrinsically germane to short wavelength semiconductor lasers for increased data storage. Nitrides are also conducive for high power devices/circuits, and sensors and detectors with applications in high temperature and unfriendly environments. Estimates show that substantial weight savings can be had in aircraft and spacecraft. In aircraft, the devices can replace the bulky hydraulics rendering the craft more reliable and lighter while avoiding costly coolers. Moreover, AlGaN alloy with bandgaps above 5.5 eV shows negative electron affinity surface with applications to cold cathodes in general and flat panel displays in particular. GaN and related materials are rich in defects, certainly to a large extent due to the lack of native substrates, whose characteristics have been analyzed both structurally and electronically.","Defects; Electrical and Optical Devices; III-V Nitrides","Characterization; Crystal defects; Electron devices; Electronic structure; Light emitting diodes; Nitrides; Optical devices; Semiconductor device manufacture; Spectrum analysis; Bandgaps; Negative electron affinity surface; Semiconductor displays; Semiconductor materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143135393

The optical design, based on grazing incidence mirrors, aims at obtaining a highly stable clean beam with efficient harmonic rejection together with small vertical and horizontal focal spot sizes. The heat load associated with unwanted high energies is dump in the less critical component, i.e. the first mirror. The latter is a flat Si mirror which acts as a heat sink, introduces a cut-off at high energy and steers the beam out of the brehmsstrahlung emission cone of the straight section. Horizontal and vertical focusing are performed separately by a couple of piezoelectric (PZT) mirrors in a classical Kirkpatrick-Baez configuration. To overcome the limitation due to the maximum length of the commercially available PZT ceramics (150 mm), several plates have been assembled side to side thus allowing a much wider angular acceptance. A wavefront sensor will provide in-situ monitoring of the mirrors shape.

In the production of other ferroelectric films developed for similar applications, e.g. BST [1], there has been evidence of interdiffusion during the annealing process. This study uses Mass and Energy Dispersive Heavy Ion Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (HIERDA), otherwise known as Recoil Spectrometry (RS), with 75-100 MeV 127;I ions to determine the amount of interdiffusion in a standard treatment of SBT deposited on Pt electrodes on Si. A new analytical procedure, involving simulation of the Time of Flight and Energy (TOF-E) data from the HIERDA has been implemented. The analysis can be considered in two parts. Firstly, the simulation of the physical processes which take place in the sample and timing foils which yield the distribution of exiting ions arriving at the detector and secondly, the response behaviour of the detectors which determines the pulse height spectrum. The model takes into account straggling and stopping of the incident ions, scattering of the incident ions which gives rise to recoiling ions and scattered ions and determines both energy and intensity values, and stopping and straggling of the exiting ions in the target and timing foils. This approach leads to intermediate data which is stored in linked lists of exiting ions. This data is then combined with detector response functions and energy and time calibrations. The simulated spectra can readily be compared with the raw experimental data.","Ferroelectric Thin Films; Heavy Ion Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis; Strontium Bismuth Tantalate","Heavy ion elastic recoil detection analysis (HIERDA); Recoil spectrometry (RS); Time of flight and energy (TOFE); Annealing; Computer simulation; Dielectric films; Electrodes; Electron scattering; Interdiffusion (solids); Random access storage; Strontium compounds; Ferroelectric materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143075831

Two prominent hole-emitting levels with thermal activation energies 0.34 eV and 0.39 eV to the valence band and two electron-emitting levels with activation energies 0.22 eV and 0.29 eV in the upper half-gap have been detected immediately after irradiation by 5.48 MeV alpha particles. These have been identified with the H3, H4 and EC and EA defects, respectively, hitherto observed as a result of electron, proton and/or gamma irradiation. Interesting transformations of the majority carrier deep levels are observed both with minority carrier injection and room temperature annealing. In particular, an additional hole level H5 at EV+0.58 eV is produced in the majority carrier spectrum as a result of ∼40 hours of room temperature (∼20°C) storage or more rapidly as a result of minority carrier injection. Similarly a third minority carrier level ED at EC-0.37 eV appears after several days of room temperature storage following irradiation. No additional electron level is observed in optical DLTS. On the other hand the hole levels are found to completely disappear on optical injection. The hole capture cross-sections of H4 and H5 are found to be temperature dependent but the capture barrier energy for H5 is found to be significantly different from a recently reported value. The observed changes in the DLTS spectra do not necessarily require the hitherto proposed transformation of H4 into H5. The observed properties can be interpreted in terms of no or partial transformation. Similarly, the recently suggested transformation of H5 into EA is not supported by our data.","Defect reactions; DLTS; InP; Radiation-induced defects","Activation energy; Alpha particles; Annealing; Charge carriers; Crystal defects; Deep level transient spectroscopy; Energy gap; Metallorganic chemical vapor deposition; Radiation damage; Semiconductor growth; Thermal effects; Alpha radiation induced deep levels; Low pressure metallorganic chemical vapor deposition (LP MOCVD); Semiconducting indium phosphide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3743101663

Energy extracted from the solar wind is episodically stored in the magnetosphere, with a large fraction of this energy being in the form of excess magnetic flux in the magnetotail lobes. The stored energy is periodically dissipated in an explosive instability that occurs in the near-Earth plasma sheet at substorm expansive phase onset. Methods are discussed to estimate the amount of energy transferred from the solar wind to the magnetosphere during substorm growth phases. Observational and modeling constraints are then used to assess quantitatively the total amount of energy stored in the plasma sheet and magnetotail lobes. Possible energy sources to drive substorm evolution are evaluated in one particularly well-observed case (May 3, 1986). By examining the major avenues of energy dissipation, the energy that is released in the form of plasma sheet heating, ionospheric Joule heating, etc. is assessed during the substorm. It is found that stored tail-lobe energy is sufficient (by a factor of 3 or more) to drive observed substorm dissipation processes.

We address the question of the proper determination of cross sections and rate constants in single beam experiments and the factors that influence the width of the collision energy distributions. We identify space charge effects as the dominant contribution under our experimental conditions. Problems pertinent to state-selected primary ion preparation with narrow energy distributions are highlighted.

A numerical model based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics was developed to describe the energy conservation within the hot fluid and the PCM and the exergy destruction in the overall system. This study has revealed that an increase in the mass flow rate of the hot fluid, to accelerate the melting of the PCM, leads to important exergy destruction within the overall system. Moreover, the optimal melting temperature of the PCM deviates from the expected geometric mean of the heat source and environment temperature, Tm = (T∞Tc)1/2. Finally, the problem of initial subcooling of the PCM was considered. This study revealed that the effects of this initial condition vanish and become negligible when approximately 40% of the PCM slab has melted. © Elsevier.","Analysis; Energy storage; Exergy destruction; Optimal melting temperature; Phase change material",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750474473

These oligoenes were prepared by McMurry and Wittig reactions. The tetradecapreno-β-carotene 7 would seem to be the longest β-carotene yet reported. Furthermore, we investigated the electronic properties using cyclic voltammetry and photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to generate open-shell and closed-shell ions of carotenoids in solution and in the solid state, respectively. With increasing chain length (≥ 11 double bonds), even the generation of tetracations and tetraanions could be observed by cyclic voltammetry. Extending the number of conjugated bonds causes the potentials to converge to limiting values. All electron-transfer processes occur in one-electron steps, which are close to each other in pairs. The potential difference between the first oxidation potential and the first reduction potential is a linear function of the reciprocal chain length. Despite the different techniques used (CV and UPS) and the different condensed phases, there is an excellent correspondence between the energies of the radical cation states generated by the two methods. This shows that the radical cation formation is principally determined by the chain length. The structures of the ion states were investigated using semiempirical methods at the NDDO level. Charge delocalization and bond relaxation are not identical and do not utilize the same number or the same kind of atoms. It can be shown that from the length of 20 double bonds onwards, the effective conjugation length for doubly-charged cations converges slowly to a limiting value. © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1997.","C26-C70 β-carotenes; Carotenoids; Cyclic voltammetry; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Semiempirical calculations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748727765

Heat balance studies, including the energy storage term inside the litter on the forest floor were carried out and the results revealed the evaporation rates of water vapor from the litter into the atmosphere. On the forest floor, the measured sensible heat flux traveled upward and the temperature gradient indicated an upward transfer. The measured water vapor flux also traveled upward, whereas the humidity gradient indicated a downward transfer. The transfer of water vapor depicted a counter-gradient in the humidity profile within the trunk space. In this study, the dry and wet bulb temperatures both inside of and on the surface of the litter were utilized for the lower level of the gradient profile to determine the difference in temperature and specific humidity between the two different heights. Latent heat flux occupied less than 30% of the net radiation in May during periods without rainfall, except after rain events, when it occupied more than 100% of the received energy. Less than 2.0 mm/day of water vapor were released after rainfall, and 0.5~0.8 mm/day during the period without rainfall in May. 2.0 mm/day were released after rainfall and less than 0.5 mm/day during the periods without rainfall, occurring in November, in Hokkaido. It is necessary to determine the bulk transfer coefficient for scalars and momentum in order to estimate the quantity transferred from the various surfaces. The bulk transfer coefficient for sensible heat was derived using both the eddy-correlation and gradient profile methods. The coefficient for water vapor was determined through a weighing device technique and the gradient profile method.

For the seasonal heat storage unit, paraffin was used as the phase change material (PCM). The system consists mainly of four units: solar air heaters, the seasonal heat storage unit, the greenhouse and a computerized data-acquisition/control unit. The absorber surface of the installed air heaters is 0.15 m2 per square meter of greenhouse ground surface. The storage tank volume is 0.055 m3 per square meter of greenhouse ground surface, and the storage volume is about 0.37 m3 per square meter of the solar air heaters. The storage tank contains 6 000 kg of paraffin PCM, of which the thermal properties, as measured with a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), were: melting temperature range of 48 - 60 °C and latent heat of melting 190 kJ/kg. All the temperatures at the inlet and outlet of the storage tank, the solar air heaters, and in the tank and the greenhouse were measured by thermistors each second, and the 15-minute averages were recorded and fed into the data-logger and computer control system. In this paper, the preliminary results obtained during the charging period of the storage tank, August and September 1994 in the first year of the experiment are presented. During the charging periods of August and September of 1994, an average values of the air temperature at the outlet of the collectors were 59.6 and 56.7 °C, respectively. The average temperature of the paraffin reached 46.8 °C and 49.3 °C during August and September 1994, respectively.","Greenhouse heating; Phase change energy storage; Solar energy",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24444478815

In addition most magnetospheric disturbances appear to occur in sporadic sequences at locations not a-priori predictable. Consequently even co-ordinated data from many and multiple satellites will depend on additional information from global networks of instrumentation on the ground.

This phenomenon reveals itself by the production of the diffuse flux of high-energy gamma and neutrino radiation due to the interaction of the cosmic rays with the intracluster gas. The produced flux is determined by the cosmological density of baryons, Ωb, if a large part of this density is provided by the intracluster gas. The signal from relic cosmic rays has to be compared with the flux produced by the late sources, which can be considered as a background in the search for cosmic-ray production in the past. We calculate this flux considering the normal galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the clusters as the sources of cosmic rays. Another potential cosmic-ray source is the shock in the gas accreting to a cluster. We found that this background is relatively high: the diffuse fluxes produced by relic cosmic rays are of the same order of magnitude that can be expected from AGNs in the clusters. In all cases the predicted diffuse gamma-ray flux is smaller than the observed one, and the diffuse neutrino flux can be seen as the small bump at E ∼ 106 GeV over the atmospheric neutrino flux. A bright phase in the galaxy evolution can be a source of the relic cosmic rays in clusters, revealing itself by diffuse gamma and neutrino radiation. We found that the observation of a signal from the bright phase is better for an individual cluster. © 1997. The American Astronomical Society.

Gamma-ray deposition is handled in a simple, accurate manner. We have parameterized the storage of energy, which arises from the time-dependent deposition of radioactive decay energy, in a reasonable manner that spans the expected range. We find that the Chandrasekhar-mass deflagration model W7 of Nomoto, Thielemann, & Yokoi shows good agreement with the observed spectra of SN 1992A and SN 1994D, particularly in the UV, where our models are expected to be most accurate. The sub-Chandrasekhar models do not reproduce the UV deficit observed in normal SNe Ia. They do bear some resemblance to subluminous SNe Ia, but the shapes of the spectra (i.e., the colors) are opposite that of the observed ones, and the intermediate-mass element lines (such as Si II and Ca II) are extremely weak, which seems to be a generic difficulty of the models. Although the sub-Chandrasekhar models have a significant helium abundance (unlike Chandrasekhar-mass models), helium lines are not prominent in the spectra near maximum light and thus do not act as a spectral signature for the progenitor. © 1997.

In the first case, two steps are involved : precipitation in an aqueous solution followed by thermal treatment of the powder under reducing atmosphere given by N2/H2/H2O mixtures. In the second case, the spinel phase is directly formed in the mill at room temperature by milling Fe+Fe2O3+TiO2 in stoichiometric quantities under argon atmosphere. Powders obtained by soft chemistry are very well dispersed and homogeneous, their size determined by transmission electron microscopy and surface area measurements is about 40 nm. Powders obtained by ball-milling consist of aggregates of many small particles. The average size of the aggregates is approximatly 100-500 nm as seen with SEM micrographs and the size of the small crystallites evidenced by TEM using dark field observations is about 15 nm. In each case, X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy evidence the spinel structure. The reactivity of the powder towards oxygen is studied by thermogravimetry and the influence of the oxidation and reduction reactions upon the magnetic properties of the particles is investigated, mainly the coercivity. Close correlations are revealed between the coercivity and the evolution of the spinel stoichiometry. The coercivity seems to depend on a combination of stresses and of the magnetostrictive properties of the Fe2+ cations. The stresses are induced by the milling and by the oxidation, as indicated by the correspondence between maxima of oxidation determined using differential thermogravimetric analysis and those of coercivity. © 1997 Trans Tech Publications.","Coercivity; Mechanosynthesis; Mössbauer spectroscopy; Nanometric particles; Soft chemistry; Spinels; X-ray diffraction","Ceramic materials; Coercive force; Data storage equipment; Heat treatment; Mossbauer spectroscopy; Nanostructured materials; Oxidation; Precipitation (chemical); Reduction; Synthesis (chemical); Titanium oxides; Transmission electron microscopy; Titanium ferrites; Ferrites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20644462561

One muscle from each animal served as a basal control. The contralateral muscle was treated with insulin (10 mU/ml), leptin (0.01- 10 μg/ml), or insulin plus leptin, and incorporation of [14C]glucose or [14C]oleate into CO2 and into either glycogen or triacylglycerol (TAG) was determined.

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the relation between iron deficiency without anemia and physical performance in healthy active women aged 19-36 y. Iron-status assessment included determination of hemoglobin, hematocrit, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin values. Dietary iron intake was assessed by frequency questionnaires and physical activity level was estimated by frequency questionnaires and 2-wk records. Fifteen women with normal iron status and 15 women with iron depletion (serum ferritin &lt; 12 μg/L) were chosen randomly from a group of 69 nonanemic women and given physical-performance tests, including determinations of maximum oxygen consumption (V̇O2max), ventilatory threshold, and δ-efficiency. There were no significant differences between the two groups in body size, body composition, physical activity level, dietary iron intake, δ-efficiency, or ventilatory threshold. Compared with the iron-depleted group, the iron- sufficient group had significantly higher hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin values and a significantly greater tendency to use iron supplements. When physical activity level and fat-free mass were controlled for, the iron-depleted group had a significantly lower V̇O2max. The difference in V̇O2max was significantly associated with serum ferritin concentration; hemoglobin value was not a significant confounder. Therefore, reduction of V̇O2max in nonanemic women with iron depletion was likely caused by factors related to reduced body iron storage but was unrelated to decreased oxygen-transport capacity of the blood.","Cross-sectional study; Dietary iron; Exercise; Iron deficiency without anemia; Iron depletion; Maximum oxygen consumption; Physical performance; Women; δ-efficiency","ferritin; hemoglobin; iron; transferrin; adult; aerobic capacity; anemia; article; body composition; body size; clinical article; controlled study; dietary intake; endurance; female; ferritin blood level; hematocrit; human; iron deficiency; iron therapy; lung ventilation; oxygen consumption; oxygen transport; physical performance; questionnaire; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842375717

The trivalent centres in CdF2 exhibit shallow-deep bistability and have potentials for optical data storage. The shallow electrons associated with certain impurities or interstitial silver in AgBr and AgCl are believed to play key roles in some of the photo-induced processes. We have studied these systems using a method developed earlier for excited electron centers in insulators. In CdF2 we found that the deep level (compact state) is separated from the shallow level (diffuse state) by a small potential barrier and the estimated changes of the optical refractive index between the deep and shallow states are in qualitative agreement with experiment. We also report on our preliminary work of the shallow electron centres in silver chloride. The topics considered are the electron state trapped at an interstitial silver, and the role of the excited electron in the diffusion of the interstitial silver toward the silver vacancy. Possible mechanisms for the recently observed anomalous heat generation in photo-excited silver halides are discussed.","CdF2:M3+; Excited electron centres; Silver halides","Composition effects; Crystal impurities; Diffusion in solids; Electron energy levels; Optical data storage; Photochemical reactions; Refractive index; Semiconducting gallium; Semiconducting indium; Semiconducting silver compounds; Semiconductor doping; Cadmium fluoride; Silver bromide; Silver chloride; Semiconducting cadmium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12844253946

The model for optimal design so determines the sizes of the main components of the system - namely the chiller and the storage tank - that the system's life cycle cost is minimal. The model is based on linear programming and is implemented in a computer program for HVAC systems with ice storage. This paper demonstrates that the optimal sizes of chiller and storage tanks differ from those selected using traditional techniques. It emphasizes the cost-effectiveness of the optimally designed system and also includes a sensitivity analysis pertaining to the economic feasibility of such systems under different economic conditions.","Design; Economic analysis; HVAC systems; Ice storage; Optimization","Air conditioning; Computer systems programming; Cooling systems; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Design; Heat storage; HVAC; Ice; Life cycle; Linear programming; Optimal systems; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Tanks (containers); Economic aspects; Economic condition; Economic evaluations; Economic feasibilities; HVAC system; Ice storage; Optimization techniques; Traditional techniques; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12444259854

Yet the expansion phase is known to inject energetic particles into the ring current, which should strengthen the storm. We propose to reconcile these apparently contradictory results by combining the virial theorem and a principle of energy partitioning between energy storage elements in a system with dissipation. As applied to the unloading description of the substorm expansion phase, the virial theorem states that -Dst is proportional to the sum of the total magnetic energy and twice the total kinetic energy in the magnetosphere including the tail. Thus if expansion phase involves converting magnetic energy stored in the tail into kinetic energy stored in the ring current, a drop in -Dst during expansion phase requires that less than half the drop in magnetic energy goes into the ring current, the rest going into the ionosphere. Indeed Weiss et al., have estimated that the energy dissipated in the ionosphere during expansion phase is twice that injected into the ring current. This conclusion is also consistent with the mentioned energy partitioning principle, which requires that more energy be dissipated than transferred between storage elements. While Iyemori and Rao's observations seem to contradict the hypothesis that storms consist at least in part of a sum of substorms, this mode of description might nonetheless be preserved by including the substorm's growth-phase contribution. Then the change in storm strength measured from before the growth phase to after the expansion phase is positive, even though the expansion phase alone makes a negative contribution.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0642281197

It is shown that room-temperature high-energy ball milling is an effective tool for the synthesis of nanophase CeO2-ZrO2 solid solution in a wide composition range. The use of combined X-ray diffraction analysis, Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy indicate that the milling process induces the formation of true solid solutions with a contraction of the cell parameter for cubic ceria following the introduction of Zr into the lattice. This, in turn, remarkably enhances the oxygen storage/transport and redox capacity compared to pure ceria and zirconia or to a simple mixture thereof. An unusual resistance to high-temperature cycling was also evidenced. These features were analyzed by the study of the reduction profile of doped ceria carried out by temperature-programmed reduction at different milling times. The oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of the catalysts was also evaluated; both the total and the kinetic accessible OSC indicated that the best composition is CexZr1-xO2 with x &gt; 0.5. This was correlated to the structural features and to the presence of a high concentration of ions with redox character (i.e., Ce4+ ions) which favor oxygen mobility. © 1997 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346720519

Human activity is already directly and indirectly affecting almost half of the terrestrial biological C cycle. Management of even a small fraction of the biological C cycle would make a major contribution to mitigation of this greenhouse gas. Electric power generation is responsible for roughly one third of fossil CO2 emissions. Direct CO2 mitigation processes are those that reduce fossil CO2 emissions from specific power plants. Direct biological CO2 mitigation processes include the cultivation of microalgae on flue-gas or captured CO2, and the cofiring of wood with fossil fuels. Indirect biological processes, such as growing trees for C storage or for fueling dedicated biomass power plants, recapture CO2 that already has entered the atmosphere. Indirect and direct CO2 mitigation processes have the same overall effect in reducing global warming potential. Reducing global CO2 emissions from forest destruction and unsustainable agricultural and land use practices is one of the most cost-effective, and environmentally beneficial actions that can be taken now to arrest global climate change. Another near-term option is to enhance the substitution of fossil fuels with biofuels. Biofuels are a major source of fuel for the poorer half of mankind. Globally, biofuels could replace a substantial fraction of current fossil fuel usage. Cofiring biomass wastes and residues with coal is one of the lowest-cost, nearest-term options for reducing fossil CO2 emissions at existing power plants.

Blotted proteins on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes can be labeled rapidly with MDPF. Our results demonstrate that energy from the excited intermediate produced in the TCPO-H2O2 reaction can be efficiently transferred to MDPF-labeled proteins in solution and on PVDF membranes. Although this nonenzymatic chemiluminescent system produces a background emission that reduces the sensitivity, the method developed in this work allows detection of 5 ng of protein in blots after 5 min exposure to X-ray film.

M.S., Free University, Amsterdam, Netherlands","This target article addresses the role of storage and reutilization of elastic energy in stretch-shortening cycles. It is argued that for discrete movements such as the vertical jump, elastic energy does not explain the work enhancement due to the prestretch. This enhancement seems to occur because the prestretch allows muscles to develop a high level of active state and force before starting to shorten. For cyclic movements in which stretch- shortening cycles occur repetitively, some authors have claimed that elastic energy enhances mechanical efficiency. In the current article it is demonstrated that this claim is often based on disputable concepts such as the efficiency of positive work or absolute work, and it is argued that elastic energy cannot affect mechanical efficiency simply because this energy is not related to the conversion of metabolic energy into mechanical energy. A comparison of work and efficiency measures obtained at different levels of organization reveals that there is in fact no decisive evidence to either support or reject the claim that the stretch- shortening cycle enhances muscle efficiency. These explorations lead to the conclusion that the body of knowledge about the mechanisms and energetics of the stretch-shortening cycle is in fact quite lean. A major challenge is to bridge the gap between knowledge obtained at different levels of organization, with the ultimate purpose of understanding how the intrinsic properties of muscles manifest themselves under in-vivo-like conditions and how they are exploited in whole-body activities such as running. To achieve this purpose, a close cooperation is required between muscle physiologists and human movement scientists performing inverse and forward dynamic simulation studies of whole-body exercises.",,"adenosine triphosphate; biomechanics; body movement; elasticity; energy transfer; jumping; muscle contraction; muscle force; muscle stretching; review; running; skeletal muscle; thermodynamics; work",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343171809

Using 31P MRS we have monitored the hepatic energetics of intact cold preserved pig liver using standard clinical harvesting and storage techniques. Following cold storage for 2 h the livers were hypothermically reperfused with oxygenated modified University of Wisconsin preservation fluid. Prior to reperfusion MRS detectable adenosine diphosphate plus adenosine triphosphate was negligible; however, the spectrum showed intense resonances from phosphomonoesters and inorganic phosphate, as a consequence of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis during cold preservation. Following a 10-min period of hypothermic reperfusion, regeneration of adenosine triphosphate occurred with a concurrent decline in inorganic phosphate and phosphomonoester, both of which are associated with adenosine triphosphate synthesis. The capacity of the liver to regenerate adenosine triphosphate following a 24-h period of cold storage was reduced by approximately 40% (p &lt; 0.01) of the total amount achieved following the shorter cold storage time. Adenosine triphosphate regeneration rates were biphasic and were decreased upon prolonged storage, with the initial rate being reduced from 40.6 · 10-2 · min-1 (standard deviation (sd) 2.70 · 10-2 · min-1) to 14.8 · 10-2 · min-1 (sd; 2.4 · 10-2 · min-1) and the secondary rate from 1.77 · 10-2 · min-1 (sd; 0.18 · 10-2 · min-1) to 0.84 · 10-2 · min-1 (sd; 0.45 · 10-2 · min-1). MR images of the liver during the period of hypothermic reperfusion were also performed providing an assessment for the degree of hepatic vascular perfusion. This non-invasive, 31P MRS assessment of hepatic energetics in a clinically relevant animal model has great potential for the understanding of graft preservation injury.","adenosine triphosphate regeneration; hypothermic reperfusion; liver; storage","adenosine triphosphate; animal experiment; article; donor; hypothermia; liver regeneration; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; reperfusion; swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342710369

The model focuses on the oxidation processes taking place in the reactive layer between hot burned gases and cold unreacted air/fuel mixture, with initial and boundary conditions similar to those provided by the emergence of hydrocarbons from a piston land crevice. Energy and species conservation equations are solved for the entire time-dependent process, using detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms. Simulation results show that the in-cylinder process is largely controlled by diffusion rates for burned gas temperatures above a transition level (of the order of 1400-1700 K depending on fuel type), reaction controlled for temperatures below that level, and practically frozen for temperatures below 1300 K. Radicals in the burned gas are shown to be important only in initiating the reaction, as radicals concentrations generated by the oxidating fuel greatly exceed burned gas concentrations except at burned gas temperatures below 1300 K. Large differences in oxidation rates are found for different fuels for the same initial conditions of burned gas temperatures and stoichiometries. The differences can be attributed to the lengths of the reaction chain, and the diffusion of intermediate products towards the cold wall zone (which acts as a storage buffer), leading to differences in the generation of radicals in the reacting zone. In contrast with previous suggestions that oxidation is dominated by the existing radicals in the burned gas, the simulations show that the role of chemical kinetics and the self-generation of radicals are critical in determining overall oxidation rates. Further, the simulations suggest that measured hydrocarbon emission levels from operation on different fuels may be attributed to their drastically different oxidation pathways and rates, rather than simply volatility or solubility in lubricant oil. © 1997 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association) Amsterdam B.V.","Engines; Hydrocarbon emissions; Oxidation; Pollutants",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342469546

Dynamic measures of flexibility are less dependent on patient discomfort and are more objective. Acute and chronic changes in flexibility are likely to occur with stretching exercises, but it is difficult to distinguish between changes in stretch tolerance as opposed to changes in muscle stiffness. How flexibility is measured impacts these findings. There is no scientifically based prescription for flexibility training and no conclusive statements can be made about the relationship of flexibility to athletic injury. The literature reports opposing findings from different samples, frequently does not distinguish between strain, sprain and overuse injury, and rarely uses the proper denominator of exposure. There is basic scientific evidence to suggest that active warm-up may be protective against muscle strain injury but clinical research is equivocal on this point. Typically, specific flexibility patterns are associated with specific sports and even positions within sports. The relationship of flexibility to athletic performance is likely to be sport-dependent. Decreased flexibility has been associated with increased in-line running and walking economy. Increased stiffness may be associated with increased isometric and concentric force generation, and muscle energy storage may be best manifested by closely matching muscle stiffness to the frequency of movement in stretch-shorten type contractions.",,"biomechanics; exercise tolerance; human; isometric exercise; muscle contraction; muscle stiffness; muscle stretching; review; running; sport injury; sprain; static exercise; training; walking",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041960016

However, conventional Møller-Plesset perturbation theory is constrained to canonical orbitals due to the explicit use of orbital energies in the energy expressions, and it is therefore not straightforward to reduce the storage requirements through such orbital localization. This work shows how the constraint of canonical orbitals can be lifted using a Laplace transform technique, and investigates the reduction in storage requirement that can result from the localization of orbitals made possible by such an approach.","Ab initio correlated method; Electronic structure calculations; Laplace transform; Localization; MP2",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041610113

The impacted fruits were incubated at the same storage conditions for 24 h before assessing the bruise volume. Two models relating the bruise volume, the impact energy and the storage time were developed for both fruits. For bananas, the bruise volume had a linear relationship with the energy absorbed by the fruits, whereas the relationship was nonlinear for plantains.

Hydrogen is a promising alternative to liquid hydrocarbon fuels. It has many advantages when injected directly into the cylinder of an internal combustion engine. However, when using compressed hydrogen gas for automotive applications, large and heavy tanks are required and when used in liquid form, expensive insulating materials and cryogenic pumps are required to create the high pressure. A prototype composite vessel has been developed to supply hydrogen gas at high pressure required for direct injection without compressing gas or using any cryogenic pumps. This vessel, called the thermocontrolled tank has been simulated and then tested to determine the rate of pressure and temperature rise in the tank. The test results indicated that the liquid hydrogen can be brought from atmospheric pressure to the high pressure in a reasonable time period. The composite vessel design has been optimized for use in vehicles. The design problem was formulated as a multi-objective optimization case because of the presence of different conflicting objectives. Weighting factors have been attached to the various objectives and then solved. Conclusions have been drawn from the tests, simulation and optimization results which would allow the most effective storage of hydrogen in thermocontrolled tanks on vehicles equipped with direct gas injection. © 1997 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

When dry HCl gas is passed over a copper surface, H2 is released and Cu is oxidized to CuCl. Subsequently, upon heating to high temperatures, the CuCl bed is decomposed back to Cu, releasing Cl2. The release of H2 from HCl on a Cu surface was studied as a function of temperature, flow rate, and specific surface area. The products H2 and CuCl were measured between 400 and 600 K; temperature has only a small effect on the reaction rate, at most T1/2. The surface geometry and gas flow allowed several thousand gas-surface collisions per HCl molecule for complete conversion of HCl to H2. The thickness of the CuCl layer is not the limiting factor in the reaction probability for layers less than a few thousand monolayers deep. Recovery of Cl2 by the thermal decomposition of CuCl was examined as a function of temperature and pressure. Useful Cl2 yields were found only for system pressures below ca. 10 torr, at temperatures above 700 K, and using a flow of inert gas to sweep out the product. ©1997 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040093675

It is emphasized that the global environmental damage caused thermodynamically is more alarming to life on Earth than the risk of exhausting the finite amount of fossil fuels being consumed at the present rate. Solar power plants can be designed and constructed to convert solar radiation into some concentrated form of useful energy first and then into electricity or directly into electricity. The latter kind is comprised of photovoltaic cells. This paper discusses some of the solar energy options and also presents a historical overview, explains the rudimentary physical principles of the technology, the photovoltaic effect, the process to generate electricity in silicon solar cells, thin-film devices and high efficiency cells, and finally, the state-of-the-art of the latest developments in solar cell technology. Finally, the storing of solar energy, collected by a photovoltaic system, is recommended in the form of hydrogen as a future energy option.

Tests were performed from harvest to the end of storage under: normal conditions (cold storage at 2C for Spartan and 0C for Golden Delicious) and modified conditions (the same temperatures but the Biofresh solution was applied to the fruits before being cooled in storage). The contact Hertz theory can be used to describe the compression curve up to the bioyield point. The parameter BMR (bioyield stress to apparent modulus of elasticity ratio) was used for classification of the whole storage period; it was divided into three parts: softening Ia, weakening Ib, ripened II. There was a linear relation between bruise volume and the absorbed energy for fruits tested at all storage times. But over Ib and II the bruise volume was a relatively stable exponential function of the absorbed energy only. The lowest value of the energy absorbed by a fruit without any bruising decreased in Ia and was relatively stable in other parts.

There is a definite need at many industrial processing plants and commercial users of electrical power to have a dependable, efficient and controllable source of real and reactive power that is available instantly to support large electrical loads (greater than 5 MVA), even if the incoming utility a.c. connection is lost. When power is interrupted or lost, the results can be extremely disruptive for critical processes and cause lost production, costly downtime and loss of customer good will, and in certain industries, can lead to environmental damage through the release of toxic emissions into the air. Recently, this challenge was faced by GNB Technologies at its lead reclaiming and smelting facility in Vernon, CA, USA. This study describes a versatile, cost-effective, workable solution to the problem that has resulted in the design and installation of a 5 MVA, 3.5 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) which provides uninterruptible power to the critical environmental control equipment throughout the plant. The BESS at Vernon provides the required power, combined with both voltage and frequency control, to allow the plant to tolerate disconnection from the utility grid without suffering unacceptable impacts on critical loads.

However, several problems stand in the way of its large-scale production and long-term storage. This includes problems associated with energy consumed in liquefaction as well as boil-off losses during storage and handling.

Carbon fiber is continuously coated with very high molecular weight polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polyvinyl-methylsiloxane (PVMS). Dynamic mechanical properties of the composites have been determined and compared with uncoated carbon fiber reinforced PMR-15 polyimide composites. The presence of the interlayer is shown by the appearance of a new relaxation peak. The peak temperature is found to be a good indication of the degree of the cure of the silicone elastomer. Comparison of the storage moduli of uncoated and coated carbon fiber composites at the service temperature range of the composites indicates that the presence of the silicone interlayer affects the shear moduli of the composites. Apparent activation energy of the α transition of the matrix in the modified composites varies with the amount of interlayer and composition in concert with the impact strength. © VSP 1997.","Carbon fiber composite; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Polyimide; Silicone interlayer","Activation energy; Interfaces (materials); Plastic coatings; Polyimides; Silicones; Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA); Polydimethylysiloxane; Polyvinylmethylsiloxane; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031702169

Members of this enzyme family have evolved diverse regulatory mechanisms that control a conserved catalytic function. The mammalian and yeast GPs are expressed as inactive forms requiring phosphorylation for activation. Phosphorylation of yeast GP occurs at a distinct site from that of mammalian GP. This work addresses the structural basis by which distinct activation signals relay to the conserved catalytic site in yeast and mammalian GPs. Such knowledge may help understand the principles by which diverse biological regulation evolves. Results: We have compared the crystal structures of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of yeast GP and propose a relay which links phosphorylation to enzyme activation. Structural components along the activation relay becomes more conserved within the GP family downstream along the relay, towards the catalytic center. Despite distinct upstream activation signals, a response element downstream of the relay leading to the catalytic center is conserved in all GPs. The response element consists of ten hydrophobic residues dispersed over two subunits of the homodimer. Phosphorylation induces hydrophobic condensation of these residues via structural rearrangement, which triggers conformation change of the active site GATE loop, leading to enzyme activation. Conclusions: Members of the GP family with diverse activation mechanisms have evolved from a constitutively active ancestral enzyme which has the TOWER hydrophobic response element in the active position. Diverse regulation evolved as a result of evolutionary constraint on the downstream response element in the active state, coupled with flexibility and variability in elements of the upstream relays.","Allosteric site; Enzyme catalysis; Evolution of protein phosphorylation; Protein conformation change; Protein refolding",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031573464

Direct overwrite (DOW) is a method to double the data transfer rate during writing, because the write process of new bits and the erase process of old bits is performed simultaneously. MO multilayer stacks must exhibit exchange coupling in order to be suitable for DOW. The switching fields of each layer depend on coercive energy, magnetic field energy and the energy of the interface wall between coupled layers. In this paper we discuss the dependence of switching fields on layer thickness and wall energy σw for several double and triple layer stacks. The memory and reference layers are Tb-FeCo and Dy-FeCo, respectively. Triple layer stacks have an intermediate layer (GdFe and GdFeCo) to adjust the wall energy. DOW presupposes a weak coupling at 300 K and a strong coupling at higher temperatures. This requires a very thick reference layer in double layer stacks, causing excessive heat capacities. However, for triple layers the DOW demands are met in much thinner stacks as the wall energy is adjusted through the intermediate layer. The wall energy of the intermediate layer is determined by its anisotropy. We studied the anisotropy of evaporated Gd-Fe, Gd-Co and Gd-FeCo films as a function of composition. Gd-Co showed only in-plane anisotropy, while Gd-Fe was perpendicularly magnetized for Fe contents up to 87 at%. Adding Co to Gd-Fe leads to a layer with a temperature dependent easy axis. The carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) of a series of magneto-optical disks, both double and triple layer stacks, was determined. The maximum CNR of 51.4 dB is comparable to results on a single layer disk with the same memory layer. On triple layer stacks a CNR &gt; 45 dB could be written at a laser power below 9 mW.","Anisotropy; Direct overwrite; Exchange coupled layers; Magneto-optic recording; Switching fields; Wall energy","Coercive force; Interfacial energy; Laser recording; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic field effects; Magnetic recording; Magnetic thin film devices; Magnetooptical devices; Multilayers; Rare earth elements; Thermal effects; Transition metals; Direct overwrite (DOW) method; Exchange coupling; Magnetic disk storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031547408

All samples were maintained at 1 °C and 93-94% relative humidity. The incidence of super ficial scald and quality parameters were assessed in February, April and June, after storage plus 1 and 7 days at 20 °C, in samples from each treatment (anti-scald rate and storage atmosphere). Storage in ULO was effective in extending the storage life of the fruit. Firmness retention was better in these fruits than in fruits held in CA and LO storage; generally, after a 7-day post-storage holding period at 20 °C, the differences were maintained. The soluble solids content and titratable acidity were similar for all treatments. These changes were similar for the 2 years studied. Over one season (1993-94) the ULO atmosphere provided the best control of superficial scald in TR apples, although a low concentration of anti-scald was necessary in some cases. During the 7-day post-storage holding period the fruit of all treatments showed an increased incidence of scald, but fruit from the ULO treatment could be considered acceptable for market distribution. Susceptibility of fruit to scald exhib ited seasonal variation; in the 1994-95 season, DPA treatment was necessary to control scald in ULO apples. No appreciable increase in low O2 injury was found in this cultivar held in 1 or 2% O2. © 1997, Sage Publications.

The analysis revealed that the heat storage of the Arabian Sea is mainly controlled by QV while the effect of QA is much larger than expected. Parameterisation of summer cooling revealed that the depletion of energy from the mixed layer is mainly due to upwelling and horizontal advection though large amount of heat is accumulated due to net air-sea heat flux.

The localized dynamic model used to parametrize the subgrid-scale (SGS) stresses begins to have a significant impact at the beginning of the nonlinear transition (or intermittency) region. The flow structures commonly found in experiments are also observed in the present simulation; the computed linear instability modes and secondary instability Λ-vortex structures are in agreement with the experiments, and the streak-like structures and turbulent statistics compare with both the experiments and the theory. The physics captured in the present LES are consistent with the experiments and the full Navier-Stokes simulation (DNS), at a significant fraction of the DNS cost.

While requiring permanent storage, radioactive waste is notorious for arousing local protest and not-in-my-back-yard (NIMBY) reactions. Nevertheless, the great majority of research by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. has been on natural science and engineering aspects of the proposed underground repository. The need to transport the waste from Canada's nuclear facilities to a remote northern site on the Canadian Shield provides a unique experimental design opportunity. Four northern communities were surveyed in this study, on their willingness to (1) host an underground repository for nuclear waste near their community or (2) reside on the transportation route along which the nuclear waste would travel to the permanent disposal location. Overall, there was considerable opposition to either hosting a nuclear waste disposal site or being along the transportation route to it. This lack of support was not related to the economic prospects that a megaproject like the underground nuclear waste repository will create. Beyond the strong opposition that was observed overall, however, we did find that there was slightly greater acceptability with involvement in the planning process. Similarly, the low acceptability along potential transportation corridors could be partially offset by direct monetary payments. Individual differences were also measured for trust in the government regulatory agencies, perceived fairness of the process, emotional responses, and faith in science and technology to deal with future problems. Together, these variables accounted for 50% of the variance in acceptability of either hosting the repository or being along the transportation route. Ethical implications of (i) the two-stage siting process Canada is following, and (ii) using monetary compensation to offset perceived risks, are discussed. Ultimately, burden sharing by distributing the risks with the benefits may be a fairer and more effective way of avoiding NIMBY.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031487088

Significant correlations were revealed between these parameters at low and high (about 5%) CO2 concentrations and different irradiances. In general, four phases were resolved in the induction curves of chlorophyll fluorescence or PA signals modulated at 35 Hz (O2-dependent component) or 400 Hz (thermal dissipation). During the first 10-15 s after onset of actinic light, a high level of reduction of the primary quinone acceptor of photosystem II (Q(A)), a low magnitude of the O2-dependent photoacoustic signal, and a high level of heat production measured as the photoacoustic signal at 400 Hz were maintained. Further illumination led to a partial Q(A)- reoxidation, an increased rate of O2 evolution, and a decline in heat production owing to an increased energy storage at the level of the plastoquinone pool. At low CO2 concentration, the steady-state level of all the above parameters was attained at the end of the first minute of illumination and remained unmodified after prolonged leaf irradiation. In contrast, the development of an additional slow peak followed by its dissipation was found for all parameters examined under high CO2 concentration and strong irradiance. The position of the slow peak in the kinetics of the O2-dependent photoacoustic signal preceded the corresponding peak of chlorophyll fluorescence measured under actinic light but coincided with the position of the peak in the kinetics of photochemical quenching. The position of the slow peak in the kinetics of thermal dissipation strictly corresponded to the one of chlorophyll fluorescence. A linear correlation was found between the magnitudes of the O2-dependent component of the photoacoustic signal and the extent of photochemical quenching. The results indicate that correlations in the kinetics and magnitudes of chlorophyll fluorescence, O2 evolution, and thermal dissipation are due at least in part to the dependence of the above parameters on the redox state of the acceptor side of photosystem II.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; CO2; O2 evolution; Photoacoustic; Photosynthesis; Plastoquinone; Thermal dissipation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031468876

Compared with fatty acid synthase activity during hibernation, summer activities were 2.5- to 8-fold higher in adipose tissue and liver. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) activity was 2.6-fold higher in WAT during the summer, consistent with increased seasonal triacylglycerol storage, but the activity did not change in liver or BAT, suggesting that in these tissues, triacylglycerol synthesis is equally active in summer and winter. Lack of change in acyl CoA synthetase in liver and BAT may reflect high synthetic rates for acyl-CoAs that are destined in the summer for glycerolipid synthesis and in the winter for β-oxidation. Monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) activity increased significantly in both liver and WAT during the summer but decreased in BAT. Although the changes were consistent with active year-round triacylglycerol synthesis, the higher summer MGAT activity observed in the squirrel liver and WAT suggest that MGATs function may not be limited to conserving essential fatty acids during physiological states of lipolysis. Seasonal changes observed in the ground squirrel were similar to those previously reported in the yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris), confirming that important adjustments occur in energy metabolism necessitated by long seasonal hibernation.","Acyltransferase; Brown adipose tissue; Hibernation; Lipid metabolism; Squirrel; White adipose tissue","acylglycerol palmitoyltransferase; acyltransferase; diacylglycerol acyltransferase; fatty acid synthase; long chain fatty acid coenzyme A ligase; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; brown adipose tissue; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; seasonal variation; squirrel; white adipose tissue; Animalia; Marmota flaviventris; Sciuridae; Spermophilus lateralis; Spermophilus lateralis; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031466672

Although no between-line difference was found in digestion of ingested energy, the true metabolizable energy (ME) intake was 40% greater in R+ than in R- birds. Basal heat production (HP) did not significantly differ between genotypes. Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) was significantly enhanced in R+ compared with R- birds, i.e., +84% when expressed as the difference in kilojoules of heat production determined in feed-deprived and fed cockerels, +31% when calculated as a percentage of ME intake (P < 0.01). The difference in DIT calculated from the regression between HP and physical activity explained 75% of the difference in HP; the remaining 25% could be explained by activity-related HP. The results cannot be explained by differences in the plasma concentration of circulating thyroid hormones: plasma thyroxine concentration did not differ between genotypes, whereas plasma triiodothyronine concentration was lower in feed-deprived R+ than in R- birds and indistinguishable in fed birds of the two lines. Heat production, however was higher in the R+ line. Propranolol decreased HP only n the R+ line, suggesting a β-adrenergic control of DIT at least in cockerels of this line. Plasma triglyceride concentration was lower in the R+ than in the R- line in fed cockerels, and plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentration was higher in the R+ than in the R- line in feed-deprived cockerels. These results are consistent with the leanness of the R+ compared with the R- line. The R+ and R- lines constitute an original model of diet- induced thermogenesis (DIT), a process that is under genetic control of appetite and allows R+ birds to balance all of their excessive energy intake without any adipose tissue storage.","Cockerels; Diet-induced thermogenesis; Energy balance; Feed intake; Genetics","animal experiment; article; bird; dietary intake; energy expenditure; food intake; genetics; nonhuman; thermogenesis; Animalia; Aves; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031459721

Verified reports of the loss of nuclear material into the environment, including loss by animals, has raised questions regarding the monitoring programmes in place on the nuclear facilities. Given these concerns regarding the fate of stored nuclear waste, the authors conducted a review of the wildlife monitoring programme used at nuclear weapons and storage facilities by (1) reviewing the key facets of the monitoring used at the facilities, (2) evaluating published and unpublished data from the facilities and (3) incorporating data from personal site visits. The study concentrated on the Department of Energy's Hanford Reservation in rural south-central Washington and the Rocky Flats Plant in central Colorado. Based on the review, it is concluded that an improved and rigorous environmental surveillance and monitoring programme is needed at both locations. The site surveys identified frequent instances of intrusion into burial sites by animals, most of which had gone unreported by Hanford and Rocky Flats personnel. It was apparent that a significant source of potential contamination was not being adequately monitored at the nuclear waste sites. It is recommended that the development of a systematic, well-planned programme of monitoring animal intrusion on burial sites be considered, coupled with improved training for responsible personnel.",,"environmental monitoring; nuclear weapons; pollution incidence; waste site; wildlife exposure; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031453166

The experiment used Freon-113 at near-saturation conditions at a constant 40% fill level to simulate the fluid dynamics and thermodynamics of cryogenic fluids in space applications. The objectives of TPCE/RF are to characterize the fluid dynamics of an axial jet-induced mixing in low gravity, evaluate the validity of empirical mixing models, and provide data for use in developing and validating computational fluid dynamics model of mixing processes. TPCE/RF accomplished all of its objectives in flight on the Space Shuttle flight in May 1996. The flow patterns observed generally agreed with a prior correlation derived from drop tower tests. Several existing mixing correlations were found to provide reasonable performance predictions. Low-energy mixing jets, dissipating on the order of 1% of the kinetic energy of previous mixer designs, were found to be effective and reliable at reducing thermal nonuniformities, promoting heat and mass active mixing, whether continuous or periodic, offers increased reliability and predictability in space cryogenic systems and can be accomplished with no significant boiloff penalty caused by kinetic energy dissipation.

Few individuals remained infective after 120 days. Concurrent measurements showed that the mean neutral lipid content of individual S. carpocapsae declined to about 10% of initial levels after 60 days, and staining of individual nematodes with Oil Red O indicated that the population was almost homogeneous for low levels of neutral lipids. in contrast, the mean glycogen content of S. carpocapsae only declined significantly between 60 and 90 days of storage. These results show that the decline in infectivity in S. carpocapsae is correlated primarily with the decline in glycogen reserves and suggests that glycogen is the key late energy store in aged infective juveniles. In contrast, Steinernema feltiae dauer larva showed a much more gradual decline in infectivity over a 150- to 180 day storage period with a concurrent decline in neutral lipids, whereas glycogen levels declined up to 90 days of storage and then remained nearly constant.

Sensory tests distinguished the control/stress groups within the 0.4°C chilling regime and the 0.4°C/3.3°C chilling groups within the control regime. Stress caused a lower score for texture (p<0.05) both at 0.4 and 3.3°C and for odor at 3.3°C in a descriptive sensory test.

These cells that have been named lipid interstitial cells or lipofibroblasts (LFs) may supply lipids for surfactant production, the synthesis of membrane phospholipids, and/or energy metabolism. They also have myofibroblastic characteristics and participate in the generation of the interstitial elastic fiber network, that is, in the pulmonary alveolar septum. To understand how this cell regulates its lipid-storing and elastin-producing properties, we have examined the effects of peroxisome proliferators on the expression of the genes that are associated with an elastin-producing myofibroblastic phenotype or an adipocytelike phenotype. Two known ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) and 15-deoxy-Δ-12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15-dPGJ2), decrease elastin gene transcription and the steady-state levels of tropoelastin (TE) and α-smooth muscle actin mRNAs in cultured LFs. Concurrently, cultured LFs increase the expression of adipocyte lipid binding protein, which is regarded as an adipocyte-specific protein, and accumulate lipid droplets. Their abilities to store lipids and express desmin intermediate filaments, α-smooth muscle actin, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain in contractile filaments in vitro illustrate similarities among the pulmonary LF, the hepatic lipocyte, and the contractile interstitial cell, which contribute to the repair reaction in the lung after pulmonary injury.","Adipocyte; Lipid storage; Lung development; Myofibroblast; Surfactant","alpha actin; collagen type 1; desmin; elastin; lipid; lipid binding protein; myosin heavy chain; peroxisome proliferator; surfactant; adipocyte; animal cell; article; controlled study; gene expression; lipid storage; lung development; lung fibroblast; myofibroblast; newborn; nonhuman; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031425869

The WIPP is a research and development facility designed to demonstrate the safe disposal of radioactive wastes generated at the United States Department of Energy facilities. The wastes will be stored 655 m (2,150 ft) below the land surface in the Salado Formation, a 610 m (2,000 ft) thick section of Permian evaporites. The 91 m (300 ft)-long waste storage rooms will close by failure thereby encapsulating the wastes. At lithostatic pressures, the salt undergoes ductile deformation, but near the free faces of the excavations the salt deforms in a brittle fashion. As a result, fractures develop in the floor and roof of the repository rooms and access drifts. The GPR surveys successfully imaged deformation caused by fracturing in portions of the roof and floor of the excavations. The results from the GPR surveys compare favorably with the available core log descriptions from boreholes. In the older, experimental portions of the WIPP excavations, roof fractures were imaged which extended diagonally from the sides of the rooms to approximately 2.1 m (seven feet) into the roof. GPR images of the floor show fractures that extend from the floor into a 0-9-1.5 m (three to five feet) thick anhydrite bed beneath the floor.","Geophysics; Ground Penetrating Radar; Hazardous Waste Management; Mining; Rock Mechanics; Waste Isolation Pilot Plant","fracture system; GPR; radioactive waste repository; USA, New Mexico, Carlsbad",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031417137

Using pelycosaurian sailbacks like Dimetrodon as analogies, popular orthodoxy holds that the tall spines served as supporting struts for dorsal sails of purported thermoregulatory function, especially heat dissipation in tropical climates. It is argued here that the neural spines of Ouranosaurus, Spinosaurus, and several other long-spined dinosaurs favor bison-like humps rather than sails: 1) in functional morphology and relative elongation they are dissimilar to pelycosaur spines but homoplastically converge on the spines of high-withered ungulates; 2) the usefulness of a sail in thermoregulation has been exaggerated - in large tetrapods it would have been fairly efficient as a thermal amplifier but ineffective as a radiator; hence large sail-hearing dinosaurs in open tropical climates are improbable; 3) the insulation properties of humps favor gigantothermy, the most likely thermobiological model for large dinosaurs. Dinosaur humps are probable adaptations for: 1) energy storage, maintenance of gigantothermy, and heat-shielding in unshaded habitats; 2) long-distance migration from feeding to nesting grounds across terrains of variable productivity; and 3) lipid conservation for production of large clutches of eggs at the nesting site.

But empirical evidence for such trade-offs is scant, which has called into question the likelihood of nonallopatric speciation. Here, we report on the second in a series of studies testing for host-related selection on pupal life-history characteristics of apple- (Malus pumila L.) and hawthorn- (Crataegus mollis L. spp.) infesting races of the Tephritid fruit fly, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh). In particular, we examine the effects of winter length on the genetics of these flies. We have previously found that the earlier fruiting phenology of apple trees exposes apple-fly pupae to longer periods of warm weather preceding winter than hawthorn-fly pupae. Because R. pomonella has a facultative diapause, we hypothesized that this selects for pupae with more recalcitrant pupal diapauses (or slower metabolic/development rates) in the apple-fly race. A study in which we experimentally manipulated the length of the prewintering period for hawthorn-origin pupae supported this prediction. If the period preceding winter is important for apple- and hawthorn-fly pupae, then so too should be the length (duration) of winter; the rationale for this prediction is that 'fast developing' pupae that break diapause too early will deplete their energy reserves and disproportionately die during long winters. To test this possibility, we chilled apple- and hawthorn-origin pupae collected from a field site near Grant, Michigan, in a refrigerator at 4°C for time periods ranging from one week to two years. Our a priori expectation was that longer periods of cold storage would select against allozyme markers that were associated with faster rates of development in our earlier study. Since these electromorphs are typically found at higher frequencies in hawthorn flies, extending the overwintering period should favor 'apple-fly alleles' in both races. The results from this 'overwinter' experiment supported the diapause hypothesis. The anticipated genetic response was observed in both apple and hawthorn races, as allele frequencies became significantly more 'apple-fly-like' in eclosing adults surviving longer chilling periods. This indicates that it is the combination of environmental conditions before and during winter that selects on the host races. Many tests for trade-offs fail to adequately consider the interplay between insect development, host plant phenology, and local climatic conditions. Our findings suggest that such oversight may help to explain the paucity of reported fitness trade-offs.","Allozymes; Apple maggot fly; Host races; Natural selection; Negative genetic fitness trade-offs; Overwintering diapause; Sympatric speciation","fitness; phytophagous insect; speciation; trade-off; winter duration; Grant; Michigan; USA; Animalia; Crataegus; Crataegus mollis; Crataegus mollis; Diptera; Diptera; Drosophila melanogaster; Hexapoda; Insecta; Malus pumila; Malus pumila; Malus x domestica; Rhagoletis pomonella; Rhagoletis pomonella; Rhagoletis pomonella; Rosaceae; Rosaceae; Tephritidae; Tephritidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031408601

To investigate the performance of the EuroQol (EQ) quality-of-life measure and the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) in assessing the outcome of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic obstruction (BPO), and to determine which men experience the greatest increase in health-related quality of life (HRQL) after TURP. Patients and methods. A prospective cohort study was undertaken over 12 months from April 1992 of 314 men who completed the EQ, the NHP and a symptom inventory before undergoing elective TURP for probable BPO (Group 1). Identical postal questionnaires were used to follow up this group at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-operatively, with response rates of 79%, 74% and 69%, respectively. Overall, 92% of patients responded at either 6 or 12 months after surgery. A group of 51 men who had not undergone operation, also with LUTS and probable BPO, were similarly followed over 6 months, before eventually undergoing TURP (Group 2). These patients differed from Group 1 in being younger, less symptomatic and having a higher baseline quality-of-life score, but the inclusion of this group from a broadly similar diagnostic category allowed outcome to be assessed over time in the absence of surgery. Results. There was a significant improvement in all LUTS 6 weeks after TURP; post-micturition dribbling and storage symptoms continued to improve for up to one year. The NHP revealed pre-operative morbidity in all dimensions of the profile. At 12 months after surgery there were significant improvements in the domains of social interaction, energy, pain, emotional reactions and sleep. The EQ profile also showed morbidity in all dimensions before surgery, with significant improvement at 12 months in usual activities, mood and pain/discomfort. The EQ self-rated health and composite quality-of-life score also showed improvement with TURP which continued for 12 months after surgery. The patients in Group 2 tended to deteriorate over the 6 months of follow-up using all measures, but the changes were not significant. The EQ composite quality-of-life score also discriminated between patients on the basis of age, number of symptoms and ASA grade, suggesting that these subgroups experienced differing amounts of benefit from surgery. Conclusion. TURP led to significant improvement in the indices of generic HRQL as measured using the NHP and EQ; this improvement continued for 12 months after surgery and mirrored the symptomatic improvement. The EQ confirmed clinical experience, in that men who were younger, fitter and most symptomatic experienced the greatest benefit from surgery. This has not been shown previously using a quality-of-life measure. Generic HRQL measures can be incorporated easily into clinical trials and both the measures used in this study have sufficient sensitivity to be used in this population. The EQ has the advantage of generating a composite quality-of-life score which is easy to interpret and can be used in cost-utility analysis. The addition of HRQL measures leads to a more robust appraisal of the results of surgical intervention. Ultimately, patient-based outcome from TURP will be assessed using a combination of psychometrically tested disease-specific and generic measures, together with symptom scoring.","Benign prostatic hyperplasia; Outcomes; Prostatectomy; Quality of life; Questionnaire; Urinary symptoms","adult; aged; article; clinical trial; cohort analysis; deterioration; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prospective study; prostate hypertrophy; quality of life; scoring system; transurethral resection; treatment outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031400817

Based on experimental results, a heat pump that uses a calcium oxide / lead oxide / carbon dioxide reaction system appears to be a suitable system. To demonstrate the validity of the heat pump, the equilibrium relationship and kinetics of calcium oxide / carbon dioxide and lead oxide / carbon dioxide, which comprise the reaction system of the heat pump, are studied experimentally. A study of the equilibrium relationship of lead oxide / carbon dioxide, which consists of a three-step equilibrium, reveals that the highest temperature equilibrium relationship of the three-step equilibrium is associated with optimal heat pump operation. The practical operation conditions of the heat pump are determined based on the equilibrium relationship and kinetic experiments. The proposed heat pump may be able to operate as a heat transformation-type heat pump, and is capable of storing heat above approximately 830°C and transforming the heat to a higher temperature of more than 870°C under sub-atmospheric pressure and thermal driving conditions with no mechanical work. The calculated mean heat output and heat output amount are 670 W/kg-CaCO3 and 1200 kJ/kg-CaCO3, respectively, at 870°C, 1 atm for 30 min. Thus, the new heat pump can be applied to a heat storage and heat transformation system for high temperature processes.","Calcium Oxide; Carbonation; Decarbonation; Heat Pump; Lead Oxide","Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Lead compounds; Lime; Reaction kinetics; Thermodynamic stability; Heat transformation; Heat utilization; Lead oxide; Heat pump systems; calcium; carbon dioxide; heat pump",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031399053

Through its far reaching projections, the central 5-HT system acts as a globally acting transmitter system to synchronize and harmonize the neuronal activities generated in multifocal, distributed networks throughout the forebrain. Substituted amphetamines exchange with 5-HT in presynaptic vesicular stores and prevent the proper storage of the released 5-HT. The 5-HT presynapses waste much energy (ATP) for functionally inefficient active transport of 5- HT. This energy crisis may lead to the degeneration of 5HT nerve terminals. especially under conditions when the peripheral supply of energy/glucose- is additionally compromized by severe systemic, energy wasting reactions (hyperthermia, peripheral serotonin-syndrome). The partial loss of 5-HT presynapses in higher brain regions will impair the ability of distributed neuronal networks to maintain the integrity of signal flow patterns and increase the likelihood of switching to instable information processing. It is assumed, and illustrated by the psychopathologies seen in previous MDMA users, that the partial loss of 5-HT nerve endings will not necessarily lead to gross behavioral abnormalities but will rather cause an intensification and accentuation of certain already existing personality features, and, in some predisposed individuals the manifestation of certain psychiatric disorders which are currently assumed to be associated with a dysfunction of the central 5-HT system.","Degeneration; Drug addiction; Ecstasy; MDMA; Neurotoxicity; Serotonin; Substituted Amphetamines","3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine; adenosine triphosphate; dopamine; serotonin; dopamine release; drug dependence; human; hyperthermia; mental disease; nerve cell network; nerve fiber degeneration; neurotoxicity; priority journal; review; serotonin release; serotonin syndrome; serotonin uptake; serotoninergic nerve",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031398516

In this study we investigated the role of Suc synthase (SuSy) in the mobilization of Suc into such sinks. Assessments of SuSy gene expression at various levels led to the surprising conclusion that, in contrast to that found for other plants, SuSy does not appear to play a role in starch synthesis in the cotton seed. However, our demonstration of functional symplastic connections between the phloem-unloading area and the fiber cells, as well as the SuSy expression pattern in fibers, indicates a major role of SuSy in partitioning carbon to fiber cellulose synthesis. SuSy expression is also high in transfer cells of the seed coat facing the cotyledons. Such high levels of SuSy could contribute to the synthesis of the thickened cell walls and to the energy generation for Suc efflux to the seed apoplast. The expression of SuSy in cotyledons also suggests a role in protein and lipid synthesis. In summary, the developing cotton seed provides an excellent example of the diverse roles played by SuSy in carbon metabolism.",,"carbon allocation; carbon dioxide fixation; carbon partitioning; cellulose; cotton; cotyledon; differential display; fiber; gene expression; phloem; plant development; seed; seed coat; seed development; starch; storage protein; sucrose synthase; translocation line; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031397570

The important concept of OEEN is that electric energy is treated like a packet of mail, with information about the sender (power producer) and the receiver (consumer). The control mechanism discussed in this paper is called the electric energy router and includes a energy storage device. The electric energy router controls the storage device in such a way that the ""electricity packet"" reaches a specified consumer from a specified power producer autonomously and in the distributed manner. This paper shows that optimal control theory can be applied to determine the control action of the electric energy router. The obtained optimal control action minimizes the difference between the load pattern of the consumer and the supply pattern of the router under the inequality constraints of energy storage capacity. A numerical example is given in order to check the validity of optimal control theory application. In order to manufacture a small-scale electric energy router for experiments, its basic structure and power control performance are studied through simulation studies. © 1998 Scripta Technica.","Autonomous decentralization; Electric power market; Electric power network; Optimal control","Decentralized control; Electric energy storage; Electric load distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Optimal control systems; Power control; Open electric energy networks (OEEN); Power flow control; Electric load flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031388507

We have proposed an electron- beam (EB) bi-level resist system to fabricate reticles for 1- Gbit DRAMs. The SI technique does not have only an effect to plane the surface of substrate with steps but also good performance to achieve high resolution due to thinner resist as a top layer. It was also found that there was no proximity effect correction to be needed to create the high accuracy patterns on the reticle by using bi-level process. This effect is caused from the reason why Cr and Cr oxide of which mask materials are consisted reflects forwarded electrons strongly. So the resist film in the region near by the surface of opaque film was easily affected by undesirable secondary electrons. For this purpose we made an experiment to set these phenomena in order. Figure 1 and figure 2 shows resist images of contact hole designs on reticles by using bi-level and conventional method respectively.

In the metastable state the EL2 quenches the photoluminescence and the excitation of the selective pair luminescence. The excitation of the photoluminescence leads to a regeneration of the EL2 from the metastable state. The increase of the photoluminescence intensity is caused by the decrease of non-radiative losses of charge carriers. The selective pair luminescence is affected by the capture of holes at shallow acceptors, which are photoionized from the EL2 during the transition to the metastable state.

Transient rate of heat collection and storage characteristics are investigated. Explicit emphasis is laid on the effect of the thickness of the bottom encapsulation on the year-round thermal performance of the system and results seem to favour the minimum thickness.

We have extended list-mode capability to include full storage of the ECG waveform and the energy value associated with each spatial coordinate. The spatial coordinates (x and y), energy value (E), and an encoded physiologic/timing signal (p/t) are stored on an event-by-event basis as 8-bit values. These four bytes are streamed onto a hard disk storage device allowing even stress gated blood pool studies to be recorded. List-mode acquisition gives greater flexibility than frame-mode. Among the demonstrable advantages this flexibility provides are the ability to: 1) Measure and correct respirational displacement of the ventricle to minimize motion blurring; 2) Form gated sequences representing only a specific aberrancy for detection of ectopic ventricular foci; and 3) Use the stored multispectral energy information to perform scatter correction on the dynamic images. To conclusively demonstrate the improved resolution of the list-mode methodology, a dynamic phantom was used to simulate blurring due to respiration. The advantages of list-mode warrant its further use, and it may be especially valuable for wall thickness measurements. © 1997 IEEE.",,"Data acquisition; Electrocardiography; Hard disk storage; Dynamic phantoms; List mode acquisition; Medical imaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031367443

Systems that utilize a vapor-compression cycle, with the tank acting as an evaporator, further complicate an analytical model due to the two-phase heat transfer throughout the storage tank. This analysis presents a simplified model of the storage process for a static-water ice-on-coil storage tank acting as an evaporator in a vapor-compression cycle. Specifically, the storage process is optimized by minimizing the amount of compressor work required to freeze water at 0°C. Optimization variables are refrigerant evaporating temperatures and tank heat exchanger sizing. The dynamics of ice production and two-phase heat transfer are simplified by assuming the overall heat transfer coefficient remains constant throughout the storage process. An average value for the overall heat transfer coefficient may be substituted and still provide useful results. A second law analysis utilizing the irreversibility developed during cool storage is also presented. The model is then used in side-by-side comparisons of compressor work, tank heat exchanger efficiency, and irreversibility, as functions of evaporating temperature, for several heat exchanger sizes. © 1997 by ASME.",,"Heat transfer; Ice; Mathematical models; Numerical analysis; Optimization; Refrigerants; Two phase flow; Cool thermal energy storages; Evaporative cooling systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031360679

A DRAM cell size can be dramatically reduced by employing ferroelectric structures in place of the current silicon oxide capacitor structures. A 5μ2 DRAM cell capacitor can be reduced in size by a factor of 20 using a ferroelectric structure. The current technology used to etch ferroelectric device layers has at least two major shortcomings. The first etch issue is the sloped profiles (i.e. 40°) which are a result of the high ion energies used to etch the relatively non volatile materials (Platinum and PZT). The second etch issue is severe sidewall redeposition when vertical profiles are obtained by using ion mills etc. The etch products that are redeposited on the sidewalls become very difficult or impossible to remove in a manufacturing environment. Profiles of &gt; 75° without heavy redeposition will be required in order for 0.5μ DRAMs to be produced using ferroelectric technology. A series of designed experiments were developed to understand the dependent variables impact on reducing residues and increasing the etched feature's profile angle. Response surfaces were developed for resist selectivity, profile angle, and etch rate versus changes in KHz power, cathode temperature, reactant gas flow and additive gas flow in an HRe- (High Density Reflected Electron) etch system. The process results (optical emission and SEM analysis) were statistically evaluated and process trends developed. The resulting response surface graphs combined with SEM micrographs demonstrate trends in profile control and etch rate.

At each time step, an input pattern is drawn at random, independently of the previous ones. The determination of the life time T of a memorized pattern viewed as a function of A and N is accomplished by a statistical study of the dynamic of the learning process which has been made possible under the assumption that the couplings evolve independently. This simplification reduces the determination of T to a one-dimensional problem, by considering energies rather than couplings. The choice of the optimal value Aopt of A is a compromise between the success of the learning process and the maximization of T.

After irradiation of test diodes by protons (Ep = 24 GeV) with a fluence of 1.5.1011 cm-2, no additional radiation induced deep traps have been detected. A reasonable explanation is that there is a sink of primary radiation induced defects (interstitial and vacancies), possibly by as-grown defects, in epitaxial layers.

The devices had excellent electrical characteristics. In the deep subthreshold regime the drain current stems from the gate current. In this region, the photo-drain-current also is caused by the photo-gate current, as evidenced by its magnitude and spectral characteristics. In the subthreshold regime, the photocurrent rises rapidly at a photoenergy of approximately 0.7 eV (which corresponds to the energy gap of the InGaAs channel). Spectral analysis indicates that the response stems from a multitude of transitions. In this regime, transitions to the first electron subband are dominating. When the device is strongly turned on, this dominance disappears. At small drain voltages (i.e. in the linear region) the photoconduction behavior is similar to that observed in GaAs based HEMTs. The transistor amplifies the photogenerated charge due to hole storage in the channel. In the saturation regime we observe a drastically different behavior: The photocurrent is negative. In this case, the drain current becomes smaller when the device is illuminated. We also observe a pronounced change in spectral response in this region.

Such ability is essential when dealing with complex environments having several millions of polygons. The principle of our technique is to split the initial environment into several sub-environments and compute the radiosity within each sub-environment. Exchange of energy between sub-environments is performed by means of virtual interfaces and visibility masks. The size of sub-environments can be adapted in order to fit into a cache or a local memory. We performed several experiments using an SGI Origin 2000 to show the effectiveness of our solution. It improves both the sequential and parallel execution of a progressive radiosity algorithm. Our technique decreases the execution time on one processor of an SGI Origin 2000 by a factor of more than 5 and leads to a very good efficiency for complex environments (1 million of polygons) on a multiprocessor configuration.",,"Algorithms; Buffer storage; Graphical user interfaces; Image analysis; Interactive computer systems; Lighting; Virtual reality; Visibility; Parallel radiosity computation; Virtual interfaces; Visibility mask; Parallel processing systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031337682

Health care providers, organizations, and professional associations, among many others, publish ""best practices"" information for both administrative and clinical audiences, making these recommendations among the fastest-growing types of health care information appearing on the World Wide Web. The problem is how to find best practices among the wealth of resources on the Internet and then how to separate the proverbial wheat from the chaff. WHO IS SEEKING BEST PRACTICES ON THE INTERNET? Best practice describes a process or technique whose employment results in improved patient and/or organizational outcomes. Health care providers, managed care organizations, administrators, payers, and policy analysts are all interested in improving the quality of health care and are likely to be customers of best practices informational resources. HOW TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF BEST PRACTICES INFORMATION? Once the information is available on the Internet, the problem for the searcher shifts from one of quantity to quality. The best practices information seeker should stop and ask a number of questions about the quality of information, its sources, and the methods used to obtain it. CONCLUSION: The ""truth"" may be out there some-where in cyberspace, but locating best practices information and evaluating its quality require new skills and patience and time to practice and develop them to the point of efficiency.",,"computer interface; computer network; directory; evidence based medicine; human; information retrieval; management; nomenclature; outcome assessment; quality control; review; writing; Authorship; Benchmarking; Computer Communication Networks; Directories; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Management Audit; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Terminology; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031303044

Mean excretion of manure for cows that averaged 29 kg/d of milk production was 3 kg/d per 1000 kg of body weight (BW) more than the value for dairy cows reported by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers; N excretion was 0.09 kg/d per 1000 kg of BW higher than the value reported by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers. Mean excretion of manure and N for cows that averaged 14 kg/d of milk production and that for nonlactating cows were substantially lower than the values reported by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers.

Estimation of manure and N excretion was more accurate than mean values when using regression equations that included variables for milk production, concentration of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber in the diet, BW, days in milk, and days of pregnancy. Equations that contained intake variables did not significantly affect predictions of manure and N excretion, and the use of such equations is discouraged unless dry matter intake is measured and not estimated. Accurate estimates of excreta output could improve the planning of storage and handling systems for manure and the calculation of nutrient balances on dairy farms.","Cattle; Manureenvironment; Nitrogen","Bos taurus; nitrogen; animal; animal food; article; body weight; cattle; dietary fiber; eating; energy metabolism; feces; female; lactation; metabolism; physiology; pregnancy; protein intake; regression analysis; Animal Nutrition Physiology; Animals; Body Weight; Cattle; Dietary Fiber; Dietary Proteins; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Feces; Female; Lactation; Nitrogen; Pregnancy; Regression Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031300069

The pyridine-H and -F interaction energies differ by about 5 kcal/mol, which is only about one-third of that found for a one-dimensional model for the surface. The difference in the interaction energies for (CH3)3PO is larger. However, the (CH3)3PO-neighbor interaction energy is larger than for pyridine, so that the (CH3)3PO - H interaction becomes repulsive for six neighboring F atoms. Substituting CN for F dramatically increases the repulsion between the surface atoms and molecules. The repulsion is sufficiently large that H/CN does not appear to be better than H/F as a possible way to store data on a surface.

Yet very few studies have been carried out on the link between foraging and life history in the context of allocation of resources. Here we report a study examining the relationship between foraging and allocation of resources in the Wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans of Crozet Islands. We simultaneously studied individual foraging strategies at sea and differential allocation to reproduction and storage by measuring the energy supplied to chicks and the variation of body mass of the adult. Satellite tracking and continuous monitoring of nest attendance by adults showed that while rearing a chick Wandering Albatrosses have two specific alternative foraging strategies. They either forage in short trips, short in duration and close to the colony over the southeastern slope of the peri-insular shelf, or in long trips far from the colony in the oceanic waters north of Crozet. On average, birds made five successive short trips before making a long trip. Chicks received a meal every 1.8 d and were fed with fresh prey, 72% squid and 24% fish, and a liquid fraction composed of oil and water. During short trips birds appear to rely to a great extent on Moroteuthis ingens, a squid species probably available in large numbers at the southeastern edge of the Crozet shelf. The measure of energy flows indicates that 74% of the energy delivered to the chick comes from short trips, whereas only 33.8% of the total energy is gained at sea during these trips. Males spent a greater proportion of their time foraging in short trips than females, and consequently chicks received 61.3% of their meals from males and 38.7% from females. Adult birds tended to lose mass after short trips and to lose more mass with increased duration of short trips, whereas they gained mass after long trips. They initiated long trips when their body mass was low. Although Wandering Albatrosses are able to provision their chicks at a rapid rate because of the proximity of an abundant resource, birds still have to forage far from the colony to restore their body condition.

The present paper describes the characteristics of temperature and humidity of the outlet air from the layer, and time history of the cold heat energy release. The experiments were performed with reference to several experimental parameters, i.e., air flow rate, air temperature and humidity, and the proportion of solidified oil droplets to water in the mixture layer.

Hysteresis phenomena were observed in the bunch lengthening. That is, two bunch lengths existed depending on changing the direction of the beam current. A longitudinal instability of a bunch was calculated using calculated wake potential by a computer code based on a linearized Vlasov equation. The growth rate was calculated as a function of the energy spread at a fixed beam intensity. It was found that the growth rate did not decay monotonously, but had an unstable peak after decaying to a stable minimum value as the energy spread increased. There are two stable regions of the energy spread on both sides of the peak, suggesting the hysteresis.","Bunch lengthening; Electron storage ring; Hysteresis phenomena; Impedance; Longitudinal instability; Synchrotron oscillation; Wake potential","Electric impedance; Electron beams; Hysteresis; Oscillations; Synchrotrons; Accumulation rings; Bunch lengthening; Synchrotron oscillation; Vlasov equation; Wake potentials; Storage rings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031272966

Its breakdown characteristics were investigated using model cable specimens with different kinds of laminated tapes such as semisynthetic paper, polypropylene film, and kraft paper of insulation thickness less than 1 mm. First, ± dc, ac, and -Imp breakdown stresses of the semisynthetic papers were investigated, +dc breakdown stress was 21.7 kV/mm for a specimen of insulation thickness 1 mm and -dc breakdown stress was 41.5 kB/mm, so that the remarkable polar effect was observed, ac breakdown stress was 18 kV/mm. Also, the ratio of -Imp breakdown stress was about 3. Furthermore, ac breakdown stresses of other tapes were investigated, but remarkable differences among their stresses were not observed. Most of the specimens were broken from the ""butt gap"" between tapes. To understand this cause, measurements of the partial discharge were carried out. It was found that the inception stress of partial discharge of butt gap located just on the conductor was about 20 kV/mm, not dependent on the kind of tape. This value is much lower than the breakdown stress of the same length of vacuum gap. Therefore, it is considered that the trigger of the breakdown of this insulation system is the surface discharge along the edge of the butt gap. © 1998 Scripta Technica, Inc.","Cryogenic temperature; High vacuum; Laminated tape insulation; Partial discharge; Superconductivity","Cryogenics; Electric breakdown; Electric conductors; Electric insulation; Electric variables measurement; Partial discharges; Stresses; Superconducting cables; Superconductivity; Cryogenic temperature; Laminated tape insulation; Superconductivity magnetic energy storages; Tapes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031272876

In light of these perceptions, the debate over where to temporarily store or permanently dispose of spent nuclear fuel (at the reactor site, an interim storage facility, or a permanent repository) provokes immense concern among possible host jurisdictions. To address these concerns, one needs to know if people's subjective opinions conform with the choices they make and are therefore reflected in their economic behavior. Argonne National Laboratory researchers used a hedonic model to complete a study of residential property value dynamics over a 5-year period within a 15-mile radius of two California nuclear power plants. They tracked the economic ramifications of decisions about the spent nuclear fuel stored at those reactors. The study revealed that no significant negative effects on residential property values resulted from a decision to move spent nuclear fuel from wet storage to a dry-cask storage facility or from a request to extend the reactor operating permit (given future changes in the type of nuclear fuel storage facility that would accompany such an extension).National, regional, state, and local surveys have revealed that people have intensely negative images of 'nuclear' and 'radioactive' technologies, activities, and facilities, as well as associated fears of stigmatization. In light of these perceptions, the debate over where to temporarily store or permanently dispose of spent nuclear fuel (at the reactor site, an interim storage facility, or a permanent repository) provokes immense concern among possible host jurisdictions. To address these concerns, one needs to know if people's subjective opinions conform with the choices they make and are therefore reflected in their economic behavior. Argonne National Laboratory researchers used a hedonic model to complete a study of residential property value dynamics over a 5-year period within a 15-mile radius of two California nuclear power plants. They tracked the economic ramifications of decisions about the spent nuclear fuel stored at those reactors. The study revealed that no significant negative effects on residential property values resulted from a decision to move spent nuclear fuel from wet storage to a dry-cask storage facility or from a request to extend the reactor operating permit (given future changes in the type of nuclear fuel storage facility that would accompany such an extension).","Behavior; Perceptions; Residential property; Risk; Spent nuclear fuel","Decision making; Fuel storage; Health risks; Mathematical models; Spent fuels; Residential property; Spent nuclear fuel storage; Risk assessment; nuclear waste; perception; property value; geographic distribution; nuclear energy; nuclear power plant; nuclear waste; review; risk assessment; United States; California; USA",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031257519

The concept of this mechanism is based on the deactivation of step tunneling sites for thin oxide. It is verified that the deactivation is electrically realized by the injected electrons into the sites. It is because the step tunneling probability of electrons though the deactivated sites is suppressed, since the electron capture cross section of the neutralized deactivation sites becomes extremely low. The deactivation scheme is as follows: (l)The deactivation of tunneling sites can be realized that the tunneling sites trapped holes change to neutralized tunneling sites due to electrons injection. (2) The injected electron can deactivate the activation tunneling sites only under energy level than the energy level of the injected electrons. It is shown that the above reduction phenomenon can be quantifiably with formulation. These results are very important for high reliable thin oxide films and for high performance ULSI.","Flash memory; Step tunneling; Stress leakage current; Thin oxide flms","Electric current control; Electron energy levels; Electron tunneling; Leakage currents; Semiconductor storage; Thin films; Flash memory; ULSI circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031250308

The agreement between the measured and simulated effectivenesses (sensible, latent, and total energy) is close and within the experimental uncertainty. In addition, the effects of certain assumptions were investigated for sensitivity on the predicted performance of regenerative energy exchangers The sensitivity results are calculated with a 0.9 m diameter by 0.1 m long aluminum matrix wheel that is coated with a molecular sieve desiccant (20% by mass). The desiccant has a maximum moisture capacity of 20% by mass. The porosity of the wheel is 85% and the normal rotational speed is 20 rpm. The design mass flow rate of air is 0.5 kg/s [1.6 kg/(s·m2)] giving a face velocity of 1.3 m/s. Neglecting thermal and moisture storage in the air is shown to result in errors as large as 2.4% in the predicted effectiveness of a rotary energy exchanger at typical wheel speeds. Including the heat of sorption in the model affects the predicted effectiveness only slightly (&lt;0.5%). However, the predicted effectiveness is greatly affected (up to 48%) by whether the heat of phase change is assumed to remain in the air or in the matrix. Controlling the energy rate of the energy exchanger by controlling wheel speed may be impractical because the sensitivity of each effectiveness to wheel speed differs with each operating condition. The model is also used to show the importance of the entry length and thermal conductivity on the predicted performance of rotary energy exchangers. © 1997 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,"Computer simulation; Experiments; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Rotating machinery; Desiccant coated rotary energy exchangers; Heat exchangers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031250215

It seems to be the most suitable converter for superconducting magnetic energy storage systems (SMES), which are expected to be used in actual power systems in the near future as a power system stabilizer. Harmonic reduction on the source side is required for such large-capacity thyristor converters. A number of methods have been proposed. These methods, however, require additional devices. Thus, a simple parallel-connected converter without any additional device remains to be constructed to reduce harmonic currents on the source side. This paper attempts to construct a simple 12-pulse thyristor converter by proposing a novel design concept of the interphase reactor. This method proposed here requires no additional devices and only reducing the inductance of the interphase reactor. The source current of the 12-pulse thyristor converter with the reduced inductance interphase reactor approaches sinusoidal waveforms, which are approximately equivalent to those of the 36-pulse thyristor converter. Simulation results show that decreasing the inductance of the interphase reactor contributes to reducing harmonic currents on the source side. In addition to the simulation results, experimental results verify the validity and practicability of the proposed novel design concept of the interphase reactor. © 1997 Scripta Technica, Inc.","12-pulse thyristor converter; Harmonic current reduction on source side; Interphase reactor; SMES","Computer simulation; Electric currents; Electric power systems; Energy storage; Harmonic analysis; Power inductors; Thyristors; Waveform analysis; Interphase reactors; Parallel connected thyristor converters; Superconducting magnetic energy storage systems (SMES); Power converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031248864

The tetradecane oil is injected from a cylindrical single hole nozzle into the cold water solution and it disperses and forms tiny oil droplets. The oil droplets ascend in the water solution by buoyancy and freeze by direct-contact heat exchange with the cold water solution. Finally, they are completely or partially frozen. The partially frozen oil droplet is composed of a frozen outer shell and unfrozen central core. As a result, it was found that the solidification fraction of the frozen oil droplets, defined as mass ratio of the solidified parts to the whole, increases with a decrease in injection oil temperature and water solution temperature. However, under a lower temperature condition, the injected oil freezes at the outlet of the nozzle, and the solidification fraction reduces with a decrease in injection oil temperature and water solution temperature. A method of data reduction for the solidification fraction is proposed and non-dimensional empirical equations to predict the solidification fraction are proposed in this study. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Buoyancy; Flow of fluids; Freezing; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Kerosene; Low temperature effects; Nozzles; Numerical methods; Solidification; Water; Empirical equations; Heat exchange; Latent cold heat energy storage system; Mass ratio; Tetradecane; Heat storage; droplets; solidification; two-phase flow(liquid/solid); water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031240023

Further, the bandgap narrowing effect is taken into account. In addition the role of the magnitude of valence band offset and heterointerface recombination velocity is discussed. It is found that set-back layer thickness strongly affects d.c. performance and frequency response. When emitter set-back layer thickness equals the base-emitter junction depletion layer width, the recombination effect in the set-back layer and the diffusion capacitance will be reduced because of minimized carrier storage in the emitter, resulting in an optimum HEBT. It is also found that the heterointerface recombination current can limit the HEBT current gain if the trapping density at the heterointerface is larger than 1 × 1012 cm-2. For an optimum design, the current gain of a HEBT can rise to 1000, which is comparable to the best experimental data reported in the literature. Quite good agreement between our model's predictions and reported experimental results is achieved.

Concern that TES is not a ""green"" technology coupled with changes in the power production industry may eliminate both demand charges and rebates. If TES technology is to survive in this environment, TES systems must be equal or lower in capital cost than conventional systems, or they must generate sufficient energy and maintenance cost savings to offset any added capital cost.

The in-tube chemical accelerator methods are the experimentally proven ram accelerator (RA) and the proposed external propulsion accelerator (EPA). The total thrust generated on the projectiles in these chemical accelerators is obtained from the energy released in the chemical reactions. The net thrust for accelerating the projectile is obtained from the difference between the total thrust and the total drag of the flying projectile. The experiments in the RA, where the titanium-nosed projectile exited the tube intact, are used to validate this energy balance method. In these tests the instantaneous acceleration as well as the maximum terminal velocity of the projectile in the RA are measured. These measurements are used to evaluate the drag coefficient of the flying projectile and the propulsive efficiency. The experimental data of tests in the RA at the University of Washington show that as the projectile approaches its maximum terminal velocity, the evaluated drag coefficient reaches values of about 1.5, while the evaluated propulsive efficiency is about 0.8. Then, the maximum projectile terminal velocity in the RA calculated by the energy balance method is about 1.2 times the detonation velocity. Then, the maximum projectile velocity in the RA (which is up to 1.2 times the detonation velocity), for mixtures of detonation velocity up to 2.5 km/s, will be about 3 km/s. The energy balance analysis shows that the corresponding maximum terminal velocity of a free-flying aerodynamically stabilized projectile in the EPA can reach up to about six times the Chapman-Jouguet detonation velocity. The energy balance analysis indicates that the EPA can be used to accelerate a free-flight projectile to velocities of well beyond escape velocity. This EPA system has the potential to be considered for the development of a one-stage-to-orbit launcher.",,"Combustion; Detonation; Drag; Hypersonic aerodynamics; Projectiles; Propellants; Shock waves; Chapman Tougnet detonation velocity; Energy balance analysis; External propulsion accelerators; In tube chemical accelerators; Ram accelerators; Propulsion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031232999

Because of the smaller amount of disk storage and CPU time required in calculations, multigroup approaches have been preferred over continuous energy (point) approaches in the past to solve the transport equation. With the advent of high-performance computers, storage and CPU limitations are less restrictive, thereby making continuous energy methods viable for transport calculations. Moreover, continuous energy methods avoid many of the assumptions and approximations inherent in multigroup methods. Because a continuous energy version of KENO V.a does not exist, the objective of the work is to develop a new version of KENO V.a that utilizes continuous energy cross sections. Currently, a point cross-section library, which is based on a raw continuous energy cross-section library such as ENDF/B-V is not available for implementation in KENO V.a; however, point cross-section libraries are available for MCNP, another widely used Monte Carlo transport code. Since MCNP cross sections are based on ENDF data and are readily available, a new version of KENO V.a named PKENO V.a has been developed that performs the random walk using MCNP cross sections. To utilize point cross sections, extensive modifications have been made to KENO V.a. At this point in the research, testing of the code is underway. In particular, PKENO V.a, KENO V.a, and MCNP have been used to model nine critical experiments and one subcritical problem. The results obtained with PKENO V.a are in excellent agreement with MCNP, KENO V.a, and experiments.","Continuous energy; KENO V.a code; Monte Carlo code","Accident prevention; Computer software; Database systems; Fission reactions; Monte Carlo methods; Nuclear reactors; Multiplication factor; Criticality (nuclear fission)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031232807

The power capacity of the current internal combustion passenger vehicle fleet is enormous and under-utilized. In the United States, for example, the vehicle fleet has over 10 times the mechanical power of all current U.S. electrical generating plants and is idle over 95% of the day. Electric utilities could use battery vehicles as storage, or fuel cell and hybrid vehicles as generation. This paper analyzes vehicle battery storage in greatest detail, comparing three electric vehicle configurations over a range of driving requirements and electric utility demand conditions. Even when making unfavorable assumptions about the cost and lifetime of batteries, over a wide range of conditions the value to the utility of tapping vehicle electrical storage exceeds the cost of the two-way hook-up and reduced vehicle battery life. For example, even a currently-available electric vehicle, in a utility with medium value of peak power, could provide power at a net present cost to the vehicle owner of $955 and net present value to the utility of $2370. As an incentive to the vehicle owner, the utility might offer a vehicle purchase subsidy, lower electric rates, or purchase and maintenance of successive vehicle batteries. For a utility tapping vehicle power, the increased storage would provide system benefits such as reliability and lower costs, and would later facilitate large-scale integration of intermittent-renewable energy resources. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"environmental management; United States of America; Cost effectiveness; Electric batteries; Electric utilities; Reliability; Electric vehicle battery storage; Electric vehicles; alternative energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031225085

Water flow in hot high-angle fractures is simulated numerically, taking into account the combined action of gravity, capillary, and pressure forces, and conductive heat transfer from the wall rocks which gives rise to strong vaporization. In heterogeneous fractures boiling plumes are found to have dendritic shapes, and to be subject to strong lateral flow effects. Fractures with spatially-averaged homogeneous permeabilities tend to give poor approximations for vaporization behavior and liquid migration patterns. Depending on water flow rates, rock temperature, and fracture permeability, liquid water can migrate considerable distances through fractured rock that is at above-boiling temperatures and be only partially vaporized.","Boiling and condensation; Heterogeneous fractures; Nuclear waste disposal; Numerical simulation; Preferential flow paths; Two-phase flow; Vapor-dominated geothermal reservoirs","Boiling liquids; Computer simulation; Condensation; Fracture; Geothermal energy; Heat conduction; Mechanical permeability; Radioactive waste disposal; Rocks; Thermal plumes; Two phase flow; Vaporization; Hot sub vertical rock fractures; Preferential flow paths; Water injection; fluid flow; fracture; heat transfer; rock; water; fluid flow; fluid injection; fractured rock; geostatistics; geothermal system; permeability; porous medium; radioactive waste storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031225059

Through the Phase 1, the member companies developed elementary technologies and reflected these into a 10 Wh class cell. The 10 Wh class cells have substantially fulfilled the targets of the first interim evaluation for capacity, energy density and specific energy. Some of these cells have not satisfied the targets of cycle life, therefore, it was obvious that the cycleability should be set at 3500 cycles for the long life type and at 500 cycles for the high energy density type, respectively. It appeared that the solid polymer electrolyte type 10 Wh cell implied the importance of the interface control between active materials and solid polymer electrolyte and improved ionic conductivity, and that the lithium metal system needs to restrain the lithium reaction with electrolyte. The incompleteness of cycle life seems to come from the selection of the active materials, the capacity balance of the materials and the volume of the electrolyte involved.

This is causing global warming and exhaustion of resources; it is important to switch to more efficient and effective energy use. These circumstances are expanding the role of secondary batteries. Non-fossil fuels such as photovoltaic cells and wind energy are unstable, but combining them with secondary batteries improves their stability as electric power sources. If electrical load leveling between day and night can be achieved by storing electric power, it will be possible to achieve a high capacity utilization rate for generating facilities that have high generating efficiency and produce little CO2. Depending on the generating mix, the practicalization of electric vehicles will serve not only to alleviate air pollution, but also to limit CO2 emissions.

The first is the independent debonding of different particles and takes place at low filler fractions when interparticle interactions may be neglected. The characteristic feature of the second is the formation of narrow zones with completely debonded inclusions oriented transversely to the drawing direction. This occurs at high filler contents when interparticle interaction is noticeable. As shown by the afore-mentioned study, the debonding mechanism is very important for further plastic deformation and fracture. It determines ductile or brittle fracture, macrohomogeneous flow or deformation with necking, etc. The subject of the present paper is a theoretical explanation of the phenomena in frameworks of linear elastic constitutive equations. The process of uniaxial tension is supposed to be accompanied by partial debonding, in accordance with the energy balance between energy storage and loss by way of new surface formation. The model predicts certain mechanisms of debonding and transitions between them with increase in filler fraction. The conclusions of the model are in qualitative agreement with experimental data. © 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.","Debonding; Linear elastic constitutive equations; Particulate composites","Composition effects; Fracture mechanics; Mathematical models; Particles (particulate matter); Plastic deformation; Plastic filaments; Polyolefins; Debonding; Linear elastic constitutive equations; Composite materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031212535

The lack of adhesion between the printing ink, or glue, and the polymer coating is another area where adhesionimprovement is needed. The common means of improving adhesion are flame, corona, and ozone treatments. A modem extrusion coating line is equipped with both a pretreatment and a post-treatment unit. From the work presented here, the following observations were made. The higher the applied coronapower and the thicker the coating, the higher the surface energy and polarity of the low density polyethylene (PE-LD) surface. When a high corona power was applied to the coating, only the polar component of the surface energy was increased. The surface energy decreased sharply as a functionof aging, but remained more or less constant after about 2 weeks' storage time. The contact angles of water on paper correlated well with the oxygen contents (determined by ESCA) and with the applied corona power. The polarities of both paper and paperboard increased as a function of the appliedcorona power. Corona pretreatment of paper and paperboard improved their adhesion to PE-LD remarkably.

One of the authors has proposed a new ice making method in which a magnetic fluid prevents water from freezing on the cooling surface. Thus, we investigated experimentally the effect of shape control of magnetic fluid using a magnet on freezing of supercooling water. The shape changes and motion of magnetic fluid, which are controlled by controlling the magnetic field, have a slight effect on the supercooling phenomenon. However, the exposure of the cooling surface covered by a film of magnetic fluid reduces the time from controlling the magnetic field until freezing to a few seconds. Therefore, it is possible to use an electric magnet.","Energy Storage; Experimental Study; Freezing; Magnetic Fluid; Supercooling Phenomenon","Freezing; Magnetic fluids; Magnets; Water; Supercooling water; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031206896

However, to minimize energy consumption, mobile clients may also often operate in a disconnected mode. As a result, the clients may miss some cache invalidation reports broadcast by a server. Thus, upon reconnection, a cache invalidation scheme must be employed to ensure the validity of the cached data. Existing techniques either require the clients to discard the cached data entirely, or require the clients to transmit uplink messages to a server. While the former eliminates the benefits of caching, the latter may lead to high energy consumption, poor channel utilization, and costs. In this paper, we present a new cache invalidation scheme, called Broadcast-Based Group Invalidation (BGI), that retains the benefits of caching while avoiding unnecessary transmissions (which translates to energy saving, better channel utilization, and lower costs). Under BGI, a pair of invalidation reports is broadcast periodically. While the object invalidation report enables the clients to salvage as many recently cached objects as possible, the group invalidation report cuts down on false invalidation. We conduct extensive studies based on a simulation model. The simulation results show that BGI consumes less energy and is superior over existing techniques. © Elsevier Science Inc. 1997.",,"Buffer storage; Communication channels (information theory); Computer simulation; Mobile telecommunication systems; Broadcast based group invalidation; Cache invalidation scheme; Data communication systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031206634

Since the surface of free aquifers fluctuates irregularly due to both inflow and outflow of groundwater, treatment is difficult compared with the case of confined aquifers. In the case of free aquifers, non-equilibrium heat transfer between fluid and particle phases exerts much influence. Even in confined aquifers, the unsteady heat transfer is marked under marble or gravel-component. The inherent properties of soils are dismissed and part of them are reflected poorly in apparent properties such as equivalent heat capacity or conductivity. Therefore, even superficial velocity has been wrongly estimated. In this paper, a two-phase model is introduced for consideration of heat propagation even into the particle phase. Then, the effectiveness of the model is confirmed using a laboratory test apparatus in two dimensions. Finally, significant deviations of temperature propagation by the particle sizes are simulated.","Energy Storage; Groundwater; Natural Energy; Packed Beds; Two-Phase Model","Aquifers; Groundwater flow; Heat storage; Mathematical models; Packed beds; Particles (particulate matter); Two phase flow; Two phase model; Heat transfer; aquifer; groundwater; heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031205848

The model is predicated on the principles of computational fluid dynamics and considers the basic forces and energy of the mixing fluid. In this approach, the three-dimensional time-averaged Navier-Stokes fluid flow equations with a k-ε turbulence model are discretized and are solved over a finite-difference grid across the reservoir geometry. The motion of fluid particles throughout the reservoir can then be determined as a function of space and time. The resulting model is both accurate and robust, and it can be applied readily to all types of storage reservoir configurations, characteristics, and hydraulic conditions. The proposed numerical model was tested for a number of locations in the United States by comparing the results with both bench-top and full-scale test data. The applicability of the model is demonstrated herein by application to a water plant clearwell. The effects of baffling on residence time distribution for disinfection effectiveness were also investigated, and conclusions are stated. The effective use of the proposed model can lead to improved designs, retrofitting plans for existing facilities, or modified operational policies for new or existing reservoirs, and to aid in optimizing distribution water quality and securing regulatory compliance and consumer satisfaction. © 1997 by Elsevier Science Inc.","Computational fluid dynamics; Distribution storage; Water networks; Water quality","Computational fluid dynamics; Finite difference method; Flow patterns; Hydrodynamics; Mathematical models; Mixing; Navier Stokes equations; Optimization; Reservoirs (water); Retrofitting; Turbulence; Water quality; Baffling effects; Water distribution systems; hydrodynamics; Navier-Stokes equations; reservoir; water quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031202562

Optimal MHC matching and infectious disease screening also require long-term storage of islets, and cryopreservation is currently the only practical approach. Cryopreservation protocols may be optimized by modeling the changes in cell volume and the associated damage incurred during cryoprotectant addition and dilution and during cooling and warming. The objective of the present work was to determine the following biophysical parameters of canine islet cells: the osmotically inactive cell volume (Vb), hydraulic conductivity (Lp), cryoprotectant permeability coefficient (Ps), and the reflection coefficient σ. A determination of these parameters allows the simulation of cell responses using computer models. Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and Euro-Ficoll purification. After 24 h culture, islets were dissociated into single cells using trypsin and 2 mM EGTA. The kinetic change in cell volume as a function of time after exposure to 2 M dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was measured using an electronic particle counter at 22, 5, and -3°C. At -11°C, cells were preloaded with 1 M Me2SO and exposed to 4 M Me2SO to prevent the formation of ice in the working solution. Kedem-Katchalsky theory was used to describe the cell volume change kinetics, and a three-parameter curve fitting was performed using the Marquardt-Levenberg method to determine Lp, Ps, and σ values. The Lp was determined to be 0.19 ± 0.05, 0.037 ± 0.005, 0.020 ± 0.003, and 0.013 ± 0.005 μm · min-1 · atm-1 (mean ± SD) at 22, 5, -3, and -11°C, respectively. The Ps values were 1.05 ± 0.50, 0.15 ± 0.04, 0.096 ± 0.028, and 0.067 ± 0.029 x 10-3 cm · min-1 at 22, 5, -3, and -11°C, respectively.

The temperature dependence or activation energy of Lp, and Ps was calculated, using the Arrhenius equation, to be 12.7 and 13.5 kcal · mol-1, respectively.

The “optimal” strategy minimizes the cost of operating the cooling plant over the simulation horizon. The particular case of a popular ice storage system (ice-on-coil with internal melt) was investigated in a simulation environment. Various predictor models were analyzed with respect to their performance in forecasting cooling load data and information on ambient conditions (dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures). The predictor model provides load and weather information to the optimal controller in discrete time steps. An optimal storage charging and discharging strategy was planned at every time step over a fixed look-ahead time window utilizing newly available information. The first action of the optimal sequence of actions was executed over the next time step and the planning process was repeated at every following time step. The effect of the length of the planning horizon was investigated. It was found that short horizons of one day were only marginally suboptimal relative to one that is optimal over the entire simulation horizon of one week. Various utility rate structures were analyzed to cover a range of potential real-time pricing scenarios. The predictive optimal controller was then compared to conventional control heuristics. In summary, it was found that in the presence of complex rate structures the proposed controller had a significant performance benefit over the conventional controls, while requiring only a simple predictor. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Computer simulation; Cost effectiveness; Heuristic methods; Ice; Optimal control systems; Predictive control systems; Thermal energy storage systems; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031193044

For electrolytes with low salt concentrations, the maximum operating voltage as well as the maximum energy decreases with decreasing salt concentration.

This paper summarizes the activity that has occurred across continental Europe, from the EU to Russia, but focuses principally on Western Europe. The paper discusses the components of residential electricity demand by end use and the role played by appliances, the energy consumption and energy efficiency trends for selected appliances, the European appliance market, the development of the EU's mandatory energy labelling scheme and some of its results, the testing and certification institutions in Europe, the EU's mandatory minimum energy efficiency standards proposal for refrigerators and freezers but current preference for voluntary agreements, the maximum energy consumption standards in Russia, the Swiss target-value approach, and the savings potentials of appliance energy efficiency standards for 'cold' appliances, 'wet' appliances, leaking electricity, electric motors, and office lighting. Since this paper was written (in 1995), the EU has passed legislation to introduce mandatory minimum energy efficiency standards for refrigerators and freezers that will enter into effect in 1999. The standards are set at a level intended to ensure that models sold after 1999 will, on average, require 15% less energy than the average of models sold between 1991 and 1992 after normalization for storage volume and cooling service. Despite these activities, the paper demonstrates that there remains a huge potential to save energy cost-effectively. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science S.A.","Appliance standards; Clothes dryers; Clothes washers; Dishwashers; Energy labelling; Energy savings potentials; EU; Leaking electricity; Motors; Refrigerators; Russia; Switzerland","Domestic appliances; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Laws and legislation; Refrigerators; Washing machines; Appliance efficiency standard; Dishwasher; Electricity demand; Energy labelling; Freezer; Electric codes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031189526

This work presents the performance of a solar drying system consisting of an air heater and a dryer chamber connected to a greenhouse. The drying system is designed to dry a variety of agricultural products. The effect of air mass flow rate on the drying process is studie. Composite pebbles, which are constructed from cement and sand, are used to store energy for night operation. The pebbles are placed at the bottom of the drying chamber and are charged during she drying process itself. A separate test is done using a simulator, a packed bed storage unit, to find the thermal characteristics of the pebbles during charging and discharging modes with time. Accordingly, the packed bed is analyzed using a heat transfer model with finite difference technique described before and during the charging and discharging processes. Graphs are presented that depict the thermal characteristics and performance of the pebble beds and the drying patterns of different agricultural products. The results show that the amount of energy stored in the pebbles depends on the air mass flow rate, the inlet air temperature, and the properties of the storage materials. The composite pebbles can be used efficiently as storing media.","Composite materials; Efficient dryer; Packed bed modeling; Pebble bed; Solar energy storage","Agricultural products; Composite materials; Drying; Energy storage; Finite difference method; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Packed beds; Solar energy; Thermal effects; Thermodynamic properties; Pebble beds; Solar dryers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031189483

The environment within the tanks is highly radioactive and chemically harsh. The waste typically consists of a heterogeneous sludge layer covered by a layer of supernatant. A few of the tanks have leaked to the environment, while others are corroding. Removing the waste from the tanks and processing it to a stable final form are desired to prevent any additional contamination of the environment. The tanks vary in size and geometric shape and do not have systems for removing the sludge waste. Mobilization and mixing studies were conducted with a surrogate sludge (e.g., kaolin clay) using submerged jets in two sizes of horizontal tanks with nominal capacities of 0.87 m3 (230 gal) and 95m3 (25,000 gal). Mobilization efficiencies and mixing times were determined for single and bidirectional jets in both tanks with the discharge nozzles positioned at various locations in the tanks. Approximately 80% of the surrogate sludge was mobilized in the 95-m3 tank using a fixed bidirectional jet (inside diameter = 0.035 m) and a jet velocity of 6.4 m/s (21 ft/s). The effective cleaning length, which is defined as the distance between the jet and the edge of the remaining sludge bank, was approximately 3.2m (10 ft) on each side of the bidirectional jet.","Horizontal; Mobilization; Nozzle; Sludge; Submerged; Tank","Environmental impact; Jets; Nozzles; Radioactive waste storage; Tanks (containers); Sludge mobilization; Radioactive waste disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031188577

Most products are manufactured locally, by firms with international links and with access to both European and North American designs and technology. A significant share of the market is imported, mainly from New Zealand, Asia and Europe. Because of the relative mildness of the climate, appliances that carry an energy label (such as dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, and refrigerators and freezers) account for a greater share of household energy use than in most other developed countries. The energy efficiency of appliances in Australia increased steadily during the early 1980s, but the introduction of mandatory energy labelling in 1986 in some states saw a significant increase in the rate of change. The mandatory government energy labelling program, which is in force in most states, now includes refrigerators, freezers, room air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes washers and clothes dryers. A voluntary industry-based gas appliance energy labelling program is also in place for gas water heaters and flued space heaters. The Australian energy labelling program is widely regarded as among the most informative and salient in the world, and it may be extended to New Zealand over the next few years (many products in NZ already carry the label as the Australian and NZ markets are closely integrated). Label recognition and use is very high among recent and prospective appliance purchasers. The use of a static efficiency scale on the label, while assisting recognition and comprehension, has also reduced the competitive pressure on suppliers, as efficiency improvements have pushed many models to the top of the rating scale. In 1995, Australian energy ministers agreed to implement minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for refrigerators, freezers, and electric storage water heaters, to take effect in 1999. The levels are relatively moderate, and the effect will be to complement the energy labelling program rather than to transform the energy efficiency of the market. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.","Appliance efficiency programs; Australia; Gas appliance labelling; Household appliances; Label recognition; Mandatory energy labelling","Energy labelling; Household appliances; Label recognition; Minimum energy performance standard; Economic and social effects; Electric codes; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Laws and legislation; Electric appliances",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031186737

Among them, dissociation of CaCO3 seems very promising as the material can dissociate at 1098 K under atmospheric condition and the reactants involved are free from toxicity. One of the dissociation products, CO2 gas, requires a storage system. Three CO2 storage systems are being considered and the thermal operating efficiencies, COP, of the respective CaO-CO2 energy storage systems are evaluated. It is found that the system with a zeolite adsorbent for CO2 storage becomes quite comparable to other systems when the adsorptivity of the adsorbent increases to higher values. The CO2 adsorption characteristics of zeolite 13X and super activated carbon under a temperature range 303-573 K are studied. Based on the adsorption data, it is found that zeolite 13X adsorbent can be used as a CO2 storage medium in a CaO-CO2 high temperature thermal energy storage system. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Activated carbon; Adsorptivity; Calcium oxide; Co2 storage; Coefficient of performance; Thermal energy storage; Upgraded temperature; Zeolitel","Adsorbents; Adsorption; Calcium compounds; Carbon dioxide; Performance; Zeolites; Activated carbon; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031175970

The structure of the poly(DTDA) was similar to that of polyaniline, in addition the S-S bond is preserved after electropolymerization of DTDA. The electropolymerized poly(DTDA) had enhanced redox processes due to an intramolecular electrocatalytic effect of aniline/anilinium and thiol/thiolate redox couples.The poly(DTDA) has some advantages because of its high theoretical energy density, faster kinetics, and higher electrical conductivity than an organosulfur cathode when used in lithium batteries.

The levitation force has been measured for single-domain YBa2Cu3Ox samples with different thicknesses and diameters. It has been found that the thickness dependence agrees quite well with a current model. However, the measured levitation force was found only within the linear regime. The levitation force in fact increases as the diameter decreases until a threshold value is reached. As the diameter of HTS sample is reduced smaller than the testing magnet (d = 12 mm), the force experiences a rather rapid fall.

Its implementation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the various state public utility commissions has created an opportunity for vastly expanded application of superconducting devices in transmission and distribution systems. Historically, the entrance of new technologies into the electric power system has been a long laborious process. Conservative utility technologists focused on reliability and long track records on someone else's system. The long range planning process (5-10 years) required in the regulatory environment further delayed implementation of newer technologies. Finally, regulations that limited return on investment fostered high cost generation over transmission. This has changed. The functional unbundling of the utilities into generation, transmission, and service components has put in place new management teams. Regulations are focusing on increased performance and reduced costs as well as reliability. A favorable environment is developing for a wide range of new devices that include transmission enhancement SMES, MicroSMES for power quality applications, and superconducting fault current limiters, motors, generators, transformers and transmission lines.

This magnet was built by American Superconductor Corporation (ASC) for Gesellschaft für Innovative Energieumwandlung und Speicherung (EUS) of Germany. The magnet consists of a solenoiidal coil constructed from a silver-sheathed BiPb2Sr2Ca2Cu3O (Bi-2223) conductor which was reacted before winding. The coil is epoxy impregnated and cooled with single stage Gifford McMahon (G-M) cryocoolers for operation at 100 A (DC) with substantial AC components due to the frequent variation of current (rampup and ramp-down.) The dominant heat load in the magnet is eddy-current heating caused by the current ramping operation. To accommodate this heat load, a separate cryocooler is employed for cooling the main coil. A smaller capacity cryocooler is used for intercepting the heat load of the conduction cooled current leads. Specialized thermal interfaces were developed for operation in AC field and at high voltages. The magnet can be ramped from zero to 100 A in 2 s and back to zero current in 2 s. One hundred sequential rampup/ramp-down cycles can be accommodated before the magnet temperature exceeds the allowable maximum . The magnet was tested in early spring of 1996 and was shipped to EUS in mid June. The successful operation of this magnet illustrates that the technology of cooling HTS magnets with G-M type cryocooler is now fully established. The long term operation of this magnet at EUS will verify the reliability of HTS magnet system in critical applications and will open future applications for HTS in the area of SMES and other magnets. © 1997 IEEE.",,"Cooling systems; Electric currents; Electric energy storage; High temperature superconductors; Oxide superconductors; Semiconducting bismuth compounds; Solenoids; Thermal effects; Cryocoolers; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Superconducting magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031162306

The fan coils can be installed side-wall or overhead in the freezing chamber, and the coils have cast aluminum fins. The usual solutions for frosting on the surfaces of freezing coils is to heat or spray with water to get rid of the frost periodically. However, these solutions are not only energy-consuming, but they also tends to spoil the refrigerated objects in the chamber. The main idea of this research is to achieve nonfrosting by using the technology of absorption-dehumidification to separate the water vapor from the circulating air in the freezing chamber during operations. Therefore, an experimental determination of nonfrosting technology using absorption principles was em- ployed in this study. In the absorption-dehumidification device, the water vapor was absorbed into the liquid desiccant solution, and the diluted solution was regenerated by using the heat sources combined with waste heat from the freezing machine and major heat from a modified water heater. The dried air from the absorption-dehumidification device was circulated in the freezing chamber. The chamber operated at a temperature of -5 to -10°C. Since most of the water vapor in the circulating air is removed by the absorption-dehumidification device, less water vapor can be condensed on the coils. Therefore, no frosty coils were found in this freezing chamber during long-term operation.",,"Absorption; Technology; Vapors; Absorption dehumidification; Cast aluminum fin; Fan coil; Freezing chamber; Gas separation; Liquid desiccant solution; Nonfrosting technology; Separation; refrigeration; separation-gas/gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031148284

These regulations vary from country to country, but in the U.S., for example, HCFC-141b will be phased out in less than a decade. Although there are several potential options for replacement blowing agents, many applications will continue to require a liquid, non-flammable blowing agent designed to produce foams with low thermal conductivity using traditional processing techniques. The most promising class of materials to fill this need are liquid HFCs. AlliedSignal is committed to supplying a liquid HFC blowing agent to the foam industry. At the 1994 Polyurethane World Congress, AlliedSignal announced that HFC-245fa (1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane) was our primary candidate for a liquid HFC ""third generation"" blowing agent to replace HCFC-141b. This molecule was selected after a rigorous screening process in which several hundred candidates were ranked using physical properties, flammability characteristics, performance as a blowing agent, economics, environmental acceptability, and anticipated toxicity as selection criteria. HFC-245fa was found to offer the optimum combination of these attributes. In ordertofully qualify this or any other material as a foam blowing agent, however, much more extensive work is required in all these areas. Additionally, customer validation and feedback is critical at every step in the process to ensure commercial viability and ultimate acceptance in the rigid foam market. This paper provides an update on the continuing HFC-245fa development program being conducted by AlliedSignal. The physical, environmental, and flammability properties of HFC-245fa are reviewed. Of particular note is that the flammability of HFC-245fa has been extensively tested by several ASTM test methods and the product's non-flammability has been confirmed. An update of the toxicity testing program for HFC-245fa is given. Results to date are very encouraging. The acute testing program is nearly complete and the results suggest that this material has a very low order of acute toxicity. This acute testing, however, does not provide a guarantee of success in full-scale toxicity tests. Full scale toxicity testing of HFC-245fa in several repeated dose studies is scheduled to begin soon. An important property of any blowing agent is its stability, both thermal and chemical. HFC-245fa has previously been shown to exhibit excellent thermal stability up to 200°C neat and in the presence of water, aluminum, and/or stainless steel [1]. Further testing has been conducted to determine the thermal stability of HFC-245fa in the presence of cold rolled steel under a variety of conditions. HFC-245fa continues to show excellent thermal stability characteristics under a variety of conditions. Three aspects of chemical stability are discussed. The first is the stability of the blowing agent in the presence of other common polyurethane foam raw materials and blends. Related to this is the stability of formulated ""B"" components after extended storage periods as measured by changes in system reactivity over time. The third is the stability of the blowing agent during the foaming reaction as determined by measuring levels of decomposition products, if any, in the foam's cells. The results of our preliminary investigations in these three areas are very encouraging. A major difference between HFC-245fa and HCFC-141b is their boiling points, 59°F for HFC-245fa vs 89°F for HCFC-141b. The implications of the lower boiling point and correspondingly higher vapor pressure of HFC-245fa vs HCFC141b in two important areas, storage/handling and foam properties have been previously discussed [1]. Although the higher vapor pressure of HFC-245fa may require some small modifications to the way the material is handled, the impact of this lower boiling point on low temperature dimensional stability and thermal conductivity appears to be very positive. The acceptability of any blowing agent candidate will ultimately be based on performance. The results of both internal and customer evaluations involving machine and hand mix studies in a variety of formulations are presented. The viability of HFC-245fa as a foam blowing agent has been demonstrated. Work has begun to optimize both formulations and processing conditions to achieve optimum performance from HFC-245fa. It is anticipated that-these data will provide a starting point from which foam formulators can begin their proprietary formulation development activities. In addition to producing foams with κ-factors approaching those of HCFC-141b blown foams, our evaluations to date indicate that the intermediate boiling point of HFC-245fa (lower than a traditional liquid blowing agent but higher than a true gaseous blowing agent) results in foams that have the excellent uniformity and physical properties of traditional pour foams, but that also have the isotropic cell structure and excellent flow characteristics most often associated with froth foams. Results of an AHAM sponsored trial which evaluated the performance of HFC-245fa blown foam in a refrigerator cabinet are presented. The results are very positive. Foam processing was judged to be excellent and refrigerator energy consumption was nearly as good as that of refrigerator cabinets filled with HCFC-141b blown foams. Data are provided on the κ-factor aging characteristics of HFC-245fa blown appliance and boardstock foams. Thermal conductivity of HFC-245fa blown foams as a function of mean temperature is also discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion of AlliedSignal's plans for the continuing development and commercialization of HFC-245fa as a blowing agent for rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams. © 1997 Technomic Publishing Co., Inc.",,"Boiling point; Chemical stability; Hydrofluorocarbons; Blowing agents; Dimensional stability; Environmental protection; Flammability testing; Foamed plastics; Polymer blends; Polyurethanes; Thermal conductivity of liquids; Thermodynamic stability; Toxicity; Vapor pressure; Fluorocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031147210

The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the influence of marginal expansion upon marginal integrity and clarify the cause of these morphological changes. METHODS: A total of 22 extracted human molars were restored with Class II resin composite restorations, with and without the use of a dentin bonding agent. The cervical restoration margin was located below the cemento-enamel-junction (CEJ). The marginal adaptation at the dentin- and enamel-composite interfaces was evaluated and measured on replicas using quantitative SEM analysis after different storage periods. The chemical composition of the marginal expansion was determined qualitatively by EDX (Energy Dispersive X-Ray) analysis using original tooth samples. The results obtained from quantitative SEM analysis were statistically analyzed by applying the Mann-Whitney U-test and the error rates method. RESULTS: Significantly less marginal expansion occurred at the enamel interface than at the dentin-composite interface (p < or = 0.01). Within the dentin, less marginal expansion was observed with the use of a dentin bonding agent than without a dentin bonding agent (p < or = 0.05). At 1 y, a significant (p < or = 0.05) decrease in marginal expansion was observed in both groups. EDX analysis revealed that the chemical composition of the marginal expansion is comparable to the resin composite, since peaks for silicon, barium and ytterbium could be found at these sites. SIGNIFICANCE: In Class II resin composite restorations below the CEJ, partial disruption of the adhesive bond may occur initially when curing the restoration. Water sorption causes gap reduction by hygroscopic expansion, seen in the SEM as a volume increase. Thus, the observed morphological changes can be regarded as an early sign of insufficient adhesion between composite and dentin at sites where disruption of the bond occurred initially, whether or not a dentin bonding agent was used.",,"acrylic acid derivative; dentin bonding agent; heliobond; resin; resin cement; Syntac dentine adhesive; Tetric; article; chemistry; dental surgery; dentin; endodontics; human; methodology; nonparametric test; scanning electron microscopy; ultrastructure; Acrylates; Composite Resins; Dental Restoration, Permanent; Dentin; Dentin-Bonding Agents; Humans; Marginal Adaptation (Dentistry); Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Resin Cements; Statistics, Nonparametric",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031129704

At peak capacity, the flight muscles can sustain a mechanical power output of nearly 80 W kg-1 muscle mass at 24 °C, which is sufficient to generate forces of approximately 150% of the animal's weight. The increase in flight force above that required to support body weight is accompanied by a rise in wing velocity, brought about by an increase in stroke amplitude and a decrease in stroke frequency. Inertial costs, although greater than either profile or induced power, would be minimal with even modest amounts of elastic storage, and total mechanical power energy should be equivalent to aerodynamic power alone. Because of the large profile drag expected at low Reynolds numbers, the profile power was approximately twice the induced power at all levels of force generation. Thus, it is the cost of overcoming drag, and not the production of lift, that is the primary requirement for flight in Drosophila melanogaster. By comparing the estimated mechanical power output with respirometrically measured total power input, we determined that muscle efficiency rises with increasing force production to a maximum of 10%. This change in efficiency may reflect either increased crossbridge activation or a favorable strain regime during the production of peak forces.","aerodynamics; Drosophila melanogaster; flight; fruit fly; muscle efficiency; power requirement; respirometry","Animalia; Arena; Drosophila melanogaster; Melanogaster",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031128293

A simulation program for modeling and performance evaluation of the solar-operated absorption cycle is done for all possible climatic conditions of Beirut. The results have shown that for each ton of refrigeration it is required to have a minimum collector area of 23.3 m2 with an optimal water storage tank capacity ranging from 1000 to 1500 liters for the system to operate solely on solar energy for about seven hours a day. The monthly solar fraction of total energy use in cooling is determined as a function of solar collector area and storage tank capacity. An economic assessment is performed based on current cost of conventional cooling systems. It is found that the solar cooling system is marginally competitive only when combined with domestic water heating. © 1997, Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is shown that: (1) the hydrodynamic base pressures reduce the uplifting resistance as well as the energy dissipation capacity of the base plate; (2) the uplifting resistance increases with increase in the thicknesses of the base plate and the tank wall, and the stiffness of the foundation soil; and (3) the energy dissipation capacity increases with an increase in the base-plate thickness and the yield level of plate material, and reduces with increase in foundation stiffness and the thickness of the tank wall. Next, an efficient method is presented for the dynamic response analysis of flexibly supported unanchored tanks.

The theory includes three fully-coupled partial differential equations.

The theory can be applied to describe the mass and energy in radioactive waste repositories, food processing, underground energy storage sites, buried electric cables positions, waste disposal sites, and in agricultural soil. Several transport coefficients for heat, water, and solute are included in the theory. The coefficients are evaluated for a silty clay loam soil to clarify their dependence on water content (θ), T, and C. The thermal vapor diffusivity DTv first increased as θ increased to 0.22 m3/m3 then decreased with further increases in θ. DTv was 3 orders of magnitude greater than either isothermal vapor Dmv or osmotic vapor Dov, diffusivities at θ of 0.20 m3/m3, T of 50°C, and C of 0.001 mol/kg.

Although a matrix converter requires 18 switching devices instead of 12, each device capacity is 0.383 times with a total capacity of 0.575 times that of the converter-inverter system. For the matrix converter, we proposed a firing sequence which eliminated voltage and current spikes in switching operations and a control method I which generated the output voltage of 0.866 times the supply voltage. Moreover, we proposed control method II which improved the waveform distortion of the input current and realized unity input power factor. In this paper, we propose a new VVVF gate circuit based on control method II for matrix converter, which can on-line control input current waveform and output voltage waveform to sinusoidal even if there is fluctuation, asymmetry, and/or harmonics in the supply voltage. We also confirm by experiments that the waveform distortion of the input current and the input power factor were greatly improved. © 1997 Scripta Technica, Inc.","Matrix converter; On-line control; VVVF","Current voltage characteristics; Electric distortion; Electric power factor; Electric waveforms; Switching; Converter inverter system; Matrix converters; Power converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031117889

It is based on the assumption that for the anaerobic poly(hydroxyalcanoates) (PHA) storage the reduction power is delivered by glycogen and the energy is supplied with hydrolysis of glycogen or polyphosphate. These have to be regenerated under aerobic or anoxic conditions which requires energy and releases carbon dioxide. Batch experiments with activated sludge from a pilot plant fed with domestic wastewater were performed. 13C (in the form of acetate) was added and traced with solid state carbon NMR. The anaerobic formation of intracellular PHA from metabolised acetate together with degraded glycogen and the aerobic conversion of PHA to glycogen could be detected. The low ratio of acetate to carbohydrate conversion and the detection of poly(hydroxyvalerate) formed from glycogen shows that there is a substantial anaerobic breakdown of glycogen for energy production. The results from the NMR spectra also indicate that glycogen is degraded via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. From the model it can be concluded that the maintenance of a glycogen and polyphosphate pool reduces the growth yield on substrate. This reduction depends on the type of substrate. It is estimated that for acetate there is a loss of biomass yield of about 12% as compared to strictly aerobic conditions. The model also shows that glycogen as well as polyphosphate may serve for anaerobic energy supply, however with acetate as the only carbon source, polyphosphate is essential for growth.","13C-NMR; Activated sludge; Enhanced biological phosphorus removal; Entner-Doudoroff pathway; Glycogen; Nutrient removal; PHB; PHV; Polyphosphate; Wastewater treatment","acetic acid; carbohydrate; carbon; carbon dioxide; glycogen; phosphorus; polyphosphate; activated sludge; article; biomass; hydrolysis; intracellular transport; priority journal; reduction; waste water management; Prospect Hill virus; bacteria; sewage treatment; Biological water treatment; Biomass; Carbon; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Degradation; Microorganisms; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Phosphates; Phosphorus; Polyesters; Polysaccharides; Substrates; Biochemical model; Biological phosphorus removal; Entner-Doudoroff pathway; Glycogen; Nutrient removal; Polyhydroxyalcanoates; Polyhydroxyvalerate; Polyphosphates; Wastewater treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107039

The specific temperature regime and procedure described for the thermal decomposition of platinum-chloride (platinum-bromide or possibly other Pt compounds) from anhydrous isopropanol (or possibly other organic solvents) produces an electrode interface that is a selective catalyst for iodine/triiodide reduction in organic electrolytes, matching the kinetics reported in aqueous iodide/iodine systems. This technology produces catalytic electrodes that are electrochemically/chemically stable in their operating environment, in addition to providing superior mechanical endurance or robustness and good adherence to substrates. The catalyst has been structurally characterized as nanosized platinum metal clusters. The very low platinum loadings (less than 3 μg/cm2) render these electrodes optically transparent, and economy in the quantity of platinum used is an additional advantage.

This is a key problem for the construction of viscoelastic minimum principles and for the micromechanics of heterogeneous materials with memory. The notion of the viscoelastic free energy functional is discussed, thermodynamic admissibility conditions are established. An engineering analysis is realized through the method of harmonic strain regimes, influence of the loss and the storage moduli on the dissipation rate is studied. For the Volterra-Frechet integral expansion approach, necessary conditions on the general form of a free energy viscoelastic functional are formulated. The obtained results are used to examine the thermodynamic validity of certain classic viscoelastic models, like that of Staverman-Schwarzl.

The first system is difficult because of the very low withstanding voltage of a superconducting coil and the second also involves difficulties such as multiple connections of many converters on the dc side and large current conductors in the superconducting coil. The third system, composed of several modules with small-scale convertor units and element coils, might be a solution of the above difficulties. In this modular system, the module coils have magnetic linkage with one another. In this paper, the influence of magnetic linkage between coils of a modular SMES is investigated by computer simulation. The magnetic linkage varies with the number of modules and the type of connection of the coils. By the effect of this magnetic linkage, each module's coil current is different at the same power. The current and energy transfer characteristics are determined for discharge from one or more of 6 modules, consisting of 18 coils. The discussion deals with the case in which there is an unused module when quenching occurs. The transfer with the same current in all modules is shown by control of converter power of the current feedback.","Energy transmission; Magnetic linkage; Modular SMES; Superconductive magnetic energy storage (SMES)","Computer simulation; Electric coils; Electric currents; Electric discharges; Energy transfer; Feedback; Magnetic field effects; Magnetic linkages; Superconductive magnetic energy storage (SMES); Superconducting devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031096920

The ASGMs installed at some pumped-storage power stations achieve automatic frequency control during nightly demand troughs by changing the pumping power to accord with the rotating speed. It is expected, on the other hand, that under peak generation during the day, the ASGM will be used for enhancement of transient stability because it can generate or absorb active and reactive power independently via the ac excitation voltage control. This paper proposes a novel control method for the excitation systems of ASGM that will improve the transient stability of multi-machine power systems like multiple ASGMs. The controller, which is designed for an energy function, works well for stability enhancement. To gauge it against conventional excitation control of synchronous generators and against constant output power control of ASGMs, the effectiveness of the proposed method is simulated in digital trials.","Adjustable-speed generator/motor (ASGM); Coordinated excitation control; Energy function; Power system; Transient stability","AC generator motors; Electric frequency control; Power control; Pumped storage power plants; Reactive power; System stability; Transients; Voltage control; Adjustable speed generator/motors (ASGM); Energy function; Multimachine power systems; Electric power systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031095985

The annual solar fraction of the system, at the weather and socioeconomic conditions of Cyprus, is, at best, approximately 77% with an in-tank auxiliary heater configuration and 86% with an external auxiliary heater. It is demonstrated that the arrangement with the external auxiliary unit has a higher collector efficiency and results in a higher annual solar fraction. In the case of in-tank auxiliary, the system performance increases with the height of the auxiliary position from the bottom of the storage tank ; with the auxiliary at the bottom of the storage tank the annual solar fraction is approximately 59%, compared to 77% when the auxiliary is located at the top of the tank.

The jam made at 92°C was stored in a shelf-life study for 13 months. The jam was then stored at 8°C, ambient temperature and at 37°C. At ambient temperature the jam was stored both in dark and in daylight, at 8°C and at 37°C the jam was stored in dark. After 13 months of storage, at 8°C, 60% of the amount of ascorbic acid and 29% of the amount of anthocyanins were retained. In the jam stored at higher temperatures less of both was retained. The β-carotene in the jam was found to be stable throughout the whole shelf-life study. Exposure to light did not have any effect on any of the components studied. The degradation of anthocyanins was best described by a second-order reaction and the activation energy was determined to be 90 kJ/mol. A jam of blackcurrant may be considered as a good source of vitamins and antioxidants after one year, if certain precautions concerning manufacture and storage conditions are taken.",,"anthocyanin; antioxidant; ascorbic acid; beta carotene; vitamin; article; darkness; degradation; environmental temperature; food packaging; food preservation; food processing; food storage; fruit; sunlight; temperature sensitivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031045310

In addition, in obesity, changes in energy expenditure are hypothesized to be involved in the development or maintenance of excessive body fat storage. In this study, abdominal fat distribution by computed tomographic (CT) scan was used to study the relation between the visceral fat depot, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity in a group of obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance (n = 26; body mass index [BMI], 39 ± 1 kg/m2) and a group of normal-weight control subjects (n = 9; BMI, 23 ± 1 kg/m2). The minimal model method was used to assess insulin sensitivity, S(I), and first-phase (Φ1) and second-phase (Φ2) β-cell sensitivity from plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations measured during an intravenous glucose tolerance test ([IVGTT] 0.33 g/kg body weight). Moreover, we evaluated the relationships between these parameters and the resting metabolic rate (RMR) and glucose-induced thermogenesis (GIT) measured by indirect calorimetry. The data show the following: (1) in obese subjects, Φ1 is greater but not statistically different from the value in control subjects (252 ± 41 v 157 ± 25 dimensionless 109); (2) Φ2 is significantly higher in obese subjects (27 ± 4 v 14 ± 2 min-1 x 109, P &lt; .05), with a positive correlation between the amount of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and Φ2 (r = .49, P &lt; .05); (3) S(I) is decreased in the obese group (2.8 ± 0.3 v 9.7 ± 1.6 10-4 min-1/(μU · mL-1), P &lt; .0001), with a negative correlation of S(I) with the adiposity index BMI (r = .67, P &lt; .0001) and VAT (r = -.56, P &lt; .05); (4) RMR, expressed in absolute terms, was significantly increased in obese versus lean subjects (5.9 ± 0.2 v 4.6 ± 0.3 kJ/min, P &lt; .01), whereas when RMR was adjusted for fat-free mass (FFM), the difference between the two groups disappeared (0.09 ± 0.003 v 0.09 ± 0.002 kJ/min · kg FFM). We did not observe any difference in GIT between lean and obese subjects. Moreover, GIT was significantly correlated with FFM (r = .69, P &lt; .005), but not with BMI. The amount of VAT did not correlate with RMR or GIT. In conclusion, these results suggest that in obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity is impaired and the β-cell hyperresponse to glucose is mainly due to an enhanced second-phase β-cell secretion. The degree of visceral fat deposition seems to affect insulin secretion and worsens insulin sensitivity, but does not influence energy expenditure.",,"C peptide; glucose; insulin; adipose tissue; adult; article; body fat; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; energy expenditure; female; human; hyperinsulinemia; hyperlipidemia; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intravenous glucose tolerance test; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031041609

The aim of the present study was to examine linoleate balance and organ partitioning in rats consuming a low but adequate level of linoleate. Weanling male Sprague- Dawley rats were given free access to a semipurified diet containing 2.3% of energy as linoleate. Food intake, fecal output and body weight gain were measured for 26 d. Whole-body fatty acid balance analysis showed that 75.5% of the linoleate consumed disappeared (apparently by β-oxidation), 18.7% was accumulated as linoleate, 3.0% was converted to (n-6) longer-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 1.2% was excreted in the feces. Visceral fat contained 64% of the accumulated linolenate, and 23% was in lean tissues. Comparable values for α-linolenate were as follows: disappearance (84.9%), accumulation (10.9%), excretion in the feces (2.2%), and conversion to (n-3) longer-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (1.4%). Visceral fat contained 67% of the accumulated α-linolenate, and 23% was in lean tissues. Visceral fat also accumulated 26% of newly synthesized (n-6) longer-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and 31% of the (n-3) longer-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thus, only 6.5% of dietary linoleate consumed at a low but adequate level for rats appeared in lean tissues as linoleate or its fatty acid metabolites; the rest was β-oxidized or stored in fat mostly in visceral fat. These results lead us to speculate whether losses through β-oxidation contribute to the recommended intake for linoleate in growing rats.","linoleate; polyunsaturates; rats; α-linolenate; β-oxidation","linoleic acid; animal experiment; animal tissue; arachidonic acid metabolism; article; controlled study; fat intake; fatty acid oxidation; lipid composition; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; rat; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031026550

Previous studies have demonstrated an increased basal metabolic rate in cancer patients. However, no previous study has investigated the changes in energy expenditure and substrate oxidation after administration of a glucose load. Furthermore, the role of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) on cancer-induced metabolic changes is still a neglected area. METHODS. In 25 cancer patients and 16 healthy subjects matched with regard to age, body mass index, and fat-free mass, indirect calorimetry was made before and after administration of a glucose load (75 g per subject, administered orally). RESULTS. Cancer patients had fasting plasma concentrations of insulin (74 ± 3.3 vs. 67 ± 4.1 pmol/L; P < 0.05), lactate (0.68 ± 0.11 vs. 0.41 ± 0.1 mmol/L; P < 0.05), free fatty acids (884 ± 121 vs. 342 ± 76 mmol/mL; P < 0.001), and TNF-α (1.23 ± 0.31 vs. 0.45 ± 0.11 ng/mL; P < 0.01) greater than controls, whereas plasma glucose concentrations (4.8 ± 0.5 vs. 5.1 ± 0.3 mmol/L; P = not significant) were not different from controls. Indirect calorimetry at baseline demonstrated that basal metabolic rate, fat oxidation, and protein oxidation were significantly greater in cancer patients than in controls. After administration of the glucose load, carbohydrate oxidation progressively rose in both cancer patients and controls, with no differences between the two groups, whereas glucose uptake (59.3 ± 3.8 vs. 69.1 ± 3.6 g/kg fat-free mass [FFM] x 240 minutes; P < 0.01) and storage (49.1 ± 4.1 vs. 60.2 ± 3.3 g/kg FFM X 240 minutes: P < 0.05) were markedly reduced in cancer patients as compared with controls. Finally, glucose-induced thermogenesis (GIT) was lower in cancer patients than in controls. CONCLUSIONS. This study demonstrated that GIT is lower in cancer patients than in healthy subjects matched with regard to age and body mass index. An overactivity of the glucose fatty acid cycle is responsible for such results. Plasma concentrations of TNF-α might play a modulating role in the metabolic changes that occur after administration of a glucose load. The role of TNF-α on glucose and lipid metabolism in cancer patients would be a worthy subject of future investigations.","cancer; glucose-induced thermogenesis; substrate oxidation; tumor necrosis factor","fatty acid; glucose; insulin; lactic acid; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adult; aged; article; basal metabolic rate; calorimetry; cancer; clinical article; controlled study; energy expenditure; fatty acid blood level; female; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; human; insulin blood level; lactate blood level; lipid oxidation; male; oral glucose tolerance test; priority journal; thermogenesis; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Glucose; Body Temperature Regulation; Energy Metabolism; Fats; Female; Glucose; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Oxidation-Reduction; Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031014505

Though both are highly productive, feedlot operators have come to view manure as a waste management problem, while grain operations face declining soil quality and a reliance on commercial fertilizers to maximize yields. Neither type of operation can be considered sustainable. Cooperative on-farm composting may provide solutions to some of the problems facing our industrialized agricultural systems and render the systems more sustainable. In this paper we view cooperative on-farm composting as the combination and processing of feedlot manure with crop stover to produce a beneficial natural soil amendment and fertilizer for those fields from which the stover was taken. Cooperative on-farm composting would help protect surface and groundwater from nutrient loading, save resources, and help renew social ties within the agricultural community. Composting stabilizes nutrients, kills pathogens and weed seeds, reduces moisture content, reduces odor, and improves physical properties of manure, thereby improving its value as a soil amendment and fertilizer. Although some N in raw manure is lost during composting, the end product differs from raw manure in that it exhibits minimal N loss in storage or after field application. Composted manure can become the primary fertilizer for grain production once the cumulative N mineralization from previous applications reach steady- state. The use of composted manure improves soil quality and greatly reduces total energy consumption compared with the use of commercial fertilizer. A hypothetical example illustrates how compost applications to irrigated corn (Zea mays L.) could result in a net energy savings of about 3.3 million Btu/acre, which is equivalent to the energy contained in 19.4 gallons of diesel fuel/acre.",,"Animalia; Zea mays",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031005425

Prospective Technol. Studs., World Trade Center, Isla de la Cartuja, E-41092 Sevilla, Spain","If fuel cells are introduced for vehicular applications, hydrogen might become an energy carrier for transport applications. Manufacture via steam-reforming of natural gas is a low-cost option for hydrogen production. This study deals with the feasibility of combining the production of hydrogen from natural gas with CO2 removal. When hydrogen is produced from natural gas, a concentrated stream of CO2 is generated as a by-product. If manufacture is carried out near a depleted natural gas held, the separated CO2 can be compressed and injected into the held and securely sequestered there. The incremental cost of the produced hydrogen (for CO2 compression plus transport, injection and storage) would typically be about 7% relative to the case where the separated CO2 is vented. Moreover, CO2 injection leads to enhanced natural gas recovery as a result of reservoir repressurization. Though the extra natural gas is somewhat contaminated with CO2, it is a suitable feedstock for hydrogen production.

Ten trans-tibial amputees were selected. The study was designed as a double-blind, randomised trial. For gait analysis a VICON motion analysis system was used with 2 AMTI force platforms. A special measuring device was used for measuring energy storage and release of the foot during a simulated step. The impulses of the anteroposterior component of the ground force showed small, statistically non-significant differences (deceleration phase: 22.7-23.4 Ns; acceleration phase: 17.0-18.4 Ns). The power storage and release phases as well as the net results also showed small differences (maximum difference in net result is 0.03 J kg-1). It was estimated that these differences lead to a maximum saving of 3% of metabolic energy during walking. It was considered unlikely that the subjects would notice this difference. It was concluded that during walking differences in mechanical energy expenditure of this magnitude are probably not of clinical relevance. Ankle power, as an indicator for energy storage and release gave different results to the energy storage and release as measured with the special test device, especially during landing response. In the biomechanical model (based on inverse dynamics) used in the gait analysis the deformation of the material is not taken into consideration and hence this method of gait analysis is probably not suitable for calculation of shock absorption.",,"adult; aged; article; biomechanics; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; energy balance; female; foot; human; male; prosthesis; randomized controlled trial",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030996502

In this model of diabetes, blood glucose is significantly increased while the circulating insulin level remains unchanged. Glucose penetrates cells because of decreased glycogen turnover, a metabolic abnormality that can be revealed by using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In control rats, hyperglycemia was accompanied by increased glycogen synthesis, as evidenced by increased concentrations of this storage substance in liver and skeletal muscle. Repeated treatment with EGb 761 or bilobalide increased the glycogen contents of both liver and muscle. This effect of bilobalide was additive to that of hyperglycemia in muscle. In diabetic rats, hyperglycemia did not modify glycogen synthesis, indicating impaired glucose utilization. Repeated treatment with EGb 761 or bilobalide partially prevented this impairment and led to increased in glycogen content in both liver and muscle under control conditions an during OGTT with 2 g/kg glucose. The molecular mechanism underlying these actions of EGb 761 could be related to an antioxidant effect (i.e., suppression of free radical formation) or to free radical-scavenging, since EGb 761 is known to have such effects and since free radicals have been implicated in the cytotoxic activity of streptozotocin. However, the increase in glucose uptake induced by bilobalide may have been related to increased glycogen synthesis.","Bilobalide; Diabetes mellitus (NIDDM); Energy metabolism; Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761); Glucose; Glycogen; Non-insulin-dependent; Rat","bilobalide; ginkgo biloba extract; glycogen; animal model; article; controlled study; glucose metabolism; glucose utilization; glycogen analysis; glycogen synthesis; hyperglycemia; intraperitoneal drug administration; liver; male; muscle; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; oral drug administration; oral glucose tolerance test; rat; streptozocin diabetes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030989191

Total lipid content of all fish samples ranged from 7.8 to 345.1 (mg/g wet weight). Lipid class and fatty acid composition showed significant shifts with increasing age in fish. Lipid content in adult Comephorus baicalensis showed the greatest change, with total lipids increasing from 1.63% of wet weight in juveniles (3 yr.) individuals to over 30% in mature adults (8-10 year). Triacylglycerol was the primary lipid store, increasing from 18 to over 90% of total lipids in several year classes of C. baicalensis with lesser amounts in C. dybowskii and omul. Three fatty acids, the 16:0, 18:1(9), and 22:6 were the major fatty acids in all fish, with significant shifts in distribution attributable to changes in prey items during fish maturity. Cholest-5-en-3β-ol (cholesterol) was the dominant sterol in all fish (> 99% of total sterols) and did not show any significant difference among species or with maturity.

The objective was to establish whether there are cell-type specific relationships between iron and other elements in the iron-rich organs and tissues (adipose tissue, opisthonephric kidneys, dorsal integument, fat column, liver, and posterior intestine) of these two life cycle periods. Iron was localized within either dense bodies (presumptive lysosomes, siderosomes) or in the cytoplasmic matrix of many cell types where it was viewed as haemosiderin/ferritin and ferritin, respectively. Presumptive lysosomes of adipocytes of the nephric folds, dorsal integument, and fat column possessed iron and sulphur and this elemental association was also prevalent in the epithelia of the larval proximal tubules and in the posterior intestine and epidermis of both life periods. Macrophages of the larval haemopoietic tissue (posterior intestine) and of the juvenile opisthonephros, which were described as melano-macrophages because of their granules, possessed iron, sulphur, and calcium. This elemental association was also noted in the presumptive lysosomes of the iron-loaded hepatocytes of the juvenile liver while no elements could be detected in these cells in the larval organ. The variations and similarities in elemental associations between the cell types in each life period and at different life periods is discussed in the context of specific cell functions related to the prevention of iron toxicity. These functions are sequestration of iron and storage as the less toxic haemosiderin (larval adipocytes, macrophages, juvenile hepatocytes) or as part of a process of elimination of excesses of this metal (posterior intestine, dorsal epidermal cells). Due to its unique ability to deal with copious amounts of iron at all periods of the life cycle, the lamprey serves as an important model for studies of iron loading in vertebrates.","Associated elements; Intracellular distribution; Iron; Lamprey; Petromyzon marinus; X-ray microanalysis","calcium; ferritin; hemosiderin; iron; sulfur; adipocyte; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell type; cellular distribution; cyclostome; epidermis; integument; intestine; iron storage; juvenile; kidney; kidney proximal tubule; larva; life cycle; liver; liver cell; lysosome; macrophage; nonhuman; transmission electron microscopy; X ray microanalysis; Animalia; Petromyzon marinus; Petromyzontidae; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030983091

In controls (group 3), canine pancreas grafts were autotransplanted without preservation.

Graft survival rates were five of five, zero of five, and five of five in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Total adenine nucleotide levels before reperfusion in group 1 were almost the same as in group 2. Furthermore, ATP tissue levels in group I before reperfusion were also the same as in group 2.

The most intensely studied situation is that in which the sterol is stored as ester in lipid droplets. Cholesterol ester must be de-esterified and transported to mitochondria where steroid synthesis begins. Since droplets and mitochondria are now known to be attached to intermediate filaments and since these structures are not contractile, it appears to be necessary to invoke the actions of other cytoskeletal elements. Actin microfilaments are involved in cholesterol transport so that it is tempting to propose that the contractile properties of actomyosin are used in this process. It is known that an energy-dependent contractile process involving actin is capable of disrupting intermediate filaments. Since the intermediate filaments appear to act by keeping lipid droplets and mitochondria apart, disruption of the filaments accompanied by a contractile process would be expected to allow these two structures to come together. This would open the way for the transfer of cholesterol to the steroidogenic pathway. This should be regarded as a first step. The events necessary for entry of cholesterol from droplets into the mitochondria remain to be clarified. In addition, the transport process for newly synthesized cholesterol that is not stored in droplets, is still not understood. At least four protein kinase enzymes have been identified in the cytoskeletons of adrenal cells, namely, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, protein kinase (Ca2+ and phospholipid- dependent), myosin light chain kinase, and protein kinase A (cyclic AMP- dependent). The Ca2+/calmodulin kinase promotes transport of cholesterol to mitochondria and does so under conditions in which phosphorylation of vimentin and myosin light chain occurs. Phosphorylation of vimentin results in disruption of intermediate filaments while phosphorylation of light chain promotes contraction of the actomyosin ring. It now appears that intermediate filaments are cross-linked by actin filaments so that such contraction would be expected to produce significant structural changes in the cytoskeleton and the attached organelles. Although the details of the changes taking place in the organ in vivo are not known, the potential for interaction between droplets and mitochondria as the result of these changes in intermediate filaments and actomyosin, is clear. Protein kinase C is activated by ACTH and cyclic AMP, although this activation does not appear to be directly involved in the regulation of steroid synthesis. Nevertheless, vimentin is a substrate for this enzyme, and changes in the organisation of vimentin filaments and the attached organelles under the influence of protein kinase C have been reported in other cells. Presumably these changes represent part of the response to ACTH because when protein kinase C is activated by phorbol ester, the cytoskeletal changes necessary for rounding up take place but such changes are not accompanied by increased steroid synthesis. Protein kinase A causes rounding of adrenal cells and cytoskeletons. This kinase also causes increased cholesterol transport and, hence, stimulation of steroid synthesis. The enzyme also causes phosphorylation of vimentin but with a different cytoskeletal reorganisation from that seen with the other three kinase enzymes. Clearly phosphorylation plays a major role in these responses. Phosphorylation alters the morphology and the functions of the cytoskeleton and this, in turn, is associated with accelerated cholesterol transport. It is now necessary to define the details of the specific phosphorylation reactions that occur during the response to ACTH, that is, which amino acids are phosphorylated and to what extent by each of the kinase enzymes.","cytoskeleton; intracellular cholesterol transport; lipid droplets; mitochondria; vimentin","adrenal cortex; adrenal tumor; animal cell; article; cholesterol metabolism; cholesterol transport; cytoskeleton; electron microscopy; immunofluorescence microscopy; microfilament; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; steroidogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030959965

In this analysis, the tank-liquid system is represented by a lumped-mass-stick model, and the rubber bearings are represented by a series of nonlinear hysteretic axial springs. The partially uplifted base plate loaded by liquid is analyzed giving due consideration to the effects of membrane action and plastic yielding.

Liver respiration was assessed both without added substrates and after the addition of hexanoate, glycerol, or sorbitol. The effect of ouabain on hexanoatesupported respiration was also determined. Metabolizable energy intake and energy expenditure increased in rats fed on an energy dense diet, but body-weight gain, as well as lipid and protein content, remained unchanged. When net energy expenditure, obtained excluding the total cost of storage, was expressed as a percentage of metabolizable energy, significant differences were found between the two groups of rats. This finding supports the presence of regulatory mechanisms in rats fed on an energy-dense diet, which are useful to counteract development of obesity. In addition, a significant increase in liver respiratory activity was found in rats fed on an energy-dense diet, both in the basal state and in that stimulated by added substrates. Na/K-pump-dependent O2 consumption also increased in rats fed on an energy-dense diet.

The aim of this study is the correlation of salt-effected changes in physiological parameters with structural and ultrastructural changes in root cells. The investigation was carried out with root cells because these cells are most directly exposed to the growth medium. Sorghum bicolor x S. sudanensis cv. Sweet Sioux plants were grown under steady-state conditions on nutrient solutions with or without 40 mol m-3 NaCl. Sorghum sustained this treatment but showed several salt-induced structural and physiological changes which were studied in various cell types of the root tip. (1) NaCl salinity led to a shorter growth region and to salt-induced alterations in the chemical and physical properties of the cell walls in the root tips. (2) Salt treatment also increased the membrane surface in root cells: root cells showed an increase in the quantity of vesicles in the epidermis and in the middle cortex cells. Additionally, some of the epidermis cells of salt-treated plants revealed a characteristic build-up of transfer cells, suggesting an increase in membrane surfaces to increase the uptake and storage of substances. (3) The number of mitochondria increased in the epidermal and in the cortex cells after salt stress thus indicating an additional supply of energy for osmotic adaptation and for selective uptake and transport processes. (4) In the epidermal cytoplasm NaCl stress led to a significant decrease of the P, K, Ca, and S concentrations accompanied by an increase of Na concentration. Electron micrographs show an increase in electron optical contrast within the cytosol and in the matrix of the mitochondria. These results are discussed with regard to the possibility of influence on the part of metabolic functions. (5) The NaCl concentrations were seen to increase and the K concentrations to decrease during salt stress in the vacuoles of the epidermis and cortex cells. The salt-induced increase in vacuolar NaCl concentrations of epidermis and cortex cells are in the region 2 cm behind the root tip, which is sufficient for an osmotic balance towards the growth medium. Additional solutes are necessary 0.5 mm behind the root tip to facilitate osmotic adaptation. The results show ultrastructural changes caused by an Na-avoiding mechanism characterized by a high level of energy consumption. The exclusion of Na from the symplast seems to lead additionally to a decrease in cytoplasmic concentrations of such essential elements as Mg, P, S, and Ca and is thus responsible directly (via energy supply in mitochondria, homeostasis, selectivity of K over Na) or indirectly (via enzyme conformation, cytoplasmic hydration) for the ultrastructural degradation indicated. The salinity-induced multiplicity of structural and functional changes within cell compartments constitutes a group of indicators for the limited NaCl tolerance of Sorghum.","Ca-deficiency; NaCl; salt tolerance; Sorghum bicolor x S. sudanensis; ultra-structure","Sorghum bicolor; Sorghum bicolor; Sorghum sudanensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030942657

ANU's development of large paraboloidal solar collectors and a thermochemical heat-pipe transport concept could well be combined to offer an attractive solution to this problem. A 4-MW(e) solar-assisted natural gas power plant is under consideration for Tennant Creek in Northern Australia. This base-load power plant will employ a steam Rankine cycle power conversion unit and incorporate an array of 28 direct-steam-generating dishes with 400-m2 aperture each. A preliminary investigation of replacing its water/steam heat transfer network with an ammonia-based heat transfer system indicates that 24-hour storage could be provided at an additional cost of only 12%. Furthermore, for alternative sites with no natural gas back-up available, it was found that a thermochemical ammonia system could demonstrate 24-hour base-load solar power generation for the same per-dish capital cost as a solar-only steam system without storage. This opens the market to megawatt-size, remote, off-grid applications.

It binds and internalizes VLDL particles and is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, brain and adipose tissue, which use fatty acids for energy production or storage. CRF is associated with elevated serum triglyceride and VLDL concentrations and depressed VLDL and chylomicron clearance. We have recently shown marked down-regulation of lipoprotein lipase expression in CRF. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that VLDL-R expression may be similarly depressed in CRF. To this end, VLDL-R mRNA (Northern blot) and protein mass (Western blot) of skeletal muscle (soleus) and heart were measured in male Sprague-Dawley rats six weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy (CRF group) or sham operation (NL group). A group of erythropoietin (EPO)-treated (150 U/kg twice weekly) CRF animals was included to determine the possible effect of EPO-deficiency anemia (EPO-CRF group). Subgroups of animals were studied at weeks 1, 3 and 6. The CRF group showed a fivefold increase in plasma triglyceride concentration. This was associated with an impressive fourfold reduction in heart and skeletal muscle VLDL-R mRNA and protein mass. VLDL-R mRNA levels in the heart and skeletal muscle were directly related to creatinine clearance and inversely related to serum triglyceride and VLDL concentrations. EPO therapy led to a mild improvement in CRF hypertriglyceridemia but failed to improve VLDL-R expression. Thus, the rise in plasma triglyceride and VLDL concentrations in CRF animals was associated with marked down-regulation of VLDL-R expression. Down-regulation of VLDL-R expression, shown here for the first time, reveals another facet of disturbed lipid metabolism in CRF.",,"erythropoietin; very low density lipoprotein; animal experiment; animal model; article; chronic kidney failure; controlled study; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; receptor down regulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030934687

The difference between these limits, more than 7 billion m3 yr-1 at the highest storage level, is nearly one-eighth the share by treaty of Egypt, and more than one-third of the share of the Sudan. It is also more than the estimated increase of the annual water need for Egypt between 1990 and 2000. This state of affairs renders proper management of the river flow for the sake of Egypt and the Sudan quite difficult. This paper compares the relevant methods of estimating evaporation from the limited data available. These methods are: water-balance, energy budget, bulk aerodynamic (Dalton), combination (Penman) and Complementary Relations Lake Evaporation (CRLE) model (Morton). The new estimates have a much narrower range, from 5.70 mm d-1 to 7.05 mm d-1, or only a bit more than 4% of the annual Nile flow below the High Aswan Dam. The average of those annual estimates of evaporation, after excluding the bulk aerodynamic method because of its severe limitations, is 6.0 ± 0.3 mm d-1 or 20% less than the 7.5 mm d-1 adopted by the irrigation authorities in Egypt and the Sudan. This difference corresponds to 3 billion m3 yr-1 at the highest storage level or more than 5% of the annual outflow from the reservoir. Even when the higher estimates from the bulk aerodynamic method and from the Penman method with its usual wind function are included, the new average is still 15% less than the figure of 7.5 mm d-1. The monthly distribution of the annual evaporation varies more widely with the method applied. Similar comparative studies in future, aiming at obtaining improved estimates of evaporation, require all the data relevant to all the methods to be collected properly for a common period of several years at relatively stable lake level.",,"energy budget; evaporation; lake evaporation; water balance; Egypt, Aswan High Dam",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030927956

During the weight loss, patients often have dramatic drops in circulating thyroid hormone concentrations and experience cold intolerance. Because poor iron status is known to alter thermogenesis, we investigated the possibility that iron intake interacts with energy intake during weight loss in obese individuals. The effects on indicators of iron and thyroid status of increasing the iron content of a VLED from 18 to 27 mg/d during 12 wk of a VLED were compared with the effects on the same indicators of increasing energy intake from 1752 kJ(420 kcal) to 3347 kJ(800 kcal)/d. Although all VLED groups initially had 30% declines in plasma transferrin saturation, increases in plasma ferritin concentrations, and decreases in plasma thyroid hormone concentrations, patients who received iron supplementation had significantly higher circulating concentrations of triiodothyronine and thyroxine at the end of the VLED than did patients who received only the recommended dietary allowance of iron. The patients who received iron supplementation also had a more rapid return of iron indicators to normal values over the course of the VLED. The transitory fall in iron delivery to bone marrow was not associated with anemia. These data suggest that higher thyroid hormone concentrations can be maintained during VLEDs that provide higher iron intakes.","Ferritin; Iron deficiency; Obesity; Thyroid hormones; Thyrotropin; Thyroxine; Triiodothyronine; Very-low-energy diets; Weight loss; Women","ferritin; iron; liothyronine; thyroxine; adult; anemia; article; caloric intake; dietary intake; ferritin blood level; human; iron blood level; iron metabolism; iron storage; major clinical study; obesity; thermogenesis; thyroid function; thyroid hormone blood level; weight reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030925170

The respective fatty acid distributions found in gills and mantles were compared to data from a Mediterranean littoral filter-feeding mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis. The main characteristic common to the gills of the two vent mussels was the high level of (n-7) monounsaturated phospholipid fatty acids, which are supposed to originate from sulphur-oxidizing symbionts. Using palmitoleic, 16:1 (n-7), and vaccenic, 18:1 (n-7), phospholipid fatty acids as bacterial markers, endobacterial biomass was estimated to account for 2-10% of the vent mussel gill volume. Vent mussel tissues were poor in plant-derived polyunsaturated fatty acids, indicating the limited importance of the photosynthesis based material in the metabolism of these hydrothermal vent bivalves. It is suggested that some compounds, such as nonmethylene-interrupted dienoic fatty acids and specific trienoic fatty acids originating from elongation and desaturation of oleic and palmitoleic acids, respectively, were synthesized in order to substitute exogenous plant-derived polyunsaturated fatty acids considered as essential in marine invertebrates. The high level of neutral lipids in vent mussel gills suggests that these compounds are used as a major energy storage material. The neutral lipid/phospholipid ratio in gills emphasized the preponderance of the endosymbionts in vent mussel nutrition. Using this ratio as an index of the physiological state, the symbiosis patterns in different hydrothermal fields were compared.",,"Bacteria (microorganisms); Bathymodiolus brevior; Bivalvia; Invertebrata; Mytilus galloprovincialis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030925062

This hypothesis was tested by subjecting stem segments consisting of four nodes and three intervening hollow internodes to axial compressive loads and by determining the natural frequencies of vibration of their nodes, compression tests were used to determine the critical load required to produce elastically recoverable deformations for each of a total of 115 stem segments of the gross Arundinaria tecta (Wait.) Muhl. Each segment was observed to flex at or very near its nodes while internodes appeared to act as rigid bars. The natural (fundamental) frequencies of vibrations of the nodes of these stem segments were subsequently determined and equalled those predicted by engineering theory assuming that nodes behave as spring-like joints. The data from resonance frequency tests were then used to calculate the spring constants of stem segments (i.e. the force required to produce a unit deflection in stems). These constants were found to agree with those predicted by theory provided that nodes acted mechanically as spring-like joints. The transverse septa of the nodes of 20 randomly selected stem segments were perforated with a needle and the spring constants of the impaired nodes were remeasured and compared with those of the same stems before surgical manipulation. On average, nodal spring constants were reduced by 35 %. This reduction agreed with the prediction that the perforation of septa would significantly reduce the ability of nodes to store strain energy, collectively, these results are interpreted to support the hypothesis that septate nodes can store and release strain energy. The hypothesis is discussed further in light of the behaviour of a physical model which shows that nodal 'diaphragms' can substantially stiffen a hollow cylindrical structure, although they are neither essential for the storage of strain energy nor the subsequent elastic restoration of the model's shape once bending loads are removed.","Biomechanics; Brazier buckling; Elastic buckling; Internodes; Nodes; Plant stems; Strain energy","Arundinaria; Arundinaria gigantea tecta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030921186

Ten trans-tibial amputees, active walkers, without stump problems, were selected (mean age: 49 years old). The study was designed as a double-blind, randomised trial and for each foot there was a habituation period of 2 weeks. Two questionnaires were designed. (A) concerned information about the preference of the subjects and (B) concerned the order of importance of difference aspects concerning a prosthesis. Results indicated that no clear preference for either the ESF or the CF existed and that the individual preference is not related to age. The items 'ability to walk fast' and 'no fatigue during walking', score statistically significantly worse for the CF2. With the small contrast between the ESF and CF, in relation to energy storing capacities, the subjects cannot distinguish between the ESF and CF. The 'absence of stump pain' and 'stability while walking' are ranked as most important aspects concerning a prosthesis.

Evidence of a genetic basis for obesity development is substantial, although the exact mechanism of action has yet to be identified. The purpose of this study was to document the circadian rhythmicity of the serum leptin level in young females and to assess the impact of the change in body fat stores during growth on the nocturnal rise in the serum leptin level with implications for obesity traits. There was a significant rise in serum leptin at midnight and 0400 h, suggesting a diurnal variation in serum leptin concentrations (ANOVA F ratio = 6.2; P &lt; 0.0001). There was also a strong association between relative total body fat and the average daytime serum leptin level (r = 0.78; P &lt; 0.0001). The percent increase in the nocturnal leptin concentration was inversely related to the percent gain in total body fat (r = -0.45; P &lt; 0.024). Forward stepwise regression analysis selected the change in total body fat over a 6-month interval as the most powerful determinant of the percent increase in the nocturnal leptin concentration (partial R2 = 0.203; β = -0.450; SE of β = 0.186; t = -2.418; P &lt; 0.024). If the lack of a nocturnal rise in serum leptin persists over a longer period of time, it may have implications for the development of obesity, presumably by inadequate suppression of nighttime appetite.",,"leptin; adolescence; adolescent; article; blood level; body composition; body fat; body growth; body mass; bone density; bone development; bone mineral; child; circadian rhythm; dietary intake; energy expenditure; female; human; human experiment; lipid storage; normal human; obesity; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030918538

Serum iron fell sharply by ≃50% (P &lt; 0.0001), and despite a small decrease in total-iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation decreased from 30 ± 11% to 18 ± 5% (P &lt; 0.0001).

Changes in sTfR correlated inversely with prior changes in serum iron.

There was no evidence of deficiency for the other trace elements and minerals tested. Daily supplementation with 200 mg Fe in 18 other subjects only partially corrected these observations despite some increase in iron stores. These results indicate that during a 2-wk VLED serum iron is significantly depressed, inducing functional tissue iron deficiency too short in duration to produce alterations in red blood cell indexes. These changes are not mediated by absolute iron deficiency, inflammation, or protein malnutrition but could be related to alterations in the iron storage and release behavior of the reticuloendothelial cell during energy deprivation alone.","Erythropoiesis; Functional iron deficiency; Humans; Obesity; Serum iron; Soluble transferrin receptor; Very- low-energy diet; VLED","iron; adult; aged; article; caloric intake; erythrocyte level; female; human; iron binding capacity; iron blood level; iron deficiency; iron metabolism; iron storage; male; obesity; pathogenesis; protein intake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030913239

By standard GC/MS analysis many of these target compounds were either undetectable or their confirmation uncertain because of matrix interferences. Detection and identification were greatly improved by using GC/MS/MS. GC/MS/MS analyses were performed by selecting the molecular ion (M) of a target compound and fragmenting it via collision induced dissociation (CID) to yield product ions corresponding to loss of CO for unsubstituted compounds or CO plus CH3 for alkylated compounds. The CID conditions were optimized using anthraquinone and 2-methylanthraquinone standards by varying the CID excitation energy and RF storage levels to yield optimum amounts of fragment ions. CID experiments were performed using both resonant and non-resonant wave forms. Although both excitation techniques gave comparable results for the removal of matrix interferences, non-resonant excitation provided more characteristic spectra for the alkylated anthraquinones.

The genes for all of the single gene defects that produce obesity in experimental animals have now been cloned. The new insights from these models are one spur for the examination of possible links to human obesity. In thinking about the biology of obesity produced by single gene defects, it must be kept in mind that adrenalectomy can prevent the phenotypic expression in all of the single gene models of obesity. Thus, nongenetic components can play a major role in regulating even single gene models of obesity. Transgenic mice have also expanded our understanding of obesity. Transgenic models that both increase and decrease body fat have been published. Of particular interest from the perspective of the physiological control of obesity is the destruction of the uncoupling protein in brown adipose tissue, which is followed by hyperphagia and obesity, suggesting that the sympathetic nervous system is involved in both modulation of food intake and energy storage. Gene mapping using quantitative trait loci and studies of candidate genes have been applied to experimental models of animals with differing susceptibilities to dietary fat and have been applied to the human genome in more detail.","food intake; gene defects; obesity","adrenalectomy; animal experiment; animal model; brown adipose tissue; conference paper; controlled study; food intake; gene expression regulation; gene locus; gene mapping; genetics; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; phenotype; transgenic mouse",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030912379

Storage of CO2 has been hypothesized to induce an energy-conserving metabolic suppression in torpid mammals. It is unclear whether CO2 storage also occurs in birds that undergo torpor. To study these questions, we measured rates of oxygen consumption (V̇O2) and carbon dioxide production (V̇CO2) during normothermia, entrance into torpor, steady-state torpor, and spontaneous arousal in Selasphorus hummingbirds. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) declined from about 0.86 to about 0.71 in both normothermic and torpid individuals, suggesting a shift from carbohydrate oxidation to lipid oxidation during the night. Torpor metabolism ranged from 5% to 42% of normothermic values. In most individuals that became torpid, a brief period of CO2 storage occurred during entrance into torpor, beginning after V̇O2 had fallen considerably below normothermic rates. The volume of CO2 stored averaged 0.048 mL CO2 g-1, somewhat less than reported for mammalian hibernators. Some individuals entered torpor without measurable CO2 storage. There was no abrupt change in RER at the start of arousal, although mean arousal RER exceeded the RER during steady-state torpor. The change in metabolic rate between normothermia and torpor had a Q10 of 1.9-2.2 in birds that did not regulate body temperature in torpor.

The environmental variables used in the model are: total particulate matter, particulate organic matter, particulate inorganic matter, chlorophyll, phaeopigments, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. Rates of clearance, filtration, ingestion, absorption and respiration along with efficiencies of retention, selection and absorption are modelled with endogenous (dry weight of the animal, energy allocation between growth and reproduction) and exogenous variables (temperature, food quality and quantity). The model simulate the temporal evolution of two compartments: somatic and storage-gonad. Absorbed energy is allocated to soma up to a maximum somatic growth. This maximum decreases with age and never exceeds 0.02 g.d-1.oyster-1. Energy in excess is allocated to the storage-gonad compartment. The model identify storage and gametogenesis periods and correctly predicts spawning intensity. In this model, the oyster selectively reject inorganic from organic particles, enriching the ingested ration. Within potentially nutritive particles, fewer particles containing phytopigments are rejected compared with detritic particles. Absorption efficiency is represented as a function of organic content in the ingested ration. Microphytes are absorbed with an efficiency which fluctuates from 20 to 60%. The model predicts negative absorption for detritic material to take into account metabolic faecal losses. Theses formulations provide information about the temporal evolution of the amount of microphytes and detritic matter biodeposited as pseudofaeces and faeces.","Crassostrea gigas; ecophysiology; growth; modelling; turbidity","Crassostrea gigas; Bivalvia; Crassostrea gigas; deterministic model; ecophysiology; estuarine environment; estuary; filter feeders; growth; Japanese oyster; modelling; turbidity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030897161

The primary photochemistry of a dark adapted leaf was less affected in the presence of Cu, while in a light-adapted leaf the photochemical events were severely impaired by Cu. Analysis of the characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence induction revealed that the primary target of Cu stress involved the PSII reaction centre in its ability to adapt to high light conditions. Denaturation of PSII occurred at 80 μm Cu resulting in a significant loss of PSII-mediated electron transport under continuous light and a strong inhibition of O2 evolution. It was also observed that PSI photochemistry, as probed by the photochemical energy storage in far-red light and the kinetics of P700 photooxidation by strong far-red light, was more tolerant to Cu compared to the PSII activity. Moreover, in Cu-exposed leaves irradiated with high intensity light, the in vivo heat emission yield increased due to the Cu deactivation of photosynthetic energy conservation. Heat release was well correlated with changes in non-photochemical quenching. Copper gradually prevents the adaptation process from a dark-adapted to a light-adapted state with the consequence that all observed photosynthetic activity criteria under steady state conditions in the light become more inefficient.","chlorophyll fluorescence; Cu stress; electron transport; energy storage; leaf absorbance; photosystems I and II; Zea mays","Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030891529

DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from non-obese, healthy females (18-32 y old) undergoing mammoplasty reduction. Preadipocytes were isolated and differentiated into adipocytes. MEASUREMENTS: Following the exposure of preadipocytes and adipocytes to ASP or insulin, glucose transport was assessed as [3H] 2-deoxy glucose uptake. The measurements were normalised per total cell protein. RESULTS: ASP increases specific membrane glucose transport in both preadipocytes and adipocytes in a time and concentration dependent manner. Stimulation in both cell types is rapid (within minutes), reaching a maximal effect between 1 and 4 h. However, after 24 h exposure to ASP, there is a downregulation in the response. The ASP response is greater following differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes and is compared to that of insulin. Dose response studies demonstrated a five-fold greater sensitivity of adipocytes (half-maximal concentration of ASP on adipocytes = 0.5 μM, preadipocytes = 2.3 μM). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that ASP not only stimulates triglyceride synthesis, but also glucose transport in differentiated human adipocytes and is consistent with a physiologically important role for ASP in postprandial energy storage.","ASP; C3adesArg; Glucose transport; Human adipocytes","glucose; insulin; protein; triacylglycerol; acylation; adipocyte; adipose tissue; article; breast reconstruction; cell culture; cell differentiation; female; glucose transport; human; human cell; human experiment; human tissue; isotope labeling; lipogenesis; normal human; priority journal; proadipocyte; time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030889442

Aprilov boulevard, Plovdiv 4002, Bulgaria","A new hypothesis for the development of malignant melanoma of the skin is suggested and a new, structural, 7-phase model of malignant transformation of melanocytes described. Both are based on the principle of a critical point in local energy (entropy?) storage (CPLES) at a certain level of structural organization within cells and tissues. The principle has been previously formulated from the rules of non-equilibrium thermodynamics exploring the concepts of high work value of energy and bifurcation. Melanocytes and malignant melanoma cells are described as open heterogeneous biosystems (in which non-linear, irreversible processes take place) being far from the equilibrium under normal conditions. The development is portrayed as a thermodynamic thread with 7 phases. It is peculiar that, despite bifurcations, each single phase might be repeated many times in its own right and the cells might remain at a similar level of malignization within the same phase. Bifurcations are trajectory periods when cells 'make' a choice of unidirectional development and should be differentiated from mutations although the latter might, of course, determine the choice during next bifurcations to a certain extent. The etiologic role for UVR is further considered to be of crucial importance when the CPLES is reached at DNA replication within premalignant melanocytes (phase IV or 4th bifurcation). The new 7-phase melanoma model is consistent and introduces a new stage of 'activated naevus' between the stage 1 ('acquired melanocytic naevus') and stage 2 ('melanocytic naevus with persistent architectural atypia') within the 6-stage model by Nathanson (1988).","Carcinogenesis; Malignant melanoma; Models; Thermodynamics; UVR","article; cancer invasion; cell ultrastructure; dna replication; human; human cell; malignant transformation; melanocyte; melanoma; skin carcinogenesis; thermodynamics; ultraviolet radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030886156

DESIGN: The rats were infused for 28d (osmotic minipumps) with oleoyl-estrone in liposomes (Merlin-2) at a dose of 3.5 mmol/day·kg. SUBJECTS: Lean (L) and obese (O) Zucker rats. MEASUREMENTS: Body weight changes. Oxygen consumption, body composition (water, lipid, protein), nitrogen balance, plasma chemistry. RESULTS: Treatment resulted in loss of body weight: 12.0% (28g) L, 9.4% (34g) O, mainly due to fat: 37.5% (10.8g) L, 11.7% (15.5g) O and water, preventing further increases in body weight and fat storage. Untreated rats increased their body weight: 10.5% (24g) L, 32.2% (101g) O and lipid stores: 20.3% (5.9g) L, 39.8% (49.0g) O, making the differences more marked. On day 28, glucose levels were maintained in all groups; in L, triacylglycerols increased and total cholesterol decreased; O showed no changes in plasma composition. In all rats, food intake decreased with treatment, and heat production (oxygen consumption) was unchanged (L) or slightly decreased (O). Energy expenditure per unit of fat-free mass remained unchanged. Protein balance was maintained in all groups; slimming was achieved without loss of body protein. CONCLUSION: Treatment of genetically obese rats with oleoyl-estrone in liposomes (Merlin-2) results in sustained loss of body weight-mainly lipid, sparing protein-for up to 28d, essentially preventing further increase in body weight and accumulation of lipid and protein. This is achieved through lower food intake and relatively small changes (if any) in energy expenditure.","Appetite; Body weight; Energy balance; Energy expenditure; Nitrogen balance; Obesity; Oleoyl-estrone; Slimming; Zucker fa/fa rat","cholesterol; estrone derivative; estrone oleate; glucose; lipid; lipoprotein; liposome; merlin 2; nitrogen; protein; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; water; animal experiment; animal model; article; blood chemistry; body composition; body fat; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; energy expenditure; female; food intake; glucose blood level; lipid composition; lipid storage; nitrogen balance; nonhuman; obesity; osmotic minipump; oxygen consumption; priority journal; protein content; rat; thermogenesis; triacylglycerol blood level; water content; weight reduction; Animalia; Falco columbarius",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030882622

In terms of physics, for humans a proof for the occurence and quantitative relevance of this phenomenon in vivo and under physiological conditions has been missing until now. In addition to the large amount of plausible, but inconclusive information about elasticity in humans and animals, we describe a simple experiment to prove the existence of quantitatively relevant elastic energy storage in the human locomotor apparatus. Ten volunteers (5 female, 5 male) each assumed a relaxed, upright posture on a steel platform. After the release of a support, the volunteers and the platform fell for a defined distance of 33 mm. Loaded with the volunteers, the platform fell significantly (p < 0.001) faster than predicted by the laws of stiff body mechanics (50 vs. 82 ms). For a minimum time of 50 ms, the human locomotor apparatus is able to support an average external power output of more than 400 W by means of an energy transfer of more than 20 J. During the fall, no EMG activities of the ankle flexors could be recorded. We conclude that the acceleration of the platform fall is induced by elastic elements serving as energy sources.

Therefore, we studied the effect of low glycogen stores on fat oxidation after a switch from a reduced-fat diet to a high-fat diet. Twelve healthy, nonobese males and females (age: 22 ± 1 yr, body mass index: 21.0 ± 0.7, maximal power output: 254 ± 11 W) consumed a reduced-fat (RF) diet (30, 55, and 15% of energy from fat, carbohydrate, and protein, respectively) three times a day at home for 3 days (days 1-3). On two occasions subjects came to the laboratory on day 3 at 1500 to perform an exhaustive glycogen-lowering exercise (EX), after which they went into the respiration chamber for a 36-h stay. On one occasion, subjects directly entered the respiration chamber at 1800 for a 36-h stay. In the respiration chamber they were given either a high-fat (HF) diet (60, 25, and 15% of energy from fat, carbohydrate, and protein, respectively) or a RF diet. In both cases they were fed at energy balance. All diets were consumed as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two or more snacks per day.

They have traditionally been cultured in very limited quantities in sulfide gradient media, where they grow as chemolithoautotrophs, forming a thin horizontal plate well below the air- agar interface. There, the facultatively chemolithoautotrophic strain MS-81- 6 quantitatively harvests the flux of sulfide diffusing from below and oxidizes it to sulfate by using oxygen as the electron acceptor. Only recently have these strains been cultivated in bulk in defined liquid media (K.D. Hagen and D.C. Nelson, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 62:947-953, 1996). In the current study, the obligately chemolithoautotrophic strain MS-81-1c was shown to have, despite much greater storage of elemental sulfur, an apparent Y(H2S) twice that of MS-81-6 when the two strains were grown in identical sulfide-limited gradient media. While the basis of this difference in energy conservation has not been established, differences in sulfur oxidation enzymes were noted. Strain MS-81-1c appeared to be able to oxidize sulfite by using either the adenosine phosphosulfate (APS) pathway or a sulfite:acceptor oxidoreductase. APS pathway enzymes (ATP sulfurylase and APS reductase) were present at relatively high and constant levels regardless of growth conditions, while the sulfite:acceptor oxidoreductase activity varied at least eight-fold, with the highest activity produced in sulfide gradient medium. By contrast, strain MS-81-6 showed no detectable activity of the APS pathway enzymes and possessed a sulfite:acceptor oxidoreductase activity just sufficient to account for its observed rate of growth in sulfide gradient medium. Freshwater strain OH-75-2a showed activity and regulation of sulfite:acceptor oxidoreductase consistent with lithotrophic energy conservation, a feature not yet proven for any freshwater Beggiatoa strain.",,"fresh water; sulfate adenylyltransferase; sulfur; article; bacterium culture; bacterium isolation; Beggiatoa; energy conservation; growth rate; marine environment; nonhuman; quantitative diagnosis; strain difference; Bacteria (microorganisms); Beggiatoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030863346

They are now perceived to protect against these consequences. This paper evaluates the evidence for this change of interpretation by considering (1) the energy content of CHOs, (2) the energetic efficiency with which they are handled by the body, and (3) their effects on appetite, relative to other macronutrients. CHOs are the least energy-dense macronutrients (ΔHc) and exhibit the greatest variability in digestibility. Doubling the usual levels of nonstarch polysaccharides (fiber) may decrease digestibility of a Western diet by 5%. De novo lipogenesis from dietary CHO is energetically inefficient but very limited on Western diets, which are relatively high in fat. There appears to be a hierarchy (protein > CHO > fat) in the extent to which the stores of the macronutrients are autoregulated by oxidation. Excess CHO intake tends to promote storage (but not de novo synthesis) of fat. The thermogenic effects of CHO are therefore relatively limited on Western diets. Per MJ of energy ingested, macronutrients differentially affect satiety (protein > CHO > fat) under conditions where fat is disproportionately energy dense. Isoenergetically dense loads of fat and CHO exert less pronounced differences on satiety. Under some conditions HC diets promote excess energy intakes. There is little evidence that a CHO-rich diet, or one with intense sweeteners, promotes spontaneous weight loss.",,"appetite; caloric intake; cancer; carbohydrate intake; conference paper; diabetes mellitus; energy balance; energy expenditure; enthalpy; human; ischemic heart disease; obesity; oxidation; satiety",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030847983

Its exceptional power and excellent thermal characteristics make it a promising choice for hybrid electric vehicle applications. The hybrid electric vehicle presents a new and unique challenge for energy storage systems. The batteries require high power for acceleration and hill climbing and good charge acceptance for regenerative braking and overall energy efficiency. Since the on board auxiliary power unit results in much lower demands for battery energy capacity, lead-acid batteries fit quite well into these performance requirements. Many of the remaining challenges involve the development of battery management systems which must function to maintain the battery pack at peak performance and achieve an economical cycle life.

A simulation program is developed to estimate the energy uncertainty from factors that would affect the scattered photon spectrum. The most significant factors are electron beam energy distribution, and the radiation detector's resolution. Simulation results indicate the total relative energy uncertainty to be around 0.25%. In addition, optical parameters are also optimized from computer codes. Moreover, energy calibration of the radiation detector is performed around 3 MeV since the maximum scattered photon energy is approximately 3.02 MeV.",,"Calibration; Carbon dioxide lasers; Codes (symbols); Computer simulation; Light scattering; Optical instrument lenses; Optimization; Photons; Radiation detectors; Storage rings; Electron beam energy measurement; Laser Compton scattering; Scattered photon energy; Electron beams",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030822449

The effect of the collector inclination angle, collector area and storage volume was examined for all systems, and various climatic conditions and their payback period was calculated. It was found that the collector inclination angle does not have a significant effect on system performance. Large collector areas have a diminishing effect on the system's overall efficiency. The increase in storage volume has a detrimental effect for small daily load volumes, but a beneficial one when there is a large daily consumption. Solar energy was found to be truly competitive when the conventional fuel being substituted is electricity, and it should not replace diesel oil on pure economic grounds. Large daily load volumes and large collector areas are in general associated with shorter payback periods.

Seven groups of young male Buffalo rats (11-21 rats/group) were given free access to semipurified diets containing different amounts of corn and/or olive oils. Four other groups (7-11 rats/group) were 30% energy-restricted. Each experiment included periods for rat growth and plasma lipid stabilization (6 wk), measurement of mean daily arterial blood plasma fatty acid concentrations (3 wk), surgical implantation of a subcutaneous tissue- isolated hepatoma 7288CTC, tumor growth and harvest (2-4 wk). Linoleic + arachidonic acid (P = 0.007) and oleic acid (P = 0.002) concentrations in arterial blood plasma were increased as dietary intake of linoleic and oleic acids was increased, respectively. In rats given free access to food, tumor growth was directly dependent on the plasma concentrations of linoleic (P < 0.001) and arachidonic acids (P = 0.04). Tumor growth in energy-restricted rats was dependent only on the linoleic acid concentration (P = 0.008). Energy restriction itself caused a growth inhibition independent of plasma linoleic acid. The linoleic acid and total fatty acid concentrations of tumor triacylglycerols were directly dependent on the plasma linoleic acid concentration in rats given free access to food (P = 0.009). Hepatoma 7288CTC (both in vivo and during perfusion in situ) supported a dose-dependent conversion (P < 0.001) of plasma linoleic acid to the mitogen, 13-hydroxy- 9,11-octadecadienoic acid.

The following experiment was undertaken to determine whether the type of dietary fat could influence fat storage and whether voluntary exercise could prevent diet-induced obesity in mice fed high fat diets. Sixty-nine 6-wk-old female mice were fed one of three diets: low fat (11.5% of energy from fat), beef fat (40.8% of energy from fat) or canola oil (40.8% of energy from fat). In each diet group, 13 mice had free access to activity wheels in their cages (exercising), and the remaining 10 mice were housed in standard mouse cages (nonexercising). Body weight and body composition were measured before and after 8 wk of treatment. The nonexercising mice fed beef fat weighed more and had significantly more body fat (23.2 ± 2.5 9/100 g body wt) than mice fed the low fat or canola oil diet (13.9 ± 1.7 and 16.8 ± 1.9 g/100 g body wt, respectively). Voluntary exercise did not affect lean body mass but did result in significantly lower body fat in all diet groups (beef, 12.6 ± 0.9; low fat, 7.4 ± 0.6; canola oil, 9.6 ± 1.4 9/100 g body wt). The amount of body fat of mice fed the monounsaturated canola oil was significantly less than that of mice fed the beef fat diet, suggesting that the type of fat as well as the amount of fat influences body fat stores. Furthermore, voluntary exercise decreased body fat in all mice and prevented diet-induced obesity in mice fed diets high in fat.","Dietary fat; Exercise; Mice; Obesity","vegetable oil; animal experiment; article; body fat; cardiovascular disease; diabetes mellitus; exercise; fat intake; lean body weight; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; physical activity; Animalia; Brassica napus var. napus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030800810

Within this framework, a new set-up for measuring the electron energy is described: CO2-laser light is scattered in a head-on collision with the electron beam in the electron storage ring and the backscattered photons are measured with an energy-calibrated high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector. The exact energy and shape of the high energy edge of the measured Compton spectrum can then be used to determine the electron energy and also the electron beam energy spread and related storage ring parameters. Moreover, at BESSY I, we have the unique possibility of measuring the electron energy by the alternative method of resonant spin depolarization.

For optimal use of the isolated hepatocytes, methods are needed to preserve the hepatocytes while maintaining their viability, metabolic and transport functions. Until now, little has been known about the maintenance of the drug metabolism capacity and energy state, measured by the so-called energy charge (ATP+1/2ADP)/(ATP+ADP+AMP), in hepatocytes after storage in University of Wisconsin cold storage solution (UW). Consequently, we investigated whether UW, originally designed to preserve organs for transplantation, was suitable for preservation of isolated rat hepatocytes with respect to the maintenance of drug metabolism and levels of energy-rich substrates. Methods: Viability of the isolated rat hepatocytes was determined by trypan blue exclusion, ATP content and energy charge after 24 and 48 h of storage in UW at 0°C. Phase I and II metabolic functions of the cells were studied by measuring the cytochrome P450 content and the metabolic rate of lidocaine and 7-ethoxycoumarin. Results: During 48 h of storage of hepatocytes in UW both phase I and phase II metabolism are preserved at control levels. After storage, the viability of the hepatocytes was not changed significantly, and the cells maintained proper cellular ATP content and overall energy charge. Conclusions: These results imply that hepatocytes from a single isolation can be stored in UW solution and used for metabolism experiments for 3 consecutive days, allowing a reduction in the use of experimental animals.","7-Ethoxycoumarin; Drug metabolism; Hepatocytes; Lidocaine; Short-term preservation; UW","lidocaine; University of Wisconsin solution; animal cell; article; cell metabolism; cryopreservation; culture medium; energy metabolism; liver cell; liver preservation; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030759992

Unfortunately, the battery usually determines the duration of life of these devices, while technical problems occur infrequently. Replacement due to battery exhaustion requires surgical procedures and accounts for up to one-third of all pacemakers sold. Attempts to provide unlimited power support using radio transmission, nuclear energy, etc., did not gain clinical acceptance. We therefore evaluated the potential role of a microgenerator (designed for use in wrist watches) to recharge pacemaker batteries. We used the EPSON-SEIKO Caliber 5M22 that uses a 'Gold-Cap' for energy storage. The mass of the actuator is 1.6 g and an angle of > 10°is needed to overcome friction. Output at a rotor frequency of 200 Hz is 1.8 mW. To measure the power provided, various experiments were made with the microgenerator taped to the chest of a normal person working in an office. A typical wearing experiment over a working day resulted in 0.9 to 6.1 μW. By taking a bridge rectifier into account, 12.2 μW were delivered. The demands of a pacemaker are 34.3 μW. Thus, this commercially available, yet not optimized microgenerator provides already approximately one-third of the power requirements of a pacemaker, making a 'lifetime warranty' for implanted devices a possibility for the future.","Battery; Defibrillator; Energy; Pacemaker","article; artificial heart pacemaker; defibrillator; energy; futurology; human; implantation; power supply; priority journal; pump",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030759659

The subjects were 16 healthy younger and older women. Fat oxidation was determined by indirect calorimetry before and after consumption of four different test meals consumed ≤ 5 d apart. The intervention meals contained 0, 1046, 2092, or 4184 kJ (simulating extended fasting, and consumption of a snack, a small meal, and a moderately large meal, respectively), with 35% of energy from fat. The duration of each measurement was the amount of time required for postprandial energy expenditure to return to the premeal fasting value. A total of 96 measurements were obtained, including duplicates for all meal sizes in the younger women (in the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle). Total postprandial fat oxidation increased in proportion to meal size in the younger subjects, but did not increase above that for the 2092-kJ meal in the older women. In addition, older subjects had significantly lower total fat oxidation after consumption of the 4184-kJ meal (781 compared with 1029 kJ/measurement, P < 0.02) and also significantly greater fat deposition (745 compared with 464 kJ/measurement, P < 0.02). These findings suggest that, relative to younger women, older women have a reduced ability to oxidize dietary fat when they consume large meals.","Age; Body composition; Dietary fat; Energy intake; Energy metabolism; Fat oxidation; Women","adult; aged; article; body composition; controlled study; energy expenditure; fat intake; female; human; human experiment; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; normal human; postprandial state; test meal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030759170

Ranges are systematic and may be related to the stage of development of the magma conduit system. Kilauea, which is in its shield-building phase, yields relatively shallow storage estimates. Loihi and Mauna Kea, which are in the early and late stages of volcano growth, respectively, yield deeper storage estimates. Shallowest depth estimates at Loihi and Mauna Kea are similar to estimates of elastic plate thickness, suggesting that the mechanical behavior of the lithosphere, rather than density contrasts at the Moho, regulates magma delivery. Apparently, a large increase in fracture energy below the brittle-ductile transition inhibits transport at depth, whereas magma transport by fracture propagation is rapid through the brittle lithosphere. Some shallow depth estimates at Kilauea support the hypothesis that the strength of the unbuttressed southeast flank influences magma storage. Kilauea transport depths correlate with an eruption sequence, which illustrates a top-to-bottom emptying of the conduit system. Successively deeper reservoirs at Kilauea were tapped within 300 days, indicating that magma is stored at a range of depths, including in the mantle, rather than at a single level within the lithosphere.",,"Silicate minerals; Volcanoes; Brittle ductile transitions; Conduit systems; Fracture propagation; Liquid equilibria; Magma transport; Mechanical behavior; Shallow depths; Thermobarometry; Elastic plate; Magma storage; Electric conduits; barometry; brittle fracture; fracture propagation; lithospheric structure; magma chamber; transport process; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Kilauea; geothermobarometry; magma transport; P/T conditions; Hawaii; Kilauea; Loihi Seamount; Mauna Kea; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030755685

After uptake of sorbitol and sucrose the growing fruit steadily accumulates fructose and sucrose, while the starch level reaches a peak about halfway through fruit development. Fructose accumulation in the fruit correlated positively with the activity of sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH). Concomitantly with transient partitioning of carbon to starch, the activities of the enzymes sucrose synthase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) also increased. Activities of phosphofructophosphotransferase (PFP), phosphofructokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) did not correlate with the rise in starch content, but increased during the phase of starch degradation. Invertase activity did not correlate with starch formation either. Acid invertase peaked in very young fruit, while neutral invertase showed a maximum in older fruit. These results are an indication that starch is synthesized primarily through a precursor derived from the sucrose synthase pathway. When fruit-bearing wood was girdled during the period of active starch synthesis to interrupt phloem import, sucrose and sorbitol adjusted to 20-30 % lower levels. Fructose concentration was not affected and starch level decreased continuously, with a concomitant rise in glucose content. Sucrose content decreased initially but increased again during the latter part of the observation period, indicating de novo sucrose synthesis from starch. After blocking external C-supply, starch became the alternative C-source, supplying hexoses for sucrose synthesis and storage. Moreover, girdling led to an increase in the activities of hexokinase, fructokinase, PFP, and pyruvate kinase. From these findings it seems likely that girdling activates glycolysis as a means of meeting the increased energy required to synthesize sucrose or to compensate for the loss of reduction equivalents, i.e. NADH, produced in the oxidation of sorbitol by SDH. Since interruption of the assimilate supply also led to a decrease in SDH and neutral invertase activity, it is suggested that gene expression of these two enzymes might be sugar regulated.","Apple fruit; Carbohydrate storage; Carbon partitioning; Pyrus malus; Sorbitol and sucrose catabolism; Starch synthesis","Malus sylvestris; Malus x domestica; Pyrus; Pyrus communis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030755116

Shell blistering attributed to the burrowing activities of Boccardia knoxi infestations occurred over the second summer of growth after the hanging out of spat at the study sites in December 1993. The infestation period was consistent with a spring dispersive phase of B. knoxi larvae. After 13 mo of suspension, the proportion of oysters containing shell blisters was significantly greater at 6- to 12-m depth than near the water surface, which was attributed to the increased shell growth at the surface. Up to 57% of the oysters contained shell blisters, and 17% were unsuitable for the half-shell trade. In a separate experiment, oyster spat were subjected to increasing periods of intertidal storage or 'hardening' in order to optimize growth rates and condition of subsequent subtidal cultivations. Spat were stunted by two methods: intertidal hardening and storage in a recirculating tank assumed to be food limited. Spat from each treatment were transferred to two growout sites in the Marlborough Sounds at monthly intervals over 9 mo. Spat stunting up to 9 mo had no significant effect on the minimum size of harvest within each site. After 9 mo of hardening, intertidally stunted spat grew significantly larger than spat stunted in a tank. Increased duration of stunting produced increased subtidal growth, with an almost doubling of growth rates between 1 and 10 mo of stunting. Stunting method or period had no significant effect on condition index or the derivative dry meat and dry shell weights at each site. Strong intersite differences in growth and condition were attributed to hydrodynamic factors. The progressive increase in growth rates with increasing stunting period indicated that the energy-compensatory and energy-conserving mechanisms developed intertidally by Crassostrea gigas spat increased with time. Because these adaptive mechanisms were also manifest in submerged spat fed on a limited diet, they appeared to be controlled by food limitation rather than by discontinuous feeding patterns present in the intertidal. An annual crop rotation is suggested for areas prone to B. knoxi, and spat stunting for optimal periods can be used to optimize subtidal growth and condition, thus reducing the growout time and avoiding fouling and spionid infestations.","Aquaculture; Boccardia; Crassostrea gigas; Pacific oyster; Paraboccardia; Polydora; Shell blisters; Spionid polychaete; Spionidae; Subtidal","oyster culture; parasitic diseases; pest infestation; shell blistering; spat; spat growth; spat stunting; subtidal production; vermifuge; water depth; New Zealand, South Island, Marlborough Sounds; Bivalvia; Boccardia; Boccardia knoxi; Crassostrea gigas; Polychaeta; Polydora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030747839

Prior analyses had suggested that the slow market development has resulted from reluctance to make the necessary investments on the part of both suppliers and customers. In order to confirm this and other concerns over the utility energy storage market, an assessment has been performed to estimate the potential penetration of batteries into regulated electric utilities. The estimates thus obtained confirm that the possible market for batteries on the utility side of the meter, approximately $280 million annually in 2010, is indeed smaller than indicated by the assessment of potential opportunities had suggested it might be. On the other hand, the estimates for possible market penetration on the customer side of the meter are greater than on the utility-side, particularly in the nearer-term. Of more importance than the numeric results, however, are the comments given by potential customers of utility battery energy storage, and the conclusions regarding ways to increase the attractiveness of utility battery energy storage that result from analyses of these comments.",,"Electric utilities; Energy storage; Estimation; Marketing; Battery energy storage; Customers; Market feasibility study; Regulated electric utilities; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030733752

The glucose concentration was kept constant, whereas the nitrogen concentration was gradually decreasing; i.e., the conditions were changed from glucose and energy limitation to nitrogen limitation and energy excess. This experimental setup enabled the glycolytic rate to be separated from the growth rate. There was an extensive uncoupling between anabolic energy requirements and catabolic energy production when the energy source was present in excess both aerobically and anaerobically. To increase the catabolic activity even further, experiments were carried out in the presence of 5 mM acetic acid or benzoic acid. However, there was almost no effect with acetate addition, whereas both respiratory (aerobically) and fermentative activities were elevated in the presence of benzoic acid. There was a strong negative correlation between glycolytic flux and intracellular ATP content; i.e., the higher the ATP content, the lower the rate of glycolysis. No correlation could be found with the other nucleotides tested (ADP, GTP, and UTP) or with the ATP/ADP ratio. Furthermore, a higher rate of glycolysis was not accompanied by an increasing level of glycolytic enzymes. On the contrary, the glycolytic enzymes decreased with increasing flux. The most pronounced reduction was obtained for HXK2 and ENO1. There was also a correlation between the extent of carbohydrate accumulation and glycolytic flux. A high accumulation was obtained at low glycolytic rates under glucose limitation, whereas nitrogen limitation during conditions of excess carbon and energy resulted in more or less complete depletion of intracellular storage carbohydrates irrespective of anaerobic or aerobic conditions. However, there was one difference in that glycogen dominated anaerobically whereas under aerobic conditions, trehalose was the major carbohydrate accumulated.

In contrast to the detector bit error rate, the sector error rate is the probability of at least one bit error in a sector of N bits, after application of an error correcting code (ECC). Due to error propagation, the DFE produces long error bursts that exceed the typical correcting capabilities of hard disk drive ECC systems. We characterize this impairment in terms of the loss in recording density. We propose new optimization criteria that limit the energy of the DFE feedback filter, slightly increasing the probability of a burst error but greatly decreasing the probability of an uncorrectable burst. The constrained DFE regains 75% of the density lost to error propagation. Alternatively, the constraint provides up to 5 orders-of-magnitude in SER margin on a Lorentzian channel at a density of PW50 = 3.0 T.",,"Bit error rate; Communication channels (information theory); Decision theory; Error correction; Hard disk storage; Magnetic filters; Magnetic recording; Optimization; Probability; Decision feedback equalizer (DFE); Error correcting code (ECC); Lorentzian channel; Sector error rate (SER); Equalizers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030714480

This allows rapid solution to the contact problem. The solution scheme is shown to be stable as each iteration reduces the energy stored in the system. Worked examples are given.

The franchise system would also permit local governments and citizens to demand and pay for more risk reduction than provided by the federal government.

The extent of these benefits depend greatly on how the capacitors are placed and controlled on the system. Presented in this paper is a methodology to solve the capacitor control problem based on the substation load measurements e.g. monthly load data. The ac power flow equations are used to account for the losses in the feeder and scale the estimated loads using the Linear Factor Approach. AC power flow is then used to determine the losses for the case of pure real loads; as if all the reactive components are neutralized by capacitors. The possible maximum loss reduction and savings for the maximum and average load levels are therefore determined. The loads are then grouped depending on a user defined savings sacrifice, called as savings sacrifice factor. This is done to reduce the number of data files so that the number of capacitor switchings are minimized without significant sacrifice in savings. A computer program is developed using this methodology and used to analyze the capacitor control problem in a radial test feeder.",,"Computer aided analysis; Computer programming; Electric load management; Electric losses; Electric power distribution; Electric power factor; Electric substations; Reactive power; Switching networks; Voltage control; Capacitor sizing; Savings sacrifice factor; Capacitor storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030711214

Lab., PO Box 999, Richland, WA 99352, United States","The demands imposed by the variability of wind power input have pushed the technical performance and cost requirements for energy storage to the forefront. In principle, wind turbine generators can be integrated with almost any kind of energy storage technology. However, the most appropriate energy storage system depends on the system size and the type of energy being delivered. Because most commercial wind turbines are designed to deliver electrical power, the vast majority of systems that do incorporate energy storage use batteries. Large scale systems using batteries have not been shown to be viable. Up to now, most efforts and successes in reliably and economically integrating storage with wind turbine generators have been concerned with relatively small power plants, less than about 1 kW. Very small wind/storage systems, where the wind turbine is dedicated to charging conventional lead-acid batteries, currently dominate the market for wind power/energy storage hybrid power systems. These systems are well developed and proven. So-called 'village scale' hybrid power generation systems using energy storage (about 5 kW to 100 kW capacity) are now the subject of considerable product development and commercialization. The key technical problem for off-grid or stand-alone wind power systems of this size that must deliver well-regulated (i.e. high quality) AC power may well be to implement the most reliable and cost effective short term and highly responsive energy storage systems (on the scale of 1 second to 10 minutes). Such storage schemes must respond effectively to the wind power fluctuations and the load demand fluctuations to maintain network stability. Pumped hydro and underground compressed air storage will probably find some applications in larger scale wind power plants where they can work with the wind power plant to deliver baseload power to the grid, however the number of applications for these systems is limited because of the specific geological and geographical requirements of the storage devices. Furthermore such plants are enormously capital intensive and are usually competing with conventional power plants on well-integrated regional and national grids in developed countries. Therefore projects of this type are unlikely to move forward until the economics are compelling to investors and lenders. Technical feasibility is not an issue. Configuring the best hybrid wind power system for a given application is difficult. The existing load demand characteristics and expected long-term load and the wind resource must be well characterized and understood before a system can be designed. The need for energy storage will be determined through the process of system configuration analysis after these data have been acquired. Because of the high costs associated with customized designs, wind storage hybrid power systems will likely only see broader application in village scale and larger systems when 'packaged' standardized designs are available and proven. The very simple micro-scale wind battery systems, of which hundreds of thousands are deployed, are an example of the effect of a standardized design 'package' on market penetration. Flywheels, high pressure hydraulic storage and ultra-capacitors could play a significant role in commercial systems as short term storage for power and load levelling. High penetration no storage systems may be a viable solution for larger scale off-grid applications where the cost of conventional large-scale storage (such as batteries) is prohibitive. Wind/storage hybrid systems and other renewable hybrid power plants can be very complex. Experience to date shows that overcomplicated systems will fail to perform satisfactorily. Simple, robust designs, combined with good training and a good inventory of spare parts and tools, are a necessity for successful stand-alone power systems.","Energy storage; Hybrid power systems; Off-grid power systems; Wind energy storage","Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Hybrid power generation systems; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030708348

The research began in 1982 and has, with some funding hiatuses, continued to the present time. The DOE programme objectives were to define a cost-effective, environmentally acceptable phase change material (PCM), and methods of incorporating the PCM into building materials (e.g., concrete, plasterboard) for applications in residential heating and cooling for energy conservation. The DOE programme goals have been achieved through defining and developing a series of linear crystalline alkyl hydrocarbon phase change materials that are commercially available from polymerization of ethylene and from by-products of petroleum refining. These PCMs are preferred over their nearest alternatives for home heating and cooling and several other applications as well. Additionally, methods of 'containing' the PCM in soft, conformable dry powders of PCM/silica, and in pellets of high density polyethylene, and by absorbing into the porous matrices (e.g., plasterboard, concrete) that effectively solves problems of PCM leakage, volume changes in melting and freezing, heat transfer, flammability, etc. were defined. However, with private industry funding, the research was broadened to include PCMs that use the solid-to-liquid phase change of water (at 0°C) and the liquid-to-gas transition (at 100°C), for uses at these specific two transition temperatures, modified composition for temperatures below 0°C and above 100°C were also developed. Besides residential heating and cooling, applications of commercial interest include; hot and cold medical therapy, hot and cold tableware service, hot and cool textile fabrics, thermal protection of flight data and cockpit voice recorders, preventing overnight freezing of bridge decks, and preventing the overnight freezing of citrus tree trunks. Commercialization of the PCM technology for all the uses listed above is in progress in the United States and Japan. Sixteen US patents, plus several equivalent foreign patents have been obtained. The results have also been published in many journal and special reports.","Energy storage in thermal and heating applications; Phase change materials (PCMs); Thermal energy storage","Building materials; Energy conservation; Phase transitions; Phase change materials; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030708346

This paper presents a method for encoding an external address bus which lowers its activity and, thus, decreases the energy. This method relies on the locality of memory references. Since applications favor a few working zones of their address space at each instant, for an address to one of these zones only the offset of this reference with respect to the previous reference to that zone needs to be sent over the bus, along with an identifier of the current working zone. This is combined with a modified one-hot encoding for the offset. An estimate of the area and energy overhead of the encoder/decoder are given; their effect is small. The approach has been applied to two memory-intensive examples, obtaining a bus-activity reduction of about 2/3 in both of them. Comparisons are given with previous methods for bus encoding, showing significant improvement.",,"Decoding; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Encoding (symbols); Storage allocation (computer); Address bus; Memory references; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030706329

Using an original calorimetric device that allows the computation of the background metabolism (energy expenditure free from the cost of locomotor activity), we assessed the effect of a microinjection of NPY upon the quantitative (background metabolism thermic effect of food) and qualitative (respiratory quotient) components of energy metabolism. NPY was injected into the juxtafornical hypothalamus at a dose that promotes feeding behavior (1 μg/0.5 μL) and enhances locomotor activity. Although total metabolism was increased proportionally to locomotion, no effect of NPY an background metabolism was observed when no food was available.

The discrete wavelet transform, a multiresolution technique, has the properties of entropy reduction and energy concentration in high frequency subimages. Scalar quantizer is applied to the high frequency components since those histograms can be modelled to the generalized Gaussian distribution. These subimages with small relative energy can be dropped entirely to compensate the compression ratio if the optimal scalar quantization is adopted. An innovative approach, named as revised run-length coding, is proposed to improve the compression performance. The idea of this approach is to represent the appearance of symbols of run-length codes in exponential expression for saving the storage in bits. One coding method, differential pulse coded modulation, is introduced to reduce the entropy of the lowest frequency subimage performed after the discrete wavelet transform and to achieve the high compression effect losslessly. The experimental results are compared with some well-known methods, for example, JPEG, (entropy constrained) vector quantization, fractal-based compression method and wavelet with variable-length coding.",,"Codes (symbols); Image coding; Pulse code modulation; Signal to noise ratio; Wavelet transforms; Discrete wavelength transforms (DWT); Revised run length coding (RRLC); Scalar quantization; Image compression",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030700178

In eight strips of uniform dimension from guinea pig lung, we assessed the storage (G') and loss (G'') moduli by using pseudorandom length oscillations containing a specially designed set of seven frequencies from 0.07 to 2.4 Hz at baseline, during methacholine (MCh) challenge, and after death of the interstitial cells. Measurements were made at mean forces of 0.5 and i g and strain amplitudes of 5, 10, and 15% and were repeated 12 h later in the same, but nonviable samples. The results were interpreted using a linear viscoelastic model incorporating both tissue damping (G) and stiffness (H). The G' and G'' increased linearly with the logarithm of frequency, and both G and H showed negative strain amplitude and positive mean force dependence. After MCh challenge, the G' and G'' spectra were elevated uniformly, and G and H increased by <15%. Tissue stiffness, strain amplitude, and mean force dependence were virtually identical in the viable and nonviable samples. The G and hence energy dissipation were ~10% smaller in the nonviable samples due to absence of actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling. We conclude that the connective tissue network may also dominate parenchymal mechanics in the intact lung, which can be influenced by the tone or contraction of interstitial cells.","Collagen-elastin matrix; Cross bridge; Elastic modulus; Hysteresivity; Nonlinearity","collagen; elastin; methacholine; animal tissue; article; connective tissue; guinea pig; hysteresis; lung mechanics; lung parenchyma; male; nonhuman; nonlinear system; priority journal; viscoelasticity; young modulus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030699093

With adequate prime electrical power, available from a thermal engine driven generator, the above systems were smaller in size than alternative rotating machine based systems, and can sustain rapid fire as long as they have projectiles. These systems also have the advantage of modular construction, allowing the components to be placed wherever there is space available in the tank. This resulted in a majority of the system being capable of being placed in the tank turret, which had the advantage of an easy coupling of the gun pulser to the gun breech.

The spreadsheet uses an iterative approach to maximize the landscape area which can be supported by a given catchment area and the design rainfall. The traditional mass curve analysis was found inadequate in determining optimal storage size because of temporal variations in rainwater supply and water demand of residential landscape. A total saving of 0.73 million dollars per year is expected for the City of Thunder Bay when the majority of households are participating in the rainwater usage for irrigation of residential landscape. Such savings do not include any of the anticipated environmental benefits. Additionally, there would be other benefits such as the reduction in chemicals and energy used in the water treatment processes, the reduction in pollutants being discharged to receiving waters, and the decrease in peak loads and flow rates in city mains. Harvesting rainwater to meet or supplement garden and lawn irrigation is a simple process which is becoming a viable solution in sustaining future water resources.",,"Harvesting; Irrigation; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Rain; Water; Water distribution systems; Rainwater; Water tanks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030689136

IRAM architectures, which combine DRAM and a processor on the same chip in a DRAM process, are more energy efficient than conventional systems. The high density of DRAM permits a much larger amount of memory on-chip than a traditional SRAM cache design in a logic process. This allows most or all IRAM memory accesses to be satisfied on-chip. Thus there is much less need to drive high-capacitance off-chip buses, which contribute significantly to the energy consumption of a system. To quantify this advantage we apply models of energy consumption in DRAM and SRAM memories to results from cache simulations of applications reflective of personal productivity tasks on low power systems. We find that IRAM memory hierarchies consume as little as 22% of the energy consumed by a conventional memory hierarchy for memory-intensive applications, while delivering comparable performance. Furthermore, the energy consumed by a system consisting of an IRAM memory hierarchy combined with an energy efficient CPU core is as little as 40% of that of the same CPU core with a traditional memory hierarchy.",,"Buffer storage; Computer simulation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hierarchical systems; Microprocessor chips; Random access storage; Intelligent random access storage (IRAM); Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030685589

Braker Lane, Suite 200, Austin, TX 78759-5329, United States","Although the development of technologies associated with electric weapons and other high power loads has proceeded for over a decade, the impact of their integration has largely focused on assumptions that sufficient prime power or energy storage would be included in the vehicle to allow the weapon and vehicle propulsion systems to operate completely independently. These assumptions have historically been appropriate for conventional weapon systems, and have resulted in a traditional isolation of weapon system and mobility system performance requirements. The advent of electric drive, electric weapons, and associated power bus technologies has provided a motivation for reexamining the generation and distribution of power and energy in the combat vehicle. The result of this paradigm shift has been the concept of an allelectric combat vehicle with electrical power generated at one or more central points and distributed in a shared manner to all of the vehicle loads. This power sharing would allow each subsystem to be capable of very high performance without the burden of having its own complete power system. Energy stored in the weapon system, for instance, could be used to augment the mobility performance. Likewise, regenerative braking from the wheels or track could provide energy to the weapon system. Quantifying these benefits in power system performance, however, requires a rather detailed look at the duty cycles expected for these systems in their actual battle environment. This paper describes initial simulations carried out for a sample all-electric combat vehicle based on a generic tank-like mission profile. Variations in prime power and pulsed energy store capacity are examined under stationary and dynamic move-andshoot conditions over a simple 30 minute mission profile, and a more complex 50 minute engagement. Results show that by sharing power between the mobility and weapons systems, the prime power required can be reduced significantly from that required by the old method of summing up the worst case loads. Further discussion for continued reduction of the power system required is also included. © 1997 IEEE.",,"Computer simulation; Dynamic loads; Electric drives; Electric energy storage; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy management; Storage battery vehicles; Tanks (military); Electromagnetic gun equipped tank vehicles; Pulsed energy storage; Electromagnetic launchers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030682374

The system is used to cool a 5800 m2 student recreation building on the University of Alabama campus in Tuscaloosa (USA). During cold weather, ambient ground water is chilled using either a cooling tower or a spray pond, and is reinjected into a water table aquifer for storage. After storage for periods of up to several months, chilled ground water is recovered for building cooling during warm weather. Measurements of water chilling, thermal energy storage and cooling performance are presented for eight years of operation. The fraction of the chill energy stored that is recovered for building cooling has ranged from 40 to 85 percent. An annual average of about 4.8 units of cooling per unit of electricity input has been measured, a value about twice that of conventional air-conditioning equipment installed at the same time. From a gross efficiency standpoint the energy performance of the system has been quite good. However, the quality of the air conditioning has suffered in late summer as chilled water temperatures become too warm to provide adequate dehumidification. Recent modifications to the system, including the addition of a large chilling capacity spray pond and additional wells, have been aimed at reducing this problem. In addition to the technical aspects of this demonstration project, economic and environmental advantages of ATES systems and obstacles that impede their more extensive use are identified. In particular, problems that have arisen with the design and implementation of the ATES system in this project are discussed. Appropriate applications of the technology, both in industrialized and in developing countries, are identified.","Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES); Energy storage; Full-scale multi-year ATES","Air conditioning; Aquifers; Energy conservation; Underground heat transfer; Multi year aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES); Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030678892

Blue and green nitride LEDs exhibit brightness levels and longevity well in excess of that required for outdoor applications. Combined with the available red LEDs, true full color all semiconductor displays can be attained for the first time. If used for traffic lights and illumination (pending further improvements in blue in some cases), these devices can outlast and outperform the incandescent light bulbs while saving precious energy. This material system is also intrinsically germane to short wavelength semiconductor lasers for increased data storage. Very recently, pulsed room temperature operation of 410 nm semiconductor lasers, the shortest wavelength ever from a semiconductor, have been reported. Nitrides are also conducive for high power devices/circuits, and sensors and detectors with applications in high temperature and unfriendly environments which leads to estimates that substantial weight savings can be achieved in aircraft and spacecraft.

One engine is a regenerative 71 kW gas turbine; the other is a hybrid power plant composed of a 15 kW gas turbine and a 7 MJ flywheel. These engines would give generally similar vehicle performance to that produced by 71 kW spark ignition and compression ignition engines. (The turbine engines would be lighter and, with a free power turbine, would have a more favourable torquespeed curve (1), giving them some advantages.) Results predict that for long-distance trips the hybrid engine would have a considerably better fuel economy and would produce lower emissions than the piston engines, and that the 'straight' gas turbine would be even better. For shorter commuting trips the hybrid would be able to run entirely from energy acquired and stored from house electricity, and it could therefore be the preferred choice for automobiles used primarily for urban driving when environmental factors are taken into account. However, the degradation of remaining energy in flywheel batteries and thermal energy in the regenerator and other engine hot parts between use periods will result in more energy being used than for the straight gas turbine engine using normal liquid fuel. The higher initial cost and greater complexity of the hybrid engine will be additional disadvantages. © IMechE 1997.","Automotive engines; Flywheel energy storage; Gas turbine engines; Highefficiency engines; Hybrid engines; Low-emission engines","Automobile engines; Flywheels; Fuel economy; Liquid fuels; Flywheel energy storage; High efficiency engines; Hybrid engines; Low emission engines; Gas turbines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030671607

We tested the hypothesis that the increase in postpubertal fat mass (FM), reflecting an alternative energy store, regulates a decrease in the capacity to store muscle glycogen. We studied Sprague- Dawley rats (n = 21) before puberty (Pre) or after puberty (at 4 mo of age) in groups that were either ad libitum fed (Post) or moderately caloric restricted (CR). FM (by 3H2O isotope dilution technique) was decreased by &gt;40% in CR compared with Post. Glucose uptake (R(d), by 18 mU · kg-1 · min-1 hyperinsulinemic clamp) was 63 ± 8 mg · kg-1 · min-1 in Pre and decreased to 39 ± 2 mg · kg 6-1 · min-1 in Post (P &lt; 0.001). However, it increased in CR to 53 ± 2 mg · kg-1 · min-1 (P &lt; 0.001 vs. Post). This increase in R(d) was mainly accounted for by an increase in glycogen synthesis (R(d) glycolysis determined by the rate of conversion of 3H-labeled glucose to 3H2O) from 23 ± 2 in Post to 33 ± 2 mg · kg-1 · min-1 in CR (P &lt; 0.001; 38 ± 7 mg · kg-1. min-1 in Pre). Correction of glycogen synthesis in CR to near-prepubertal levels was further supported by directly assayed muscle glycogen content after insulin stimulation that was 45% higher and by a 35% enhanced accumulation of [3H]glucose into glycogen. No changes in the enzyme kinetics of glycogen synthase or phosphorylase were observed. An additional group of 2-mo-old postpubertal ad libitum-fed rats was matched with CR for lean body mass but had more FM. This group demonstrated 25% lower rates of insulin-mediated glycogen synthesis compared with CR, further supporting the notion that a moderate reduction of FM prevents the decline in insulin responsiveness and glycogen synthesis occurring after puberty. These data suggest a cause- effect relationship between the increased deposition of fat and the reduced ability to store glucose in skeletal muscle after puberty.","Calorie restriction; Glycolysis; Insulin responsiveness","fat; glycogen; insulin; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; caloric restriction; controlled study; glucose intolerance; glycogen synthesis; hyperinsulinemia; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; priority journal; puberty; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030667418

These Factors are important for determining the behavior of ac motor drives during sags. Voltage unbalance and phase angle shifts cause large unbalanced source currents to, excessive voltage ripple in the dc-link, and reduced dc-link average voltage. The response of the motor and drive to these varies considerably. Experimental results clearly show the load-dependent behavior of a typical drive. The ability of the drived to ride-through a voltage sag is dependent upon the energy storage capacity of the dc-link capacitor, the speed and inertia of the load, the power consumed by the load, and the trip point settings of the drive. The control system of the drive has a great impact on the behavior of the drive during the sag and after recovery.

However, because the hit rate also increases, the number of main memory accesses decreases and thus the power consumed by a memory access decreases. Recent papers which consider the power consumption of caches tend to ignore hit rates. This is unfortunate, because it is undesirable to have energy-efficient caches which are also very slow. Hit rates also play a key role in truly evaluating the energy efficiency of a cache, because low hit rates lead to more frequent main memory accesses which consume more power than cache accesses.",,"Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hierarchical systems; Mathematical models; Storage allocation (computer); Energy efficient caches; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030657216

Dynamic programming was used to obtain the optimal control trajectories which minimized an integrated energy and demand cost function for both the daily and monthly simulations. In addition to leading to simple heuristics, the monthly optimal control results were used as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of both conventional and the new control strategy. For a range of partial-storage systems, load profiles, and utility rate structures, the monthly electrical costs for the rule-based control strategy were, on average, within about 3% of the optimal costs. In contrast, the monthly electrical costs associated with the most common conventional control strategy, chiller-priority control, were as much as 20% greater than optimal, whereas a simple storage-priority strategy yielded costs that were within about 6% of optimal. The rule-based strategy can be easily implemented within a small micro-processor controller and only requires measurements of the system cooling requirement, building electrical usage, and state-of-charge of storage.",,"Computer simulation; Cooling systems; Costs; Dynamic programming; Energy utilization; Functions; Heuristic methods; Ice; Knowledge based systems; Melting; Optimal control systems; Tanks (containers); Chillers; Electrical costs; Ice storage systems; Cold storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030654014

However, since the power plant is supplying a constant power, it requires a constant `energy rate' from the storage. In order to design the storage, the modelling has to meet this particular constraint, while having a correct handling of the well to surface connections. To demonstrate the feasibility of such a project, Gaz de France has developed a new feature in its in-house multi-gas/water reservoir simulator, which already includes a reservoir to surface network coupling. In various scenarios of power plant needs, we manage to minimize the number of infill wells and to minimize the yearly injected gas quantity.

The high costs of making headwater benefits determinations prohibit the use of a complicated model in basins where the magnitude of the benefits is expected to be small. A simple alternative method, such as flow duration analysis (FDA), is needed to reduce the assessment costs. This paper evaluates the application of the FDA method for determining energy gains in these smaller basins. The standard FDA method is enhanced by (1) using an appropriate flow step in the numerical integration, (2) replacing a power-to-turbine flow ratio by a variable flow-head-efficiency relationship, and (3) expanding FDA to derive the unregulated flows based on regulated flow and reservoir storage changes. A computer model (HWBFDA) was developed to automate the process of applying the this enhanced FDA method.

Corporation, Bloomington, MN, United States","With the recent successes in the development of electro-thermal-chemical cartridge technology, the need for an advanced repetitive fire power supply has become a more nearterm problem. While capacitor banks have provided the singleshot capability necessary for optimizing charge design and the required electrical pulse shape, it is not clear that it is the best power supply for a fielded system. The primary disadvantage of the capacitor approach is the requirement for recharging the bank between shots. Conceptually, the required charging is accomplished with either a high voltage alternator and rectifier, or a battery bank which requires power conditioning (D-D converters, etc.) to achieve the required 15 to 20 kV charging voltage. In the case of the alternator-rectifier system, energy storage for multiple shots can be built into the alternator rotor (or by adding an energy storage flywheel). Since battery charging system design is typically driven by power considerations, the battery needed to perform the charging will generally store sufficient energy for several shots. In either case, the pulsed power system is composed of two distinct components: A capacitor based pulse forming network (PFN) and an energy storage/charging power supply. Rotating machines provide the advantage of combining the two functions described above into a single smaller package. Under U.S. and Marine Corps funding, the Center for Electromechanics has been developing compact, lightweight pulsed rotating machines (compensated pulsed alternators, or compulsators) for electromagnetic guns for the past 10 years. Air-core and iron-core variants of these machines have demonstrated an ability to efficiently drive low impedance pulsed loads. Other advantages of these machines over PFNs include lower operating voltages, higher burst firing rates, and the ability to store a substantial number of shots in rotor energy. In addition, a wide variety of pulse shapes are possible and the current profile can be varied from shot to shot if needed. This paper describes the important rotating machine power supply design considerations for two operational ETC missions. Aspects of energy storage for burst firing and prime power averaging, pulse shaping capabilities, and switching requirements are also discussed. © 1997 IEEE.",,"Electric current control; Electromagnetic launchers; Fire control systems; Machine design; Pulse circuits; Rotating machinery; Switching networks; Burst firing rates; Pulse forming networks (PFN); Pulsed rotating machine power supply systems; Electric power supplies to apparatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030649110

The thermodynamic performance of a single-effect absorption system alone and coupled to a liquid desiccant dehumidification system, both powered by high performance flat-plate collectors, was investigated under variable cooling load conditions. The modeling for the absorption system was based on performing heat and mass balances on each of its component while the liquid desiccant system was simulated using a cooling tower effectiveness model. A detailed heat transfer analysis was used to model the solar collector array. Systems variables were optimized as function of geographic location and maximum cooling load. Variables investigated and optimized included collectors' surface area, collectors' inclination angle, and thermal storage to collector surface area ratio. Three cities within the Caribbean were taken as a basis for this study: two in Puerto Rico, and one in Trinidad. Results for maximum cooling loads ranging from 18 to 176 kW indicate that average annual solar fractions exceeding 70 percent can be achieved at these cities for the absorption system alone as well as for the absorption/desiccant hybrid system.

The best heat leak results were obtained in laboratory test facility, showing 0.13W/kA. A spiral shaped winding method was also attempted to eliminate the eddy-current losses generated by energy storage cycles of SMES. For the Tl-1223/Ag tape, which has the greatest potential for a superconducting magnet operable at liquid nitrogen temperature, we recently developed a biaxially aligned Tl-1223 tape with a large current density of more than 105A/cm2 on {100}〈001〉 textured silver substrate by means of a spray pyrolysis method. Further technological challenges are required, in order to develop a long and thick superconducting layer that maintains the crystal alignment.",,"Applications; Bismuth compounds; Current density; Electric coils; Magnetic fields; Superconducting devices; Tapes; Superconducting tapes; High temperature superconductors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030645415

The paper presented here deals with the electrothermal accelerator (ETA) itself as the necessary plasma source. After a short description of the standard ETA and its energy storage system, the first part of the paper gives results of the experimental investigations on the plasma pulse. Since the surface modification is strongly dependent on the interaction of the target material with the impacting plasma pulse, it is important to know its characteristics. Essential parameters, such as jet velocity, dynamic pressure, pulse duration and transferred electric energy were measured. The changes of these pulse parameters were connected to the more easily controlled input parameters, such as the charging voltage and the amount of additive used for plasma seeding. This investigation helps to adjust and optimize the electrothermal accelerator more precisely to the needs of surface treatment. The second part of the paper discusses far reaching changes of the design and the operation of the ETA in order to further improve its capabilities in generating hypervelocity plasma pulses.

Lead/acid batteries are used as an energy storage device for the stand-alone photovoltaic system. Hence, monitoring the battery status of photovoltaic systems is quite important to extend the total system service life. To monitor the state-of-charge of batteries, we adopted a current interrupt technique to measure the internal resistance of the battery. The internal resistance increases at the end of charge/discharge steps and also with cycles. The specific gravity of the electrolyte was measured in relation to the state-of-charge. A home-made optical hydrometer was utilized for automatic monitoring of the specific gravity. It is shown that the specific gravity and stratification increase with cycle number.

A systematic comparison of the line profiles and continuum strength with the X-ray and radio burst data shows that the flare is a Type-I white-light flare with the following characteristics: 1) During the flare impulsive phase the central intensities of lines in different wavelengths, the continuum, the line half-widths, the red asymmetry of the wings and the hard X-ray burst at the high energy portion all reached maximum at the same time. 2) The Hα line had a half-width of 10 Å when the continuum emission reached maximum, and showed strong line reversal at the center. Hβ and Hγ also showed line reversal. 3) The five lines observed all showed clear red asymmetry, which lasted some 1 min. Based on these results, we find electron-beam bombardment, combined with chromospheric evaporation and condensation can provide a good qualitative interpretation of the energy storage and release of this white-light flare.","Spectrum analysis; The sun; White-light flare",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030640015

IRP-1 is the cytoplasmic isoform of the enzyme aconitase, and, depending on iron status, may switch between enzymatic and RNA-binding activities. IRP-1 and IRP-2 are trans-acting regulators of mRNAs involved in iron uptake, storage and utilisation. The finding of an IRE in the citric acid cycle enzymes, mitochondrial aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, suggests that the IRPs may also influence cellular energy production. These two proteins appear to bind RNAs with different but overlapping specificity, suggesting that they may regulate the stability or translation of as yet undefined mRNA targets, possibly extending their regulatory function beyond that of iron homeostasis. The interaction between the IRPs and the IRE represents one of the best characterised model systems for posttranscriptional gene control, and given that each IRP can also recognise its own unique set of RNAs, the search for new in vivo mRNA targets is expected to provide yet more surprises and insights into the fate of cytoplasmic mRNAs.",,"iron; iron regulatory factor; iron regulatory protein 1; iron regulatory protein 2; iron sulfur protein; RNA; RNA binding protein; transferrin receptor; animal; chemistry; conformation; genetics; metabolism; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; physiology; review; Animals; Base Sequence; Iron; Iron Regulatory Protein 1; Iron Regulatory Protein 2; Iron-Regulatory Proteins; Iron-Sulfur Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Receptors, Transferrin; RNA; RNA-Binding Proteins; MLCS; MLOWN",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030636370

When fecundity increases with body size, the cost to future reproduction arises through decreased growth of reproductive individuals. We investigated the effects of reproduction on aspects of survival and growth in female northern water snakes (Nerodia sipedon). We did not find a decrease in survival associated with mating despite the conspicuousness of mating aggregations, and pregnancy did not impair locomotor ability. We found evidence of a decrease in over-winter survival of reproductive females related to their emaciated state following parturition. Reproductive females grew less in length than nonreproductive females, but increased similarly in mass. Following parturition, reproductive females weighed less than in the spring, indicating that mass gain prior to parturition was invested in the litter and that most foraging occurred prior to ovulation. Captive reproductive females given food ad libitum grew in length at a rate similar to free-living reproductive females, but increased more in mass. Captive females weighed more after giving birth than in the spring, indicating that unlike that of females in the wild, some of their mass increase was due to energy storage, and also that they continued to feed after ovulation. Consistent with the prediction that smaller females would benefit more than larger females from reproducing less and growing more to increase future fecundity, we found that smaller females participated less in mating aggregations and reproduced less often.",,"Nerodia sipedon; Nerodia sipedon; body size; northern water snake; reproduction; survival",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030619801

Success in nonequilibrium environments depends in part on the ability to store energy and control its allocation during periods of extreme food limitation or outright starvation. Starvation resistance is one measure of the ability of a species to persist when energy intake s less than energy expenditure. The life-history responses of nine species of planktonic rotifers to food deprivation were compared using cohort life-table experiments. Allometric patterns of energy storage and respiration rate lead to the prediction that larger species should have greater starvation resistance than smaller species. Contrary to this prediction, when rotifers were acclimated to high resource levels and starved as young adults, body mass did not predict starvation time. Rather, there was a trade-off between survival and reproduction during starvation. Some species did not reproduce during starvation and had high starvation times (up to 5.0 d). Other species maintained or increased fecundity relative to fed controls and had low starvation times (as low as 0.4 d). Species with more rapid senescence when fed tended to have shorter starvation times. However, the interspecific trade-off between survival and reproduction remained after removing the effect of control survivorship. Differences in life-history responses to starvation may be critical in determining competitive outcome and community structure in variable environments. When acclimated to low food levels prior to food deprivation, simulating conditions of declining resource abundance in nature, rotifer starvation time decreased. Juveniles had longer starvation times than adults, further supporting the idea that allocating energy to reproduction decreases starvation resistance.","Body mass; Life history; Nonequilibrium environments; Reproduction; Rotifers; Starvation; Survival vs. reproduction trade-offs; Variable environments; Zooplankton","life history; reproduction; starvation; zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030616863

Here I propose and test two hypotheses: (1) that food-hoarding herbivores behaviorally overcome consumption limits imposed by secondary compounds by storing food until the toxins degrade; and (2) that the presence of secondary compounds in cached plant maternal facilitates the preservation of these items, as well as other cached items that lack such compounds. To evaluate these hypotheses, I conducted a number of field and laboratory experiments using the North American pika, Ochotona princeps, a generalist herbivore that consumes low-phenolic vegetation in the summer while it simultaneously collects and stores high-phenolic vegetation for subsequent consumption during winter. In experiments investigating decomposition of summer and winter diets of pikes, after 10 mo of storage, the winter diet retained 20.5% more biomass, and was higher in energy, lower in fiber, and equal in nitrogen compared to the summer diet. Moreover, a common food item in the winter diet, Acomastylis fossil, which contains high levels of phenolics, was the only plant extract tO deter bacterial growth in a bioassay. Acomastylis rossii leaves with experimentally reduced phenolic levels retained significantly less biomass than leaves with natural phenolic concentrations. However, the presence of A. fossil in artificial caches containing a low-phenolic species, Trifolium parryi, did not facilitate the preservation of T. parryi. Approximately halfway through the typical storage period, phenolic concentrations of pika winter diet samples in artificial caches decreased to levels readily consumed by pikes in their summer diet. Examination of natural haypiles of pikes before and after storage revealed that pikas do increase their intake of A. rossii from the haypile sometime during the winter. In experiments with captive pikes, pikas preferred A. rossii with experimentally reduced phenolic concentrations over those with natural concentrations. Observations of pikas foraging from natural and artificial haypiles suggested that pikas do not increase their intake of A. rossii from the haypile until phenolics levels decrease. Taken together, the results support both of the hypotheses. Pikes manipulate plant chemistry by storing plants rich in allelochemicals and by delaying consumption of these plants until the toxins decay. Moreover, plants with high levels of secondary compounds exhibit superior preservation qualities so that more biomass and nutrients are retained during storage. As food caching is a common strategy among several animal classes and many foods contain potentially deleterious compounds, the manipulation of food toxins by storage may be a prevalent phenomenon.","Bacterial inhibition; Decomposition; Ochotona princeps; Phenolics; Pikas; Plant-herbivore interactions; Toxin manipulation","Ochotona princeps; Acomastylis rossii; Fabaceae; Ochotona princeps; Trifolium parryi; caching; hoarding; phenolic; pika; plant toxin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030616842

In two experiments, female sail fin mollies (Poecilia latipinna), raised on high and low levels of food, produced neonates of similar mass and percentage of fat by varying egg size and the amount of supplemental nourishment provided to embryos as they developed. In one experiment, females displayed plasticity in ovum size, but not neonate size; females raised in a low-food and low-salinity treatment produced larger eggs than those raised on higher food levels and at higher salinity. In a second experiment, the amount of nourishment provided to embryos, in addition to that in the egg yolk, was dependent on brood size and maternal food level. Females with small broods were less matrotrophic than those with large broods; female body size and brood size were highly correlated. The brood size at which egg mass equaled neonate mass was smaller for females raised on low levels of food than for females raised on a higher food level treatment. In the second experiment, females from two populations, different from the source of fish for the first experiment, were studied and found to differ in the amount of fat stores remaining after reproduction. Females from a population with low postparturition fat stores displayed greater brood reduction during gestation (via resorption or abortion) and fewer offspring per unit mass than females from the population with more fat. In sailfin mollies, matrotrophy appears to be an adaptation that diminishes the offspring size-offspring number trade-off by permitting a reduction in ovum size and increase in fecundity without compromising neonate size. However, matrotrophic supplementation of yolk nourishment was greatest in relatively large females raised on a restricted food level. Thus, matrotrophy may incur some energetic cost that renders it inefficient for small females and for females with substantial or dependable energy reserves available for reproduction.","Energy storage; Fecundity; Lecithotrophy; Life history; Matrotrophy; Phenotypic plasticity; Poecilia latipinna; Reproductive investment; Resource availability; Scope for reproduction; Trade-off; Viviparity","Cyprinodontiformes; Poecilia; Poecilia latipinna; Poeciliidae; Poecilia latipinna; offspring provisioning; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive investment; resource availability; sailfin molly",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030613979

The crosslinking reaction followed nth order kinetics with an order of reaction of 1.8 and an apparent activation energy of 13.40-14.7 kcal/mol. HPC lends itself less readily to crosslinking with pMDI as compared to HPL. The optimum safe storage temperature was determined as -16̊C for both resins. Vitrification and damping behavior of HPL-based polyurethanes were also studied as a function of resin stoichiometry (NCO : OH). The glass transition temperature (Tg) measured at the tan δ-peak maximum and its corresponding activation energy showed a positive linear increase with increasing NCO : OH. Increasing NCO : OH was observed to cause a broadening of the tan δ peak and a decline of the tan δ peak height.

This system uses photovoltaic cells to generate electrical energy that is subsequently dissipated in multiple electric resistive heating elements. A microprocessor controller continually selects the appropriate heating elements such that the resistive load causes the photovoltaic array to operate at or near maximum power. Unlike other residential photovoltaic systems, the photovoltaic solar water heating system does not require an inverter to convert the direct current supplied by the photovoltaic array to an alternating current or a battery system for storage. It uses the direct current supplied by the photovoltaic array and the inherent storage capabilities of a residential water heater. A photovoltaic solar hot water system eliminates the components most often associated with the failures of solar thermal hot water systems.

The methodology starts with determining the number of entropy generation numbers (Ns) for a cyclic operation consisting of heat storage and retrieval processes. During the cyclic operation, the phase-change material is maintained at its melting temperature. The entropy generation number is determined as a function of the Reynolds number of the operating fluid, specific heat transfer area, operating fluid inlet temperatures during the cyclic processes and the thermo-physical properties of both the storage materials and the heat transfer fluids. A case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the model developed.

An energy balance model can be used to predict the rate of ventilation air exchange, and hence the loss of CO2 for any internal concentration. For a source of pure CO2 at a known fixed cost, an optimization routine can be used in real time to determine the CO2 set-point that will maximize the difference between the benefit and cost. If fuel burners, linked to heat storage, are used to generate the CO2, then the CO2 could be regarded as free, provided the heat can be used or stored for later use. A dummy price can be used as a basis for optimizing the distribution of the CO2 that will be generated. The dummy price should be adjusted so that the sum of the computed demands for CO2 over the rest of the day will match the total available. This procedure ensures that the CO2 is used with equal marginal benefit throughout the day and so, given a relation of diminishing returns, used to maximal effect. As an initial estimate of this dummy price, the real price of the fuel may be used. If the demand that this creates exceeds the amount needed for heating, then fuel should be burned to meet the CO2 demand alone and the heat should be stored while possible.","Dummy price; Energy balance; Model","Lycopersicon esculentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009414176

Group 1 had ad lib. access to the drinking bottle, the groups 2 and 3 were pair fed by gastric infusion, splitted up into 2 greater meals for group 2 respectively into 6 smaller meals for group 3. After adaptation all animals get an i.p. injection of doubly labelled tracer solution (200 μl) containing 2.5 mg L-[15N]leucine (72 atom% 15N) combined with either [1-14C]- or [U-14C] leucine (37kBq). The course of 14CO2 expiration was estimated by breath test over 4 h in intervals of 15 min and the course of urinary 15N excretion over 24 h in intervals of 45 resp. 90 min. An infusion of saline (0.9 %, 5 ml/h) into the vena jugularis was used to provoke sustained urine production of the animals during the experiment. From the parameters of the excretion curves of breath 14CO2 resp. urine 15N (cumulative end value) and from the N balance the portions of leucine-C and leucine-N used for protein synthesis, transamination, decarboxylation and total oxidation as well as the kinetic parameters for whole body protein metabolism were computed. The following conclusions were drawn: 6 × feeding regime produces a small but measurable amino acid economy effect in comparison to 2 × feeding regime. Protein gain for 2 × feeding group was significant smaller than for 6 × feeding group, though protein synthesis rate was higher, but was overcompensated by a greater increase of protein breakdown rate for the 2 × feeding group. Energy storage in form of fat and glycogen built from decarboxylation was unaffected by feeding frequency. The amount of leucine oxidized for heat production was 4 % higher for the 6 × feeding group. Transamination rate for leucine was estimated to 8-15 %. Absolute values for protein flux, protein synthesis and protein breakdown may be overestimated or underestimated because the metabolism of [15N] leucine does not exactly agree with that of total N; but the proportions of them and therefore also the conclusions will be true. Better results for absolute values will be obtained using a mixture of 15N labelled AA, 15N labelled protein or hydrolysate of 15N labelled protein (yeast) as the tracer source.",,"Animalia; Rattus norvegicus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0008608592

Moreover, the opinion of some experts that plutonium of any isotopic blend is a proliferation threat (Mark, 1993) has been well publicized, heightening the concern that plutonium produced in the civilian fuel cycle is itself a proliferation threat. Assuring that separated plutonium, from dismantled warheads as well as from civilian power programs, is under effective control has (again) become a high priority of U.S. diplomacy. One pole of the debate on how to manage this material is to declare it to be a waste, and to search for some way to dispose of it safely, securely, and permanently. The other pole is to view it as an energy resource and to safeguard it against diversion, putting it into active use in the civilian power program. The ultimate choice cannot be separated from the long-term strategy for use of peaceful nuclear power. Continued use of a once-through fuel cycle will lead to an ever-increasing quantity of excess plutonium - requiring safeguarding. Alternatively, recycling the world's stocks of plutonium in fast reactors, contrary to common misconception, will cap the world supply of plutonium and hold it in working inventories for generating power. Transition from the current-generation light water cooled reactors (LWRs) to a future fast-reactor-based nuclear energy supply under international safeguards would, henceforth, limit world plutonium inventories to the amount necessary and useful for power generation, with no further excess production. The IFR offers complete recycle of plutonium, and indeed, of all transuranics, with essentially no transuranics sent to waste, so the need for perpetual safeguards of Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) waste is eliminated. The pyro-recycle process is more proliferation resistant than the current plutonium-uranium extraction process (PUREX) because at every step of the IFR recycle process the materials meet the ""spent-fuel standard."" The scale of IFR recycle equipment is compatible with colocation of power reactors and their recycle facility, eliminating off-site transportation and storage of plutonium-bearing materials. Self-protecting radiation levels are unavoidable at all steps of the IFR cycle, and the resulting limitation of access contributes to making covert diversion of material from an IFR very difficult to accomplish and easy to detect. Material diverted either covertly or overtly from the IFR fuel cycle would be difficult (relative to material available by other means, such as LWR spent fuel) to process into weapons feedstock.

The observed enhancement of the like-sign correlations at low invariant masses is related to the dimensions of the hadronic source. The data are compared to different QCD models where the hadronization is performed with the string-fragmentation model. Results are presented for the first time separately for diffractive and non-diffractive scattering, in domains of four-momentum transfer, Bjorken-x, and hadronic center of mass energy, and in intervals of charged particle multiplicity.

However, only over the last ten years has major interest been manifested in commercial development of this possibility in so-called 'supercapacitors' or 'ultracapacitors' based on the large double-layer capacitance achievable at high-area, carbon powder electrodes. In parallel with the utilization of double-layer capacitance is the possibility of use of the large pseudocapacitance that is associated with e.g. electrosorption of H or metal adatoms (underpotential deposition) and especially some redox processes. Such pseudocapacitance arises when, for thermodynamic reasons, the charge q required for progression of an electrode process, e.g. electrosorption or conversion of an oxidized species to a corresponding reduced species in liquid or solid solution, is a continuous function of potential, V; then the derivative dq/dV corresponds to a capacitance but one of a Faradaic kind. This behavior is different from that with an ideal battery where, according to the Nernst equation, V is invariant with state-of-charge measured by q Various experimental examples are shown and characterized, especially that for RuO2 and other transition metal oxides. Additionally, electroactive polymers such as polyaniline exhibit analogous pseudocapacitative behavior.","Eenergy storage; Pseudocapacitance; Supercapacitors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002746162

Models based on mass and energy balances together with simple microbial kinetics have been incorporated into a commercial simulation package. The process is evaluated from raw materials through to consumption and as a result a prediction of the contribution of each individual process stage to the microbial level in the product is made. The model is a valuable tool to assist decision making on the operation of existing processes as well as in the process design of new product lines. The system output is a quantitative estimate used as a guide to identifying key process steps rather than a high precision solution to a fully defined problem. This can help to identify critical areas of a process line for which more dedicated programs and microbial kinetics can be used for a more detailed assessment. The model is thus a valuable tool for a HACCP team by providing a more quantitative basis on which to base decisions and set critical limits. The system is a framework within which various models can be combined. An initial test of the model has shown its value in identifying bottlenecks and setting limits for several processes, including both batch and continuous systems.","Food processing; Food safety; HACCP; Hygiene design; Line design; Predictive modelling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002560262

By describing the motion of a scattering particle in a viscoelastic medium in terms of a generalized Langevin equation with a memory function, we relate the time evolution of its mean-square displacement to the frequency-dependent storage and loss moduli of the medium. The utility of this technique is illustrated through the application of diffusing-wave spectroscopy to probe the viscoelastic behavior of two complex fluids. The properties of a concentrated suspension of colloidal particles interacting as hard spheres are shown to be strongly influenced by the incipient colloidal glass transition, which leads to an extended range of frequencies over which they behave like an elastic solid. Similar elasticity is observed in a compressed emulsion, resulting in this case from the additional interfacial energy of the deformed droplets. In both cases diffusing-wave spectroscopy is used to measure the frequency dependence of the storage and loss moduli, and these results are compared with those from mechanical measurements. Besides providing a purely optical method for measuring mechanical properties, this technique provides new insight into the origin of the viscoelastic behavior. © 1997 Optical Society of America.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002387837

U.S. per capita consumption of potatoes is about 61 kg/year. Potatoes also produce potentially toxic glycoalkaloids, both during growth and after harvest. Glycoalkaloids appear to be more toxic to man than to other animals. The toxicity may be due to anticholinesterase activity of the glycoalkaloids on the central nervous system and to disruptions of cell membranes affecting the digestive system and other organs. The possible contribution of glycoalkaloids to the multifactorial aspects of teratogenicity is inconclusive. Possible safe levels are controversial; guidelines limiting glycoalkaloid content of potato cultivars are currently being debated. This review presents an integrated, critical assessment of the multifaceted aspects of the role glycoalkaloids play in nutrition and food safety; chemistry and analysis; plant physiology, including biosynthesis, distribution, inheritance, host-plant resistance, and molecular biology; preharvest conditions such as soil composition and climate; and postharvest events such as effects of light, temperature, storage time, humidity, mechanical injury, sprouting inhibition, and processing. Further research needs are suggested for each of these categories in order to minimize pre- and postharvest glycoalkaloid synthesis. The overlapping aspects are discussed in terms of general concepts for a better understanding of the impact of glycoalkaloids in plants and in the human diet. Such an understanding can lead to the development of potato varieties with a low content of undesirable compounds and will further promote the utilization of potatoes as a premier food source for animals and humans.","Analysis; Chaconine; Food safety; Glycoalkaloids; Nutrition; Plant genetics; Plant molecular biology; Plant physiology; Plant-host resistance; Potatoes; Processing; Solanidine; Solanine; Solanum tuberosum; Storage","Animalia; Magnoliophyta; Solanaceae; Solanum tuberosum; Tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002108958

The energy available for melt was estimated from a surface energy-balance model using meteorological data collected by automatic weather stations on the glacier. Net radiation and the turbulent heat fluxes were calculated hourly for every grid point of a 30 m resolution digital terrain model, using the measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and radiative fluxes on the glacier. Two different bulk approaches were used to calculate the turbulent fluxes and compared with respect to their impact on discharge simulations. Discharge of Storglaciären was simulated from calculated meltwater production and precipitation by three parallel linear reservoirs corresponding to the different storage properties of firm, snow and ice. The performance of the model was validated by comparing simulated discharge to measured discharge at the glacier snout. Depending on which parameterization of the turbulent fluxes was used, the timing and magnitude of simulated discharge was in good agreement with observed discharge, or simulated discharge was considerably underestimated in one year.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001766883

It has been designed specifically for time-resolved studies of non-crystalline and fibrous materials and has been optimized for small-angle scattering measurements. The beamline operates with a SAXS resolution between 10 and about 1400 A in d spacing (at 8 keV) and has been optimized with respect to high flux at the sample [of the order of 1013 photons s""1 for 8 keV photons (2 GeV, 400 mA)]. Soon it will be possible to perform simultaneously wide-angle diffraction measurements in the dspacing range 1.2-8 A (at 8 keV). In order to allow timeresolved (resolution ~1 ms) small-angle scattering measurements, a high-power 57-pole wiggler is used as the beamline source. From its beam, one of three discrete energies, 5.4, 8 and 16keV, can be selected with a double-crystal monochromator, which contains three pairs of asymmetrically cut plane Si(lll) crystals. Downstream, the beam is focused horizontally and vertically by a toroidal mirror. Commissioning tests of this new SAXS beamline showed that all design parameters have been realized. © 1997 International Union of Crystallography all rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001739446

Because of the ease of installation and increasing capabilities of electronic controllers, operational strategies that could be programmed with these controllers are of particular interest. The objectives are concerned with the examination of various operational strategies applied to older- and newer-type commercial office buildings utilizing constant-air-volume-reheat and variable-air-volume-reheat HVAC systems, respectively. The operational strategies are night purge (NP), fan optimum start and stop (OSS), condenser water reset (CWR) and chilled water reset (CHWR). The indoor air quality requirements are met and the latest applicable energy rates from local utility companies are used for Des Moines, Iowa. The results show that, in general, NP is not an effective strategy in buildings with low thermal mass storage, OSS reduces fan energy, and CWR and CHWR could be effective for chillers with multi-stage unloading characteristics. The most energy-efficient operational strategies are the combination of OSS, CWR, and CHWR for the older-type building, and OSS for the newer-type building. Economically, the most effective is the OSS strategy for the older-type building and the CHWR strategy for the newer-type building.

This paper discusses the design of such an integrated hybrid solar-fossil combined cycle with maximum daily and nightly power outputs of 88 MWe and 58 MWe, respectively. This cycle is currently being evaluated from a technical and economic risk feasibility standpoint for possible implementation as a pilot plant in Tunisia1. This paper outlines pertinent design considerations utilized in the thermoeconomic optimization approach employed for developing the hybrid combined cycle proposed here. The approach shows that there are several advantages to this type of design when compared with a purely solar steam cycle or any of the several other hybrid solar concepts which exist today. In addition to these advantages, the design presented revolves around the definition of a number of degrees of freedom which allow the solar energy part of the cycle to be highly integrated into the conventional part. A discussion of them is given. Finally, from an environmental standpoint, the obvious advantage of this type of cycle is that due to the substitution of fossil fuel, there is a marked mitigation in CO2 and NOx emissions when compared to a conventional cycle and to other hybrid concepts. Pertinent results for these reductions are presented. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","CO2 mitigation; Hybrid solar-fossil combined cycle; Integrated solar-fossil combined cycle; Pilot plant; Solar generated electricity; Thermoeconomic optimization; Tunisia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001511406

At the heart of the system is a hybrid magnetic bearing. The bearing consists of ring and disk shaped permanent magnets, and a synthetic ruby sphere on a sapphire plate. The bearing is shown to be stable without active control. Equations of motion for the flywheel are derived in a sensor based coordinate system. The resulting equations are non-singular around the nominal operating condition and are feedback linearizable without the need for a coordinate transformation. A method of modeling rotor imbalance as a set of sinusoidal disturbances of magnitudes that do not depend on rotational speed is also presented. To reject large external disturbances active control is applied to the flywheel. Two nonlinear control laws are applied and are shown to improve the initial condition response of the inherently stable system. © 1997 ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001491208

This international collaborating research clarifies a fairly good agreement between the x-ray energy response data and our recently proposed theoretical predictions for such a semiconductor x-ray-detector response. The x-ray response for several positions on the active area of the detector unit is studied; a good uniformity observed guarantees that the detector can employ any sized and shaped collimator for the x-ray tomography regardless of any correction factor coming from the response nonuniformity on the detector active area. Operational conditions of the detector for the ASDEX Upgrade plasma diagnostics are optimized using its capacitance measurements as a function of an applied bias as well as the numerical evaluations of the detector response; these are also directly verified by the synchrotron-radiation experiments. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001237127

All complexes contain π-delocalized bidentate N + O monoanionic ligands. Their syntheses have been performed either by the metathesis reaction from CuCl or by reaction of the monoprotic ligands with Cu5Mes5 (Mes ≡ 2,4,6-Me3C6H2) in the presence of norbornadiene.

Complex 3 is the precursor, in the presence of NBD, of the photoactive monomeric species [CuL(NBD)], 9, where a single C=C binds copper(I), of which complex 7, [CuL(NBN)] [NBN = norbornene], can be regarded as a model compound. The NBD photoisomerization assisted by 3 (see 9) has been carried out in methanol by visible light irradiation (λ = 405 nm) with a photoisomerization quantum yield of 0.029. Turnover numbers (moles of Q produced/mole of photocatalyst) of ca. 5000 were obtained in this solvent. An increase of the temperature gave rise to a significative quantum yield enhancement. The other compounds were less efficient than 3 in assisting the NBD → Q photoisomerization under visible light irradiation, most probably due to the low energy of their MLCT excited states.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001232722

The geometry, in which the stockpile is sealed on all sides except the top, which is exposed to the ambient conditions, is of interest in the transport of coals in barges or in rail cars. The role of oxygen diffusion as the cause of self-heating of coal is re-examined. In previous work, it was concluded that the diffusion in a one-dimensional stockpile can lead to a maximum temperature rise of ∼80 K; this conclusion is shown to be a consequence of the unrealistic boundary conditions imposed on the oxygen and energy balance equations. Simple calculations, with more realistic boundary conditions which reflect that the resistance to heat transfer may lie at the interface between the pile and the ambient, lead to a maximum possible temperature rise of ∼2150 K. Mathematical models are developed, assuming that the pile is isothermal, to determine the influence of various parameters - coal reactivity, stockpile dimensions and ambient conditions - on ignition behaviour. In particular, it is shown that storage of coal in this configuration is, at best, conditionally safe. Based on the calculations, methods which may be implemented to suppress spontaneous combustibility in confined storage are discussed. Application of the model is illustrated by detailed calculations pertinent to the transport of coal in barges or in rail cars. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Coal storage; Oxygen diffusion; Spontaneous combustion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000655090

These applications are generally powered by electric energy. On the other hand, solar energy is widely available and has no fuel cost, which makes the running of solar powered refrigeration a viable and economic proposition. Unfortunately, research shows that solar powered conventional refrigeration systems have a relatively low coefficient of performance (COP). This paper describes a new way for harnessing solar energy, using a combined ejector-vapour compression cycle. This combined cycle brings together the advantages and eliminates the disadvantages of the two common conventional cycles. H2O is used as the refrigerant in the ejector sub-cycle and HFC-134a in the vapour compression sub-cycle. The study shows that the combined cycle is: (i) a potentially high performance system with a potential increase in system COP by more than 50% over the conventional cycles; (ii) a ""green"" system that conforms to all foreseeable ozone preserving regulations and reduces ""green house"" effects; and (iii) a cost effective system with low maintenance. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Thermorheologically simple materials are considered and the influence of the deformation frequency on the storage and loss moduli is modeled using fractional derivative operators. The effect of material temperature on the force-deformation relation is modeled using the concept of evolutionary transfer function, and the proposed model is implemented using a step-by-step technique in the frequency domain. The predictions of the proposed model in the case of sinusoidal and seismic deformations show good agreement with experimental results.
