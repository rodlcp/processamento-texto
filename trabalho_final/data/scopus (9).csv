The mean oxygen consumption of a 50 mg AFDW brachiopod was 0.205 μg-at. O · h -1 while the ammonia excreted was 0.022 μg-at. NH3-N · h -1. The exponents of the regressions relating these parameters to AFDW were not significantly different from each other and the common slope was 0.83. The rise in metabolism over previously published winter levels was 15-20%. The difference between simulated summer and winter conditions was the presence or absence of food. The rise in metabolism was seen in both oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion whilst the oxygen to nitrogen ratio remained virtually unchanged at 9.2 (9.3 in winter), showing that, as in winter conditions, protein was the main metabolic substrate. Oxygen consumption rates were around five times lower than those of temperate brachiopods, even after applying a Q10 temperature correction, and they were two to seven times lower than Antarctic bivalve and gastropod molluscs. An investigation of the biochemical components of field specimens showed strong seasonal variation in protein and carbohydrate, although carbohydrate levels were only as ≈5-10% of protein contents at any one time. There was no significant seasonal variation in lipids, although there was some evidence to suggest that they may be involved, with protein, in the gametogenic cycle. Shell tissues (the caeca) were identified as a site of nutrient storage and may be implicated in short-term storage of material for reproduction as well as the long-term storage of overwintering energy reserves. © 1987.","Biochemical composition; Brachiopod; Excretion; Liothyrella; Respiration; Seasonal metabolism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002997670

Vibrational lifetimes have been measured for two diatomic ions in their electronic ground state: NO+ and HCl+. NO+ and NO have similar lifetimes, in very good agreement with calculated values. HCl+ (v = 1) has a lifetime ten times shorter than HCl (3 ± 1 ms compared with 29 ms), in fairly good agreement with the calculated value of 4.6 ms.

The conclusions are the following: (1) The storage of suspended erythrocytes at 2 °C up to 24 h or at 37 °C for 30 min did not change the water exchange time significantly, even if Mn2+ was present in the medium. This indicates that no significant penetration of Mn2+ is taking place under such conditions. (2) In case of cells previously incubated at 37°C for longer than 30 min with concentrations of p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (PCMBS) greater than 0.5 mM, the water-exchange time gradually decreased if the cells were stored in the presence of Mn2+ for more than 10 min at 37°C. (3) When the arrhenius plot of the water-exchange time was calculated on the basis of measurements performed in such a way as to avoid a prolonged exposure of erythrocytes to Mn2+ no discontinuity occurred, regardless of the treatment with PCMBS. (4) No significant differences between erythrocytes and resealed ghosts regarding their permability and the activation energy of water diffusion (Ea,d) were noticed. The mean value of Ea,d obtained on erythrocytes from 35 donors was 24.5 kJ/mol. (5) The value of Ea,d increased after treatment with PCMBS, in parallel with the percentage inhibition of water diffusion.

The results involve the possibility of separate but related thermal activation of energy-storage and energy-loss processes, and apply to the response of both dielectric and conductive systems. Response with a Gaussian distribution of activation energies (GDAE) may be either symmetric or asymmetric in log frequency, and typical GDAE responses are compared with those associated with several exponential distributions of activation-energy (EDAE) models, using complex nonlinear least-squares fitting. The GDAE model does not lead to the frequently observed fractional-exponent power-law response in time or frequency as does the EDAE; thus, the GDAE cannot fit any EDAE response well which involves an appreciable range of such behavior, but it is found that, conversely, the general EDAE model can often fit a GDAE response very well over a wide frequency range. Recent (KBr)0.5(KCN)0.5 dielectric data covering a range from T=13.7 to 34.7 K are analyzed with the Cole-Cole, EDAE, and GDAE models, and the GDAE is found to yield the best overall fits. The results of the GDAE fits are analyzed in detail to illustrate the application of the GDAE model to real data. Contrary to the conclusions of an earlier analysis of the same data using an idealized, symmetric, and approximate GDAE model, we find that much of the data are better fit by a somewhat asymmetric, exact GDAE model which may involve a temperature-independent, finite-width Gaussian probability density. The present analysis suggests an alternative to the earlier results and suggestions that the width of the probability-density distribution increases with decreasing temperature and that the activation energies or barrier heights themselves depend linearly on temperature. The present data fit yield estimates of the lower limit of the temperature independent distribution of activation energies E0 and of the more or less central activation energy E1, but only set a lower limit for the value of the maximum activation energy of the distribution, E ∞. There is some evidence from the fitting that there may be a glasslike transition below about 4 K, but other effects outside the GDAE model may intervene before that temperature region is reached.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2842559917

Under normoxic conditions the metabolism of the worms is mainly aerobic with a respiratory ratio of 0.7. Under hypoxic conditions, metabolism of energy sources via aerobic and anaerobic pathways is observed. During complete anoxia acetate and propionate are the main products of glycogen degradation and they are excreted in constant rates into the water. A retransfer of the worms to aerobic conditions enables them to regain aerobic metabolic state within about 60 min. In two Tubifex habitats, which we have characterized, concentrations of dissolved organic material (DOM) were low in the surface water, but high in the interstitial water from sediments. The short-chain fatty acids acetate and propionate reached concentrations up to 1 mmole/liter. Employing radioisotope techniques, we demonstrated that Tubifex can achieve an integumentary uptake of acetate and propionate from artificial tap water at naturally occurring concentrations of 5 to 1000 μM. Levels of uptake (600 to 800 nmoles/g wwt.hr) and transport characteristics are very similar to those of marine invertebrates associated with detritus rich sediments. The uptake is susceptible to inhibition by structurally analogous compounds and to metabolic inhibition. Furthermore, DOM uptake in Tubifex is susceptible to inhibition by oxygen depletion, ouabain and Na+-depletion. The results may suggest that a carrier system for DOM transport exists in the integument of the worms. The uptake system is highly specific for aliphatic C2 and C3 carboxylic acids. The absorbed volatile fatty acids are rapidly metabolized. Only 15 min after absorption, a considerable amount of radioactivity is present in the glycogen storage of the animals. Depending on the substrate concentration assumed to be available for uptake, up to 40 per cent of the oxidative requirement of the worms may be attained by using dissolved organic material from the interstitial water of their habitat.

In expt 1, pregnant hamsters lost nearly 50% of their body lipid stores, even though they showed significant increases in body weight and food intake during the latter half of pregnancy.

In expt 2, brown fat cytochrome-c oxidase activity (mitochondrial content) was significantly lower in the late- but not early-pregnancy females relative to the nonpregnant controls. Specific GDP-binding levels did not differ significantly among these groups. Thus an overall decrease in total thermogenic activity in brown fat would be expected during late pregnancy. The loss of carcass lipid, despite decreased brown fat thermogenesis and increased food intake, suggests that substantial increases in energy expenditure occur in pregnant females that are not related to heat production in brown fat.

The increased flexibility allows for storage of energy within the structure. At heel-strike energy should be absorbed and realsed at an appropriate time during the gate cycle. In doing so the energy consumption of the amputee will be decreased.

On the 26-GeV injection platform, in particular, there is a considerable tune spread due to both the beam-beam interaction and incoherent space-charge detuning, making it difficult to keep both protons and antiprotons away from low-order nonlinear resonances. For the first time an attempt was made to minimize the contribution of the beam-beam interaction by separating the beams at all crossing points using a single electrostatic deflector.

The primary tasks included in the system are data acquisition, waveform reduction, automatic control, and data storage. The rule-based approach to the automatic control portion of the system will remain intact. The control algorithms are rule-based and goal-driven. The automatic control system raises ion-source electrical parameters to selected energy goals and maintains these levels until goals are requested or faults are detected. Signal processing allows control responses to be verified for relative accuracy, and error conditions to be dynamically defined. The upgrade will preserve the functionality of the neutral-beam system, while providing the environment in which expansion of the current knowledge base is possible. Removing the limitations on data archival space and computational capability allows the control algorithms to cross-reference the expert's rules with operational data learned by the computer.

This program was intended to provide third-party, unbiased safety evaluations of dams at the Commission's licensed projects. Inspections were to be performed at five year intervals by 'independent' consultants engaged by the licensees. The FPC program included projects having a dam exceeding 10. 7 meters (35 feet) in height or having a gross storage capacity in excess of 2. 5 million cubic meters (2,000 acre-feet). By the time Order No. 122 was issued, most of the licensed dams already had been inspected three times. With the regulations promulgated by Order No. 122 now more than five years old, the second round of inspections are underway.

Based upon an interpretation of the depth of penetration of hydrogen in reacted SRL-165 glass the authors have modeled the radionuclide release from the glass as a combined process of the diffusive exchange of alkalis and boron in the glass for hydrogen species in the solution (D equals 10** minus **1**6 cm**2/s) and surface dissolution. Surface dissolution controls the release of components not exchanged by diffusion and takes place at a rate of 1. 5-3. 0 mu m/yr. Subsequent to release the radionuclides may remain in the leach solution, diffuse into the tuff, or precipitate as secondary phases. Precipitation is particularly important for plutonium and americium. Diffusive transport of radionuclides through the tuff takes place at a slow rate, D equals 10** minus **1**6 cm**2/s. As such, the mass of radionuclides incorporated in the tuff by diffusion during the tests is inconsequential relative to that in the leach solution (with the exception of plutonium) and can be ignored in mass balance calculations. Mass balance calculations based upon the release of radionuclides by surface dissolution of the glass waste form are in good agreement with observed solution chemistry when allowances are made for a pulse of dissolution early in the tests. This pulse may be due to either the rapid dissolution of high-energy surface features early in the integrated tests or an initially high surface dissolution rate that decreases with time as silica saturation is approached, or a combination of the two.",,"GLASS - Dissolution; NUCLEAR FUELS - Waste Disposal; NUCLIDES - Radioactive; NEVADA NUCLEAR WASTE STORAGE INVESTIGATIONS PROJECT; RADIONUCLIDES; TUFF; WASTE PACKAGE DESIGN; RADIOACTIVE WASTES",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023568819

The capture chamber geometries are those that have been either used or recommended in conjunction with pneumatic wave energy conversion. The respective waterplanes of the chambers are square and circular, and the areas of each are equal. The pressure of the entrapped air above the internal water surface is measured for a series of wave frequencies and heights. The pressure values are then used to determine the potential energy of the compressed air. For each of three inlet areas of the chambers, the square waterplane chamber is shown to be a more effective energy storer. The reason for this is that the circular chamber is a better radiator. The peak energy storage efficiency of the square chamber is approximately 60%, while that of the circular chamber is 20%.

The switch has demonstrated the ability to compress the output pulse of a capacitively-based pulsed-power generator, resulting in a pulse whose voltage and power simultaneously exceed the matched load values by factors greater than 2. Experiments on the Gamble II generator have demonstrated simultaneous voltage gain of 2. 7 (4. 6 MV) and power gain of 2. 4 (3. 5 TW) over the ideal matched load values (1. 7 MV, 1. 46 TW). This is accomplished by inductive energy storage, where a vacuum inductor shunted by the PEOS is located between the generator and the load. Energy from the initial portion of the generator pulse is stored in the vacuum inductor, with the PEOS closed. The PEOS then opens swiftly ( less than 10 ns), delivering the inductively-stored energy and the balance of the generator pulse to the load. The coupling of the PEOS to the load is also critical in obtaining voltage and power gain.",,"ELECTRIC INDUCTORS; ELECTRIC SWITCHES - Performance; HIGH POWER OPERATION; OPENING SWITCH; PLASMA EROSION; PULSED-POWER GENERATOR; VACUUM INDUCTOR; PLASMA DEVICES",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023564821

PEP has been operated at 8 GeV where the uncoupled beam emittance is 27 nm-rad. Since a lower beam energy is now required, the optics have been modified to reduce the emittance further. In a brief run at 8 GeV a beam was successfully injected and accumulated. The horizontal and vertical emittances were measured using the photon beam of the 58-m long undulator beam line and found to be 12. 1 and 1. 2 nm-rad. This is close to the expected value of 9. 9 nm-rad for the sum of the two. The beam lifetime was over 30 h at low currents. Methods for reducing this emittance even further are investigated. Increasing the horizontal damping partition from one to two is seen as most promising, does not require new hardware, and can be achieved with a small increase of the RF-frequency of about 4 kHz. Such an operation mode has been computed and tracked.

To leave the spent fuel in an intermediate storage facility until such time as a final judgement can be made on whether it is only waste, or whether its contained fissionable fuel is worth recovering, appears to be logical and this is what will happen to the bulk of the spent fuel coming out of reactors up to the end of this century.",,"NUCLEAR ENERGY - International Cooperation; RADIOACTIVE WASTES - Management; INTERMEDIATE STORAGE; PLUTONIUM FABRICATION; REPROCESSING; WASTE MANAGEMENT; NUCLEAR REACTORS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023562098

The steady state of the bunch is determined by the minimum of the free energy, of which the potential energy of bunch displacement is a key part. The result is that bunch oscillation becomes thermodynamically favored when the parasitic losses have displaced the bunch by approximately one rms width from its zero current equilibrium location. This phenomenon is independent of the synchrotron tune shifts and unrelated to the mechanical instabilities predicted by the linearized Vlasov equation. The threshold scaling shows that thermodynamic bunch lengthening dominates for short bunches, and a detailed calculation using the power-law impedance shows that this is the probable mechanism for the bunch lengthening in SPEAR II.",,"PARTICLE BEAMS - Thermodynamics; ELECTRON STORAGE RINGS; SYNCHROTRON RADIATION; THERMODYNAMIC BUNCH LENGTHENING; ACCELERATORS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023561181

Till to date the approach of power engineers towards this problem has been to find the best way of controlling the governors so that the oscillations and maximum deviation can be brought to a minimum. A parallel approach has been developed recently which points out that the crux of the problem lies in the fact that the only storage capacity a power system has is in the inertia of the generator rotors. It also suggests that the situation can be improved by employing fast acting energy storage devices which can share the sudden requirement of power.

In this work we analyze the heat and mass transfer associated with the desorption of ammonia in calcium chloride ammoniate due to the application of heat. The ammoniate is in solid phase in the form of a porous matrix and the ammonia gas that is generated by the degasification filters through it due to the pressure gradient generated by the degasification. Assuming chemical equilibrium between reactants and products, as well as Darcy's law for flow through porous media, a simplified model of the process is developed. A strongly nonlinear diffusion equation is obtained under a constant specific heat and molecular mass approximation. Numerical solutions of this diffusion equation for a semi-infinite slab are examined. Qualitative information has been obtained on the kind of heating that is desirable. © 1987 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.",,"CALCIUM COMPOUNDS; FLOW OF FLUIDS - Porous Materials; GASES - Heat Transfer; MASS TRANSFER; CALCIUM CHLORIDE; DARCY'S LAW; POROUS GENERATOR; SOLID GENERATORS; THERMAL DEGASIFICATION; AMMONIA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023559542

Nutrient balance is in part regulated by the two limbs of the autonomic nervous system. Hypothalamic and genetic obesity are associated with lower levels of sympathetic activity. Conversely the reduced weight of animals with lateral hypothalamic lesions is associated with increased sympathetic activity. Thus the activity of the sympathetic nervous system appears to be inversely related to energy stores. The levels of hormones such as insulin, adrenal steroids, gonadal steroids and growth hormone play an important role in modulating nutrient intake and storage. The data seem to fit the hypothesis that nutrient stores are regulated systems with afferent feedback systems acting on a central controller which regulates intake, storage and metabolism of nutrients through modulation of the autonomic nervous system and motor control of food seeking.",,"autonomic nervous system; heredity; human; hypothalamus; metabolism; nutrient; obesity; short survey; Human; Nutrition; Obesity; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023554059

However, when algebraic coupling among the energy variables exists, then the associated state-space equations are implicit in form. Typically, such equations require implicit integration methods for their solution, unless the original model is modified suitably. Bond-graph models, through the use of causality techniques, allow one to indentify the existence of algebraic energy-variable coupling. The detailed nature of the coupling leads to various options for solving such problems. A modification of, and extension to, the standard sequential causality assignment procedure is given that permits the identification of the structure of energy fields.",,"MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES - State Space Methods; BOND GRAPH MODELS; DYNAMIC SYSTEMS; ENERGY STORAGE FIELD STRUCTURE; ENERGY STORAGE",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023541813

With this in mind the authors have investigated the question of undulator tunability with emphasis on the role of the ring energy in order to find the smallest storage-ring energy consistent with the desired tunability interval and photon energy.

It is shown how a careful analysis of the stress-optic properties of Nd:La//2Be//2O//5 (Nd:BEL) permits the design and fabrication of face-pumped slab lasers that eliminate first-order thermooptical effects over an extended range of operating conditions. A major consequence of this is that very simple and inexpensive straight-through slab geometries can be used in applications that heretofore have required zigzag slab geometries. This greatly reduces slab fabrication tolerances, times, and costs, since only the slab ends need be polished to optical finishes and parallelism requirements are relaxed. Because high optical fluences no longer contact the pumped and cooled slab faces, optical damage problems are substantially alleviated; consequently, the mounting of the slab and the design of the pumping chamber are greatly simplified. In addition, optical anisotropy of Nd:BEL mitigates the effects of stress and thermally induced optical birefringence, while its strongly polarized emission and moderate emission cross section permit relatively high-energy storage and substantially reduce ASE parasitics. Recent data on the performance of athermal straight-through Nd:BEL slabs are presented.

The program is designed so that the user can formulate or modify existing models and add them to the library of components. During the 12 years that the TRNSYS has been in the public domain, many equipment models have been added to the library.

After seven years exposure to salt water no alteration of the transmission capability of the cable was noted. Fluctuations in the electrical output were successfully smoothed by the flywheel effect of the turbine in conjunction with an AC-DC-AC conversion system, allowing the electricity produced by an induction generator to be transmitted to the local power grid.

A Monte Carlo model of fission fragment transport through the ceramic lid was used to measure the concentration of uranium present in the lids.

To investigate the discharge resistance and voltage drop, an experimental system has been built, and the operating E/P (ratio of electric field to gas pressure), the discharge resistance, and the energy transfer to a resistive load have been studied in high-pressure, high-current-density, UV-preionized, self-sustained diffuse discharges. Preliminary measurements to test the system and determine the rage of parameters have been made in N2 with tri-n-propylamine (TPA) seedant and in three CO2:N2(w/TPA):He mixtures at gas pressures between 100 and 760 torr. It has been found that in the CO2:N2:He mixtures E/P decreases with increasing J/P (attachment dominated), while in N2 it increases with J/P (recombination dominated), where J is the current density. The resistance of the discharge was calculated and found to range between, 0.7 Ω and 13 Ω under various initial conditions. A simple calculation for predicting energy transfer from a capacitive storage element through a gas discharge and into a relative load is presented. Experimental data from diffuse discharge measurements show remarkable agreement with the calculated results. The agreement indicates that the ratio of Vop/Vappl (ratio of operating discharge voltage to applied voltage) is a useful parameter for determining the energy transfer efficiency of the discharge.",,"Electric Discharges; Gases--Ionization; Pulse Generators; Diffuse Discharges; Discharge Current Measurement; Energy Transfer; Fast-Recovery Switching; Pulse Forming Lines; Triggered Spark Gap; Electric Switches",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023528024

The projectile, a conducting cylindrical sleeve, is driven by the force exerted on it by a traveling magnetic-wave packet created by the barrel currents. Since the rate of energy transfer is proportional to the projectile velocity, it was convenient to divide the barrel into three separate sections, corresponding to the low-, medium-, and high-velocity parts of the projectile motion. Each section is excited by a different method, chosen to satisfy the need for the most efficient utilization of the energy stored in the power supply capacitors.

An innovative transformer concept, the hybrid pulse power transformer (HPPT), replaces the inductor and the homopolar generator. This pulse transformer significantly increases the energy transfer efficiency and eliminates the need for a high-current switch. It requires the use of a superconducting primary with a composite conductor that becomes highly resistive when driven normal. The sequence of HPPT operation is to charge the superconducting primary, then drive it normal when the energy pulse is required. The primary total resistance determines the time constant of energy transfer independently of its distribution. Since the winding resistance and inductance are distributed along the windings, internal voltage elimination is achieved locally.

These lines are connected to three horizontal triplate disks in a water convolute section. Power will flow through an insulator stack into radial MITLs that will drive the three-ring diode. Saturn is designed to operate with a maximum of 750 kJ coupled to a three-ring electron-beam diode with a peak power of 25 TW to provide an X-ray exposure capability of 5 × 1012 rads/s (Si) and 5 cal/g (Au) over 500 cm2.",,"Accelerators; Electric Switches; Energy Storage; Pulse Generators; Large Area X-Ray Simulation Accelerator; Magnetically Insulated Transmission Lines; Marx Generators; Saturn Accelerator; Three-Ring Electron-Beam Diode; X-Ray and Gamma Ray Production",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023527268

For example, with such devices x-ray beams comparable to those from conventional undulators will be attainable on storage rings of much lower energy (and emittance) than those presently in use. X-ray instrumentation will also be affected, e.g., micropole undulators of sufficient length can provide extremely monochromatic outputs, obviating the need for expensive and complex ultrahigh vacuum monochromator systems.

Electron ejection within the protein molecules is followed by efficient electron capture at both iron centres, giving a loss in the FeIII g = 6 feature and a gain in features assigned to (FeO2)- units. Features in the g = 2 region of the spectrum are assigned to protein electron-loss centres. The results confirm that electrons in these proteins are mobile and relatively long-lived, despite their ability to react with amide groups and various side groups. Furthermore, a method is developed which gives relative yields of the FeII and (FeO2)- units with considerable accuracy and it is concluded that e- capture by FeO2 is ca. 2.5 times as probable as capture by FeIII. Also, storage at 77 K for several months resulted in no detectable intramolecular electron transfer to give FeO2 and FeII units despite the resultant gain in stability. This result is contrasted with a recent study involving electron transfer from 3ZnII to FeIII in Zn-Fe hybrids, which occurs quite rapidly at 77 K (kt ≈ 0.8 s-1). We conclude that in our case electron-transfer rates are greatly reduced because the energy difference is smaller than for the 3ZnII case. Various alternatives based on non-statistical distribution of O2 in the protein tetramers are considered, but we conclude that these cannot explain the different results. Reasons for the greater ease of electron-addition to FeO2 units relative to FeIII units are discussed. The electron-loss centres are identified as nitrogen-centred radicals, formed from the peptide backbone by proton transfer to carbonyl oxygen atoms. That these centres become rapidly immobilized is established by the fact that when pure deoxyhaemoglobin (FeII) is irradiated, there is no detectable formation of FeIII units. From an analysis of the β-proton hyperfine coupling in these N-centred radicals it is shown that the majority must be formed within the α-helical regions of this protein, the conformations requiring that A(βH) ≈ 38 G. However, a considerable number are formed in random-coil regions; these give small β-proton splittings.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000087396

Simulations were run to determine the relative sensitivity of the model to transient versus steady-state radial flow, grid size, time-step lengths, and injection temperatures. In order to determine the effects of uncertainties in the values of aquifer and aquitard parameters, energy recovery factors and recovery temperatures were calculated for worst-case, best-case, and best-estimate simulations. Aquifer and aquitard parameters were either measured directly or were estimated based on previous hydrogeologic investigations. All simulations were performed assuming a 150 d injection phase with a pumping rate of 15 m3h-1, a 35 d storage phase, and a 150 d production phase, also with a pumping rate of 15 m3h-1. The worst-case simulation for an injection temperature of 23.9°C produced an energy recovery factor of 0.43 and a final production temperature of 14.6°C. The best-case simulation resulted in an energy recovery factor of 0.69 and a final production temperature of 16.2°C. The best-estimate simulation predicted an energy recovery factor of 0.50 and a final production temperature of 15.0°C. Both the energy recovery factor and the recovery temperature were most affected by the uncertainty in the storage formation longitudinal dispersivity. Using the best-estimate parameter values, an injection temperature of 18.0°C resulted in a final production temperature of 13.2°C and an energy recovery factor of 0.50.

During transient states parameters as growth rate, pigment contents, photosynthetic activities and pool sizes of carbohydrate and proteins were followed. The changes in pigments and photosynthesis were similar for irradiance transitions and transitions in light period length. Carbohydrates served for the supply of carbon and energy during adaptation to low light conditions until a basal level of 125 μg · mg dry wt-1 was reached. After transfer to high light conditions excess carbon fixation led to the storage of carbohydrate reserve polymers up to 600 μg · mg dry wt-1. During adaptation to longer light periods cells showed an overcapacity for carbohydrate accumulation even in the presence of a high carbohydrate content at the start of the light period. A model for the feed back repression of photosynthesis related to carbohydrate accumulation was presented. In all cases protein synthesis was directly maximized under the given conditions. Growth rate defined as specific rate of change in carbon showed the fastest response after a shift in light conditions. It was concluded that adaptation of O. agardhii to changes in light conditions was directed to the optimization of growth. The observation that carbohydrate is used to supply carbon and/or energy during adaptation leads to the conclusion that changes on survival in low light depend on carbohydrate level, the efficiency of its conversion in cell material and the maintenance requirements. Such a survival strategy enables cyanobacteria to cope succesfully with light limiting conditions. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.","Carbohydrate accumulation; Cyanobacteria; Light-shade adaptation; Photosynthesis; Protein synthesis; Reserve polymers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343814654

Larval consumption is relatively low in C. biguttulus (C=4.3 kJ/ind.) compared with C. parallelus and G. rufus (4.9 kJ/ind.). In the adult phase (maturity) consumption rates of C. biguttulus and G. rufus (6.9 kJ/ind.) are similar, but higher in C. parallelus (7.3 kJ/ind.). The energy content decreases from the egg (23.2-24.3 J/mg dw) and body tissue (22.1-23.2 J/mg dw) to faeces (16.6-18.1 J/mg dw). The energy contents of faeces differ significantly between the species, indicating different rates of food conversion (on Dactylis glomerata). On average, the assimilation rates are about 30%, slightly lower in G. rufus. Approximate digestibility (A/C) ranges from 28.2 (G. rufus) to 35.7 (C. biguttulus) without great differences between larvae and adults. In contrast, the efficiency of conversion of ingested food (P/C) differs significantly between larval (10-11) and adult stages (3.4-3.6), and so to a much higher degree does the efficiency of conversion of digested food (P/A), from 30.3-33.5 in the larval to 9.5-14.9 in the adult period.

The proportion of production of the grasshopper populations (body tissue) used for egg production differs in C. parallelus (28%) and G. rufus (44%).

TLC analysis of the reaction mixture showed that ADP was the only radioactive product, proving that the original substance was a polyribonucleotide. Studies of the time course of labelling and of the distribution of the acid-insoluble product between the mitochondrial and nuclear fractions showed that both are labelled even after 1 min at 25 °C, but at short times and low temperature more radioactivity is found in the mitochondria. The kinetics of adenosine incorporation resemble those expected for the labelling of hnRNA and mRNA. Isolated, respiring mitochondria incorporate adenosine and adenine nucleotides into acid insoluble form by a process dependent on oxidative phosphorylation and the adenine nucleotide translocase that is specific for adenine derivatives. The results are discussed in terms of the hypothesis that the polyribonucleotide might be a storage form of adenine nucleotides: it is concluded that the bulk of the labelled product is unlikely to play a major role in energy metabolism. © 1987 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.","adenosine incorporation; heart mitochondria; ischaemia; perfused rat heart","adenine nucleotide; adenosine; animal; article; cell fractionation; heart mitochondrion; heart muscle; in vitro study; male; metabolism; rat; rat strain; temperature; Adenine Nucleotides; Adenosine; Animal; In Vitro; Male; Mitochondria, Heart; Myocardium; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Subcellular Fractions; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023444794

Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy. The storage ring was designed, manufactured and put into operation by the staff of the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Siberian Department of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1983. In 1984 a superconducting ""snake"" with a 4.3 T field was mounted in the storage ring. In 1984-1985, as part of the process of developing the storage ring a modification of the synchronization system of the linac FAKEL and of the injection system to the storage ring were performed. The beam diagnostics system was developed. The vacuum system of the storage ring and injection channel was up-dated. Regimes for the joint operation of the storage ring and the linac FAKEL were developed at various adjustments of the latter. A current of 180 mA was obtained at the injection energy of 55 MeV and one of 160 mA at 450 MeV. The beam lifetime has so far been limited by scattering on the residual gas in the storage ring chamber and amounts to 3.6 × 103 s at 100 mA current and to 1.4 × 104 s at 1 mA current. Presently, operations are being carried out at the experimental station of the luminescent VUV-spectroscopy of channel M and at the VUV-spectrometer for the investigation of wide-band dielectrics, including cryocrystals, at channel S. © 1987.",,"ACCELERATORS - USSR; BEAM DIAGNOSTICS; FAREL LINAC; SIBERIA-1; SYNCHROTRON RADIATION; ACCELERATORS, SYNCHROTRON",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022813198

Initial Plinian rhyolite fallout is confined to a narrow downwind sector, and its maximum thickness may occur as far as 13 km from source. In contrast, the partly contemporaneous rhyolite-rich ash flows underwent relatively low-energy emplacement, their generation evidently being decoupled from the high column. Flow veneers 1-13 m thick on near-vent ridge crests exhibit a general rhyolite-to-andesite sequence like that of the much thicker valley-confined ignimbrite into which they merge downslope. Lithics in both the initial Plinian and the ignimbrite are predominantly fragments of the Jurassic Naknek Formation, which extends from the surface to a depth of ca. 1500 m. Absence of lithics from the underlying sedimentary section limits to &lt; 1.5 km the fragmentation level and the structural depth of the vent, which is thought to be funnel-shaped, flaring shallowly to a surface diameter of 2 km. Overlying the ignimbrite are layers of Plinian dacite fallout, &gt; 100 m thick near source and 10 m thick 3 km away, which dip back into an inner vent &lt;0.5 km wide, nested inside the earlier vent funnel of the ignimbrite. The dacite fallout is poor in Naknek lithics but contains abundant fragments of vitrophyre, most of which was vent-filling, densely welded tuff reejected during later phases of the 3-day eruption. Adjacent to the inner vent, a 225-m-high asymmetrical accumulation of coarse near-vent ejecta is stratigraphically continuous with the regional dacite fallout. Distensional faulting of its crest may reflect spreading related to compaction and welding. Nearby andesite-dacite stratovolcanoes, i.e., Martin, Mageik, Trident, and Katmai, display at least 12 vents that define a linear volcanic front trending N65°E. The 1912 vent and adjacent dacite domes are disposed parallel to the front and ca. 4 km behind it. Mount Griggs, 10 km behind the front, is more potassic than other centers, taps isotopically more depleted source materials, and reflects a wholly independent magmatic plumbing system. Geochemical differences among the stratovolcanoes, characteristically small eruptive volumes ( &lt; 0.1 to 0.4 km3), and the dominance of andesite and low-SiO2 dacite suggest complex crustal reservoirs, not large integrated magma chambers. Linear fractures just outside the 1912 vent strike nearly normal to the volcanic front and may reflect dike transport of magma previously stored beneath Trident 3-5 km away. Caldera collapse at Mount Katmai may have taken place in response to hydraulic transfer of Katmai magma toward Novarupta via reservoir components beneath Trident. The voluminous 1912 eruption (12-15 km3 DRE) was also unusual in producing high-silica rhyolite (6-9 km3 DRE), a composition rare in this arc and on volcanic fronts in general. Isotopic data indicate that rhyolite genesis involved little assimilation of sedimentary rocks, pre-Tertiary plutonic rocks, or hydrothermally altered rocks of any age. Trace-element data suggest nonetheless that the rhyolite contains a nontrivial crustal contribution, most likely partial melts of Late Cenozoic arc-intrusive rocks. Because the three compositions (77%, 66-64.5%, and 61.5-58.5% SiO2) that intermingled in 1912 vented both concurrently and repeatedly (after eruptive pauses hours in duration), the compositional gaps between them must have been intrinsic to the reservoir, not merely effects of withdrawal dynamics. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000846639

Imaging sensors operating at other wavelengths have the potential to provide vision through severe weather, but these systems need to be simulated before assuming the technological and financial risks involved in hardware development. Sensor and atmospheric models have been developed which simulate images at a variety of wavelengths. These models have been incorporated into a modified version of the IVEX Corporation Behold software which is used for the creation of three dimensional views of terrain data bases and includes fractal texturing and anti-aliasing. This new version, called Behold-ms, adds phenomenological models of material properties, such as surface roughness, emissivity, and temperature, and structured atmospheric weather models that consider path emission, backscatter, and specular/diffuse reflections of the sky. To date, images have been simulated in the visible (color), infrared (8-14µm), passive millimeter wave (35 GHz and 95 GHz), and active MMW (35 GHz and 95 GHz). These algorithms can be used for other windows over this spectral range. In order to accommodate the widely varying types of sensed energy while maintaining a practical amount of internal storage, a scheme for scaling each spectral band has been developed. Spatial resolution degradation due to diffraction, which is especially important at millimeter wavelengths, spatial sampling effects, and system noise models are also included. These sensor models and simulations have been used to examine adverse weather landing systems. Simulated images have also been used in image understanding research and spatial superresolution studies. © 1987 SPIE.",,"ATMOSPHERIC OPTICS - Mathematical Models; ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE - Mathematical Models; COMPUTER PROGRAMMING - Algorithms; IMAGE PROCESSING; INFRARED IMAGING; ATMOSPHERIC WEATHER MODEL; BEHOLD-MS COMPUTER SOFTWARE; MULTISPECTRAL IMAGING SIMULATION; SENSOR MODEL; IMAGE SENSORS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023580913

Measured values of the stored thermal energy and radiative heating were used to evaluate several bulk formulae for sensible and latent heat transfer. Over 50-100 day intervals, bulk formulae for latent and sensible heat flux without stability corrections were as good as formulae that incorporated such corrections; both satisfactorily reproduced the measured heat storage data. Over shorter (daily to weekly) time-scales, predictions incorporating stability corrections were superior to those without stability corrections. Over daily periods when the atmosphere was nearly neutral or was unstable, a formulation for sensible and latent heat transfer designed for small-scale systems (cooling ponds and reservoirs) agreed closely with the usual large-scale (oceanic) bulk formulations. The corrections for stability in the small-scale formulation are based on laboratory and theoretical studies of free convection; the stability correction in the large-scale formulation uses a bulk Richardson number in a manner consistent with flux-profile theory. Both agreed with the measured data for the unstable and near-neutral cases. Under stable atmospheric conditions (in a daily average sense), both formulations underestimated the measured fluxes © 1987 D.

The wavelength of the fundamental radiation from the FEL can span from 0.25 to 10 μm, and harmonics will be produced in the UV spectral region.

This is probably the lowest wavelength attainable on ACO with TiO2 SiO2 dielectric mirrors because of the near-UV TiO2 broad absorption band. A careful analysis of the optical gain, taking into account the measured beam characteristics, shows a spectral dependence scaling as λ1,1, with a maximum at λ = 650 nm close to 0.4%. Therefore the ACO FEL may be tuned over almost the whole visible spectrum at the expense of time consuming mirror changes. Due to the poor transmission of these very high reflectivity mirrors the average extracted power is only a few mW throughout the visible region. However the maximum intracavity peak power (at low frequency Q-switching) reaches about 0.5 MW. The next step will be to test new Al2O3 SiO2 coated mirrors in the near-UV spectral range. © 1987.",,"ACCELERATORS - Storage Rings; MIRRORS; OPTICAL GAIN; OPTICAL KLYSTRON; ORSAY STORAGE RING; LASERS, FREE ELECTRON",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023417036

In the example of the ACO storage ring, the high X-ray flux of spontaneous emission sets a limit to the shortest wavelength. A detailed analysis of the resistance of multilayer dielectric TiO2 SiO2 mirrors has been carried out. Several degradation processes have been identified occurring at different energies of incident photons leading to either surface or bulk absorption. This data was very important for the operation of the FEL at wavelengths above 460 nm. For shorter wavelengths almost nothing is known about the resistance of normal incidence multilayer mirror under X-ray exposure. At Orsay we are starting a program of work to test various mirrors under such conditions. A device has been built for this purpose, allowing consecutive irradiation of more than 12 mirrors without any ultrahigh vacuum break. Precision alignment screws are provided to align the mirrors with a reference mirror in order to continuously monitor the reflectivity during X-ray exposure. A thermocouple is located on the mirror holder. The device will be inserted on the ACO storage ring in the fall of 1986. The results of this program are essential for the future UV-VUV SUPER-ACO FEL and for any other storage ring FEL. © 1987.",,"ACCELERATORS - Storage Rings; DIELECTRIC MATERIALS; LASERS, FREE ELECTRON; MIRRORS; PHOTONS; ACO STORAGE RING; DIELECTRIC MIRRORS; OPTICAL COATINGS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023416851

The exposure energy required to produce 2.0 m resist lines on product wafers at this level was monitored and correlated with both the total and diffuse reflectivity as measured on control wafers included with the product wafers during Al/Si deposition. Fourteen product lots were monitored over a period of several months. The results show a strong correlation between changes in the diffuse reflectivity and the exposure energy. An increase of 64% in the diffuse reflectivity of the Al/Si film is accompanied by an increase of 80% in the exposure energy required to produce 2.0 m lines in positive resist. For these same lots, the total reflectivity varies by less than ±%, usually taken as an indication of good process control at metal deposition, with no apparent correlation to the exposure energy. Several different resist processes were investigated to control the effects of changes in the diffuse reflectivity. The most promising of these has been a new dyed photoresist developed at Sandia. The unbleachable dye has been selected for optimal performance at the exposure and alignment wavelengths used in the Ultratech stepper. The diffuse reflectivity of Al/Si films coated with dyed resist is diminished by a factor of eight over the reflectivity of films coated with our standard resist. The total reflectivity is diminished by a factor of five. © 1987 SPIE.",,"Data Storage, Digital - Random Access; Optical Variables Measurement; Control Wafers; Diffuse Reflectivity; Dyed Resist; Exposure Energy; Linewidth Control; SRAM Device; Photoresists",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023642051

While several analytic studies of hot phonons have appeared in the literature, we present here a novel Ensemble Monte Carlo calculation of nonequilibrium-phonon effects on the relaxation rate of photoexcited electrons. The build up of the phonon population on a picosecond scale is monitored, in parallel with the cooling of the electron distribution. No assumptions on the form of the phonon or the electron distributions are required. The strong phonon emission by the high-energy photoexcited electrons in the first stage of their relaxation (within a few tenths of a picosecond) is found to drive the phonon distribution strongly out of equilibrium. After the excitation, reabsorption of the emitted phonons by the carriers and nonelectronic phonon decay processes bring the distribution back to its equilibrium value. The time evolution of the calculated phonon distribution is in agreement with the available data obtained with time-resolved Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, the strongly perturbed phonon distribution can, for the moderate carrier excitation densities considered, fully account for the observed reduction of the cooling rate of the phototexcited carriers. Finally the arguments for and against a dominant role of free carrier screening are critically analysed in the light of the present and of foregoing theoretical hot-phonon theories. © 1987 SPIE.",,"Cooling; Digital storage; Electrons; Gallium arsenide; Hot electrons; III-V semiconductors; Microstructure; Probes; Semiconducting gallium; Semiconductor lasers; Ultrafast lasers; Dynamical simulation; Electron distributions; Ensemble monte carlo; Free carrier screening; Nonequilibrium phonons; Photoexcited electrons; Time-resolved luminescence; Time-resolved Raman spectroscopies; Phonons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5544275898

The primary measure of behavior was the time of the rat's highest response rate during a trial (peak time), which represented the interval during which the rat maximally expected food. With a lecithin snack, peak time was gradually shifted over sessions to a shorter time, remained shifted to the left of the normal function with additional testing, and then remained at the shorter time on two sessions after the snack was discontinued; with the protein snack, peak time was abruptly shifted to a shorter time, returned to normal with additional testing, and then rebounded to a longer time when the snack was discontinued; with a carbohydrate, snack peak time was abruptly shifted to a longer time, returned to normal with additional testing, and then rebounded to a shorter time when the snack was discontinued.

Instead of using Richardson numbers, this improved approach uses non-local approximations to the shear, buoyancy, storage, and dissipation terms of the turbulence kinetic energy equation to parameterize the turbulent mixing potential between every combination of grid points in a 1-D model of the atmosphere. The original (n2 - n) degrees of freedom associated with the independent transilient matrix coefficients for a model of n grid points is thus reduced to four degrees of freedom associated with the four free parameters. The resulting parameterization is applied to three consecutive case-study days of boundary-layer data acquired near the Cabauw tower in The Netherlands. The first day is used for sensitivity tests to select the best values of the four free parameters. The remaining two days, used as independent tests, demonstrate that realistic entraining mixed layers and nocturnal boundary layers form in the model without explicitly parameterizing such boundary layers.

The saturated fatty acids-lauric, myristic, palmitic and stearic-were incorporated into phosphoglycerides at faster rates with increasing chain lengths, while triglyceride incorporation was almost uniform. The degree of incorporation of the unsaturated fatty acids into phosphoglycerides (structural) compared to triglyceride (storage and energy) was the converse of their oxidation rates. The incorporation of oleic, linoleic and α-linolenic acids was mainly into triglyceride, whereas dihomo-γ-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid were preferentially incorporated into phosphoglycerides. The data suggest that distribution of each fatty acid is different depending on its destination for structural or energy function. © 1987 American Oil Chemists' Society.",,"carbon; fatty acid; phospholipid; triacylglycerol; unsaturated fatty acid; animal; article; biosynthesis; fat intake; female; liver; metabolism; rat; rat strain; Animal; Carbon Radioisotopes; Dietary Fats; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Female; Liver; Phospholipids; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023393875

Methods included brightfield and fluorescent light microscopy, secondary and backscatter scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy in conjunction with silver stain, cationic dye, and antibody to type-I collagen. These studies reveal a twisted, beaded appearance and a complex substructure of collagen fibrils embedded in a ground substance that has a positive reaction with cationic dye. A hierarchy of patterns of branching and attachment was seen among intercellular struts ranging in diameter from 0.1 μm to several urn. The hypothesis that struts tether not only the surfaces but the contractile lattices of laterally adjacent myocytes is supported by the following: (a) the attachments of struts to the collagen weave of the sarcolemma, often lateral to the level of Z bands, (b) the presence of collagen type I in a composite material arrangement, (c) the relative dispositions and configurational changes of struts and myocyte surfaces in various physiological states and induced, non-physiological perturbations of cardiac muscle, (d) the corrugated sarcolemmas with infoldings near Z bands, and (e) the continuity of intracellular filaments from Z bands to the inner aspect of the sarcolemma in relaxed and contracted myocytes.

Two 12-V, nine-cell modules of the Li/FeS system were constructed and tested. Operation of the modules in a thermal enclosure showed that it was possible to achieve thermal balances and to control temperature and temperature gradients. The first module constructed demonstrated an energy output of 60 Wh/kg. Changing the ratio between the quantities of negative and positive reactants improved the energy output of the second module to 91 Wh/kg, about 8% above the design goal. Estimates based on the performance of the second module suggest a range of 1. 8 mi/kWh of ac input energy for vehicular use. The heat exchanger constructed for this project successfully maintained the temperature of the second module at the operating temperature, 500 degree C.

The main objective of this work was to demonstrate the capabilities of advanced heat pump technology in commercial establishments for process applications, indoor climate control and energy management. The design of the system is unique in that it takes advantage of the coincident waste heat production, hot water demand and space cooling needs. By properly balancing the hot water storage, heat pump capacity and utilization of the cool discharged air through a specially designed distribution duct, significant energy savings: 42% and demand reduction: 44% were achieved during the first year of operation. In addition, the proper distribution of the cool air provides an improved and comfortable working environment in the kitchen and adjacent areas. Excess cool air is directed to the basement of the building where the office, storage space and main refrigeration equipment are located.

Both rates rose to new steady values during feeding, and the respiratory quotient (RQ) increased from 0.792 to 0.924. The RQ was consistent in repeat studies on any individual (coefficient of variation: 2.5 per cent), and differences between individuals were significant in the fasted but not the fed state. Simultaneous measurements were made of the rate of protein oxidation by primed constant infusion of (1-13C) leucine for 8 h. Rates were calculated from the enrichment of plasma α-ketoisocaproate and the production of 13CO2 in the breath, taking account of the incomplete recovery of 13CO2 and the changes in baseline enrichment resulting from natural 13C in the food. Leucine oxidation increased by 87 per cent during the feeding period. Rates of nutrient utilization were calculated from respiratory gas exchange and rates of protein oxidation. These showed that fat was predominant in the fasted state, contributing 61 per cent of total energy expenditure, compared with 27 per cent for carbohydrate and 11 per cent for protein. On feeding there was a switch to carbohydrate as the main fuel (62 per cent), with smaller contributions from fat (20 per cent) and protein (18 per cent). During feeding total utilization of each nutrient exceeded its intake from the diet, indicating storage in the body. Dietary carbohydrate was stored without conversion to fat. It is concluded that this method is useful for studying the control of nutrient utilization by food intake.",,"carbon dioxide; leucine c 13; unclassified drug; article; gas exchange; human; human experiment; methodology; normal human; nutrition; oxygen consumption; priority journal; Adult; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Female; Humans; Male; Nutrition Physiology; Oxygen Consumption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023191392

This study found that chemical oxidation, not foreign particulate contamination, was the major cause of the discrete defects found on PBS films. Elemental analysis of the small defects on fresh PBS-coated quartz masks with a scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive x-ray analysis, and Auger spectroscopy showed that 66 percent of the defects contained little or no elemental contamination other than excess oxygen. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and small-spot refective infrared analysis of larger oxidized defects on older plates and of defects induced by known initiators of oxidation in polymers yielded information on chemical functional groups in the defects. This information confirmed the finding that oxidation was responsible for the changes observed in discrete areas. Oxidation changes the physical and chemical properties of the reacting area and produces an embedded particle or pinhole that causes a chrome spot or pinhole defect in the finished mask. Perkin-Elmer EBT has matched chrome spot defects that are images of known oxidized areas on PBS films with chrome spot defects detected by a KLA on finished production masks at Perkin-Elmer ALO. That similar defects have been observed on PMMA, EBR-9, and several kinds of AZ optical resists allows us to predict that oxidation of resists increases defect densities in all types of microlithography. The mechanisms of oxidation that result in discrete defects are described, and ways of reducing or eliminating such defects are discussed. © 1987, SPIE.",,"Coated materials; Electron beams; Electrons; Energy dispersive X ray analysis; Initiators (chemical); Lithography; Optical disk storage; Oxidation; Polymethyl methacrylates; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray diffraction analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Auger spectroscopy; Chemical functional groups; Chemical oxidation; Embedded particles; Infrared analysis; Oxidation changes; Particulate contamination; Physical and chemical properties; Chemical analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957503175

We measured the absolute photon flux from five foil targets using a 44-/xA, 109-MeV-elec-tron beam, and estimated the photon flux by exposing 4"" silicon wafers coated with PGMA photoresist. All previous measurements of photon production used photon-counting methods. We destructively tested foils at high-average currents for the first time. We exposed photoresist using a mask to produce a soft-x-ray lithograph. This research constitutes the first use of transition radiation as a source of soft x rays for lithography.These results indicate that moderate-energy linacs with transition radiators offer an alternative method of high power production of soft x rays for lithography. The radiation produced is at least three orders of magnitude brighter on a per-electron basis than synchrotron radiation. Storage rings have higher average beam currents than linacs; however, with a 10“2 difference in average currents, our experiments show that transition radiation will have the same average flux. Small, inexpensive accelerators such as one-klystron linacs can produce the required beam energies needed and would be less expensive than larger synchrotron sources.The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s (LLNL) electron-positron linac was used in a series of short experiments (two 8-hr. shifts) to show feasibility. The foils were located in the accelerator cave in a direct line with the linac primary beamline. Immediately downstream from the foils, the electron beam was deflected into a beam-monitoring system. The lithography station and photon detectors were located 6.4 m downstream of the foils. The silicon wafers were partially shielded from other ionizing radiation produced in the accelerator cave. The soft-x-ray radiation was emitted in a cone of apex angle ± 5 mrad, with a diameter at the wafer of approximately 10 cm. The average power at the silicon wafer was 0.28 mw using the 44-fiA beam. The x-ray flux produced a smooth exposure of the resist, resulting in the ""doughnut"" pattern that is characteristic of the transition-radiation cone. No attempt was made to determine the optimum exposure time during these runs, and the wafers were left in the photon beam for time periods between 1 to 2 hrs.Adelphi Technology currently is constructing a test station at the Stanford High Energy Physics Laboratory. The beam spot will be approximately 3 cm in diameter and will be capable of being stepped across a 4""-diameter silicon wafer. The distance from the foils to the wafer will be 1.5 m. Fluxes of 5 to 10 mw are expected to be generated with photon energies from 1 to 3 keV. © 1987 SPIE.",,"Caves; Electron beams; Electrons; Linear accelerators; Photons; Photoresists; Silicon wafers; Synchrotron radiation; Synchrotrons; Average currents; Lawrence livermore national laboratories; Photon counting method; Photon production; Soft x-ray radiation; Synchrotron source; Three orders of magnitude; Transition radiation; X rays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347384002

High energy radiation inactivated the glucose-sensitive cytochalasin B binding of each of these membrane preparations by reducing the total number of the binding sites without affecting the dissociation constant. The reduction in total number of binding sites was analyzed as a function of radiation dose based on target theory, from which a radiation-sensitive mass (target size) was calculated. When the plasma membranes of insulin-treated adipocytes were used, a target size of approximately 58,000 daltons was obtained. For adipocyte microsomal membranes, we obtained target sizes of approximately 112,000 and 109,000 daltons prior to and after insulin treatment, respectively. In the case of microsomal membranes, however, inactivation data showed anomalously low radiation sensitivities at low radiation doses, which may be interpreted as indicating the presence of a radiation-sensitive inhibitor.

BAMs are heteroassociative content addressable memories (CAMs). A BAM stores the m binary associations (A1, B1),..., (Am, Bm), where A is a point in the Boolean n-cube and B is a point in the Boolean p-cube. A is a neural network of n bivalent or continuous neurons a.; B is a network of p bivalent or continuous neurons b.. The fixed synaptic connections between the A and B networks are represented by some n-by-p real matrix M. Bidirectionality, forward and backward information flow, in neural nets produces two-way associative search for the nearest stored pair (Ai, Bi) to an input key. Every matrix is a bidirectionally stable heteroassociative CAM for both bivalent and continuous networks. This generalizes the well-known unidirectional stability for autoassociative networks with square symmetric M. When the BAM neurons are activated, the network quickly evolves to a stable state of two-pattern reverberation, or pseudo-adaptive resonance. The stable reverberation corresponds to a system energy local minimum. Heteroassociative pairs (Ai, Bi) are encoded in a BAM M by summing bipolar correlation matrices, M = X1 Y1 +... + Xm Ym, where Xi (Yi) is the bipolar version of Ai (Bi), with -Is replacing 0s. The BAM storage capacity for reliable recall is roughly m &lt; min(n, p)-pattern number is bounded by pattern dimensionality. BAM optical implementations are divided into two approaches: matrix vector multipliers and holographic correlators. The four optical BAMs described respectively emphasize a spatial light modulator, laser diodes and high-speed detectors, a reflection hologram, and a transmission hologram. © 1987 SPIE.

Because the membrane has an acoustic impedance very close to that of water, there is practically no reflection of acoustic energy from it, thereby permitting detection of near-surface flaws.

The 14C-label from [14C]glucose and [14C]sucrose taken up by the cells could be detected rapidly in phosphate esters and, after feeding of [14C]glucose was found also in sucrose. The temperature-dependent uptake process (activation energy EA about 50 kJ · mol-1) seems to be carrier mediated as indicated by its substrate saturation and, for glucose, by competition experiments which revealed positions C1, C5 and C6 of the D-glucose molecule as important for effective uptake. The apparent Km(20° C) for glucose (3-O-methylglucose) was about 1 mM whereas for sucrose a significantly lower apparent affinity was determined (Km about 10 mM). When higher concentrations of glucose (5 mM) or sucrose (20 mM) were administered, the uptake process followed first-order kinetics. Carrier-mediated transport was inhibited by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, Na-orthovanadate, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid, and by uncouplers and ionophores. The uptake system exhibited a distinct pH optimum at pH 5.0. The results indicate that generation of a proton gradient is a prerequisite for sugar uptake across the plasma membrane. Protoplasts from the bundle regions in the hypocotyl take up glucose at higher rates than those derived from bundle-free regions. The results favour the idea that apoplastic transport of assimilates en route of unloading might be restricted to distinct areas within the storage organ (i.e. the bundle region) whereas distribution in the storage parenchyma is symplastic. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.","Assimilate allocation; Beta (sugar uptake); Protoplast (sugar uptake); Sugar uptake",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001344445

In these machines the material is exposed to vacuum, to intense heat loads, and to the edge plasma. The use of graphite in such machines, therefore, depends on the outgassing behavior, the heat shock resistance, and thermochemical properties in a hydrogen plasma. Investigations of these properties made at different laboratories are described here. Experiments conducted at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Livermore, and the Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik (IPP) in Garching showed that the outgassing behavior of fine-grain reactor-grade graphite and carbon fiber composites depends on the pretreatment (manufacturing and/or storage). However, after proper outgassing the samples tested behave similarly in the case of fine-grain graphite, but the outgassing remains high for the carbon fiber composites. Heat shock tests have been made with the Electron Beam Test System (EBTS) at SNL, Albuquerque. Directly cooled graphite samples (FE 159 graphite brazed onto Mo tubes) showed no failure at a heat load of 700 W/cm2, 20 s; or 10 kW, 1 s. Thermal erosion due to sublimination and particle emission from the graphite surface was observed. This effect is related to the surface temperature and becomes significant at temperatures above 2500°K. Fourteen different types of graphite were tested; the main differences among these samples were the different surface temperatures obtained under the same heating conditions. Cracking due to heat shocks was observed in some of the samples, but none of the carbon fiber composites failed. Thermochemical properties have been tested in the PISCES plasma generator at UCLA for ion energies of around 100 eV. The formation of C-H compounds was observed spectroscopically at sample temperatures of around 600°C. However, this chemical reaction did not lead to erosion as observed in beam experiments but to a drastic change of the surface structure due to redeposition. Carbon-hydrogen lines were still observed at sample temperatures of around 100°C. Under these conditions the erosion yield is high and in agreement with those measured in beam experiments. © 1987.",,"PLASMAS; TOKAMAK DEVICES - Materials; HEAT LOADS; LIMITER; OUTGASSING; GRAPHITE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022721425

When plotted against the net all-wave radiation, the heat storage values display a hysteresis loop with the peak storage preceding that of radiation. Therefore, although a linear parameterization of heat storage is shown to produce reasonable first-order estimates of storage, a form which includes the time derivative of the net radiation is probably better. © 1987 D.

The effects of increasing glucose intake on nitrogen balance, energy expenditure and fuel utilization were measured in malnourished adult patients receiving parenteral nutrition with constant nitrogen intake and high or low glucose intakes for 8 day periods. 2. Energy balance, nitrogen balance, weight and temperature were determined daily. Blood samples taken at admission and at the end of days 7 and 8 of each diet were analysed for glucose, fatty acids, urea, insulin, glucagon and thyroid hormones. 3. The effect of increasing glucose intake was to increase nitrogen balance by 0.28 ± 0.08 (SEM) mg/kJ. A scheme is proposed, based on present and previous findings, of the separate effects of nitrogen and energy intake on nitrogen balance, permitting calculation of rates of repletion of fat and lean body mass from estimates of nitrogen intake and energy balance. Malnourished patients are shown to attain markedly positive nitrogen balances at zero or negative energy balances. Large errors in estimation of energy requirements have little effect on nitrogen balance. 4. Changes in nitrogen balance were entirely due to changes in urea excretion. 5. Creatinine excretion increased 12% with high glucose intake, attributed mainly to increased muscle mass (7%) and body temperature (4%). 6. A 12% increase in resting energy expenditure was only partly due to costs of glycogen storage and lipogenesis; the remainder, about one-half, is probably due to glucose and insulin mediated increases in sympathetic activity. 7. There were marked increases in 3,5,3'-tri-iodothyronine (T3) concentrations with time, but no difference between the high and low glucose diets. The T3/thyroxine ratio, an index of free T3 concentration, increased much more rapidly on the high than on the low glucose diet.

We have studied indirect gap GaAs/AlAs superlattice alloys using x-ray diffraction and pressure dependent magneto-luminescence. Analysis of the x-ray data shows that the AlAs layers are strained to be pseudomorphic with the GaAs substrate. Because the indirect conduction band ground state derives from the AlAs X-point these superlattice alloys must be treated as strained-layer superlattices. Interpretation of luminescence data using Kronig-Penney and tight-binding analyses of the superlattice bandstructure and optical dipole matrix elements shows that this experiment provides a sensitive measure of the conduction band offset for the GaAs/AlAs system. Quantum size effects lift the three-fold degeneracy of the X-point to yield an in-plane X band quantized according to the transverse electron mass (Xt) and a separate X band along the superlattice axis quantized according to the longitudinh electron mass (X1).

Here we report the first comprehensive investigation of those phenomena in total internal reflection (TIR) face-pumped lasers. The results to be presented here were made possible by the development of two three-dimensional computer codes. The first (PARA) systematically searches for parasitic oscillations in slab lasers and determines the gain required to reach threshold. Our second code (AMSPE) is a three dimensional raytrace model which includes temporal gain and allows for non-uniform gain profiles. AMSPE calculates the gain depletion as well as changes in spatial gain profile and thus the decrease in amplifier efficiency as a function of a number of critical parameters such as slab aspect ratio, spontaneous emission spectral profile, and slab face angle. In this paper we first review the classes of parasitics in slab lasers and show how symmetry breaking can significantly increase the energy storage capability of such deyices. We then review the construction of the AMSPE code and show how it may be used to identify maximum efficiency slab laser configurations. © 1987 SPIE.",,"CODES, SYMBOLIC - Applications; Aspect ratio; Codes (symbols); Laser applications; Pumping (laser); Refractive index; Solid state lasers; Spontaneous emission; AMPLIFIED SPONTANEOUS EMISSION; FACE-PUMPED TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION LASERS; NON-UNIFORM GAIN PROFILES; PARASITIC OSCILLATIONS; THREE-DIMENSIONAL COMPUTER CODES; TWO-DIMENSIONAL MODES; LASERS, SOLID STATE; Laser mirrors; Amplified spontaneous emissions; Emission spectral; Face-pumped lasers; Maximum Efficiency; Parasitic oscillations; Slab aspect ratio; Storage capability; Total internal reflections",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023599048

To date, with few exceptions, atomic physics studies have been limited to rare gases and a few metal vapors, and to photoexcitation energies in the VUV region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These limitations can now be overcome using photons produced by high-brightness synchrotron storage rings, such as the X-ray ring at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven. Furthermore, calculations indicate that irradiation of an ion trap with an intense energetic photon beam will result in a viable source of highly-charged ions that can be given the name PHOBIS: the photon beam ion source. Promising results, which encourage the wider systematic use of synchrotron radiation in atomic physics research, have been obtained in recent experiments on VUV photoemission and the production and storage of multiply-charged ions.

This simple technique appears to be consistent with other internal stress measurement techniques. It was found that the effective stress approaches a limiting value with applied strain and an extrapolated yield point could be defined. The limiting value is a function of the strain rate during the initial load application. The general increase in applied stress (at fixed applied strain) with crosshead speed was attributed to the increase in magnitude of the effective stress. The maximum peak ratio of effective over recovery stress, at each crosshead speed, could indicate that it was the energy-dissipating part of the material that played a dominant role in the early stages of the deformation while the energy-storage part dominated the latter stages. © 1987 Chapman and Hall Ltd.",,"MATERIALS TESTING; MATERIALS TESTING APPARATUS; STRAIN; EFFECTIVE STRESSES; INTERNAL STRESSES; RECOVERY STRESS; STRAIN TRANSIENT DIP TEST; POLYVINYL CHLORIDE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023332051

The growth rate of the vertival betatron amplitude is calculated for beam halves with opposite polarizations rotating in the horizontal plane, at intrinsic spin resonance aγ ± νy = integer. This polarization method would work best with rings having large diameter, low vertical emittance, low vertical betatron tune, and strong superconducting quadrupoles. Provided that suitable strong quadrupoles exist, the method might advantageously replace the present technique for obtaining polarized proton or heavy ion beams, where low energy polarized beams are first generated by a source and then accelerated through numerous depolarizing resonances up to the final energy. Although the proposed self-polarization in the present colliders and storage rings might be impractically slow, it is shown that in a purpose-built machine the vertical splitting rate of the beam might be reasonably fast compared with the beam blowup or decay. © 1987.",,"ACCELERATORS - Storage Rings; MAGNETS; POLARIZATION; QUADRUPOLE FIELDS; STERN-GERLACH EFFECT; PROTONS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023329262

We have now investigated parameters of ultrasonic hydrogenation and the quality of the resulting products. Refined and bleached soybean oil was hydrogenated continuously with and without ultrasonic energy at different temperatures, pressures and catalyst concentrations. Flavor and oxidative stability of the oils were compared with a commercially hydrogenated soybean oil. The extent of hydrogenation (ΔIV) was not affected by temperature between 245 and 290 C, but was greater at 106 psig than at 65 psig hydrogen pressure. The ΔIV of hydrogenated oils increased linearly with catalyst concentration from 40 ppm to 150 ppm nickel. At the same catalyst concentration the IV drop was significantly increased when ultrasonic energy was used. By reducing the amount of power supplied to the ultrasonic reactor to 40% of full power, the specific power (watts/ΔIV) was lowered by 60%. Linolenate selectivities and specific isomerization (%trans/ΔIV) remained the same, but linoleate selectivities were lower than for batch hydrogenation under varied operating parameters. Flavor scores were not significantly different, initially or after storage eight days at 60 C, for oils continuously hydrogenated with and without ultrasonic energy.

A comparative study of Mg2Ni and a mechanically alloyed mixture Mg-55wt.%Ni has been recently carried out in the laboratory. The mixture presents some interesting properties and the preparation of this material is easier and less energy consuming owing to the absence of heating. However, while the hydrogen capacity (3.2 wt.%) is close to that of Mg2Ni, it is significantly smaller than that of magnesium (7.6 wt.%). Therefore, to improve this characteristic, several compositions of mechanically alloyed mixtures Mg-xwt.%Ni with a lower nickel weight content have been studied (x = 5, 10 and 25). It was shown that the amount of nickel has an important effect on the hydriding-dehydriding kinetics. The decrease of the particle size and the augmentation of the density of defects are because of hydriding-dehydriding cycling. These effects are enhanced by an increase in the nickel content and increase the rate of the hydriding and dehydriding reactions. In contrast, the hydrogen storage capacity diminishes as the amount of nickel increases. For these reasons, Mg-10wt.%Ni and Mg-25wt.%Ni are the most favourable compositions. © 1987.",,"CHEMICAL REACTIONS - Reaction Kinetics; HYDROGEN - Absorption; DEHYDRIDING KINETICS; MECHANICALLY ALLOYED MIXTURES; PLANETARY MILL; MAGNESIUM NICKEL ALLOYS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022687691

When Mg2Ni was mixed with nickel thermal ballast and was hydrided in the copper tube reactor, the temperature rise was reduced to less than 2 °C. From the rate data obtained using the copper tube reactor, the hydriding kinetics were studied. Although all former researchers have obtained a negative activation energy, a positive activation energy was obtained for the first time in this study. This indicates that the negative activation energy found by previous workers was because of the heat effect. By the removal of the heat effect the absorption rate is increased by about one order of magnitude. At the initial stage of the reaction the rate-controlling step is found to be forced flow, but at the later stage surface reaction is the rate-controlling step.

The commercial size of SMES studied in these activities is 5 GWh in capacity and 1 GW in power. The diameter of superconducting coil is 400 - 1500 meters. The comprehensive conclusions derived from the works are that there are no unresolvable technological breakthrough for construction and the existence of its commercial viabilities. However the studies have ignored many technological items related to complete commercialization of such unit. The protection method of superconducting coil is one of them. Needless to say, SMES should be as safe and reliable as power plants. In any case of accidents in SMES, the whole stored energy in such huge system can not be discharged in a short time to protect the superconducting coil. If it should be, the heavy disturbance given to the utility lines by energy dumping or high voltage will be generated on the terminals of the coil. Then an idea of coil protection that the whole stored energy is absorbed by its enthalpy keeping its temperature lower than the permissible level was proposed. (3) However the quick quench of the whole superconducting coil is overwhelming in this case. The local hot spot will pose significant problems. Even if such conditions are fulfilled, internal voltage generation comes to the next difficulties.

Although granules can be made fairly readily when isolating rubber from either latex or solution, they tend to agglomerate to solid blocks on storage unless high levels of partitioning agents are present. Conventional size-reduction equipment usually requires two operations: guillotining followed by granulating, and is labor intensive and not very energy efficient. Conventional granulators also can create frictional heat, some of which is passed into the rubber and can degrade properties. Through design innovations the Blackfriars bale granulator solves these problems. Processing from a standard 35 kg bale down to granules is achieved in a single, energy-efficient operation. Due to rotor design, frictional heating of material is greatly reduced. Most commonly available natural and synthetic rubbers can be processed from the standard 35 kg bale, with considerable variation in bale size being accommodated. The granule produced can be as small as 5 mm although typical requirements range from 10 to 50 mm.

When grown under conditions of excess carbon and energy (either methanol or acetate) and limiting nitrogen, M. thermophila accumulated a polysaccharide which could be hydrolyzed to glucose by the enzyme amyloglucosidase. This polysaccharide reached levels of 20 mg polysaccharide per g protein in nitrogen-limited cells, while cells limited for carbon, as well as cells in the exponential phase of growth, did not accumulate significant amounts of this polysaccharide. Thin-section electron micrographs of M. thermophila showed glycogen-like inclusion granules in nitrogen-limited cells but not in carbon-limited or exponential-phase cells. These granules were stained by a polysaccharide-specific staining procedure, the PATO stain. The polysaccharide was purified from cell extracts, the iodine-polysaccharide complex gave a maximum absorption at between 500 and 510 nm. The polysaccharide was mobilized within 21 h by cells starved for a carbon/energy source. N-Limited (polysaccharide-containing) acetategrown cells could shift to methanogenesis from methanol more quickly than did C-limited acetate-grown cells lacking polysaccharide, and ATP levels remained higher in N-limited cells.

Standard wiggler designs have a quasi sinusoidal magnetic field distribution resulting in a - more or less - perfect cancellation of right/left handed circularly polarized photons emitted from successive poles. We show here that one can easily generate a periodic but asymmetric magnetic field distribution having a field integral still equal to zero in order to maintain a straight overall direction of the particle trajectory. Due to the asymmetry of the field distribution in our device, the synchrotron radiation along the wiggler axis can keep a high degree of circular polarization above or below the particle trajectory plane. As compared to standard bending magnets, the proposed device can afford a significant increase of the available flux of circularly polarized light which is typically proportional to the number of magnetic periods. As compared now to the two crossed field undulator system, our wiggler device definitively offers a much broader spectral range of emission and far more flexibility regarding energy scanned experiments which might prove to be very difficult with a two crossed field undulator device. The wiggler described here should also accomodate any future or already existing machine with common lattices while a two crossed field undulator system is only to work on very low emittance storage rings. © 1987.",,"MAGNETIC FIELDS; POLARIZATION; SYNCHROTRON RADIATION; WIGGLER; ACCELERATORS, SYNCHROTRON",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023287589

The bits written on the multi-layered Bi/Se films are very clean and comparable to those of the best known optical recording media. Intrin-sic S/N, corrected for the substrate defects on these films, is the same or slightly better than that of 300A pure Te thin film on glass substrate.

In fact, some Bi/Se bilayer films made more than 10 years ago still show little signs of degradation.

A crossbar network can be achieved using holographic elements which permit to connect independently all inputs and all outputs. The incorporation of dynamic holographic materials is enticing as this will render the interconnection changeable. However, it is necessary to find first a passive method permitting to achieve beam deflection and secondly a photosensitive material of high optical quality requiring low power levels to optically induce the refractive index changes. We first describe an optical method allowing to produce very large deflections of light beams thus enabling to randomly address any spot on a plane. Such a technique appears applicable to both interconnections of VLSI chips and random access of optical memories. Our scheme for realizing dynamic optical interconnects is based on Bragg diffraction of the beam to steer by a dynamic phase grating which spacing and orientation are changeable in real time. This is achieved in a passive way by acting on the optical frequency of the control beams used to record the dynamic grating. Deflection angles of 15° have been experimentally demonstrated for a 27 nm shift in the control wavelength. For a larger wavelength scanning (50 nm), 28° deflections are anticipated while maintaining the Bragg condition satisfied. We then discuss some issues related to photosensitive materials able to dynamically record the optically induced refractive index change. The specific example of Bi12 Si 020 or Bi12 Ge 020 photorefractive crystals is presented. Indeed these materials are very attractive as they require low driving energy and exhibit a memory effect. This latter property permits to achieve numerous iterations between computing cells before reconfiguration of the interconnect network. © 1987 SPIE.",,"Deflection (structures); Diffraction gratings; Holography; Light; Light sensitive materials; Optical data processing; Photorefractive crystals; Photosensitivity; Random access storage; Refractive index; Semiconductor quantum wells; Holographic elements; Interconnect networks; Large-scale interconnections; Multiple light beams; Photosensitive materials; Refractive index changes; Very large deflection; Wavelength scanning; Integrated circuit interconnects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957514352

Moreover the class of functions suitable for linkage representation is large. For all these reasons numerous recent works deal with the problem of design mechanisms for robotic applications, but very often in terms of components such as gripper, transmission, balancing. We investigate a new application for linkages, using them to design industrial manipulator. The selected mechanism for this application is a four bar linkage with an adjustable lengh for exact path generation. This adjustment is performed by a track or cam which is substituted to a bar. By this mean, we define a cam-modulated linkage which possess superior accuracy potential and is capable of accomodating of industrial design restrictions. Such a kinematic chain is free from structural error for path generation and the presence of the track introduces the flexibility and versality in the usefull four bar chain. The synthesis technique of cam modulated linkage utilizes loop closure equations, envelop theory to find the centerline and the profile of the track. These techniques provide a systematic approach to the design of mechanism for path generation when extreme accuracy is required. In order to complete an contribution, we take in consideration the static balancing of the synthesized manipulator.

The model accounts for conduction and convection in the reservoir and instantaneous heat generation by combustion at a moving front, as well as, heat losses to cap and base rocks by conduction. In the model, the energy equation is first solved by the implicit technique to obtain temperature distribution following the burning of a block at a given injection rate. For pressure and saturation calculations. small time steps are used to obtain stable solutions of the non-linear, partial differential equations for the flow of gas, water and oil using the IMPES method. The model has been applied to study the injection and production performance of a combustion pilot in operation for about ten years in a heavy oil reservoir in the Lloydminster area. Predicated well pressures and oil production rates agree with the reported field data. The model shows that gas drive is one of the main oil recovery mechanisms associated with the fire flood process in a relatively thin heavy oil reservoir. Based on the oil recovery mechanism identified, the model was employed to investigate the effects of oxygen content, air and water rates, and fuel concentration on oil production in a given reservoir. The model also was used to study the effects of formation thickness and fluids saturations on the expected fire flood performance. From these sensitivity analyses, the optimal air injection rate and oxygen content can be determined for a given reservoir. © 1987 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

Frequency domain finite-difference solutions are readily generated by using this technique. The direct forward scattered waves are modelled with a single pass of the extrapolator operator in the paraxial direction for each frequency. For heterogeneous models, transmission and reflection coefficients are determined at structural boundaries within the media. The first-order back scattered energy can then be modelled by extrapolation (in the opposite direction) of the reflected field determined on the first pass. Higher order multiple scattering can be included by sweeping through the model with more passes. The chief advantages of the paraxial approach are 1) active storage is reduced by one dimension as compared to solutions that solve upgoing and downgoing waves simultaneously, 2) the decomposition in frequency allows the technique to be implemented on highly-parallel machines such the hypercube, 3) attenuation can be modelled as an arbitrary function of frequency, and 4) only a small number of frequencies are needed to produce movie-like time slices. By using this method a wide range of seismological problems can be addressed, including strong motion analysis of waves in three-dimensional basins, the modelling of VSP reflection data, and the analysis of whole earth problems such as scattering at the coremantle boundary or the effect of tectonic boundaries on long-period wave propagation. © 1996-2018 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

The possible benefits of the presence of the vacuole can be divided into those which are related merely to the increased volume of the protoplast, independent of the nature of the vacuolar contents, and those which depend on the nature of the solutes in the vacuole. Increasing the volume of the protoplast per unit volume of cytoplasm increases the total surface area of the cell per unit of cytoplasmic volume. This area amplification has potential benefits in terms of resource acquisition under resource‐limiting conditions. At a given chromophore concentration in the cytoplasm, dispersal of a given volume of cytoplasm at the periphery of a vacuole increases the efficiency of photon absorption of an ‘average’ chromophore molecule relative to a comparable non‐vacuolate cell, unless the chromophore concentration is low arid/or the cell is very small (no package effect) or the total chromophore per unit projected area is such that almost all light is absorbed, regardless of vacuolation. The area amplification also increases the plasmalemma area per unit cytoplasmic volume through which‘lipid solution’, or mediated transport of chemical resources can occur on a cytoplasmic volume basis and decreases the impediment to resource transfer from a bulk aqueous phase to the cell surface, again on a cytoplasmic volume basis. The increased capacity for uptake of chemical resources from low external concentrations due to vacuolation can increase overall solute acquisition, except in cells of picoplankton size, although other remedies for restricted capacity for chemical nutrient uptake per unit cytoplasmic volume are possible (e.g. evaginations of the cell surface). In addition to these potential benefits of vacuolation which are essentially independent of the contents of the vacuole, and which relate almost entirely to the rate at which resources can be acquired, there are potentially beneficial effects of vacuolation (dependent on specific vacuolar contents) on the acquisition of resources, and on the storage, manipulation and protection of resources which have already been acquired. Effects of vacuolation which involve essentially irreversible deposition (within the life of the cell) of specific solutes in the vacuole embrace the acquisition, manipulation and protection of resources, but not, of course, true (‘reversible’) storage. Deposition‐related increases in resource (at least phosphate and iron) acquisition capacity can, in attached rhizophytic macrophytes, result from rhizosphere acidification involving accumulation of cation salts of organic acid anions in the vacuole. Related to resource acquisition (CO2, H2O) in terrestrial halophytes is the disposal of ‘excess’ salt entering the roots by deposition in hypertrophied vacuoles. Resource manipulation involving deposition of salts of organic acid anions occurs as a means of OH− disposal in the reduction of NO3− in the shoot, a process which can increase the photon and water use efficiency of N assimilation. Resource protection in plants often involves the deposition of antibiophage solutes in the vacuoles. The possible osmotic problems engendered by cation organate deposition can be ameliorated by production of insoluble calcium oxalate. Reversible accumulation of solutes in vacuoles is involved in CAM, which can increase the water (and nitrogen?) use efficiency of carbon assimilation, and may be involved in the storage of fermentation products during temporary anoxia. The storage of soluble compounds in vacuoles during CAM cannot, apparently, be replaced by that of insoluble materia; there is some scope for storage of insoluble waxes during fermentation. Storage of energy and carbon (as reduced carbon), phosphorus and nitrogen often involves soluble low‐molecular weight materials in large vacuoles, but can also, in all three cases, involve polymers in smaller vacuoles or in other parts of the cytoplasm. Other potentially beneficial effects of vacuolation include a (mechanistically unexplained) stimulation of the velocity of cytoplasmic streaming in large vacuolate cells and a role in buffering cytoplasmic volume from rapid, large changes in cells (e.g. stomata) undergoing large changes in protoplast volume. Against these putative benefits must be set, in terms of natural selection, the costs of vacuolation. These costs include the costs (energy, solutes) of producing, and those (energy) of maintaining the vacuoles, and the costs (energy, carbon) of synthesizing the extra wall material. The additional costs (all on a unit cytoplasm basis) can be substantial relative to benefits in terms of additional energy and carbon acquisition resulting from vacuolation. Additional costs may be incurred in relation to the energetics of large cells maintaining a constant turgor pressure in environments (e.g. estuaries) with frequent and large changes in external osmolarity, and as colonization opportunities lost if vacuolation reduces desiccation tolerance. The analysis conducted in the paper suggests that the specific growth rate of a cell of a given cytoplasmic volume under optimal growth conditions is decreased if it is vacuolated. Furthermore, the resource acquisition rate of the cell under conditions of low resource availability may be enhanced by vacuolation, even when the resource costs of vacuolation are taken into consideration, although this is not invariably so. Nevertheless, although the cost‐benefit analysis of resource acquisition may not always favour vacuolation, the presence of vacuoles may still lead to an increase in inclusive fitness when benefits in relation to the storage, manipulation and protection of resources are also considered. At all events, most phototrophs are vacuolate, the major exception being many planktophytes (where the lack of vacuoles may be rationalized, at least for smaller cells) and essentially all microalga‐invertebrate synthesis.

These are l) Receiving, 2) Fermentation, 3) Pasteurization and Inoculation, 4) Vegetative Growth, and 5) Fructification. The structure was built on cement blocks with tin roof and utilizes roof height and ventilation system (fans and windows) to regular ambient temperature and light requirements. A steam generator is the only equipment in the system and pipes in rooms 3, 4 and 5 permit steaming of rooms, substrates and materials. At this time, production schemes previously developed at the laboratory and greenhouse, are being tested and fine tuned in this newly constructed mushroom house at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus. © 1987, Elsevier B.V.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023276285

These organelles are sometimes found close to mitochondria and chloroplasts. Such associations could frequently be observed in sections of leaves from the high alpine plant Ranunculus glacialis (Lutz and Moser 1977). This species shows interesting photosynthetic properties: net photosynthesis (CO2-fixation) needs more than 80 klux for saturation; CO2-uptake is possible between — 7°C and +38°C (Moser et al. 1977). In general, close associations of microbodies to mitochondria and chloroplasts indicate the presence of an active photorespiratory metabolism. Microbodies in the leaves of C3-plants are numerous and show high catalase activity as demonstrated with the DAB-test. This property shows high levels of photorespiration (Frederick and Newcomb 1969). The oxygen uptake in light might be useful for formation of amino acids like serine and glycine; however, metabolic consequences of this “respiration” are mostly discussed as a waste of energy (Heber and Krause 1980, Ogren 1984). Plants, growing under unfavorable environmental conditions, instead should have developed pathways to use energy as efficiently as possible. An avoidance of photorespiratory activity similar to C4-plants was never found in high alpine species, which have to grow at relatively low temperatures. Furthermore, the C4-metabolism is not established in Ranunculales (Monson et al. 1984). Other activities of leaf peroxisomes have been described in the last years: in contrast to earlier results, they should be intensively involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids (Gerhardt 1983). Recently, Stabenau et al. (1984) described the β-oxidation of fatty acids in algal microbodies, too. Lipid degradation as organelle function would make sense in view of the short growing season of plants from high altitudes, if they contain lipids as an energy storage form for use during their fast development in the alpine summer. Cytochemical characterization of the microbodies in leaves of Ranunculus glacialis should give information about their eventual photorespiratory activity. The occurrence of lipid bodies is also traced in favour of possible lipid oxidation activities. These studies should be the basis for subsequent physiological investigations: studies of photorespiration, and the biochemistry of lipid mobilization and cytochemical analyses have been never performed in high alpine plants. However, understanding of plant life in extreme environments requires more information from cytology and biochemistry. © 1987, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

Box 2703, Beijing, China","Based on the statistic analysis of numerous experiments, especially for the PPT discharge, it is clear that the ignition process of the main discharge including the waveform and its peak value is able to change over a wide range. When the thruster is in operation the main discharge current is the key to efficient conversion of electrical energy into the directed mechanical force. Its variation has the probabilistic features and its amplitude has a certain distribution. The article tries to determine the factors affecting the waveform amplitude distribution in order to raise the thruster’s dynamic performance and to improve the waveform itself. Ultimately it should be possible to design a thruster with high performances. The amplitude characteristic of main discharge current is determined by such parameters of the circuit, as initial voltage, connection between the main gap and the element for energy storage, condition of propellant’s working surface etc., The electrical feature describing the physics of the main discharge process has even a great effect. In the transient from open circuit through ignition to the main discharge occurrence, the ignition has an obvious influence upon the process. A successful ignition can result formation of a very distinct discharge and a rapid rise time to produce a normal waveform with a high peak. It is logical to assume that for foundation of the main discharge the ignition ability plays an important role. It is more reasonable and convenient to change ignition energy level than needs. To investigate the effect of the ignition process one must keep such factors as the thruster configuration and ignition circuit, the concerned electrical parameters and the operation condition as the constant. In order to obtain sufficient data of the order of 105 discharges, the CES (Computerized Experiment system) has been used to collect data in real time and to complete respective on-line analysis. A relationship between the minimum ignition energy Eig(min) required for an effective discharge and the effective main discharge current Idis(aff) is shown to be: K.q.Exp(Eig(min))≥Idia (eff) On the basis of the equation the ignition energy can control the development of the main discharge and current amplitude which gives an evident effect on the discharge efficiency. © 1987 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The new algorithm shows particular promise for potential energy minimization of large molecular systems. Usual implementations of Newton's method require storage space proportional to the number of atoms squared (i.e., O(N2)) and computer time of O(N3). Our suggested implementation of the Truncated Newton technique requires storage of less than O(N1.5) and CPU time of less than O(N2) for structures containing several hundred to a few thousand atoms. The algorithm exhibits quadratic convergence near the minimum and is also very tolerant of poor initial structures. A comparison with existing optimization procedures is detailed for cyclohexane, arachidonic acid, and the small protein crambin. In particular, a structure for crambin (662 atoms) has been refined to an RMS gradient of 3.6 × 10−6 kcal/mol/Å per atom on the MM2 potential energy surface. Several suggestions are made which may lead to further improvement of the new method. Copyright © 1987 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988112508

Truncated Newton methods, in particular, are emerging as a versatile subclass. In this article we present a truncated Newton algorithm specifically developed for potential energy minimization. The method is globally convergent with local quadratic convergence. Its key ingredients are: (1) approximation of the Newton direction far away from local minima, (2) solution of the Newton equation iteratively by the linear Conjugate Gradient method, and (3) preconditioning of the Newton equation by the analytic second‐derivative components of the “local” chemical interactions: bond length, bond angle and torsional potentials. Relaxation of the required accuracy of the Newton search direction diverts the minimization search away from regions where the function is nonconvex and towards physically interesting regions. The preconditioning strategy significantly accelerates the iterative solution for the Newton search direction, and therefore reduces the computation time for each iteration. With algorithmic variations, the truncated Newton method can be formulated so that storage and computational requirements are comparable to those of the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient method. As the convergence rate of nonlinear Conjugate Gradient methods is linear and performance less predictable, the application of the truncated Newton code to potential energy functions is promising.

These measurements are analogous to measurements of carbon fixation (CO2 uptake) at different irradiances and photosynthetic activities. Nitrite uptake as a function of irradiance did not follow Michaelis‐Menten kinetics as proposed for nitrate by MacIsaac and Dugdale (1972) because of inhibition at high irradiances. The Haldane equation described nitrite uptake better. Nitrite uptake as a function of oxygenic photosynthesis followed Michaelis‐Menten kinetics. Irradiance‐dependent (Haldane) and photosynthesis‐dependent models described nitrite uptake equally well. We suggest that nitrite is taken up and assimilated in response to intracellular concentrations of photoreductant that are directly proportional to photosynthetic activity and are related indirectly to irradiance. This contention is supported by photosynthesis‐dependent nitrite uptake (Michaelis‐Menten) at both light‐limited and photoinhibited photosynthetic activities. This is consistent conceptually with deactivation of light traps at high irradiance levels. The proportion of photoreductant allocated to nitrite uptake and assimilation increased markedly at low irradiance levels. This indicates that cells synthesize important N‐containing biomolecules across a broader range of irradiance levels than fixation of carbon for synthesis of energy storage and structural products.

Among the grafting parameters, the most important are storage time after irradiation, grafting time, grafting temperature, and absorbed dose. Trapped radicals in PVF2 are very stable; peroxy radicals generated by storage of irradiated samples in air can initiate grafting, too. The grafting of PVF2 proceeds slowly from the film surface to the inner part, ceasing when the middle of the film is reached from both sides. The penetration of the grafting front has been observed by “Differential‐Interference‐Contrast” (DIC)‐microscopy. At constant other parameters, the penetration depth depends on the grafting time and can be correlated with the time conversion curves. For the discussion of the grafting reaction a simple kinetic model has been developed. A very high activation energy of diffusion of ∼ 80 kJ mol−1 has been estimated both by sorption measurements and by application of the kinetic model with regard to the activation energies of grafting rate and saturation grafting yield (SGY). From the SGY‐dose relationship the ratio of the rate constants kpkt−1 has been calculated. As for other grafting systems this ratio has about the 105‐fold value in relation to homopolymerization of the same monomer. This indicates the restrained mobility of propagating macroradicals in the highly viscous grafting medium leading particularly to a lower kt in comparison with homopolymerization. © 1987 Hüthig &amp; Wepf Verlag, Basel",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981890666

Pentland Javelin) were stored in darkness or diffuse daylight at 9°C and transferred at intervals to conditions suitable for sprouting, their capacity for sprout growth was unaffected by the presence or absence of light during previous storage. When similar tubers were stored at 10°C, 18°C or 25°C, sprout growth commenced earliest at 25°C, but the date was unaffected by fluorescent light. It was concluded that light did not affect the length of the dormant period, but only the rate of sprout elongation after that period had ceased. When tubers with growing sprouts at 10°C or 18°C were transferred from darkness into fluorescent light, sprout growth virtually ceased. Transfer from light into darkness resulted in immediate sprout growth, at a rate comparable with tubers stored continuously in the dark. Tubers of three Peruvian cultivars, stored in farm‐scale diffuse‐daylight stores, grew progressively shorter sprouts with increasing daily exposure to light from 30 min to 12 h. Storage of cv. Wilja under 21 Wm‐2 (total) of white fluorescent light for 10 h per day maintained the sprouts at the same length as ten times this light intensity for 1 h per day. In a subsequent experiment with cv. Bintje the 10 h, low‐intensity light regime gave slightly shorter sprouts. It appeared that the total light energy falling on the tubers was the dominant factor controlling sprout growth. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

A computer simulation model has been devised, which predicts the pattern of changes in body weight which result from the annual cycle of agricultural work load, and the way in which food consumption is regulated over the year. The model also includes the effect of post-harvest storage losses. The actual observed patterns of food use of farmers in The Gambia, and in Burma, are first of all used to simulate the seasonal changes in body weight and these agree well with observations. The effects of alternative strategies of food use are then tried, ranging from a constant intake throughout the year, to an exaggerated feasting and fasting cycle. The simulations show that the actual food allocation patterns adopted by these two peasant populations constitute an optimum strategy in which the need to achieve maximum body weight at the time when peak work output is required, is balanced against the need to minimise the losses due to long term food storage. © 1987, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This power supply concept uses a second superconductive coil for energy storage. Large reversable power demands of the load magnet are met by energy exchange between the storage and load coils, through the DFC bridge. This paper will show that the DFC circuit can be decomposed into two elementary single flying capacitor (SLC) circuits which can be controlled independently. The discovery of this decoupled control concept is the origin of several new control strategies which significantly improve the performance of DFC power supplies, microcomputer controllers containing the decoupled control algorithm were tested on a DFC system simulator. The results show that time optimal load coil current and voltage control is now achievable by a robust bang-bang control technique. Furthermore, load coil current ripple and voltage spectrum can be independently controlled, while following an arbitrary reference signal. The DFC bridge, with the decoupled controllers, is a high performance power supply candidate for superconductive magnets of fusion reactors, particle accelerators and other systems. © 1987 IEEE.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939007153

Paraffin wax was used as the PCM and a black dye was added to it to vary its absorption coefficient. Samples composed of the PCM layer and an insulating layer with adiabatic rear side were tested using a solar simulator with constant incident radiation. A theoretical analysis was carried out by applying. the concept of overall specific heat. The numerical results agreed fairly well with the experimental results within the range of the present experimental conditions and so this theoretical analysis proved to be valid.

Awealth of spectroscopic information could be obtained, e.g. on condensed molecules, small clusters, porous and smooth films, atomic chemisorption states and corroded surfaces. Binding energies below and above EF, bulk and surface densities of states, work function changes, alloy concentrations and adsorbate coverages, specific data on chemical bonds and their orbital character, and parameters of adsorption kinetics were derived. Although space limitation did not allow to discuss all the surface science behind the examples, I hope that the potential of the various photoelectron spectroscopies became evident. Which developments and improvements can we expect in the near future? Clearly one desirable goal is to obtain spatial resolution in XPS investigations (""submicron resolution for sub-micron structures""). This would give the opportunity to study e.g. the local electronic structure at extended defects. As compared to scanning Auger techniques, scanning XPS will be a much less damaging technique, in particular with respect to adsorbate systems. The feasibility of a scanning photoelectron microscope was studied recently (ref. 48): On the basis of a synchrotron light source and zone plate X-ray optics a spatial resolution of 50 nm seems possible, at an energy resolution of 1 eV and count rates of the order of 104 cps. Another point of development concerns ""real-time"" PES. This allows e.g. to study reaction dynamics as a function of time and temperature or to investigate diffusion processes in an interface region. Two approaches have been attempted: Time-modulated reactive beam techniques may be combined with UPS, giving a time-resolved photoelectron signal from adsorbates and intermediate species (ref. 49). Otherwise a time scale down to picoseconds can be defined in experiments using the pulse-structure of synchrotron light from storage rings (ref. 9), or in two-photon absorption experiments where one of the photon sources is a pulsed laser. Once spatial resolution and time resolution will be routinely available in combination with the various electron spectroscopies discussed above, qualitatively new insights into the mechanisms of chemisorption may be expected.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957529848

The major function of these lipoproteins is the transport of energy-rich triglyceride from the intestine and the liver to sites of storage and utilization. The two major classes in this group are the chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). The proportion of triglyceride is higher in chylomicrons than in VLDL and there are important differences in apoprotein composition. A characteristic difference between the two triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is in the nature of the obligatory structural apoprotein, (apo)B. The intravascular catabolism of VLDL is regulated, at least initially, along similar lines to that of chylomicrons. There is early transfer of apoC and apoE from high-density lipoproteins (HDL) that controls the rates at which delipidation and removal take place. Remodeling of VLDL remnants is also required and involves the transfer of unwanted surface lipid and protein to HDL and exchange of core lipids between VLDL and HDL. © 1987, Elsevier B.V.

This is coupled to a vapour compression water chiller with a total cooling capacity of 65 ton refrigeration. Present work shows the benefits of combining solar, desalination, power and cooling disciplines to obtain a reasonably cheap solar cooling system. Hot water leaves a flat plate collector/storage loop at 95°C and is introduced into a flashing chamber. In the Brayton cycle, the generated vapour from the chamber is compressed, heated in a regenerator using turbine exhaust steam and passes to a fuel-fired superheater. The superheated steam at 120 kPa, 400°C expands in a steam turbine coupled directly to the vapour compressor. The net shaft power output drives a separate vapour compression cooling unit. In this theoretical cycle the nonsolar input energy represents 16% of the system total energy requirements with a basic power cycle efficiency of 15.7%. The overall coefficient of performance of this system is comparable to that of a sophisticated, pressurized solar cooling system with suntracking parabolic troughs. Comparison with the fuel-assisted solar steam Rankine power cycle shows that the present cycle requires 21% less fuel per unit power produced, with a 30% reduction in the superheater volume required, and requires 16% instead of 22% nonsolar energy. © 1987.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45949126901

Monthly average meteorological data were then used as inputs to the computer program for predicting long-term system performance, as indicated by the fraction of annual heating load supplied by solar energy. Results from simulation runs suggested that monthly solar heating fraction may be correlated with a dimensionless variable that involved mean daily solar radiation on an outside horizontal surface, total capture factor of the greenhouse cover, and night-time heat load.

Phase I previously described all those projects already completed or underway which have inadvertently and/or unintentionally served the purpose of sea-level regulation. These forms of Phase I sea-level regulation include large and small reservoirs, irrigation projects, water infiltration schemes, farm ponds, and swimming and reflecting pools.

Their advent has created a need to disseminate the large volume of data presented by such models to potential users in a convenient and abbreviated form. Taking as an example the theoretical thermospheric model developed at University College London, England, it is inconvenient to transmit the data by print-out, magnetic tape, disk media, electronic mail or networks. The number of individual parameters computed in a data set corresponding to a ""steady-state"" 24 h simulation, contains 3.8 × 106 real numbers, describing 15 pressure levels, 91 steps in latitude, 20 steps in longitude, 20 steps in Universal Time, and at least seven geophysical (atmospheric) parameters. These large numerical data sets exist for each of some 50 complete thermospheric simulations, covering a range of solar, geomagnetic and seasonal conditions. A process of high energy Fourier filtering has been used to reduce the data volume by a factor of up to 150, a data set size which is convenient for storage and electronic transmission purposes. A four-dimensional array, i.e. latitude vs longitude vs height vs time, can be quickly and conveniently reconstructed with high fidelity, for each individual atmospheric parameter using a VAX or PC computer. This provides a convenient and rapid means of disseminating verified data from the global simulations to end users. © 1987.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45949113884

The one- and three-charged-particle inclusive branching ratios of the decay are measured to be B1=(84.7±1.0)% and B3=(15.1±1.0)%, where B1+B3 is constrained to be 99.85%.

This analysis of the reproductive strategy shows that A. boyeri can rapidly adapt its life history and morphology to environments ranging from freshwater to polyhaline coastal lagoons and oceanic waters. The optimum strategy is shown to be tied to temperate seasonality: the cold winters act to lengthen the life cycle, and result in cyclic switching of energy between reproduction, somatic growth and fat storage. The adaptability of the fish to a range of environmental characters is viewed as being due to natural selection acting to produce a genotype capable of a flexible phenotypic response. This flexibility is essential for survival in the highly variable inshore/brackish habitat. It is argued that such preadaptive plasticity, coupled with the potential for populations to become isolated, produces ideal conditions for speciation. The importance of the coastal, estuarine and lagoonal environment as a springboard for teleost evolution is discussed. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

Its purpose was to better understand the relevant scientific topics and to suggest suitable areas of research. In particular, a number of potential applications were identified, which require further scientific advances for them to see fruition. These include nonlinear and active optical devices, chemical, biochemical, and physical sensors, protective layers (e.g., for passivation), patternable materials both for resists and for mass information storage, surface modification (e.g., wetting and electrochemical electrode properties), and synthetic biomacromolecules. Studies of these films have the added advantage that they could lead to a better scientific understanding of such subjects as the relationships between the microstructure of ordered molecular arrays and their collective properties, the tailoring of interfaces and surfaces, especially when used to model multibody interactions, and the physical and chemical reactions of films involving phase transitions and intra- and interfilm transport. The areas that appear to require the most attention include the application of new characterization techniques, such as the scanning tunneling microscope, the improvement of mechanical and thermal stability, the identification and characterization of physical and chemical defects, and the effects of internal ordering on macroscopic properties. It is further recommended that strong interdisciplinary efforts be mounted to address and solve these problems. © 1987 American Chemical Society.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845282567

In addition to the regulation of intracellular ionic or pH balance, some ATPases help drive numerous physiological or biological processes by 'energy coupling'. Among these are muscle relaxation, receptor recycling, hormone storage, food digestion and ATP synthesis.

The system that can manage the power exchange with ease is the integrated controlled-current pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) rectifier/controlled-current PWM chopper link. Bidirectional power is accomplished by bidirectional current flow in the dc link for both modulators. The three-phase currents in the rectifier side are near sinusoidal in waveform at unity power factor.

Mathematical methods employing iterative maps and related concepts from nonlinear dynamics have been applied in the analysis of these schemes. The effect of transforming a pulse sequence by an iterative procedure can be represented as an iterative map on a quantum statistical propagator space, with fixed points in this space corresponding to certain desired responses of the spin system. The stability of these points with respect to variations of parameters, such as amplitudes or energies, determines the bandwidth characteristics of the corresponding sequence; broadband behavior results from stable fixed points, and narrowband behavior from unstable fixed points. This paper examines schemes which produce maps with more than one stable fixed point. Such schemes are shown to generate sequences which exhibit bistable or selective, bandpass behavior. Spatially selective NMR, spin decoupling, nk-quantum selective multiple-quantum NMR, isotope selective zero-field NMR, and optical information storage are some of the applications which can benefit from bandpass selective excitation sequences. © 1987 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444252921

They are tested with three and five body planar motions, with checks on energy conservation, angular momentum conservation, and reversibility. The scheme include Runge-Kutta methods, Stormer-Cowell methods (multi-step methods) and extrapolation methods. The extrapolation method of Gragg, Bulirsch and Stoer produces highly accurate solutions, but for lower accuracy requirements the multistep methods of Krogh and Nordsieck are more efficient. Aarseth's restricted Krogh method is slightly worse, and the Runge-Kutta methods show unacceptable error growth in the 5 body simulation. Gear's implementation of the Nordsieck method uses least computer memory, and the extrapolation methods use most (almost twice as much). A leap-frog version of Krogh's method uses more storage than Gear's method, but is significantly more accurate.

Under all conditions, isolated mitochondria showed good respiratory control (2.5 ± 0.5, 3.2 ± 0.5, 5.0 ± 0.5 for succinate, NADH, and malate respectively) and high values of membrane potential with all substrates (0~=210± 10 mV). Efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation was constant with malate, succinate, and exogenous NADH, whatever the temperature conditions of fruit storage. In contrast, the rates of oxidation were greatly enhanced (60 % to 70 %) in mitochondria isolated from fruit warmed to 20 °C for 24 hours after exposure at 4 °C for 4 days.

Nonperturbative analytic treatment of the Vlasov equation allows us to study time evolution of a single coherent mode (an azimuthal harmonic of the density driven by the impedance) and the overall uniform-density distribution function. In the case of a Gaussian beam, this formalism simplifies to a pair of equations of motion which together with the dispersion relation fully describe the dynamics of the beam. Further numerical treatment reveals saturation of the mode growth which simultaneously provides a stabilizing mechanism (via Landau damping) for the overall distribution function.

From the combination of magnetic and electrochemical measurements, we find definitive evidence of the reversed spin-charge relation expected for bipolarons with Ns/Nch<10-3; from the spectroscopic data we find the two subgap absorptions indicative of self-localized bipolaron levels located nearly symmetrically within the gap. For charge injection below the principal injection threshold, one observes polaronlike features with a maximum number of spin-carrying species of approximately 0.2 mol % (one per 500 rings). Our results imply that these features result from defect states in the energy gap, but they are not the self-localized polarons which would be characteristic of a charge on a nondegenerate ground-state polymer such as a perfect P3MT chain.

The paper discusses the evolution of the technology both of the desalination and the collector-subsystems as a result of the technical and economical constraints associated with the utilization of solar energy, a highly fluctuating energy source of low surface density. Performance data is presented in particular for the coupling of a selfregulating MSF unit with a solar pond energy collection and storage system, both inhouse developments. The performance and layout data was obtained both from computer simulation and experimental results with a small sized solar pond and desalination subsystem in Switzerland. The economy assessment, which is presented for Middle East climate conditions, clearly demonstrates that solar desalination already becomes competitive for medium sized installation at remote locations.

The data were obtained with the MAC detector at the PEP storage ring of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, at a center-of-mass energy of 29 GeV. The measured e+e- differential cross section is used to test the validity of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in this energy range; it agrees well with QED, and the limit on cutoff parameters for the electron propagator is >66 GeV. The measurement of e+e- is used to test the QED calculations of order 3 and to search for anomalies that would indicate the existence of new particles; the agreement with QED is excellent and no anomalies are found. Two events from the reaction e+e- are found, in agreement with the QED prediction. © 1987 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042170484

Predicting the conformation of deoxyribose is important not only because of the molecule's central conformational role in the nucleotide backbone, but also because energetic and geometric discrepancies from experimental data have exposed some underlying uncertainties in potential energy calculations. The three fundamental issues examined here are: (i) choice of coordinate system to represent the molecular conformation; (ii) construction of the potential energy function; and (iii) choice of the minimization technique. For our study, we use the following combination. First, the molecular conformation is represented in cartesian coordinate space with the full set of degrees of freedom. This provides an opportunity for comparison with the pseudorotation approximation. Second, the potential energy function is constructed so that all the interactions other than the nonbonded terms are represented by polynomials of the coordinate variables. Third, two powerful Newton methods that are globally and quadratically convergent are implemented: Gill and Murray's Modified Newton method and a Truncated Newton method, specifically developed for potential energy minimization. These strategies have produced the two experimentally‐observed structures of deoxyribose with geometric data (bond angles and dihedral angles) in very good agreement with experiment. More generally, the application of these modeling and minimization techniques to potential energy investigations is promising. The use of cartesian variables and polynomial representation of bond length, bond angle and torsional potentials promotes efficient second‐derivative computation and, hence, application of Newton methods. The truncated Newton, in particular, is ideally suited for potential energy minimization not only because the storage and computational requirements of Newton methods are made manageable, but also because it contains an important algorithmic adaptive feature: the minimization search is diverted from regions where the function is nonconvex and is directed quickly toward physically interesting regions.

The procedure is described and the main equations to calculate energy expenditure and substrate utilization are presented. The limitations of the method include physiological effects, such as hyperventilation, and the influence of metabolic processes such as gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis and lipogenesis. The general principle is that intermediate processes do not influence overall conclusions, provided that the intermediate substrates which are formed do not accumulate within the body or are not excreted. Continuous measurements of metabolic rate and respiratory quotient using the ventilated hood system have been carried out during the last 5 years to study carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in lean subjects, in obese and diabetic patients. By using the euglycaemic insulin clamp technique or by giving oral glucose loads, it has been shown that the main effect of insulin on carbohydrate metabolism is to stimulate glucose storage. By raising plasma free fatty acid levels with a neutral fat infusion in lean subjects, both glucose oxidation and glucose storage were impaired during euglycaemic insulin clamps. Glucose storage was found to be markedly impaired in non-diabetic obese patients, during euglycaemic insulin clamps in the presence of elevated lipid oxidation. In obese diabetic patients, the impairment in glucose storage was more pronounced than in non-diabetic obese; this defect was particularly marked during euglycaemic insulin clamps, but it was also present after an oral glucose load. It is concluded that impairment of glucose storage is a major defect of glucose utilization in type II diabetes. © 1987 Bailliére Tindal.

Several systems combining photoelectrochemical conversion with electrochemical storage have been presented with maximum efficiencies of approximately 3 per cent. A series of polysulphide solution effects 2-5 resulted in a high efficiency caesium polysulphide n-Cd(Se,Te) single crystal PEC6.

The prospect of superconducting devices and machines operating in liquid nitrogen and at higher temperatures is seen as an unprecedented technological development. There are potential applications in microelectronics and computers, energy storage and transmission, transport, high technology engineering, sensors and instrumentation. For many applications it is essential to prepare these materials in the form of thin films on suitable substrates. Currently, most of the research effort and all of the available published information relates to the fabrication of bulk samples from powders. At Cambridge our primary objective has been to achieve the deposition of high-quality thin films. We have taken this course because, (1) deposition from a multi-target sputter system gives great flexibility and enables us to cast a wide parameter net in composition and temperature to ensure early identification of key superconducting phases, (2) the deposition and processing of 0.5 μm films can be carried out very rapidly with one or possibly more system cycles per day and (3) measurements on thin films provide quantitative information on basic superconducting parameters and are likely to lead to the first practical applications of these remarkable materials. Here we report preliminary results on the deposition of relatively homogeneous films with transition temperature onsets up to 99 K. First results are reported on film deposition conditions, film composition and structure, and on the effect of post-deposition anneals on superconducting properties. © 1987 Nature Publishing Group.",,"OXIDES; SPUTTERING; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; YTTRIUM COMPOUNDS; HIGH SUPERCONDUCTING TRANSITION TEMPERATURES; SPUTTER-DEPOSITED THIN FILMS; YTTRIUM BARIUM COPPER OXIDES; SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIALS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023646343

Measurements of actual oxygen uptake rates were made for soybean and pea seeds as a comparison of short and long lived seeds when light, temperature, and moisture contents were varied. In both peas and soybeans, the oxygen uptake was depressed at low temperatures (<16 degrees C) and low water contents (< 0.25 gram H2O per gram dry weight). Apparent activation energies under these conditions are very high, while apparent activation energies of seeds at higher water contents and at temperatures greater than 22 degrees C are much less. Light enhances the level of oxygen uptake in pea, but reduces the level of oxygen uptake in soybean. The complexities of the interactions of oxygen uptake with environmental conditions in soybean compared to pea suggest that oxidative processes occur in soybean at low water contents, but are essentially absent in pea. It is suggested that the additional oxidative processes in soybean with moisture contents between 0.10 and 0.24 gram per gram may contribute to the poorer longevity of soybean seed compared to pea seed.",,"lipoxygenase; water; article; biological model; comparative study; darkness; humidity; light; metabolism; NASA Discipline Number 40-10; NASA Discipline Plant Biology; NASA Program Space Biology; Non-NASA Center; oxygen consumption; pea; physiology; plant seed; radiation exposure; soybean; temperature; NASA Discipline Number 40-10; NASA Discipline Plant Biology; NASA Program Space Biology; Non-NASA Center; Darkness; Humidity; Light; Lipoxygenase; Models, Biological; Oxygen Consumption; Peas; Seeds; Soybeans; Temperature; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023641519

Activities of peroxisomal fatty acyl-coenzyme (CoA) oxidase and catalase as well as mitochondrial citrate synthase were assayed in liver tissue of 24 young adult male and female Wistar rats fed a nonpurified diet containing 0.6% DHEA (6 g/kg) for 6 wk. DHEA-treated animals gained less weight but had heavier liver weights than did the controls. Hepatic activity of fatty acyl-CoA oxidase of the experimental male and female animal was 1058 and 946% higher, respectively, than that of the controls. For catalase activity, only the female groups were different (30%). Activity of citrate synthase was not affected by DHEA. These data support the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of DHEA on energy storage as fat is mediated, at least in part, by increased β-oxidation of fatty acids in peroxisomes. The peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway is uncoupled from oxidative phosphorylation; electrons are transferred directly to molecular O2 because of cycling of NAD/NADH resulting in the expenditure of chemical energy as heat.",,"prasterone; animal experiment; drug mechanism; enzyme activity; liver; nonhuman; peroxisome; rat; therapy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023633151

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels at rest were reduced by 22%, but did not fall further during exercise or contracture. The slope of work rate versus inorganic phosphate/phosphocreatine (Pi/PCr) was 42 ± 8 joules/min/Pi/PCr in three patients without muscle wasting, compared with 13 and 16 in patients with atrophy (normal, 30 to 50 joules/ min/Pi/PCr). Recovery from exercise showed similar rates in patients (postischemic exercise 1.03 ± 0.17, post-aerobic 1.63 ± 0.17 PCr/Pi units per minute) and controls (1.0 ± 0.2 and 1.8 ± 0.2, respectively) independent of intracellular pH. Infusion of glucose improved exercise kinetics by 163 to 190%, but an oral load of protein had no effect.

Total caloric intake was 65% of energy expenditure on the low intake and 119% on the high intake, with a difference of 54% due entirely to carbohydrate. Although there are many assumptions and approximations necessarily involved in multiple balance studies, the accuracy is sufficient to produce useful information in short-term studies of this type. It is particularly useful in looking at differences between diets, since most of the methodologic errors cancel out. The effect of the increased glucose intake was to significantly increase storage, or decrease loss, of fat carbohydrate, protein, intracellular water, and K. Changes in Na and extracellular water varied widely among patients, but were not affected by the increase in glucose. Most of the increase in K content (83%) was associated with glycogen deposition; a much smaller amount (17%) was associated with protein deposition. Thus, the ratio of K/N deposited (15mEq of K:1 g of N) was very different from the 3:1 ratio seen in most tissues. Changes in any one constituent of body cell mass may not, therefore, be good indicators of changes in another. Since protein is the most important active component of body cell mass, changes in body cell mass components other than N should be interpreted with caution when used as indices of nutritional therapy.",,"glucose; adult; body composition; body fat; body water; body weight; caloric intake; clinical article; controlled study; energy expenditure; human; malnutrition; parenteral nutrition; potassium balance; sodium balance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023614049

Recent evidence suggests that 85 percent of adenosine triphosphate regeneration is based on oxidative metabolism and that substrates other than glucose may be used. Because platelets can oxidize free fatty acids (FFA) as a possible source of energy during storage, the authors studied their availability, distribution, and turnover. Plasma FFA concentration was unchanged after 1 day of PC storage but significantly increased on Days 3, 5, and 7. Platelet-free plasma (PFP) stored under the same conditions as PC demonstrated a progressive increase in FFA, suggesting that some of the FFA accumulating in PC were derived from plasma rather than platelets. Indeed, during PC storage, plasma triglycerides decreased significantly, suggesting that they are a possible source of the increased levels of FFA found on Day 3 and thereafter. Thus, PC have a plasma FFA pool available continuously for oxidation during storage. Studies with radiolabeled palmitate suggested that FFA oxidation by platelet occurs during storage. The current findings show that plasma FFA could be a significant substrate for oxidative metabolism during storage of PC and that the oxidized FFA are replenished at least in part from plasma.

Acad. Sci. USA, pp. 5000-5004, 1985]: (formula present) At sufficiently high temperatures (|300 K), the binding process is exponential in time and its velocity proportional to the concentration of the ligand in the solvent. At low temperatures (typically <210 K), the combination velocity is not correlated with the amount of free ligand in the solvent and the time course is nonexponential (approximately power law). This implies that (a) proteins are flexible structures and fluctuate between many substates, each having a different ligand binding velocity, and (b) that the rate of interconversion between the various conformational substates is high compared to that of ligand binding at and above room temperature and extremely slow below | 200 K. We have investigated the temperature dependence of CO binding after a photolysing pulse to a variety of myoglobins and hemoglobin subunits. The results show that for all myoglobins investigated, the most probable activation energy for the inner process (B| A) is in the order of 10 kJ/mol, while for the hemoglobin subunits it varies between 2.5 and 5 kJ/mol. The distribution of barrier heights is very broad in myoglobins, somewhat narrower in the non-a-chains and narrowest in the a-hemoglobin subunits. This finding implies that different degrees of flexibility exist between storage and transport proteins and that hemoglobin cooperativity may be related to the presence of subunits with different flexibility within the tetramer. © 1987 S.

During the second pregnancy of 56 Swedish women resulting in a term birth, energy intake and physical activity were measured for 3 days at weeks 17 and 33. The values were related to maternal lean body mass, pregnancy weight gain, maternal fat accretion and infant birth‐weight by multiple linear regression analyses. A significant regression coefficient was found for energy intake at week 17 on maternal fat accretion. Energy intake was not significantly correlated with infant birthweight, not even when physical activity and maternal lean body mass were taken into account. Thus in a well‐nourished Swedish population, energy intake is positively related to maternal fat accretion but not to the birthweight of term infants. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

Several experimental and theoretical results are described to illustrate the present level of understanding and the best switching results obtained to date. Significant power multiplication has been achieved on the Gamble II generator, producing 3.5 TW with less than 10-ns rise time. Switching after nearly 1-μs conduction time has been demonstrated on Pawn, producing a 0.2-TW 100-ns pulse. Scaling the switch to higher current, power, and conduction time should be possible based on theoretical analysis and the favorable results of scaling experiments performed thus far.

To investigate whether this defect is related to 1) a decreased rate of glucose storage, 2) a reduced energy cost of glucose storage, or 3) a defect in the sympathetically mediated component of thermogenesis, we studied the thermic effect of ingested and infused glucose in nine NIDDM obese Pima Indians [90.5 ± 3.9 kg,39 ± 2% fat, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 130 ± 10 m,g/dl] and in nine nondiabetic obese Pima Indians (99.3 ± 7.2 kg, 38 ± 2% fat, FPG 103 ± 2 mg/dl). Energy expenditure and glucose storage were derived from indirect calorimetry measurements. The thermic effect of 100 g of glucose was found to be similar in both groups (4.0 ± 0.9 vs.5.0 ± 1.3% of energy ingested in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, respectively) but lower than that previously reported in nonobese subjects. The cost of glucose storage calculated after stimulating storage by constant glucose infusion (0.46 g/min) and variable insulin infusion (19.5 ± 3.8 vs. 2.9 ± 0.6 mU·kg-1·min-1 in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, respectively; P &lt;.01) was similar in both groups (~0.35 kcal/g glucose stored) and not different from that reported in lean subjects. As opposed to lean and obese Caucasian subjects, energy expenditure failed to markedly decrease during propranolol infusion in both nondiabetic and diabetic Pima Indians. We postulate that the decreased rate of tissue glucose uptake and storage associated with insulin resistance is the major cause of the lower thermic effect of ingested glucose in NIDDM. It is unlikely that reduced thermic effect of glucose causes or perpetuates obesity in NIDDM, because a low thermic response is the consequence of the increased insulin resistance and is opposed by greater increases in resting metabolic rate.",,"propranolol; calorimetry; clinical article; energy expenditure; glucose blood level; glucose infusion; glucose transport; human; human experiment; insulin infusion; insulin resistance; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023597753

The results are obtained with very low computation time, through a computer program on a CDC 730, which can be easily linked to other thermal hydraulic codes for the storage pool. To show the capabilities of the program, some results are presented, concerning step response and other transient operations of the exchanger. The validation of the method has been performed comparing the numerical results with the exact steady state analytical solutions available in literature; the agreement is very satisfactory. © 1987.",,"MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES - Finite Element Method; NUCLEAR REACTORS - Spent Fuels; RADIOACTIVE WASTES - Storage; TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION - Mathematical Models; STORAGE POOLS; HEAT EXCHANGERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023593924

The first is based on a PWM converter than transforms the dc input voltage into a high dc output voltage, followed by a PWM bridge for waveshaping and inversion. The second uses a forward PWM converter for transformation and waveshaping at the same time, followed by an inversion bridge to obtain a sine wave. The application of reactive loads to modern PWM circuits presents a special problem, because the current reverses during a part of the output voltage period, and the inverter needs an intermediate storage for the reverse energy flow. Due to the specific methods used to solve this problem for different inverter topologies, the question arose of which circuit gives the least stress on the buffer capacitors. Three solutions are compared. One circuit requires a rather larger buffer capacitor, while the other topologies can use smaller capacitors but result in a higher circuit complexity. One of the principles described has been successfully implemented in a 1-kVA highly efficient inverter.",,"Capacitors; Electric converters, Power type; ELECTRIC NETWORKS - Topology; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Pulse width modulation; 1-KVA INVERTER; DC-DC CONVERTER; ENERGY STORAGE CAPACITOR; PWM-INVERTERS WITH REACTIVE LOADS; SINGLE-PHASE PWM-INVERTERS; Electric inverters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023588670

For example, based on 30-year average water flows, the model predicts that 1.93 × 109 m2 (477,000 acres) of solar ponds, 1.02 × 109 m2 (253,000 acres) of evaporation ponds to recycle salt, and 0.51 × 109 m2 (125,000 acres) of freshwater storage reservoirs could be maintained at the Great Salt Lake of Utah.

This is roughly 30 times the water evaporated per unit of electrical energy from coal-fired generating plants using wet cooling towers, but substantially less than water evaporation losses per unit of electrical energy produced from typical hydropower dams and reservoirs. It is concluded that water use requirements for solar ponds, although not necessarily prohibitive, are substantial; and in many locations may be the physical factor that limits solar pond development. © 1987.",,"MATHEMATICAL MODELS; SOLAR ENERGY; WATER SUPPLY; SALT GRADIENT; SALT GRADIENT SOLAR POND (SGSP); WATER REQUIREMENT MODEL; SOLAR RADIATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023578168

A transient model based on measured local environmental conditions (solar insolation, ambient temperature and ground temperature) is developed to predict solar transmission, temperature distribution and salt distribution inside the pond for any day of the year. In the model the effects of heat dissipation into the ground, bottom reflection, pond dimensions, load extraction and variation of the pond's physical properties with temperature and concentration are investigated. The generated non-linear coupled system of heat and salt concentration equations for the composite media, considered to have isothermal boundary conditions, is solved numerically using the implicit finite-difference scheme. The results show that the optimum thickness of the gradient zone, under hot climatic conditions, is 1·5 m. Following the first year of operation, the pond with a thicker storage zone gives much less temperature fluctuation between winter and summer seasons and hence a better thermal performance. An energy analysis performed on the pond shows that about 32% of incident solar energy is lost to the air by evaporation, convection and thermal radiation, 6% is lost to the ground; 12% is the extracted load and the remainder (50%) is due to absorption and reflection at the surface of the pond. For a similar pond, operating under cold climates, air and ground losses are much higher while the useful load is relatively lower in comparison with the corresponding figures for hot climates. © 1987.",,"MATHEMATICAL MODELS; SOLAR ENERGY; SALT GRADIENT SOLAR PONDS; SOLAR RADIATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023576457

On the first occasion the subjects ran on a motor‐driven treadmill at 3.33 m s‐1;the second and the third exercises consisted of performing rhythmical vertical jumps for 1 min both in rebound (RJ) and no‐rebound (NRJ) conditions. The mechanical efficiency calculated in NRJ, which reflects only the conversion of biochemical energy into mechanical work, was found to be lower than the corresponding observation in RJ, 17.2 vs. 27.8% (P &lt; 0.001), respectively. These differences could not be explained by only the storage and recoil of elastic energy occurring in RJ compared with NRJ. The calculated extra work delivered ‘free’ was greater than the potential elastic energy which could be stored within the leg extensor muscles (187 vs. 124 J for each jump, P &lt; 0.05). It is likely that other factors might be responsible for the extra work found in NRJ. It was suggested that the difference in the length of time to perform positive work between a simple shortening contraction and a stretch‐shortening muscular activity could be also responsible for the enhanced efficiency observed in RJ. This suggestion was supported by the high relationship (P &lt; 0.001) found between the time to perform positive work and the mechanical efficiency measured in jumping and estimated during running. © 1987 Scandinavian Physiological Society","muscle efficiency; muscle elasticity; muscle mechanics; stretch‐shortening cycle.","controlled study; human experiment; male; muscle elasticity; muscle mechanics; normal human; skeletal muscle; Adult; Elasticity; Exertion; Human; Male; Mechanoreceptors; Muscle Contraction; Running",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023572239

The dispersed PV generator is viewed as an active device used to improve system stability by appropriately modulating the power conditioning unit's output power. Disturbances on the utility system can be damped out by injecting this power into the grid in such a way so that the net effect is a cancellation of undesirable oscillations. The approach is implemented by monitoring the oscillating power and generating control signals which shape accordingly the interface unit's output power. Successful implementation of the scheme relies heavily on the speed and flexibility with which the electronic inverter moves power from the primary source/storage facility to the utility lines. Simulation studies, using the proposed control approach, indicate that application of these policies may result in reduced load following requirements for conventional power generating units, increase the value and acceptability of new energy technologies, and improve power quality and stability of the interconnected system.

The three penetration mechanisms considered are 1) the Chodura model based on the ion-acoustic instability where the saturated value of the anomalous collision frequency is approximated by the ion plasma frequency; 2) a model based on the lower hybrid instability in which the anomalous collision frequency is proportional to both the ion plasma frequency and the electron drift velocity; and 3) a model that limits the ion drift velocity to the plasma influx velocity.

This has culminated in a field trial at Spa School in London. It was predicted to lead to significant energy savings, to a lower installed boiler capacity requirement, and to reductions in installation costs for new and for some retro-fitted systems. Specifically, a thermally insulated 3235 1 hot water store was installed in the circuit between the existing modular boiler set and the hydronic ‘radiator’ network. The pipework was arranged so that the heating system could be operated either as configured originally or in the storage mode, in which case two of the five modular boilers were valved off. The two configurations were operated alternately (for four week periods), and their performances were carefully monitored over the 1985/86 heating season. The storage system performed successfully with a 40% lower installed boiler capacity. Boiler cycling was reduced by a factor of 15 and the mean boiler load factor rose from 37 to 70%. Analyses of results show that a 6% saving in annual fuel consumption was achieved by the storage system as compared with that of the highly efficient conventional system employing direct external compensation of the boilers. However, all this saving is attributable to the faster building preheat achieved with the store as, surprisingly, the annual efficiencies of the two systems were the same (in contradiction to the findings of other trials). The reasons for this are examined. Where direct compensation is not possible, the reduction in boiler cycling demonstrated will lead to a further substantial efficiency advantage of at least 10%. © 1987, SAGE Publications.

Species succession in Great Lakes aquatic communities is characterized as a cyclic repetition of maturation followed by seasonal, annual or periodic setbacks. These ""enjuvenation events' are attributed to any cultural or climatic factors which induce flux in energy-matter delivery to the system. The time course of rehabilitation to any arbitrary prior condition of the community is closely related to the enjuvenation-maturation cycle and to the life span and reproductive characteristics of the species present. The principal homeostatic mechanism lies with variations in the durations of life history stanzas as affected by fish growth rates. The ""biomass storage' function of larger organisms in the system is a major determinant of the ""biotic inertia' or sensitivity or the community to perturbations. Trophic linkages from the piscivores downwards must be maintained as biological feedback pathways to ensure that moderately excessive fishery yields can be self-limiting. Without these linkages, biomass capture of nutrient inputs by algae will vector to waste as planktivore density limits secondary production. -from Authors",,"fish community; fisheries; Canada; Great Lakes; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023557947

Smelt have a eurythermal life history, which results in spatial segregation of their larvae, juvenile and adults, and are omnivorous feeders, eating a range of food types from zooplankton to fish. Effects on other species are mediated via food web interactions resulting in recruitment and growth changes in some species and redirection of energy flow and storage. Species most often affected are cold-water and cool-water species whose niches are most similar to juvenile and adult smelt. Increased growth rates of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, and lake trout Salvelinus namaycush and recruitment failure of lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis are the best documented responses to invasion by smelt. Variation in the smelt metabolic niche (as expressed by relative growth efficiency) is due to variations in prey size and availability and is reflected in differences in smelt body size between lakes. Smelt body size, in turn, is related to the variable effects that they have on other species. -from Authors",,"Atlantic salmon; colonization; lake trout; lake whitefish; lakes; rainbow smelt; salmon; smelt; trout; whitefish; Canada; Great Lakes; USA; Coregonus clupeaformis; Osmerus mordax; Salmo salar; Salvelinus namaycush",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023557026

Nutrient uptake kinetics are regulated by the storage pools, and the patterns of regulation have a feedback effect on the amount of accumulated nutrient in the cells. Besides having a storage function the nutrient storage products are likely to act as metabolic sinks during conditions of energy stress. Regulation of storage products is especially strict in light‐limited cultures. By increasing the rate of polysaccharide formation during growth with short photoperiods, cyanobacteria are able to sustain relatively high growth rates.

The focus of this work is on understanding how two effects, a current-limiting model of electron emission, and the magnetic insulation of electrons at the cathode, determine current conduction in the plasma. Simulations are performed in the parameter regimes of the Gamble I, POP, and PBFAII pulsed power generators, and previous low-density, short-rise time simulations of the PEOS. Fluid code results are compared to a 1-D analytic theory and to the Gamble I and POP experiments. Good agreement between theory and simulation, but mixed agreement between simulation and experiment is found. Experimental B-field measurements on POP show weaker j x B compression than the simulation. Current penetration and plasma current channels qualitatively similar to experimental observation are found in the Gamble I regime. However, magnetic insulation of electrons emitted from the cathode bunches the electron flow into narrower current channels than observed experimentally. In several cases, the presence of an electron-scattering or energy-loss mechanism near the cathode must be invoked to overcome magnetic insulation and widen the current channels.

This switch consists of fill plasma injected into a transmission line. The plasma is ultimately removed by self-electrical forces, permitting energy delivery to a load. Here, ANTHEM treats the ions and electrons of the fill plasma and the electrons emitted from the transmission-line cathode as three distinct Eulerian fluids-with electron inertia retained. This permits analysis of charge separation effects, and avoids the singularities that plague conventional MHD codes at low density. E and B fields are computed by the implicit moment method, allowing for time steps well in excess of the electron plasma period [Eq.] and cells much wider than a Debye length, [Eq.]. Switch dynamics are modeled as a function of the driving electrical pulse characteristics, the fill plasma parameters, and the emission properties of the transmission line walls-for both collisionless and anomalously collisional electrons. Our low-fill-density (ne 4 x 1012 electrons/cm3) collisionless calculations are in accord with earlier particle code results. Our high-density computations (ne 2 x 1013 electrons/cm3) show the opening of the switch proceeding through both ion erosion and magnetic pressure effects. The addition of anomalous electron collisions is found to diffuse the driving B field into the fill plasma, producing broad current channels and reduced magnetic pressure effects, in some agreement with NRL experimental measurements.

Both of them are located directly behind the south facing glazing of a wall. A Transwall is essentially a transparent modular wall. It consists of water in a container made of parallel glass walls and has a partially absorbing plate at the centre parallel to the glass wall. Thus, it partially absorbs and partially transmits solar energy. A Trombe wall consists of either masonry or water in opaque containers and does not transmit solar energy. The relative performance of these has been studied to find out their suitability for a cool climate of North India. Mathematical models have been developed to predict the thermal performance in terms of the heat flux entering the living space through these walls. Numerical calculations for Srinagar (India) climatic conditions show that the Transwall is more effective than the Trombe wall to meet the daytime heating load, but from load levelling and both day and night performance points of view, a water Trombe wall is better. The results are quite general and can be extended to any place having similar climatic behaviour. © 1987.","Performance comparison; Transwall; Trombe wall","BUILDINGS - Solar, Passive; SOLAR RADIATION - Energy Storage; THERMAL STORAGE WALLS; TRANSWALL; TROMBE WALL; ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023535921

Insulation 10 cm deep and 1.35 m wide was installed horizontally 30 cm below the ground surface, surrounding one room of the house. The other room is not insulated. During the first year, all windows were insulated with weather shutters to avoid disturbing the heat gain due to solar radiation. As a result, the yearly room temperature swing varied °C less than the temperature swing of outdoor air. The air temperature in the insulated room was 1.2°C higher in the winter and 0.5°C lower in the summer than in the room without insulation. The influence of various thermal insulation formations in the earth around the house on room temperature fluctuation and heating and cooling loads was calculated using the two-dimensional finite element method.

Heat transfer by horizontal convection within the aquifer and by vertical conduction in the caprock and bedrock is considered. The model also incorporates variable temperatures on the surface of the caprock. Thus it can be used to study problems in connection with aquifer thermal energy storage, heat recovery from, and cold water injection into aquifers near the surface. The derived analytical solutions show that the caprock thickness is important only in long‐time periods and at greater distance from the injection well. The application of this model to cold water injection into an aquifer with 1.75‐m caprock thickness shows that the influence of seasonal variations of the surface temperature on the aquifer is nearly ±2°C.

Unfortunately the space required, using sensible thermal storage, is usually too great to provide anything more than a buffer to prevent chillers starting too frequently. To overcome this space problem system designers are now resorting to latent thermal storage. Commercially available equipment can be divided into that based on ice and that based on the use of encapsulated eutectic mixtures (phase change materials). For the air conditioning designer the systems can be further subdivided into pressurised and atmospheric storage. Both types rely on the latent heat of fusion to reduce to a third or a quarter the storage volume necessary, but there are important differences in the satisfactory application of the various methods. The note examines and discusses the basic principles relevant to system design, describes the range of ice-based equipment available including ice builders, ice tanks and ice harvesters. The range of phase change materials and associated equipment is then discussed and analysed in the context of suitable air conditioning applications. It is concluded that both ice systems and phase change materials can offer advantages and savings but that they must be carefully matched to the air conditioning system design if their full benefits are to be realised. © 1987, SAGE Publications.

The pattern of such changes varies with species, but trends suggest a comprehensive model. O3 generally reduces the amount of dry matter in the whole plant. In plants which have not flowered or set fruit, and at low O3 levels, the remaining available assimilate is generally diverted to leaves and stems at the expense of roots and crowns. As the plant matures, flowers and develops seeds, these sinks receive a relatively high proportion of the available assimilate. O3 may reduce the number of flowers or seeds, but the remaining seeds often have a total dry matter accumulation comparable to that in non-stressed plants. At higher O3 levels, assimilate accumulation is greatly depressed, and partitioning changes are not as obvious. However, it is significant that the storage organs of plants-those organs which supply energy for new growth in perennial plants such as trees-are the organs most affected by O3-induced partitioning changes when O3 concentrations are in the range commonly observed in polluted ambient air. © 1987.",,"BIOCHEMISTRY; OZONE - Environmental Impact; ASSIMILATE PARTITIONING; BIOMASS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023525051

The nature of platelet lesion occurring with storage of platelet concentrates (PC) in second‐generation containers was investigated using various storage media and storage periods up to 14 days. In CPD‐plasma (control medium), the changes which occurred progressively during storage were loss of discoid shape, microscopic platelet aggregate formation, fragmentation and the appearance of disintegrated, ‘balloon’ forms. By day 14 less than 10% of the platelets were discoid in shape, the platelet count had decreased by 23%, and there was a 5‐fold increase in the amount of lactate dehydrogenase in plasma. Associated with this was a decrease in the platelet oxygen consumption rate, D(O2), loss of cellular ATP and extent of ADP‐induced shape change, and a decrease in the hypotonic shock response. These parameters decreased at a similar rate, with a 50% decrease (t1/2) at days 7–9. They correlated highly with each other during storage and also with a fall in pH. At day 14 of storage, mean pH was 6.1 ± 0.3. To evaluate the effect of pH stabilization during storage, 4 mEq sodium bicarbonate was added to PC in CPD‐plasma. Although pH maintenance was much improved, 7.2–6.6 during 14 days of storage, the same in vitro lesions developed, although more slowly. The t1/2 of the same parameters was prolonged for approximately two days. When PC were stored in a plasma‐free physiologic salt solution whose salt composition was similar to CPD‐plasma, the t1/2 of the parameters increased to 11–15 days of storage, although the platelets eventually developed the same in vitro lesions. In all media there was a high correlation between platelet ATP level and the other in vitro parameters during storage. Furthermore, energy depletion of the platelets produced by using the physiologic salt solution without glucose and by addition of metabolic inhibitors caused a similar deterioration of in vitro functions, but at a significantly faster rate which correlated with the rate of decrease in platelet ATP. This suggests that the platelet lesion observed with prolonged storage in second‐generation containers might be due to a failure in platelet energy metabolism. © 1987 S.

Apart from the summer-flowering B. attenuata, the species flowered in winter. There was no support for the hypothesis that strongly serotinous species would show the highest variation in reproductive output. Follicle set was low for all species (0.1-4.7% of florets). All species stored some seeds in the canopy for at least 5 yr. There was no viable soil-stored seed bank. The mean number of canopy-stored viable seeds per plant ranged from 1344 (B. leptophylla) to 2 (B. menziesii). Extreme serotiny was recorded for B. leptophylla and B. attenuata in which seed older than the current year's crop comprised 92% and 80% respectively of the total viable seed bank. Corresponding values were 34% for B. prionotes and 25% for B. menziesii. Rate of decline in seed viability and pre-dispersal seed predation were lowest in the most serotinous species. There was little support for the hypothesis that species which resprout post-fire would allocate less energy to sexual reproduction than the 2 non-sprouting species.

The gastric juice sample, treated with sulfamic acid to remove nitrite, is injected directly into refluxing ethyl acetate containing either acetic acid for determining thermo/acetic acid-labile-thermal energy analyser (TEA)-responsive compounds (TAC), or into hydrogen bromide for the analysis of TAC and NOC. The nitric oxide (NO) levels released are measured by chemiluminescence by TEA, and the difference between the two determinations represents the concentrations of NOC in gastric juice. This method also allows the determination of nitrite and is not affected by nitrate concentrations up to 1,000 mumol/l.

Because the difficulties arising from the 'system response' to the denitrosating agent and variability of NO release by acetic acid from nitrite were eliminated, this improved method can more accurately distinguish NOC from most other TEA-responsive species.

An energy balance method was used in which net radiation (RN) and ground heat flux (G) were measured directly. Sensible heat flux (H) was measured by the eddy correlation technique using a propeller anemometer and a fine-wire thermocouple. The energy components were calculated hourly on-line, and data were collected reliably over a five-month period. The RNand H instruments were mounted above the forest canopy and simultaneous measurements of H at heights of 12 and 6 m were in good agreement. Measurements at an open bare rock site indicated that G could be a substantial fraction of the daily RN at some locations, but over longer time periods, it was a small fraction and, therefore, was ignored. The two measurement locations represented upland (open bedrock/jack pine forest) and lowland (aspen/willow forest) sites in the drainage basin. The mean daily value of RN- H at the upland site was 0.57 times the value at the lowland location owing to differences in RN, H, and G. The mean ratio of daily H/RNwas 0.6 for the upland site and 0.4 for the lowland site. A basin-wide ET was calculated by weighting the values for the two sites in proportion to their areas. The measured ET agreed well with precipitation minus runoff for the basin. Differences between these two quantities in summer and fall were attributed to water release and storage by the ground, respectively. © 1987 D.

In this system, a cylindrical-type, synchronous motor generator with permanent 2-pole magnets on the inside periphery is adopted. The flywheel rotor rotates continously at a high rotational speed of about 30 000 rpm. The stress and strain in the flywheel rotor is caused by centrifugal force. This stress and strain occurs in the rotor magnet at the same time. A crack in the permanent magnet would occur if the flywheel rotor were to reach a higher rotational speed because the material of the permanent magnet is brittle.

The difference between this design and that of Kudish is that the water depth is allowed to be changed from 2–15 cm and is not fixed as in the mentioned reference design. The thermal insulation of the cover is installed between the reflector and the inner surface of the wooden cover. In the design of the reference (Kudish and Wof, 1978), the insulation is fixed on the outer surface of the cover, where it will probably be damaged by water, wind, dust etc. Also in our design, the level of water in the bag is measured using a static pressure manometer. The tests were carried out both in winter and in summer whereas they have been done only in summer in the mentioned reference.

In the system constitution of the continuous type, the overhead vapour of the fractionation column is fed through the heat exchanger into the exothermic reactor, where acetone and hydrogen in excess are changed at 200°C into the equilibrium mixture, from which condensable 2–propanol is separated in the column by cooling at 30°C. The reverse reaction of 2–propanol decomposition into acetone and hydrogen proceeds in the endothermic reactor, i.e. the reboiler of the column, absorbing heat at 80°C. On the contrary, acetone and hydrogen in the overhead vapour of the fractionation column are stored at 30°C as liquid and metal hydride, respectively, in the system constitution of the storage type; when necessary, metal hydride is decomposed by heating at 80°C, with hydrogen at high pressure evolved and fed through the heat exchanger into the exothermic reactor, giving the equilibrium mixture at high pressure and temperature. Product condensates are transferred through a valve into the fractionation column in order to separate 2–propanol and acetone, the former of which is dehydrogenated in the endothermic liquid‐phase reactor, regenerating acetone and hydrogen at 80°C and atmospheric pressure. Energy efficiencies were evaluated for the system constitutions of both the continuous and storage types; the 80°C heat supplied was convertible into the 200°C heat continuously at the enthalpy efficiency or coefficient of performance (COP) of 0·36 in the former, whereas the 270°C heat was obtainable with the aid of metal hydride from the same heat source at COP of 0·21 in the latter.

The shape and position of the charge body is established so that the collector-voltage rise can be predicted, especially in the final stages of turn-off. Constant collector current, corresponding to an inductive load, is assumed during the charge-removal process. The effect of varying the reverse base drive is considered as is turning off from hard- and quasi-saturation. It is shown that the collector region can be swept clear of minority carriers at a collector voltage well below BVceo. Once minority carriers have been cleared, collector current is supported by a displacement current which causes energy storage, rather than dissipation. Experimental verification is sought with a developmental transistor that minimizes two- and three-dimensional effects. Qualitative agreement is evident; reasonable quantitative agreement does not require unrealistic assumptions.

Thin films of amorphous rare earth-transition metal (RE-TM) alloys deposited by sputtering on a nonmagnetic substrate have become a popular choice for an erasable storage medium. We have developed a simplified micromagnetics simulation of the behavior of RE-TM films that produces an equilibrium configuration of film magnetization for a specified thermal profile and applied magnetic field. This Monte Carlo-type model is useful for assessing the size, shape, and stability of written marks in MO recording. In addition, the simulation provides estimates of the minimum field strength required for nucleation and growth of reversed domains, and hence it predicts film coercivity at any temperature. An equilibrium state is determined by magnetic energy minimization. Magnetization dynamics are not incorporated into the model, but instead, a quasi-static approach to equilibrium is simulated. Spatial resolution can be arbitrarily small, and discretization down to about 20 nm can be reasonably accommodated.

A one-dimensional, transient, two-phase model is chosen for the packed bed which assumes uniformity at each cross section within the packing. The governing equations for the time dependent temperature distributions in both the solid and fluid phases are solved using a fully implicit formulation. The accuracy of the numerical method is demonstrated by comparison with experimental measurements of temperature distribution in a randomly packed bed of uniform spheres. The goal of the optimization is to achieve maximum utilization of the thermal energy storage and recovery capabilities of the storage medium for a given set of operating conditions. The optimum combination of bed length, size of the packing particles, and relative size of the bed cross section to the particle diameter is determined, subject to constraints on the maximum allowable pressure drop across the packing, the maximum outlet fluid temperature, and the total amount of supplied energy. The thermodynamic availability is examined as the measure of storage utilization. The monotinicity method is utilized for the optimization process. This method identifies a global optimum without any special computations, and prevents acceptance of false optimum solutions, as could be generated by numerical techniques. The results of the study provide guidelines for choosing the size of the packing and the packing particle subject to the constraints for a practical operating system. © 1987 by ASME.",,"ROCK - Heat Transfer; MONOTINICITY METHOD; PACKED BED; THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023401107

Fracture tests were performed with single‐edge notched specimens in tension and three‐point bending over a wide range of test speeds. Both larger radius notches and longer specimens were found to promote ductile tearing instability. This behavior is attributed to the higher driving force for crack growth produced by increased elastic energy storage before crack initiation. Over a certain range of test speeds, these factors lead to a novel effect of notch sharpness on toughness; a sharp notch gives rise to a higher fracture energy than does a blunt notch.

Collagenase isolated mouse islets were kept in culture for 3 days in the presence of 11.1 mM glucose and then transferred to freezing ampoules containing Hanks' solution supplemented with 10% calf serum and 2 M dimethyl sulfoxide. After a 20-min incubation at 0 °C the islets were cooled at a rate of 25 °C/min to -70 °C and subsequently plunged into liquid nitrogen. After 2 hr the frozen islets were rapidly thawed at 37 °C, transferred to culture dishes, and cultured for another 3 days in the presence of 2.8, 5.6, 11.1, 16.7, or 28 mM glucose. Nonfrozen control islets were treated identically after a preceding 3-day culture at 11.1 mM glucose. The percentage recovery of cryopreserved islets was decreased compared to that of nonfrozen islets, but was increased when higher glucose concentrations were used in the post-thaw culture medium. Since the DNA content of the cryopreserved islets was slightly decreased, the overall survival rate of the cryopreserved B-cells, when cultured at the higher glucose concentrations after thawing, was found to be about 75%. The insulin content of the cryopreserved islets was decreased but the glucose-stimulated insulin release was essentially the same as that of the nonfrozen islets. We have previously demonstrated that islets cryopreserved with the present technique have a preserved (pro)insulin biosynthesis and therefore the decreased insulin content is most likely to be due to minor intracellular damage leading to a reduced capacity for insulin storage. The present findings also suggest that a high glucose concentration is not deleterious to cryopreserved islets. Rather the islet recovery was enhanced by glucose, presumably because of its energy generation in the B cells, and this may allow repair of small injuries induced by the freeze-thawing. © 1987.",,"diagnostic agent; DNA; glucose; insulin; radioactive iodine; animal; article; culture medium; freezing; male; metabolism; mouse; pancreas islet; physiology; tissue preservation; Animal; Culture Media; DNA; Freezing; Glucose; Insulin; Iodine Radioisotopes; Islets of Langerhans; Male; Mice; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tissue Preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023388351

We investigated the modification of the temperature on which this exothermic process occurs by submitting the mixtures to these thermal treatments. By doing so we show that these mixtures can be used for a wider range of energy storage applications. © 1987.",,"ALCOHOLS; GLYCOLS; THERMODYNAMICS; EXOTHERMIC PROCESS; PENTAGLYCERINE; PENTAGLYCERINE/NEOPENTYLGLYCOL MIXTURES; ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023385683

It has been demonstrated that these brittle failures may be a direct result of high energy storage upon impact in large compliant systems. A rubber‐toughened blend of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) and polycarbonate (PC) was highlighted in this study. Soft steel springs were used in series with compact tension samples to simulate the high energy‐storing capability of large compliant structures, Ductile and stable fractures of compact tension samples of the blend were observed at all of the temperatures tested down through −30°C. With the insertion of springs to simulate large compliant structures, however, unstable failures resulted. At 25°C, initial ductile crack growth was followed by ductile but unstable failure. At −30°C, initial ductile crack growth was followed by brittle unstable failure. These instabilities resulted from the excessive amount of stored energy released by the system during initial crack growth. A higher rubber variant of the PBT/PC blend as well as acrylonitrile‐butadiene‐styrene (ABS) and polycarbonate exhibited similar behavior.

The response of filled melts in steady, dynamic and transient shear flows as well as uniaxial extensional flows are studied in terms of three important material variables: the volume concentration of the fillers, filier size and shape, and polymer-filler'interfacial characteristics. The fillers, the shapes of which strongly influence the overall rheology especially the elastic behavior, can be classified into those having directionality such as fibers and those without it which we denote as particles. Within each category, increasing filier loading increases the viscous dissipation and elastic energy storage capacity of the system eventually giving rise to a yield stress at high concentrations. Decreasing filier size increases the importance of interfacial interactions and generally results in larger values of viscous dissipation and elasticity. The ratio of the normal stress difference to shear stress is smaller for a particle filled system than for the pure melt, but is larger for a fiber filled melt compared to the pure melt. Extrudate swell decreases with the presence of fillers regardless of shape. Explanations for these contradictory observations, both of which relate to the elasticity of the system, is provided. The effect of the filler-polymer interface (interphase) on rheology is even more complex and depends on the specific interactions between the polymer, filier, and surface chemical additives. © 1987, Walter de Gruyter.

The gastric juice sample, treated with sulphamic acid to remove nitrite, is injected directly into refluxing ethyl acetate containing either acetic acid for determining thermo- and acetic acid labile thermal energy analyser (TEA) responsive compounds (TAC), or into hydrogen bromide for the determination of TAC and NOC. The nitric oxide (NO) levels released are measured using thermal energy analysis with chemiluminescence detection, and the difference between the two determinations represents the concentrations of NOC in gastric juice. This method is not affected by nitrate concentrations of up to 1000 μmol I -1. The method was found to be rapid, reproducible and sensitive (detection limit 0.02 μmol l-1 M NOC), requiring only small volumes of gastric juice and no prior extraction. Because the difficulties arising from the system response to the denitrosating agent and variability of NO release by acetic acid from nitrite were eliminated, this improved method can more accurately distinguish NOC from most other TEA-responsive species. Suitable techniques for stabilising gastric juice samples from duodenal ulcer and atrophie gastritis patients and the influence of the time and storage conditions on NOC concentrations have been studied.","Chemical denitrosation; Gastric juice analysis; Gastric juice stabilisation and storage; N-Nitroso compound determination; Thermal energy analysis","dyes, reagents, indicators, markers and buffers; nitroso derivative; article; human; stomach juice; technique; Gastric Juice; Human; Indicators and Reagents; Methods; Nitroso Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023372801

The degradation of many drugs in aqueous solutions occurs by hydrolysis. Equations using activation energy of the hydrolysis reaction (Ea) derived from Arrhenius principles, rate constants, and temperature are used to illustrate the exponential decrease in drug shelf-life proportional to an arithmetic increase in temperature. Use of the Q value, a factor based on Ea, rate constants, and temperature change, is described. The range of Ea for pharmaceutically important degradation reactions is relatively limited; thus, near room temperature, Q values of 2-5 can be used to estimate the effect of temperature change on shelf-lives of drugs in solution. To conservatively estimate effect on shelf-life when Ea is not known, a Q value of 2 is used to predict the increase in shelf-life obtained by decreasing storage temperature, and a Q of 5 is used to predict decrease in shelf-life from increasing the temperature. Sample calculations are used to show the application of equations based on these principles to practical temperature-dependent problems regarding shelf-life.

The finite‐element method is used to calculate the upper and lower cutoff frequencies of the stop band for metallic gratings of infinite periodic structure, and circuit parameters are determined from these values. Therefore, in this equivalent circuit, all the effects of piezoelectric perturbation, mechanical perturbation, and energy storage are taken into account. To show the validity and usefulness of this approach, for aluminum strips on some useful piezoelectric substrates (LiNbO3, quartz, LiTaO3, Li2B4O7), equivalent circuit parameters for each of the metallic gratings are determined and SAW reflection characteristics are computed. Result show that for the Li2B4O7 substrate, the reflection magnitude per strip is large and the influence of the change of strip thickness on the center frequency shift is small.

Because of the bombardment by high‐energy particles, the composition of the deposited film was different from that of the target material. However, we were able to beam films with stoichiometric composition by adjusting the composition of the target. In one case, the first 300 Å layer had spinel‐type crystal structure and the layer above that initial layer had the structure of the magnetoplumbite type of Ba‐ferrite, oriented along the c‐axis. In the other case, the entire film was composed of the Ba‐ferrite layer oriented along the c‐axis. The result of investigating the growth conditions showed that the spinel layer caused a Δθ50 dispersion of the growth orientation in the Ba‐ferrite layer away from the c‐axis. When the growth temperature was around 550°C, the growth occurred in the direction of the c‐axis. The surface roughness of the film was dependent on the distance between the target and the substrate, the partial pressure of oxygen, and the substrate temperature. At high oxygen partial pressures, the deviation of the growth orientation from the c‐axis was especially high, and the surface became rough. The best Ba‐ferrite film had the following properties: Δθ50 = 2 to 3°, Hc1 = 1.2 kOe and Ms = 300 emu/cc.

Point-plane aluminum electrodes were used with point radius 1.5 mm and gaps between 0.5 and 10 mm. It was found that a capacitor connected in parallel with an electrode gap reduces the electrical strength in a manner similar to that observed with increasing electrode area. The capacitance was found to play two major roles. On one hand, the larger stored energy associated with a larger capacitance promoted greater cathode damage. As a result, subsequent voltage breakdowns occurred at lower voltage levels. On the other hand, when additional stored energy was placed within 15 cm of a discharge site, the initial voltage application resulted in a breakdown voltage less than that observed in the absence of the capacitor during a comparable test. The results presented here advocate an energy based explanation of the area effect rather than a probabilistic weak link theory.

These approaches result in two classes of methods. The first includes equation‐solving methods that try to solve a nonlinear equation system; the second is based on a minimization of the total Gibbs free energy. Most of these methods may fail to find a solution or may lead to erroneous solutions near critical conditions when an equation of state is applied to both the vapor and liquid phases. New methods for solving the problem are proposed. Combining the simplicity in structure of the conventional successive‐substitution method and the efficiency of some unconstrained minimization algorithms, they all ensure convergence to local minima of the Gibbs free energy. The new methods are compared from the standpoints of computer storage and calculational effort requirements. The performance of these methods is tested on four multicomponent systems taken from literature, and a comparison is made with other published methods.

It replaces the salinity gradient zone by a transparent polymer gel and thereby eliminates all problems of instability associated with the former. A framework for the preliminary design of a gel pond to serve different purposes has been presented here. Heat extraction at constant pond storage zone temperatures of 40°–80°C at storage zone depths of 2–5 m has been considered and optimum pond dimensions have been predicted depending upon maximum and minimum heat load constraints. The computer simulations are carried out with the meteorological conditions for Albuquerque, New Mexico. For example, the simulations show that the gel pond can provide an average heat load of 107 W/m2, a typical domestic water heating requirement, at a constant pond temperature of 40°C with a storage zone depth of 4.0 m and gel thickness of 0.6 m. For the case of power generation, the pond can provide a minimum of 32 W/m2 at a constant pond temperature of 80°C with a storage zone depth of 4 m and gel thickness of 0.6 m. These factors combined with the easy operation and maintenance of the gel pond seem to make it a better alternative compared with the conventional salt gradient pond.

The fraction resistance of composites subjected to these conditions are of fundamental interest. A study was undertaken to examine the effects of Gammaradiation on the structure and properties of fibers, matrix and their interfacial bonding in terms of their influence on composite failure mechanisms. Also thermomechanical analysis was conducted to estimate the residual thermal stresses due to differential thermal expansion coefficients both between fiber and matrix and between two laminae. Results indicate that the impact energy of a composite laminate could be increased by 100 percent by immersing the specimen in liquid nitrogen for only five min. Samples impact‐tested at cryogenic temperatures were found to possess a great degree of delamination and crack bifurcation. Thermomechanical analysis and SEM investigation both reveal that microcracking and small‐scale delamination are promoted by differential thermal contraction. Such effects could be responsible for the observed crack branching and delamination phenomena during impact loading. Although under certain circumstances the Gammaradiation may yield a small increase in fracture resistance it generally degrades the cohesive strength of the matrix and reduces the interfacial bonding between fiber and matrix. Results of a mechanical and microscopic analysis are presented and discussed.

The absorption and translocation of mineral ions by the mycelia require an energy source and a reductant which are both supplied by respiratory catabolism of carbohydrates produced by the host plant. Photosynthates are also required to generate the carbon skeletons for amino acid and carbohydrate syntheses during the growth of the mycelia. Competition for photosynthates occurs between the fungal cells and the various vegetative sinks in the host tree. The nature of carbon compounds involved in these processes, their routes of metabolism, the mechanisms of control and the partitioning of metabolites between the various sites of utilization are only poorly understood. Both ascomycetous and basidiomycetous ectomycorrhizal fungi synthesize and some, if not all, accumulate mannitol, trehalose and triglycerides. The fungal strains employ the Embden-Meyerhof pathway of glucose catabolism and the key enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, transaldolase and transketolase). Anaplerotic CO2 fixation, via pyruvate carboxylase and/or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, provides high pools of amino acids. This process could be important in the recapture and assimilation of respired CO2 in the rhizosphere. The ectomycorrhizas are thought to contain the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which provide the carbon skeletons for the assimilation of ammonia into amino acids. The main route of assimilation of ammonia appears to be through the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase cycle in the ectomycorrhizas. Glutamate dehydrogenase plays a minor role in this process. Glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase are present in free-living ectomycorrhizal fungi and they participate in the assimilation of ammonia and the synthesis of amino acids through the glutamate dehydrogenase/glutamine synthetase sequence. In both in vitro cultures of fungi and ectomycorrhizas, the assimilated nitrogen accumulates in glutamine. Glutamine, but also ammonia, are thought to be exported from the fungal tissues to the host cells. Studies on the metabolism of ectomycorrhizas and ectomycorrhizal fungi have focused on the metabolic pathways and compounds which accumulate in the symbiotic tissues. Studies on regulation of the overall process, and the control of enzyme activity in particular, are still fragmentary. The partitioning of carbon into storage compounds, in respiration and in assimilation of nitrogen and the identification of the metabolites transported between the associates remain key areas for future research in ectomycorrhiza metabolism. © 1987.","carbon; ectomycorrhizal fungi; ectomycorrhizas; metabolism; nitrogen","carbon; nitrogen; fungus; metabolism; microbiology; review; symbiosis; tree; Carbon; Fungi; Nitrogen; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Symbiosis; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023350752

These facilities incorporate several features which allow the user to increase his operational flexibilty with respect to the local utility. These facilities can be: local generation, local dependent generation, local energy storage facility, and shiftable load schedule. The only true control the utility has over the actual operation of such facilities is through the judicious selection of the energy prices proposed to such users both for the sale and purchase of energy. It is likely that most utilities will react to this novel user-utility relationship by implementing timevarying energy prices to better reflect their own production costs. These time varying energy prices are often referred to as Spot Prices and are rather commonly used in Europe. A key issue is then the simulation of the various SPPF loads under various spot pricing policies and as they would be seen from the utility's point of view.

Experimental hardware is assembled and demonstrated to perform adequately, besides showing compactness of the space-packaged ""capsule"" module that is self-contained. Building upon previous studies, the concept of in situ propellant production (ISPP) is reexamined in light of more recent energy and materials technologies. Missions to comets and Mars Sample Return are mentioned as candidate scenarios. The mission duration, reliability-repairability of hardware, resource availability in low Earth orbit (LEO), and the thrust requirements are considered in turn. It is seen that space storage of hydrogen for extended durations (5-10 years) involves problems that require detailed studies, besides involving many presently unanswered issues. A study of the energy option in LEO and in deep space is developed in simple terms. The different solar, radioisotope, and nuclear power sources are mentioned. Storage and handling of raw and processed chemicals are considered. © American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., 1987, All rights reserved.",,"SPACECRAFT - Interplanetary; IN SITU PROPELLANT PRODUCTION; PROPULSION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023348441

Cyclic voltammetry indicates that unlike tin/alkali systems, the Sn/S= half-cell does not undergo passivation at storage potentials. Measured overpotentials in Sn/S= indicate large relative surface area tin electrodes can minimize polarization losses. Characterization of a variety of membranes indicates that a sulfonated polyethylene membrane minimizes problems of polysulfide passage into the tin/aqueous sulfide half-cell.

The present solution is suboptimal in the sense that it is a linear approximation of a non-linear plant. The recursive Kalman filter was employed for the linear regulator solution.

Phase identification was carried out using XRD, electron diffraction in TEM, and backscattered electron imaging in SEM. Phase microanalyses were carried out using energy-dispersive X-ray analyzers (EDX) during SEM and TEM examinations. X-ray diffraction and grain microanalyses using EDX revealed the existence of a pyrochlore-structured phase CaU(Ti3+, Ti4+)2O7, perovskite (Ca, U)(Ti3+, Ti4+)O3 and uraninite (U, Ca, Ti)O2, while Ba-hollandite Ba(Al3+, Ti3+)2Ti5O14 was identified using only XRD. The leaching resistance of SYNROC-FA was determined by carrying out a modified MCC-1 leach test in a simulated Canadian Shield groundwater at 90°C for 120 days. The normalized leach rate of Ba was 6 × 10-3 g · m-2 · d-1 while the concentrations of U and other simulated fission products in the leachants were below the detection limits of inductively coupled plasma spectrometry and atomic absorption techniques. The leach rates of U and Ti were estimated to be less than 6 × 10-5 and 3 × 10-5 g · m-2, respectively. © 1987.",,"MICROANALYSIS; RADIOACTIVE WASTES - Disposal; AMINE PROCESS; FISSION PRODUCTS; PHASE IDENTIFICATION; STORAGE; SYNROC-FA; CERAMIC MATERIALS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023327317

The female reproductive tract is a single straight tube containing small oogonia (6 micron in diameter), which are arranged in a rosette pattern around a central rachis at the anterior end of the tract. Developing oocytes separate from the rachis and pass posteriorly in single file down the growth zone. Oocytes increase rapidly in volume due to the accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusion granules. These granules are of 3 types. Type 1 granules are amorphous and probably consist primarily of lipoprotein. Type 2 granules are large lipid inclusions and type 3 granules are electron-dense lipoprotein yolk bodies, which are probably used for energy reserves in the developing embryo. Histochemical studies show a more intense reaction for DNA in the nuclei of oogonia than in the nuclei of oocytes. There is a strong reaction for RNA in the nucleoli and in the cytoplasm of oogonia and oocytes. Ultrastructural studies indicate that this RNA is probably in the form of rRNA in the abundant ribosomes. Mature oocytes are cylindrical (60 X 70 micron), have a distinct nucleus with nuclear pores, and the cytoplasm is filled with inclusion granules and ribosomes but contains only small amounts of glycogen. Prior to fertilization the plasma membrane of oocytes acquires a flocculent coat. These oocytes contain 6 distinct bivalent chromosomes in diakinesis. Thus the major changes that occur in developing germ cells are 2-fold: nuclear changes that prepare the chromosomes for fertilization by initiating reduction division, and cytoplasmic changes that involve the synthesis and storage of inclusion granules.",,"DNA; lipid; RNA; animal; article; cell granule; cell membrane; cell nucleus; electron microscopy; female; nematode; Nematospiroides dubius; oocyte; oocyte development; ovary; physiology; ultrastructure; Animals; Cell Membrane; Cell Nucleus; Cytoplasmic Granules; DNA; Female; Heligmosomatoidea; Lipids; Microscopy, Electron; Nematospiroides dubius; Oocytes; Oogenesis; Oogonia; Ovary; RNA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023324030

Detailed analytical and numerical analyses have been performed to study the fundamental aspects of the problem for simple geometries. Based on the detailed analyses, a thermal energy storage effectiveness parameter has been defined in terms of the changes in heating and cooling energy requirements of a single-zone building in response to the introduction of mass in its exterior walls. Calculations of the exterior wall effectiveness have been made to investigate the effect of variations in convection coefficients at the interior surface of external envelope materials, as well as the influence of dditional building parameters, such as internal loads, interior air temperature control strategy, and internal mass. To extent the results of the detailed analysis and to study the effects of variable convection coefficients on heating and cooling energy requirements in real buildings, simulations of two prototype residential buildings (in Mexico and the United States) have been performed using the building energy analysis computer program BLAST†. Results indicate that the energy consumption of a typical uninsulated Mexican residence is quite sensitive to the variations in convection coefficients commonly occurring in buildings (a difference up to a factor of three over the range 0.5 ≤ h ≤ 10.0 W/m2K). Buildings energy consumption of a typical well-insulated U.S. residence is less sensitive to variations in convection coefficients, although for some climates the effects are still significant (up to a 40% increase over the range 0.5 ≤ h ≤ 10.0 W/m2K). Since the convection coefficients at interior building surfaces vary quite widely within this range, this work suggests that for some climates and building constructions, improved characterization of convection coefficients is needed to permit reliable calculation of the energy requirements of buildings incorporating large amounts of thermal mass. © 1987.",,"BUILDING MATERIALS - Thermal Properties; HEAT TRANSFER - Convection; HOUSES - Computer Aided Analysis; CONVECTION COEFFICIENTS; EXTERIOR MASSIVE WALLS; THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE; BUILDINGS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023295205

Charge storage and conduction properties were measured using TSCD and open and short circuit TSC; and TSPC, respectively. Antioxidants increased negative and positive storage level and reduced conduction activation energies, but had little effect on lifetime. 0.01 wt% of phthalocyanine increased lifetime in the dark (x5) and conduction activation energy. Trapping may take place by the cage-like amine structure. 5 wt% of titanium dioxide increased charge lifetime by a factor of roughly 7. Defect traps were annealed out at low concentrations, and new deep traps were introduced by the titanium dioxide itself at all concentrations. Additive-matrix boundary trapping is another possibility for the latter two additives.

This system shows clear LFD behavior in the frequency domain and is known to be nonlinear with voltage. Surface conduction along the cleavage planes on humid mica is reported to have a time dependence fully consistent with LFD, but while the charging current is proportional to the applied voltage less an internal EMF of approximately 1 V, the discharge current is voltage-independent. The behavior is shown to be fully consistent with a model involving a secondary battery, probably arising at the mica-aluminum contact, and an internal humidity-dependent surface resistance. The results clearly confirm the validity of the earlier assumption that the LFD phenomena are related to electrochemical interactions and cannot be reconciled with normal electrostatic charge and energy storage. The model explains the enormously high low-frequency capacitances observed in many LFD systems, sometimes exceeding 100 F/m2.

The dispersed source is viewed as an active device contributing towards the regulation of real and reactive power flows while improving the stability of the power system. Conceptual means are developed for an effective DSG-utility grid interface. Computer models of appropriate interconnection and control equipment are used in simulation studies to test the effectiveness of control strategies and optimize design parameters. Simulation results indicate that load frequency control and voltage regulation may be effectively accomplished with dispersed generators within a fraction of the time required for conventional regulating units. Appropriate modulation and conditioning of the DSG-output power can assist in damping out undesirable power oscillations. Implementation of the proposed policies may result in reduced load following requirements for conventional power generating units, increase the value and acceptability of new energy technologies, and improve power quality and stability of the interconnected system.

If these elements are capacitors, the control circuit includes a window comparator, a polarity comparator, an AND gate, a switch and a source of reference voltage. This control circuit momentarily connects (each oscillation period) the oscillator capacitor to the source of reference voltage at the instant when energy in another storage element (a capacitor or an inductor) is absent. If the reference voltage is modulated, the new value of the oscillation amplitude is established without an amplitude transient in the oscillators with two energy storage elements (with a possible delay of up to one oscillation period). The oscillators with more than two storage elements will have an amplitude transient which can be calculated period by period.

Macro-engineering offers a variety of approaches to lessen, correct or alleviate drought and water problems, wherever they may occur. The WEALTH concept is proposed. (WEALTH is an acronymn for Water resources, Economy/energy/engineering, Agriculture/aquaculture, Land/light-solar radiation, Technology/transportation, and Health/human care/housing. A ""large-scale systems venture"" can be accomplished in the SubSahara-Sahel-Sudan region of Africa through the formation of one or more international public/private consortia. Phase 1 involves the establishment of Water-Solar Oasis projects that could become economically viable and independent in less than a decade. They would form a staggered emergency chain across Africa. The Water-Solar Oasis would include: a water source; a central photovoltaic (PV) concentrator system; intensive agriculture with water conservation and recycling, including greenhouses, hydroponics and aquaculture; storage facilities; sanitation systems; controlled grazing; and mobile PV-hybrid power for pumping water and electricity in outlying areas. An illustrative design is presented. Photovoltaic capabilities and progress are reviewed. Production commitments for PV and other components of the system would reduce the cost substantially. The use of PV power in conjunction with efficient pumps, drip irrigation, hydroponics, biosystems for water purification and recycling, and use of new low-cost materials (plastics, glass-reinforced concrete) would help the nomad and agriculture populations in Africa reduce the drastic effects of the recurring droughts. Disaster aid is expensive, inefficient, always too late, and never solves the problems. Hence, multinational private and public sectors are willing to take and share risk through International Technology Venturing Consortia, to resolve the water and food problems, as more rewarding socially, politically and economically than the continued drain on local, national and international resources year after year. The Water-Solar Oasis projects would be the beginning of a larger macro-engineering WEALTH program for better and more efficient water management to first greatly reduce the effects and later solve the drought problems. © 1987.",,"AGRICULTURE - Developing Countries; HOUSING - Developing Countries; PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS - Developing Countries; SOLAR RADIATION - Concentrators; WATER SUPPLY - Africa; HEALTH CARE; MACRO-ENGINEERING; WATER-SOLAR OASIS PROJECTS; WEALTH CONCEPT; WATER RESOURCES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023273228

The knowledge of the matrix effects and their origin was most important for the interpretation of the SIMS and IBSCA in-depth profiles recorded for samples prepared with variations of the production parameters. The variations in the degrees of hydration of the subsurface layers could be ascribed to the influence of the thermal treatment before coating, to the interaction with slurries of different pH values, and to the duration of storage before coating with lambda /4-MgF//2 layers. It is of importance for the fabrication of optical surfaces that the analysis results and the optical properties of the subsurface layers could be correlated with each other and with respective changes of the production parameters.

This high temperature and pressure process results in the production of sugars which may be fermented to ethanol. By virtue of their cellulosic content, agricultural, industrial and municipal solid wastes may all be processed by acid hydrolysis with an end result of waste disposal and recycling/recovery of important energy sources. The complete process of the conversion of a cellulosic waste through to the end product and by-product utilization has to give due consideration to likely technologies. Some essential problems that have to be tackled are raw material storage, availability and preparation, the optimum acid hydrolysis and fermentation conditions and product separation methods. This paper is a review of the research that is taking place not only in the field of acid hydrolysis but also in the types of waste used, the concentration of the product sugars, the optimization of the fermentation conditions and the use of low-energy alcohol recovery methods to replace conventional distillation.

Therefore, the purpose of these experiments was to examine the permanence of prenatal and early postnatal protein malnutrition on energy balance in rats. Five weeks before mating and through gestation adult female rats were fed either a 25 or 8% casein diet (designated 25 or 8). Diet reversals were performed at birth and/or weaning (designated B or W) and the pups were cross-fostered at birth. Thus, the groups were: (1) 25-25B (controls), (2) 8-25W (gestational and lactational protein malnutrition, (3) 82-5B (gestational protein malnutrition), and (4) 25-8B-25W (lactational protein malnutrition). Animals were weighed and sacrificed 200-250 days postpartum for carcass composition. Retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (RWAT) and interscapular BAT (IBAT) wet weights and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity were also measured in the 25-25B and 8-25W groups. Nutritional rehabilitation at birth (8-25B) resulted in normal body weights as adults. Lactational protein malnutrition (25-8B-25W) resulted in intermediate body weights to the controls (25-25W), which had the greatest weights, and the 8-25W group, which had the lowest weights. The 8-25W and 25-8B-25W rats also had significantly decreased carcass wet weight and total body water, fat and fat-free dry mass relative to the 25-25B and 8-25B groups, the latter two of which did not differ in their carcass composition. The 8-25B and 25-8B-25W groups exhibited a selective decrease in the percent of the carcass as lipid. Despite more than 6 months of nutritional rehabilitation beginning at weaning (8-25W), IBAT wet weight, total protein, and specific LPL activity (LPL activity per mg protein) were decreased relative to the 25-25B rats. Total IBAT LPL activity did not differ between the groups. Similarly, the 8-25W rats had decreased RWAT wet weight and total RWAT LPL activity relative to the 25-25B group. The critical time period for protein malnutrition to affect the mechanisms underlying the decreases in body mass and carcass lipid content may be during lactation, since the offspring of prenatally protein malnourished rats cross-fostered at birth to mothers fed a nutritionally adequate protein diet (8-25B) did not exhibit the selective decrease in carcass lipid content, but the offspring of gestational and lactational protein malnourished mothers (8-25W), and, more importantly, the offspring of lactationally protein malnourished mothers (25-8B-25W), both had decreased body weights and carcass lipid content despite the extended nutritional rehabilitation. © 1987.","Body fat; Brown adipose tissue; Carcass composition; Lipoprotein lipase; Protein malnutrition","lipoprotein lipase; adult; animal experiment; brown adipose tissue; fetus; infant; newborn; nonhuman; priority journal; protein malnutrition; rat; soft tissue; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Body Composition; Body Water; Body Weight; Brown Fat; Female; Lipids; Lipoprotein Lipase; Male; Organ Weight; Protein Deficiency; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023262767

Irradiation of seed before planting can stimulate early plant growth, leading to advanced maturity and increased yield. The unreliability of this response has limited its application. However, the technique has been extensively studied and now is practiced on a large scale on some farms in certain countries. Our research has addressed various factors that may determine the stimulation response with the goal of developing an ability to predict the occurrence of increased economic yield. In this paper, we discuss several of these factors in light of our data and data from other field studies in Canada. A hormesis response was observed for most species studied, but varied among cultivars and among seed lots within a cultivar. Seed condition may be the underlying factor in these effects. The response was most frequently evident at very early stages of growth and was often masked in subsequent growth. This suggests that the hormesis phenomenon in seeds may be quite common and is not reliably manifest in advanced maturity or yield increases because of environmental effects. Storage time after irradiation must be minimized to gain the greatest response. There is little evidence to suggest that the photon energy or dose rate of the radiation source is an important factor. 1987 Health Physics Society. © 1987 Health Physics Society Pergamon Press Ltd.",,"priority journal; Cereals; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Seeds; Vegetables",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023256119

The system studied works without a heat exchanger loop because care is being taken to prevent freezing. This is accomplished by a sufficiently large volume of water to provide inertia plus the use of high quality transparent insulation materials for the front cover. This extremely simple system is modelled using actual weather data for a year with exceedingly low temperatures. The conditions under which freezing is excluded are determined and the optimized system is evaluated for the entire year regarding solar fraction for a four person household and conversion efficiency. Also evaluated are different types of auxiliary heaters: Solar fraction ranges from 55.6 to 41.0% and efficiency from 35 to 26% for a 4 m2 integrated storage collector.

Excessive flyrock is produced when there is too much explosive energy for the amount of burden, stemming is inadequate, or the explosive energy is too rapidly vented through a zone of weakness in the rock. Geology, improper blast design, or carelessness can cause unwanted flyrock. Most misfire accidents are caused by drilling into bootlegs in underground mines. Improper disposing of misfires is the second most frequent cause of misfire accidents, and some accidents are due to impact initiation of explosives in the muckpile.

For this purpose, a direct-gain ambient-energy recuperation factor has been defined and correlated with the difference between the 'indoor' thermostat setting and the ambient environment's air temperature, divided by the total amount of solar radiation transmitted per day into the living space through the glazing. An expression for this factor is obtained by solving a one-dimensional energy-balance equation which involves (i) the total amount of solar and 'internal' energy gains, (ii) the average thermal conductance of the house's envelope, and (iii) the storage properties of the constructional materials employed in this envelope. The method facilitates the estimation of the following: the solar contribution to the building's heating requirements; the amount of solar energy captured per day that exceeds the house's daily heating load, and which must therefore be vented to prevent overheating; as well as the variation with time of the temperature within the building. Finally the effects of altering (i) the thermostat set-temperature, (ii) the properties of the thermal-store, and (iii) the collector-to-store areas ratio upon the direct-gain ambient-energy recuperation factor (and consequently on the amount of auxiliary energy needed for heating or cooling) have been investigated. © 1987.",,"HEATING - Solar; SOLAR RADIATION; AMBIENT-ENERGY RECUPERATION FACTOR; ENERGY BALANCE EQUATION; NONVENTED TROMBE WALLS; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023244240

Patients immobilized with a long leg cast after tibial fractures or ligamentous injuries were studied immediately after removal of the cast and after mean periods of 18, 36 and 81 days of remobilization. Immobilization resulted in a decrease of circumferential dimensions. The difference in mid-thigh circumference between the immobilized and the unaffected leg was still present after 81 days of remobilization both for the patients with tibial fractures and for the patients with ligamentous lesions. An increase of midpatellar circumference was present exclusively in the patients with ligamentous lesions at all four testing dates, indicating that this is an effect of the ligamentous lesion and not of immobilization per se. Variables of the hysteresis diagrams, resulting from sinusoidal movement of the knee at a range of knee angles, were used to quantify passive resistance of the knee in the flexion-extension plane (the muscles crossing the knee are inactive). Variables related to the elastic storage and release of energy, and variables related to energy dissipation were discerned. During remobilization the increased resistance to flexion (shown by the variables related to the elastic storage of energy), as found immediately after removal of the cast, disappears and the resistance becomes identical to the resistance of the unaffected leg. This may indicate a rapid readaptation of the length of ventral structures (shortened due to immobilization in a shortened position) to almost normal values. The variables related to energy dissipation, which do not differ between the two legs immediately after immobilization, are low in comparison with the unaffected knee during the whole remobilization period studied, indicating a remaining atrophy (as is also shown by the still decreased aircumference of the lower limb). All resistance variables are still lower at the last date of testing when the knee is extended. The remobilization period studied was not long enough to achieve complete restoration of the dimensions of the lower limb and full return of normal passive resistance of the knee. © 1987.","immobilization; knee joint; Passive resistance; remobilization; sinusoidal movements","HUMAN KNEE; PASSIVE RESISTANCE; REMOBILIZATION; BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS - Fracture; BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING - Fracture Fixation; JOINTS; MATERIALS TESTING; BIOMECHANICS; clinical article; human; immobilization; joint; joint mobility; knee; priority journal; resistance; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Humans; Immobilization; Knee Injuries; Leg; Ligaments, Articular; Male; Middle Aged; Movement; Rupture; Tibial Fractures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023242994

We studied 13 full-term surgical infants (mean initial weight 2.88±0.19 kg; mean days postsurgery 5.0±0.5). Ten infants were receiving total parenteral nutrition and three were orally fed (mean caloric intake 84±4 kcal/kg/d; mean fluid intake 145±4 mL/kg/d). Total body water (TBW) was measured by isotope dilution using heavy oxygen (18O) labeled water (H218O). Total body fat (TBF) was estimated from anthropometric data. Lean body mass (LBM) was calculated as follows: LBM = weight - TBF. Protein, fat, and carbohydrate accretion were determined by energy and macronutrient balance in conjunction with open-circuit indirect calorimetry. Body composition was reevaluated after an interval of seven days. Body weight increased from 2.88±0.19 to 3.00±0.19 kg, representing a mean growth velocity of 5.9 g/kg/d. Increments were observed in all body compartments but only the increase in TBF reached statistic significance (12.9 v 14% of body weight, P&lt;.05). TBW ranged from an initial value of 76.2±1.4% to a value of 75.5±1.4% at the end of the study. Protein, fat, and carbohydrate accretion (g/kg/d) during the seven-day study period were 1.62±0.13; 1.44±0.41, and 0.96±0.70, respectively.

Such pulses contain only four optical cycles, and even shorter pulses should be feasible. The amplification of such pulses requires a large gain bandwidth. Pulses shorter than approx 40 ps exceed the bandwidth of a single rotational-vibration transition in even 10-atm CO//2 amplifiers. However, for pressures above approx 10 atm the individual rotational lines strongly overlap, producing a weakly modulated gain bandwidth of more than 0. 5 THz. This bandwidth is sufficient for the amplification of pulses as short as 2. 5 ps through very large gains.

T2N 4N1, Canada","To explain why subjects vary in body fat content despite similar nutrient intake and physical activity, a hypothesis is proposed invoking individual variability in the potentially vast quantities of energy utilizable for such biomechanical functions as cellular motility processes, and for protein mobility. The collective term ""biomechanical-mobile"" activity is introduced. The hypothesis explains variation without differences in external energy losses. After utilization for indispensable metabolic needs and the variable ""biomechanical-mobile"" activity, excess energy is mainly transduced to anabolic processes, and eventually stored as chemical energy, mostly as adipocyte triglycerides. At one extreme, are subjects with the least degrees of ""biomechanical-mobile"" activity, the consequently largest surfeits of energy for chemical storage, and thus the greatest susceptiblity to massive obesity. The converse applies to inordinate leanness. Between the extremes, the almost infinite individual variability is due to a ""continuous"" distribution of ""biomechanical-mobile"" activity inversely related to the quantity remaining for chemical storage. While the extremes may result from mutations, the intervening continuum is ascribed to genetic polymorphism and to novel endocrine-neural mechanisms. In addition, such environmental influences as diet and drugs might modulate ""biomechanical-mobile"" activity. This hypothesis is extrapolated to all living systems. © 1987.",,"obesity; susceptibility; theoretical study; Adipose Tissue; Biomechanics; Cell Movement; Energy Metabolism; Human; Models, Biological; Obesity; Polymorphism (Genetics); Thinness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023219586

On the basis of the 13C shifts, C8-C9stretching character is assigned at 1217 cm-1in rhodopsin, at 1206 cm-1in isorhodopsin, and at 1214 cm-1in bathorhodopsin. C10-C11stretching character is localized at 1098 cm-1in rhodopsin, at 1154 cm-1in isorhodopsin, and at 1166 cm-1 in bathorhodopsin. C14-C15stretching character is found at 1190 cm-1in rhodopsin, at 1206 cm-1 in isorhodopsin, and at 1210 cm-1in bathorhodopsin. C12-C13stretching character is much more delocalized, but the characteristic coupling with the C14H rock allows us to assign the “C12-Ci3 stretch” at ~ 1240 cm-1in rhodopsin, isorhodopsin, and bathorhodopsin. The insensitivity of the C14-C15stretching mode to N-deuteriation in all three pigments demonstrates that each contains a trans (anti) protonated Schiff base bond. The relatively high frequency of the C10-C11mode of bathorhodopsin demonstrates that bathorhodopsin is s-trans about the C10-C11single bond. This provides strong evidence against the model of bathorhodopsin proposed by Liu and Asato [Liu, R., &amp; Asato, A. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 259], which suggests a C10-C11s-cis structure. Comparison of the fingerprint modes of rhodopsin (1098, 1190, 1217, and 1239 cm-1) with those of the 11-cis-retinal protonated Schiff base in methanol (1093, 1190, 1217, and 1237 cm-1) shows that the frequencies of the C-C stretching modes are largely unperturbed by protein binding. In particular, the invariance of the C14-C15stretching mode at 1190 cm-1does not support the presence of a negative protein charge near C13 in rhodopsin. In contrast, the frequencies of the C8-C9and C14-C15stretches of bathorhodopsin and the C10-C11and C14-C15stretches of isorhodopsin are significantly altered by protein binding. The implications of these observations for the mechanism of wavelength regulation in visual pigments and energy storage in bathorhodopsin are discussed. © 1987, American Chemical Society.

In this paper, the critical buckling load of isotropic and orthotropic cylinders subjected to different types of wind load distributions is investigated. The prebuckling displacements are obtained by using the membrane theory of shell analysis. The principle of minimum potential energy in conjunction with Ritz's approach is used to obtain the stability matrix. The size of the stability matrix in this analysis is (81 × 81). By solving the stability matrix as an eigenvalue problem, the critical pressures are obtained as eigenvalues and the deflection shapes as eigenvectors.

To reduce this heat loss further, either a movable insulation cover during off sun-shine hours over glazing or a thermal trap sheet over the blackened surface is used.

The summer and winter optimum tilts are found to be 0° and 50°, respectively. Based on these optimum tilts, the annual performance of different types of solar collectors which have experimental efficiency curves is predicted. The variation of the performance of the collectors with the optimum tilts is found to be small. The difference between the outlet temperatures of these collectors is also found to be small. The effect of changing the incident angle from zero degrees is found to increase the efficiency of the flat-plate collectors and to reduce the efficiency of the evacuated collectors. In the coldest month of the year, the flat-plate collector can collect heat up to 70°C, while the tubular one can collect heat with temperature more than 90°C. In the other months, all the collectors collect heat with temperatures more than 90°C. The performance of a well-mixed storage tank used with one of the flat-plate collectors is annually predicted.

Because of the loop, the MSHHP system uses less energy than other HVAC systems while lowering peak demand. This is done by shifting the required electrical energy consumption to lower rate periods, such as off-peak and mid-peak times. Lower installed heat pump capacity, such as refrigeration, is another benefit of the MSHHP system.

Using a combination of linear programming and gradient techniques, the following conclusions are obtained:. During the worst days of the heating season, passive solar houses built above ground use a substantial amount of peak backup energy even if they are well designed. Even relatively crude off-peak controls provide reasonable comfort provided the energy is introduced in thermal masses well coupled to the room [e.g. 0.05 m (2 inches) beneath the inside face of the Trombe wall or 0.05 m (2 inches) below the top of the slab floor]. Introducing off-peak energy in thermal masses poorly coupled to the room (e.g. deep in the floor slab) makes proper control very difficult without very accurate weather prediction. Reducing backup use to zero from 7 am to 10 pm requires a doubling of daily backup use in Albuquerque and Madison. Excluding backup for shorter periods (e.g. 5 pm to 9 pm) requires an increase of about 25% in daily backup consumption. Even if off-peak energy is stored at points reasonably well coupled to the room, significant backup and comfort penalties are incurred with erroneous weather forecasts. Even in two adjacent days in Madison, reversing the weather patterns while maintaining the same off peak control strategies resulted in either wasting half the backup energy or severely under heating the house. The effects of faulty weather forecasts are more severe when poorly coupled storage sites are used. © 1987 Pergamon Journals Ltd.",,"ENERGY UTILIZATION; OFF-PEAK ENERGY; PEAK LOAD; PEAK LOAD BLACKOUT; BUILDINGS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023209412

First, the emergence and growth of solar pond technology since the 1950's is described. The inherent problems encountered with the conventional salt gradient ponds are discussed, leading to the concept of the solar gel pond in which the salt gradient layer in the former is replaced by a transparent polymer gel. The major work in the first phase dealt with the experimental development of a polymer gel which met certain selection criteria. The criteria considered included transmissivity, stability of physical and chemical properties, high viscosity and other physical and optical properties. The gradual development of the polymer gel through an alternating process of testing and elimination and evaluation of relevant properties of the gel has been described. Modeling and optimization studies of the solar gel pond have been presented. Bansal and Kaushik's model for a salt gradient pond has been modified for a solar gel pond, and the results of the simulation are presented in a graphical form to serve as a quick reference for estimation of pond surface area, depth and flow rate for heat extraction depending on the extreme temperature required in the storage zone and the required heat load. Then, a cost-benefit economic analysis compares the economics of a solar gel pond with a conventional salt gradient pond. The construction of an experimental gel pond (18 m2) at The University of New Mexico is described, and the results of the study are summarized. Information on commercial scale ponds at Chamberino, New Mexico (110 m2), and in Albuquerque, New Mexico (400 m2), is provided. The review of the technology demonstrates the immense potential of the gel pond as a source of alternate energy for the years ahead. © 1987 Pergamon Journals Ltd.",,"GELS - Applications; GEL POND; GEL SCREENING; SALT-GRADIENT POND; SWELLING RATIO; SOLAR RADIATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023208116

Norepinephrine, the neurotransmitter of the postganglionic sympathetic nerves, increases the rate of formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in cells. Cyclic AMP the modulator of certain key enzymes of metabolism, was decreased in sympathetically-aneural hearts. Six histochemical assays were used to investigate the metabolic profile of sympathetically aneural hearts as compared to control hearts. NADH-tetrazolium reductase activity (indicator of oxidative metabolism), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (indicator of glycolytic rate), β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (indicator of β-oxidation of fatty acids), and oil red 0 assay (neutral lipid content) each demonstrated no difference between aneural and control hearts. Periodic acid-Schiff method for glycogen content, indicated greater stores of glycogen in aneural hearts compared to controls. α-Glucan phosphorylase, an enzyme responsible for glycogen hydrolysis, showed less activity in aneural hearts than in controls. The results indicate that the sympathetically aneural heart's metabolism is altered by decreased capability in the maximal rate of glycogen breakdown (decreased phosphorylase Vmax) and subsequent increased storage of the glycogen substrate.

Since 1978, we have been using human amniotic membrane incorporating 0·5 per cent silver nitrate. Studies in 96 patients using this method showed that the silver-incorporated membranes gave a better therapeutic effect than plain amniotic membranes. It was noted that 0·5 per cent silver nitrate incorporated into the membranes increased their manageability, provided easier application to the burned area and created a bactericidal effect, therefore reducing the risk of contamination and infection. One of the main advantages of wound coverage with amniotic membrane is that it does not appear to discourage re-epithelization, reduces fluid, protein, heat and energy loss, increases mobility and most important this may be the ideal wound cover next to the patient's own skin. Therefore, we highly recommend the use of 0·5 per cent silver nitrate-incorporated amniotic membrane, since it is readily available and freely obtainable has low preparation and storage costs that make it an ideal dressing to use especially in countries where economic factors prevent the purchase of other types of dressings. © 1987.",,"silver nitrate; amnion; burn; clinical article; human; injury; pregnancy; therapy; wound dressing; Adolescent; Adult; Bandages; Biological Dressings; Burns; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Human; Infant; Male; Middle Age; Silver Nitrate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023202203

Sixteen small for gestational age infants, 21 infants of mothers with preeclampsia, and 13 symptomatic infants of diabetic mothers had significantly higher transferrin levels and lower ferritin levels and calculated iron stores than did asymptomatic gestational age-matched control infants without these conditions. Cord ferritin levels and calculated iron stores were significantly lower in the infants of diabetic mothers than in any other group of infants. Cord transferrin levels were inversely correlated with ferritin levels (r=-0.59, P<0.001) and were unrelated to transthyretin levels and birth weight in the high-risk infants, but were positively correlated with ferritin levels (r=0.50, P<0.001), transthyretin levels (r=0.65, P<0.001), and birth weight (r=0.75, P<0.001) in the control infants. We conclude that cord transferrin levels do not reflect protein-energy status in newborn infants with prenatal histories suggesting uteroplacental insufficiency or chronic hypoxia, and that when associated with decreased cord ferritin levels, indicate possible impaired iron stores in these infants. © 1987 The C.

Anoxia and cyanide intoxication were combined with substrate deficiency at constant perfusion flow. All three energy-depleting procedures caused a similar overflow of noradrenaline which, following a constant delay of 10 minutes without increased release, amounted to more than 25% of total heart content within 40 minutes. This noradrenaline overflow was not diminished in the absence of extracellular calcium and was inhibited by the uptake1 blocker desipramine in all three experimental models, indicating a common and nonexocytotic release mechanism. In the presence of glucose, neither anoxia nor cyanide intoxication resulted in a measurable noradrenaline overflow. Conversely, blockade of glycolysis or glucose depletion prior to ischemia or cyanide poisoning accelerated the noradrenaline overflow, demonstrating a key role of the sympathetic nerve cells' energy status in causing nonexocytotic catecholamine release. Blockade of energy metabolism in the presence of oxygen (cyanide model) resulted in the overflow of high amounts of dihydroxyphenylglycol that was not inhibited by uptake1 blockade. The release of the lipophilic dihydroxyphenylglycol by diffusion reflects deamination of axoplasmic noradrenaline by monoamine oxidase. Since saturation of the enzyme could be excluded in this model dihydroxyphenylglycol release can be taken as a mirror of cytoplasmic noradrenaline concentration. The results obtained by these studies indicate that nonexocytotic catecholamine release is a two-step process induced by energy deficiency in the sympathetic varicosity. In a first step, noradrenaline is lost from storage vesicles, resulting in increasing axoplasmic concentrations. The second step is the rate-limiting transport of intracellular noradrenaline across the cell membrane by the uptake1 carrier that has reversed its normal net transport direction.",,"3,4 dihydroxyphenylethylene glycol; cyanide; noradrenalin; animal experiment; etiology; heart; heart muscle ischemia; ischemia; nonhuman; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023197241

The one tends to limit storage of energy as fat by promoting the dissipation of nonessential dietary calories and tends to preserve mobility. It appears to be largely under control of the sympathetic nervous system. The other promotes storage of dietary fat in the form of fat, and tends to protect in time of famine. These two mechanisms operate in varying proportions in the heterogeneous animal that is man. The predominance of the second mechanism of fat storage and the insulin resistance that often accompanies it is associated with modern lifestyles and is closely related to the byproducts of obesity, hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.

A new technology, computed radiographic imaging, has been investigated as a means of producing images taken with 6 and 10 MV x rays.

Image processing using contrast enhancement and unsharp masking yields images at least as good as the best portal films obtainable with conventional commercial radiotherapy cassettes. Additionally, CRI offers advantages of reduced image size and digital storage.

Cells were continuously moving, without interruption by resting periods, on glass as well as on plastic surfaces covered with liquid medium. Gliding cells always moved in the direction of their headlike structure; their course did not indicate any preference for a certain direction. Under appropriate growth conditions, cells showed linear and circular movements. Under inadequate conditions, cells glided in narrow circles or entered into zigzag trembling and tumbling movements. Organisms glided as single cells, in pairs, and in multicellular configurations. Movement patterns and gliding velocity were significantly affected by the cultivation and preparation time, the medium viscosity, and the storage and observation temperature. The number of passages on artificial media and the composition of the media used did not have a striking influence on gliding motility, but movements were effectively inhibited by homologous antiserum.

This improvement is accomplished by subdividing the converter into two or more series-resonant power modules. The power modules are operated with a constant relative phase shift (phase-staggering control). The elimination of the harmonic components in the input and output currents of the conversion system without increasing the internal pulse frequency is justified by Fourier analysis of the current waveforms. The frequency spectra of the source and output waveforms for the continuous and discontinuous resonant current mode are shifted to higher frequency ranges for both a single module and paralleled modules. Inadequacies in the phase-staggering control method applied to series-resonant converters are indicated. The control method decreases the rms current through the input and output capacitors of the converter and the losses in the indicated components, which is advantageous for low-voltage, high-current applications.",,"ELECTRIC CONVERTERS, POWER TYPE - Control; ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS - Resonance; PARALLELED POWER MODULES; PHASE STAGGERING CONTROL; SERIES-RESONANT DC-DC CONVERTER; CONTROL, ELECTRIC VARIABLES",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023174373

The decay heat generated by spent fuel in a dry storage cask is removed through a combination of conduction, natural convection, and thermal radiation. One major advantage of COBRA-SFS is that fluid recirculation within the cask is computed directly by solving the mass and momentum conservation equations. In addition, thermal radiation heat transfer is modeled using detailed radiation exchange factors based on quarter-rod segments. The equations governing mass, momentum, and energy conservation for incompressible flows are presented, and the semi-implicit solution method is described. COBRA-SFS predictions are compared to temperature data from a spent fuel storage cask test, and the effect of different fill media on the cladding temperature distribution is discussed. The effect of spent fuel consolidation on cask thermal performance is also investigated.",,"COMPUTER AIDED ANALYSIS; HEAT TRANSFER; RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS - Storage; COBRA-SFS COMPUTER CODE; SPENT FUEL STORAGE (SFS); THERMAL-HYDRAULIC ANALYSIS; NUCLEAR REACTORS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023171731

This behavior is related to the sinusoidal energy exchange between the parasitic capacitances of the power stage and the energy-storage reactor during the discontinuous MMF mode of operation. The resulting ringing can cause dramatic variations in the apparent gain of the power train, thereby affecting the dynamic performance of the power supply.

Recent studies have also shown their thermal performance to be comparable with that of equivalent active systems. When pump power is considered, the energy savings of domestic hot water thermosyphons can be significantly superior to active systems. In spite of these advantages, use of solar thermosyphons in the United States is almost negligible compared to their widespread use in other countries. A major limitation to the use of thermosyphons in the United States is lack of effective, reliable freeze protection. One technique for reliable, passive freeze protection is to use a heat exchanger in the storage tank and a nonfreezing fluid in the collector. Previous analytical work indicates that the performance penalty for these systems with practical-sized heat exchangers may be small enough to make these systems economically feasible. A full-scale, residential-size test facility has been constructed for testing this concept and validating the theoretical models. This paper describes results of testing comparing the performance of a horizontal tank with and without heat exchanger to a baseline case of a vertical tank without heat exchanger. An analytical expression for a ""heat exchanger penalty factor"" for these systems is derived and compared with the experimental results. © 1987.",,"HEAT EXCHANGERS; FREEZE PROTECTION; PERFORMANCE PENALTY; SOLAR THERMOSYPHONS; TEST FACILITY; WATER HEATERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023164196

Numerical calculations for fifty rows of capsules showed that there is a certain location in the rows where the heat transfer rate between the capsules and the flow shows a maximum value, and the location moves to the down-stream rows as time proceeds. © 1987, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

Because detectable alteration of brainwater content may start within the first hours after an ischemic insult, MR imaging promises to be a unique tool in the experimental and clinical approach to cerebral infarction. MR spectroscopy offers a noninvasive method for observing the fundamental metabolic processes of cell function. Phosphorus-31 (P-31) MR spectroscopy can elucidate the accumulation and depletion of molecules that act as the energy storage substrates of the cell and their breakdown products. The pH within the tissue of interest can be calculated. Hydrogen MR spectroscopy can detect lactate accumulation when ischemia forces a shift from aerobic to anaerobic glycolysis. More sophisticated metabolic pathways are also accessible to MR spectroscopy. Because MR imaging and MR spectroscopy can be done with the same instrument in a single experimental model or in a human patient, MR offers a unique methodology for investigating acute (potentially reversible) ischemia, its evolution, and the effect of various therapeutic interventions on its prognosis. The purpose of this review is to summarize the initial experience with MR imaging in the clinical setting of cerebral ischemia and to introduce the reader to the potential future application of combined MR imaging/spectroscopy in this disease process by discussing clinically relevant experimental models.

The dispersed PV generator is viewed as an active device used to improve system stability by appropriately modulating the power conditioning unit's output power. Disturbances on the utility system can be damped out by injecting this power into the grid in such a way so that the net effect is a cancellation of undesirable oscillations. The approach is implemented by monitoring the oscillating power and generating control signals which shape accordingly the interface unit's output power. Successful implementation of the scheme relies heavily on the speed and flexibility with which the electronic inverter moves power from the primary source/storage facility to the utility lines. Simulation studies, using the proposed control approach, indicate that application of these policies may result in reduced load following requirements for conventional power generating units, increase the value and acceptability of new energy technologies, and improve power quality and stability of the interconnected system.",,"PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS - Control; DISPERSED PV GENERATOR; DISTRIBUTION NETWORK; ELECTRONIC INVERTER; GRID CONNECTED PHOTOVOLTAIC SOURCES; POWER CONDITIONING; UNDESIRABLE OSCILLATIONS; ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023147043

While the yearly investment in machinery and equipment may approach US$100 billion, the value of products treated by refrigeration is perhaps ten times this amount. The importance of refrigeration is bound to increase since it will be an essential factor in solving two major problems of the future: the supply of enough food and the development of new energy sources. The use of low temperatures constitutes a major means of conservation of perishable foods during storage and distribution and it is widely applied in the developed countries. In the Third World, however, the use of low temperatures is mainly limited to food for export and the needs of the 'well-to-do' sector of the population. Refrigerated or frozen foods, in their present form, are generally priced too high for the undernourished poor. There is a pressing need for simple and inexpensive cooling methods to enable efficient low cost mass production and distribution under more primitive conditions. The future of man, and his food supply in particular, depends on the availability of sufficient energy. At present, fossil fuels carry the main load, but in the course of the next century new energy sources, such as nuclear fusion, will have to be commissioned. Refrigeration technology will play an important part in this development. © 1987.","economics; refrigeration; review","ENERGY UTILIZATION; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT; FOOD PRODUCTS - Refrigeration; ENERGY NEEDS; ENERGY SUPPLY; FOOD NEEDS; POPULATION EXPLOSION; REFRIGERATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023138779

The small molecular constituents within these cytoplasmic samples were controlled by a dialysis capillary with a 6,000 molecular weight cut off. The negative log of the calcium ion activity (pCa) (6.72 ± 0.03, n = 40) and, in some cases, the pH (7.51 ± 0.01, n = 7) of the samples were monitored with ion-sensitive microelectrodes. Adding 5 mM succinate or 5 mM ATP at pH 7.5 caused the Ca activity in the cytoplasm to drop from an experimentally elevated value of ~10 μM to below 1 μM. This decrease could be inhibited with ruthenium red, suggesting a mitochondrial mechanism. Ca uptake, following the addition of either succinate or ATP, was reversibly slowed when the cytoplasmic pH was elevated to ~8.3. When ruthenium red was added after mitochondria had taken up Ca, the Ca activity in the extramitochondrial cytoplasm gradually increased, suggesting ongoing release of Ca from storage sites. Increasing the cytoplasmic pH to ~8.5 in the presence of ruthenium red did not increase the ongoing release over that found with ruthenium red alone. The apparent washout of Ca from the energy-independent, nonmitochondrial Ca buffers was only slightly affected by pH (pH 7.5-8.5). It is concluded that elevating intracellular pH to 8.3 slows the Ca uptake by mitochondria. Thus cytoplasmic pH may have a function in regulating mitochondrial Ca metabolism and/or extramitochondrial calcium activity.",,"calcium; animal cell; cytosol; invertebrate; mitochondrion; myxicola; nerve fiber; nervous system; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; Animalia; Annelida; Invertebrata; Myxicola; Myxicola infundibulum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023135396

The overall ATPase activity (150–250 nmol ADP min−1 mg−1) of the granule ghost preparations was inhibited &lt; 5% by the bathophenanthroline chelate of Fe(II), a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial F1‐ATPase. This small inhibition can be accounted for by a very minor contamination with mitochondria or mitochondrial fragments. The overall ATPase activity of native granule ghosts was inhibited about 75% by N‐ethylmaleimide, with half‐maximal inhibition at about'20 μM. The titration curve was slightly shifted towards higher concentrations as compared to the inhibition curve for the proton pump activity, which was completely inhibited at 25 μM. N,N′‐Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide inhibited the overall ATPase activity by 75–80% at 1.1 μmol/mg protein, a concentration that completely abolished the proton pump activity. Low concentrations (10 μM) of vanadate inhibited the overall ATPase activity by about 15% but had no effect on the proton pump activity, which was partly inhibited only at higher vanadate concentrations. Our attempts to assign a function to the vanadate‐sensitive and N‐ethylmaleimide‐insensitive ATPase have so far been unsuccessful. In particular, our assay for ATP diphosphohydrolase activity was negative, although the chromaffin granule ghosts revealed a low Mg2+‐ADPase activity (11.8 nmol AMP min−1 mg−1 protein). In intact chromaffin granules the specific Mg2+‐ATPase activity (50–70 nmol ADP min−1 mg−1) was stimulated 2‐fold by uncouplers, as compared to 1.6–1.7‐fold in granule ghosts. The degree of energy coupling was rather independent of the external pH (6.5 &lt; pH &lt; 8.0) and temperature (20–45°C). As expected, partial inhibition (about 15%) of the overall ATPase activity by 10 μM vanadate increased the ATPase control ratio. ADP was found be a potent inhibitor of the proton pump activity with MgATP as the substrate, and the effect can partly be explained by a competitive type of inhibition of the hydrolytic reaction. This effect of ADP explains some of the kinetic data reported for MgATP‐dependent (H+‐ATPase‐dependent) reactions in this organelle, notably the energy‐dependent accumulation and storage of catecholamines.

The present experiments were conducted to determine the metabolic anad vasomotor responses during exposures to similar RF fields. We exposed five adult male rhesus monkeys to 225 MHz radiation (E orientation) in an anechoic chamber. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were measured before, during, and after RF exposure. Colonic, tail and leg skin temperatures were continuously monitored with RF‐nonperturbing probes. The monkeys were irradiated at two carefully‐controlled ambient temperatures, either cool (20 °C) or thermoneutral (26 °C). Power densities ranged from 0 (sham) to 10.0 mW/cm2 with an average whole‐body SAR of 0.285 (W/kg)/(mW/cm2). We used two experimental protocols, each of which began with a 120‐min pre‐exposure equilibration period. One protocol involved repetitive 10‐min RF exposures at successively higher power densities with a recovery period between exposures. In the second protocol, a 120‐min RF exposure permitted the measurement of steady‐state thermoregulatory responses. Metabolic and vasomotor adjustments in the rhesus monkey exposed to 225 MHz occurred during brief or sustained exposures at SARs at or above 1.4 W/kg. The SAR required to produce a given response varied with ambient temperature. Metabolic and vasomotor responses were coordinated effectively to produce a stable deep body temperature. The results show that the thermoregulatory response of the rhesus monkey to an RF exposure at a resonant frequency limits storage of heat in the body. However, substantial increases in colonic temperature were not prevented by such responses, even in a cool environment.

Men with regular physical training habits voluntarily increased their dietary fat intake from 43 to 54% of energy (E%) for four weeks. This was followed by a low‐fat (29 E%), high‐carbohydrate diet for another four weeks. During the high‐fat diet period, the muscle lipoprotein lipase activity (LPLA) increased from 59±8 to 106±12 mU/g (mean±SE) (P<0·05). After the high‐carbohydrate diet, LPLA was 57±16 mU/g, and unchanged relative to the pre‐trial value. The triglyceride content in m. vastus lateralis increased from 30±4 to 47±9 mmol/kg d.w. (P<0·05; mean±SE) following the high‐fat diet and to 41±8 following the high‐carbohydrate diet. Neither of the diets affected the serum triglyceride and insulin concentrations, nor glucose, glycerol, β‐hydroxybutyrate, citrate and lactate levels in the blood. Nor did they alter enzyme activities in muscle used as markers for the oxidative (citrate synthase, β‐hydroxy‐acyl CoA dehydrogenase) and glycolytic (glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase) capacity. It is concluded that one month's adaptation to a high‐fat diet results in increased muscle‐LPL activity indicating a higher capacity for uptake of fatty acids from circulating serum triglycerides into the muscle cell in association with a greater capacity for triglyceride storage in the muscle. Under these conditions serum triglycerides were not decreased despite the increased muscle LPLA, and serum insulin variations could not explain the change in muscle LPLA. The effects of prolonged diets on muscle metabolism in well‐trained men differ in several respects from those of short‐term dietary treatments. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

The half-life period of the adenylate energy charge ECA (52 h) is similar to the trehalose half-life period, and it is concluded that it is trehalose which is essential for long-term survival while glycogen is used in the very early stages of carbon starvation to produce energy for metabolism under these conditions.

We have therefore investigated the effect of the administration of these three hormones to the brain dead pig; their value has been assessed on both the freshly excised and stored donor heart. Brain death was induced by ligation of the two arteries to the upper part of the body which arise from the aortic arch. Storage of selected hearts was by continuous hypothermic perfusion for 20 to 24 hr. Hearts were biopsied for estimation of adenosine triphosphate, creatine phosphate, lactate, and glycogen, and were subsequently functionally tested. Six groups of pigs were studied. Hearts were tested from control pigs which had not undergone brain death (A1), from brain dead pigs which had received intravenous fluid and inotropic support for 4 hr (B1), and from brain dead pigs which had in addition received 2 hr of hormonal therapy (thyroxine 2 μg cortisol 100 mg, and insulin 5-10 IU hourly) (C1). A further 3 groups (A2-C2) underwent management identical to A1-C1, but in addition the hearts were stored for 24 hr. Brain death in pigs was followed by a consumption of myocardial energy stores, despite anaerobic glycolysis; this was associated with reduced myocardial function. The administration of hormones to the brain dead pig led to some replenishment of myocardial energy and glycogen reserves and reduction in lactate, with associated improvement in hemodynamic function. A period of hypothermic perfusion storage appeared to reverse the anaerobic metabolism occurring in the heart in the nonhormonally treated brain dead animal, though not in the hormonally treated animal, and led to replenishment of glycogen reserves in nontreated animals. The observation that both better function and an increase in myocardial energy stores occurred in hormonally treated, stored hearts, even though perfusate lactate dehydrogenase rose to significantly higher levels during hypothermic perfusion storage, and tissue lactate levels remained high, suggests that thyroxine promotes both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in brain dead animals. © 1987.",,"hydrocortisone; insulin; thyroxine; animal experiment; brain death; central nervous system; drug comparison; drug efficacy; heart; heart function; hypothermic perfusion; nonhuman; prevention; regional perfusion; swine; Animal; Brain Death; Heart; Heat; Human; In Vitro; Insulin; Perfusion; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Swine; Thyroxine; Tissue Donors; Tissue Preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023093824

Coronary vascular resistance in group 1 increased progressively, whereas that in group 2 tended to decrease during the early period of reperfusion. Total creatine kinase leakage during the initial 20 minutes of reperfusion was less in group 2 (0.87 +/- 0.13 IU/heart) than in group 1 (2.48 +/- 0.32 IU/heart, p less than 0.01). Hearts in group 2 showed a better recovery of energy charge (0.850 +/- 0.020) than did those in group 1 (0.787 +/- 0.013, p less than 0.05) at 5 minutes of reperfusion. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and total adenine nucleotide contents in group 2 exceeded those in group 1 (ATP, 18.0 +/- 1.8 and 13.4 +/- 0.8 mumol/gm dry weight; total adenine nucleotide, 22.7 +/- 1.5 and 17.8 +/- 1.0 mumol/gm dry weight, respectively, both p less than 0.05) at 20 minutes of reperfusion. Functional recovery at 60 minutes of reperfusion was better in group 2 than in group 1 (50.3 +/- 5.8% and 30.6 +/- 4.2%, respectively, p less than 0.01). These findings indicate that hypothermic reperfusion reduces the extent of myocardial damage and improves the oxygen supply and demand balance during the early period of reperfusion; hence there is a better recovery of heart function.",,"animal; article; cryoanesthesia; energy metabolism; heart; heart muscle; metabolism; organ preservation; perfusion; physiology; rat; rat strain; Animal; Energy Metabolism; Heart; Hypothermia, Induced; Myocardium; Organ Preservation; Perfusion; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023075117

Previous estimates 1-5 have shown that the oceanic heat transport is comparable to that of the atmosphere especially in the tropics and sub-tropics and that the ocean shows a similar seasonal transport carrying energy into the winter hemisphere. The annual mean meridional heat transport in individual oceans has also been estimated6-8. Heat storage can be computed from subsurface data to provide a picture of the annual cycle of the heat transport for each ocean separately. Lamb9,10presented such estimates for the Atlantic Ocean and found a southward heat transport in the November-December season with a northward heat transport in both hemispheres at other seasons. A similar method is used here to compute the seasonal variation of the heat transport north of 20°S for both the Pacific and the Indian oceans. The Pacific Ocean exhibits two regimes. North of 20° N transport is mostly northward with a maximum in September. Transport between 20°N and 20° S is evenly divided between northward (with a March maximum at 10° N) and southward (with an August maximum at 10°S). In the Indian Ocean, the transport is mostly southward except during January-February when a small northward transport appears north of 5°S. © 1987 Nature Publishing Group.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023066916

Major NASA programs are developing the technologies to meet the future power and energy needs for space. This paper discusses the relevant space power technologies, their status, and the thrusts of the NASA Space Power Technology Program. Significant progress has been achieved in static power systems technology. Photovoltaic cell technologies from silicon to III-V devices have made incredible advances. Concentrator arrays with low cost potential and ultralightweight arrays one-half the specific mass of the lightest flown to date will be presented. Major advances in the state of development of LEO-durable nickel-hydrogen batteries and in high capacity, long life bipolar nickel-hydrogen batteries enable an emerging range of missions. After a decade and a half of neglect, dynamic power systems are again receiving emphasis. The critical technical barriers to the use of solar dynamic systems in LEO will be discussed and progress in developing durable, efficient 25 kW free piston Stirling engines will be detailed. Corollary developments in advanced radiator technology will be outlined where progress in liquid drop and liquid belt radiators will be presented. The technology that links static and dynamic systems is the power management and distribution system. As power levels move to the multihundred kilowatt range, increases in voltage are mandatory. The view that the power systems must be treated as a user-friendly utility will be presented and supported by technical reference to a 20 kHz power distribution system. Additionally, the critical role played by the near-space environment and its interactions with power systems will be described and advances in materials technologies pertinent to space power system survivability will be described. © 1987.","Energy Storage; Environmental Interactions; Materials; Photovoltaics; Power Management and Distribution; Solar Dynamic Systems; SP-100; Space Power; Stirling Engines; Thermal Management","ENERGY MANAGEMENT; ENERGY STORAGE; PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS - Space Applications; PROPULSION - Space Applications; SOLAR ENERGY - Space Applications; SPACE POWER; STIRLING ENGINES; SPACECRAFT",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022956889

(1) understanding the electrochemistry of carbon and graphite surfaces; 2. (2) electrically controlled adsorption and separation processes; 3. (3) electrical energy storage and delivery. In the present communication the thermodynamics of the electrical double layer is briefly outlined. Specific attention is paid to the measurement of dimensional changes of the electrode which is proportional to the surface tension changes. Coupling this parameter with electrical measurements enables discrimination between the electrical double layer charge that resides at the interface and controls electroadsorption, and faradaic or electrochemical charge that crosses the interface and induces changes in the bulk. Unlike metallic interfaces which exhibit fast electrical double layer charging rates, there are slow sites on the surfaces of carbon with relaxation times in the range of few minutes. Since according to previous studies graphite electrodes acquire slow sites as well, at least part of these sites seems to originate at the graphitic side of the basal planes, and are not associated with chemical functional groups. © 1987.","carbon electrodes; electrical double layer; Electroadsorption; electrochemistry","ELECTRODES - Electrochemistry; CARBON ELECTRODES; ELECTRICAL DOUBLE LAYER; ELECTROADSORPTION; CARBON",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022953412

Both as-synthesized and solution-cast films can be readily doped to give electrical conductivities that are quite high: θ ∼ 30 - 100 S/cm. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of the neutral and doped forms have been obtained for solid films (as-synthesized and solution-cast) and for the polymers in solution. Excitation into the φ-φ* transition (peak at ≈ 2.8 eV), leads to photoluminescence (peak at 2.16 eV). The Stokes' shift is consistent with radiative decay from photogenerated neutral bipolarons (exciton-polarons). From electron spin resonance measurements and spectroscopic data on the doped polymer in solution, we have determined the nature of the charge storage configurations. The results indicate that the spinless bipolaron is the lowest energy charge storage configuration on single poly(3-hexylthienylene) macromolecules in solution.

The deposition sections in these facilities must provide large deposition areas, large storage of coating material and reasonable deposition rates. D.c. reactive sputtering using magnetron sources shows promise for meeting all three of these requirements for the deposition of both CuInSe2 and amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H). The question thus is whether films with properties suitable for fabricating high performance photovoltaic devices can be fabricated by reactive sputtering. This paper briefly reviews several of the atomic level processes that occur during sputter deposition and that influence film properties. Particular attention is given to target processes that lead to the formation of selenide surface layers during CuInSe2 reactive sputtering, and to substrate reactions which appear to control film properties in the CuInSe2 case and to a significant degree in the a-Si:H case. Experiments which are under way at the University of Illinois to investigate the critical issues in CuInSe2 and a-Si:H reactive sputtering are described.

Patterns of nectar foraging were distinctly different in the two geographical types. Among Africanized honeybees, lower proportions of the foraging force were engaged in foraging for nectar only, but a higher proportion foraged for both nectar and pollen. In addition, Africanized bees collected lower volumes per foraging trip than European honeybees, but returned to the colony with nectars having a higher sugar content. The two geographical types contributed similar amounts of joules (energy) per average forager and, therefore, made similar net contributions of carbohydrate energy to the colony. However, European colonies always had more stored honey than Africanized colonies.

Diurnal-average temperatures and heat fluxes are calculated as a function of pressure, latitude, and season. In addition to treating radiation and small-scale convection in a manner typical of conventional radiative-convective models, the dynamical heat fluxes due to large-scale baroclinic eddies are included and parametrized using a mixing length formulation (P.H. Stone, 1972; J. Atmos. Sci. 29, 405-418; A. P. Ingersoll and C. C. Porco, 1978, Icarus 35, 27-43). The atmosphere is assumed to be bounded below by an adiabatic, fluid interior with a single value of potential temperature at all latitudes. The internal heat flux is found to vary with latitude and season. The total internal power and the global enthalpy storage rate are seen to oscillate in phase with a period of 1 2 Uranian year. On an annual-average basis, equatorward heat transport can take place both in the atmosphere and convective interior. For a weak internal heat source, the meridional transport takes place predominantly in the atmosphere. If the internal heat source is larger, a greater share of the transport is taken up by the interior. For a value of the internal heat near the current upper limit for Uranus (∼27% of the adsorbed sunlight), about one-third of the equatorward heat transport at midlatitudes occurs in the interior. For a given internal heat source, placing the peak of the solar heating at high altitudes or depositing the solar energy into a narrow altitude range favors heat transport by the atmosphere over the interior. Deep penetration of sunlight favors transport by the interior. For the time corresponding to the Voyager 2 Uranus encounter, the effective temperature at the south (sunlit) pole is calculated to be ∼1.5°K higher than that at the equator. Horizontal contrasts of the mean 450- to 900 mbar temperature are found to be ≤1.5°K, in fair agreement with Voyager 2 IRIS results (R. Hanel et al., 1986, Science 233, 70-74), but the model fails to reproduce the local minimum in this temperature seen at -30°S. Nevertheless, it is concluded that meridional heat transport in the atmosphere is efficient in keeping seasonal horizontal temperature contrasts below those predicted by radiative-convective models (L. Wallace, 1983, Icarus 54, 110-132). © 1987.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0006841685

When small leaf discs of 1 cm diameter were heated at 40.5°C, both relative quantum yield for oxygen evolution (as estimated by the ratio of the amplitude of the oxygen evolution signal (Aox) to the amplitude of the photothermal signal (Apt)) and photochemical energy storage were reduced drastically within a few minutes in the heat sensitive genotypes. In contrast, in the genotypes processing heat tolerance characteristics, these photoacoustic parameters remained constant for at least 20 min. Photochemical energy storage appeared to be more resistant towards heat stress conditions than oxygen evolution, suggesting differential heat sensitivity of PS2 compared to PS1. Within the heat resistant species, we were able to further select for high temperature tolerance when the rate of decrease of Aox/Apt was measured in leaf discs incubated at a higher temperature (42°C). The results suggest that the photoacoutic technique could be used as a rapid and easy screening test for heat tolerance in crop plants. © 1987.","heat stress; photosynthesis; screening test",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004796264

The lower jaw rotates with respect to the neurocranium through an angle of 62° in less than 15 ms. The power requirements for jaw depression are calculated from a mathematical model and may reach a peak of ±4 watt in a 12‐cm‐long specimen. Data from the literature on mechanical output of fish muscle suggest that a muscular volume equal to 44% of the volume of the fish (= 45 cm3) should be required, if it is premised that movement and muscle shortening are directly coupled. Therefore, we assumed that storage and release of strain energy must be considered. The work demands for depression equal 0.014 J. The amount of energy storable in only three pairs of head ligaments can be estimated between 0.008 J and 0.05 J. The use of strain energy implies initial blocking and subsequent triggering of the movement. The position of the hyalomandibular connection, dorsal to the mandibular‐suspensorial articulation, appears to be of crucial importance in balancing the forces of sternohyoideus and the body muscles. Triggering at the onset of jaw depression occurs by the contraction of the levator operculi. The line of action of the hyalomandibular connection is lowered beneath the jaw suspension, which raises the equilibrium of forces. Elastic recoil can occur thereafter.

It is found that for Westerly granite, the energies to create splitting fractures and shear faults are about three orders of magnitude greater than the energy needed to drive the tensile microcracks, due to the large amount of subsidiary crack surface area created in forming the larger scale fractures.

This foraging model contains a foraging time, a digestive capacity, and a nutritional constraint which determine the optimal solution to a given human foraging goal: nutritional maximization, foraging time minimization, risk aversion, or food storage maximization. The model is compared with the most commonly used foraging models in anthropology and is shown to be more appropriate for hunter-gatherers. Using data on present day hunter-gatherers, the model's solution is shown to indicate quantitatively that these people tend to either maximize their energy or protein intake rather than minimize their time spent providing for their energy and protein needs. The model also predicts diet proportions, absolute food intake, time spent foraging, and sexual division of labor. A general version of the model is developed where the hunting and gathering cropping rates are made functions of environmental primary production. The solutions to this model agree with world patterns of hunter-gatherer diets, foraging time, and sexual division of labor. Modifications of the model to investigate risk-averse foraging and food storage are also presented, and the model is applied to determine when agriculture/pastoralism might be adopted and how hunter-gatherer body size might be selected. Although the model appears closely to predict observed hunter-gatherer foraging, the model's sensitivity and the quality of the data available make its uncritical acceptance unwarranted at this time. © 1987.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002177485

The simple design allows production either by farmers themselves, using cheap and locally available materials, or by small scale industries. Due to the low investment required, the solar dryer is predestined for application on small farms in developing countries. Depending on the crop to be dried and the size of the dryer 100-1000 kg of fresh material can be dried within 1-7 days to safe storage conditions. The solar dryer was successfully tested in Greece, Yugoslavia, Egypt, Ethiopia and Saudia Arabia drying grapes, dates, onions, peppers and several medicinal plants. Compared to traditional sun drying methods, the use of the solar dryer reduces drying time significantly and prevents mass losses. Furthermore, product quality can be improved essentially. During drying, the crop is protected completely from rain, dust, insects and animals. All these features contribute to the desired high product quality. The energy cost required for operating the fan features contribute to the the additional earnings from reduced mass losses and improved quality. On-farm tests also showed that the dryer can be easily operated by farmers.

Among these are the ways of energy storage in ball lightning, the mechanisms of thermal processes, the form and structure of ball lightning, and the electrical phenomena and luminous processes in ball lightning. The separate problems are investigated on the basis of model experiments. Numerical analysis of various aspects of the phenomenon allows us to construct a phenomenological model of ball lightning.

Thylakoids stored in a low-salt, 200 mM sucrose containing buffer were insensitive to pyridine (a localized proton gradient response), whereas storage in a 100 mM KC1 containing medium resulted in sensitivity of both phosphorylation parameters to pyridine, showing delocalized H+ gradient behavior. The KC1 effect seems to be mediated by divalent cations, particularly Ca2+, as indicated by the following: (A) 2 mM ethylene glycol bis(ß-aminoethyl ether)-N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a Ca2+ chelator added to the low-salt, sucrose-containing medium, was nearly as effective as 100 mM KC1 in causing the pyridine-induced effects on the phosphorylation parameters; (B) 1 mM CaCl2 or 30 mM MgCl2, added to the 100 mM KC1 containing medium, blocked the action of the 100 mM KCl medium, maintaining the thylakoids in a localized coupling response; (C) when 2 mM EGTA was also present with either the 30 mM MgCl2 or the 1 mM CaCl2 medium, it blocked the divalent cation tendency to promote the localized coupling response, resulting in a return to a delocalized coupling response; and (D) a membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator, added to the low-salt thylakoid storage medium, caused the normally localized behavior of those thylakoids to be switched to a delocalized coupling mode. The results suggest that Ca2+ ions associated with the lumenal side of thylakoid membranes or with the interior of the membrane in some way regulate a gating function that can switch proton diffusion pathways from localized to delocalized energy coupling gradients. © 1987, American Chemical Society.

Relevant perturbations, their time scales, and the various ensemble averages, are elucidated: the use of statistical concepts is shown to be essential to the calculation. Semiclassical techniques are used to derive, and extend to first order in g-2, the equilibrium degree of polarization (the Derbenev-Kondratenko formula). In so doing, some aspects of the polarization mechanism not previously recognized are uncovered.

There is evidence to suggest algal uptake of dissolved phospholipids. This polar hpid class may be used by autotrophs as a source of N and P when inorganic nutrient levels are depleted. The energy-rich storage component, triglyceride, became the major particulate lipid class from the time of the chlorophyll maximum onwards.

Xanthi) by withholding water from the soil. Photosynthesis was measured in leaves from those water‐stressed plants by the photoacoustic method. Slow drought induced marked changes in the photoacoustic signals, which were largely similar to those observed previously in leaves subjected to rapid desiccation in air (over 3–4 h), reflecting two simultaneous changes: 1) Modification of the heat and oxygen diffusion characteristics of the leaves due to changes in their anatomical structure [shown by the change in the slope of the plot of the oxygen (AOX) to photothermal signal (APT) ratio vs the square root of the modulation frequency]; 2) Inhibition of gross photosynthesis measured by the extrapolation of the AOX/APT ratio to zero frequency. However, in contrast to rapid water stress in detached leaves, where it was shown that mainly the oxidizing side of photosystem II (PS II) was damaged, we found a slower and more complex phenomenology having largely biphasic kinetics. During the first 6 days, there was a strong reduction in the photochemical energy storage, but the inhibition of oxygen evolution was relatively mild. The Emerson enhancement in state 1 dropped considerably, indicating lowering of the apparent absorption cross‐section of PS II. Fluorescence measurements suggest that PS II reaction center itseIf may be the primary site of the damage. PS I activity, judged by cytochrome f photooxidation, remained largely intact. The subsequent days were associated with a further spectacular decrease in the oxygen evolution quantum yield with both photosystems damaged. The photochemical energy storage continued to decrease further. The Emerson enhancement ratio of the remaining activities in both State 1 and 2 showed a marked increase, indicating the reestablishment of a strong imbalance in the distribution of excitation energy within the photochemical apparatus in favor of PS II. All the photoacoustic changes observed in response to drought were completely reversible within 2–3 days upon rewatering of the soil. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

Three mechanisms contribute to electron capture at these energies: radiative and nonradiative capture and the capture of the electron following electron-positron pair production. The radiative and nonradiative cross sections both fall off as -1 at high energies, (-1)Mc2 being the ion energy. The vacuum capture cross sections increase as the ln. Projectile 1s ionization cross sections also increase as ln at high energies if target screening is negligible. However, when the projectile atomic number is smaller than the target atomic number, the transverse interaction giving the ln term is screened and reduced. Therefore, the total 1s ionization cross sections are dominated by Coulomb ionization, and are nearly constant with increasing projectile energy. Tables of reduced capture and ionization cross sections are given, and are applied to calculating the charge states of ions in matter and the lifetime of ions in storage rings. © 1987 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000164992
