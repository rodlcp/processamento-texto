Then, under the same laser light irradiation in oxygen gas atmosphere, the PL intensity recovers. Through many successive experiments, it is found that the spectral change is nearly reversible. In spite of the changing atmosphere (for example, oxygen gas and air exposures), each PL state is stored for a long time at room temperature after the removal of the laser light under room light. This phenomenon is interpreted as results of photoinduced valence-number change of europium ions, the oxygen vacancy formation and some excitation energy transfer. Such a reversible phenomenon may well yield materials for erasable optical storage and oxygen sensor. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The storage period can vary from 6 months to several years, during which time the stockpiles are subject to atmospheric precipitation which causes rewetting and a subsequent reduction in calorific and monetary value. A study was undertaken to characterise the pore structure of stockpiles and identify relationships between structure and propensity to rewet. Recent research examining rewetting mechanisms in milled peat stockpiles has focused mainly on macroscale physical data. With respect to the importance of the structure of a porous medium for water movement and storage, a characterisation of the pore and particulate structure of milled peat in stockpile was conducted using micromorphological techniques. Samples with water contents up to 0.6 g g-1 were impregnated in the field. Thin sections produced in days as opposed to months (no period of chemical dehydration was required) were used to quantify macroporous structures using image analysis. Results illustrated that a significant hydraulic discontinuity existed between the surface and subsurface layers of stockpiles, a factor not identified by laboratory physical analysis. This endorsed the current hypothesis in that the milled peats of different genetic origin had different pore architectures which had a significant effect on the active rewetting mechanisms. The visualisation of water flow pathways using dye tracers suggested that in addition to the wetting front water movement, by-pass flow was an active rewetting mechanism. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Texas Southwestern Med. Ctr., Presbyterian Hospital, Dallas, TX, United States","BACKGROUND. Energy metabolism in muscles relies predominantly on the breakdown of glycogen early in exercise. In patients with McArdle's disease, blocked glycogenolysis in muscles results in low exercise tolerance and can lead to muscle injury, particularly in the first minutes of exercise. We hypothesized that ingesting sucrose before exercise would increase the availability of glucose and would therefore improve exercise tolerance in patients with McArdle's disease. METHODS. In a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 12 patients with McArdle's disease drank 660 ml of a beverage that had been sweetened with artificial sweeteners (placebo) or with 75 g of sucrose after an overnight fast. Thirty to 40 minutes later, the patients rode a stationary bicycle at a constant workload for 15 minutes while the heart rate, level of perceived exertion, and venous blood glucose levels were monitored. RESULTS. Supplemental sucrose increased the mean plasma glucose level by more than 36 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter) and resulted in a marked improvement in exercise tolerance in all patients. The mean (±SE) heart rate dropped by a maximum of 34±3 beats per minute (P<0.001), and the level of perceived exertion fell dramatically when the patients ingested glucose as compared with when they received the placebo. CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests that the ingestion of sucrose before exercise can markedly improve exercise tolerance in patients with McArdle's disease. The treatment takes effect during the time when muscle injury commonly develops in these patients. In addition to increasing the patients' exercise capacity and sense of well-being, the treatment may protect against exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis.",,"ammonia; fatty acid; glimepiride; glucose; insulin; lactic acid; placebo; pyruvic acid; sucrose; sweetening agent; adult; article; beverage; bicycle ergometer; bicycle ergometry; blood glucose monitoring; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; crossover procedure; diabetes mellitus; drug effect; exercise; exercise tolerance; female; glucose blood level; glycogen storage disease type 5; glycogenolysis; heart rate; human; human tissue; ingestion; male; muscle injury; priority journal; protection; randomized controlled trial; rhabdomyolysis; single blind procedure; treatment outcome; wellbeing; workload; Administration, Oral; Adult; Blood Glucose; Cross-Over Studies; Exercise Test; Exercise Tolerance; Female; Glycogen Storage Disease Type V; Heart Rate; Humans; Insulin; Male; Middle Aged; Single-Blind Method; Sucrose",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347517831

As a result, the crystalline structures on the particles' surface are being destroyed and amorphous areas are formed. After micronization of salbutamol sulfate to be used in dry powder inhalers, only small amounts of amorphous material are produced. Nevertheless, even these small amounts can have important effects on the physical stability of the powder. The amorphous state is thermodynamically unstable and tends to convert to the stable, crystalline state. The recrystallization process of disordered regions on the particles' surface leads to particle growth of milled particles. In this case, bridges of solid material are being formed between the individual particles, which leads to particle growth. This is an undesirable process, because particles for pulmonary administration are designed to range between 1 and 10 μm in diameter to exert respirative effect. In the present investigation, salbutamol sulfate is micronized by an air jet mill, and the generated products are exposed to different conditions. Thereafter, the best possible conditioning parameters and storage conditions for the micronized salbutamol sulfate are worked out and rated. The aim of this treatise is to demonstrate the importance of conditioning following micronization.","Dry and wet conditioning; Salbutamol sulfate; Storage","bronchodilating agent; salbutamol; salbutamol sulfate; article; crystallization; dry powder; humidity; particle size; pharmaceutical engineering; powder; thermodynamics; X ray powder diffraction; Albuterol; Bronchodilator Agents; Crystallization; Particle Size; Powders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345491943

It has a series of transport pathways which mediate the movements of the univalent cations Na and K, which are either identical or similar to systems in other human tissues, including the human kidney. The balance between the energy-consuming NaK pump and a 'passive leak' component maintains a net deficit of cations within the cell, which defends the cell volume against osmotic swelling. There exist a series of dominantly inherited human red cell conditions, gathered under the generic title 'hereditary stomatocytoses', in which the so-called 'passive leak' to Na and K is pathologically increased. In the more severe variants this compromises the integrity of the cell and the patients suffer haemolytic anaemia. Some less severe variants present with pseudohyperkalaemia caused by loss of K from red cells on storage of blood at room temperature. The most severe variants show a deficiency in a widely distributed 'raft' protein known as stomatin. The stomatin protein is homologous to the 'podocin' protein, the gene for which is mutated in a recessively inherited form of nephrotic syndrome.

Furthermore, multiple structures have been demonstrated to play important functional roles. Thus, a representation of the ensemble of probable structures is of interest. We present a statistical algorithm to sample rigorously and exactly from the Boltzmann ensemble of secondary structures. The forward step of the algorithm computes the equilibrium partition functions of RNA secondary structures with recent thermodynamic parameters. Using conditional probabilities computed with the partition functions in a recursive sampling process, the backward step of the algorithm quickly generates a statistically representative sample of structures. With cubic run time for the forward step, quadratic run time in the worst case for the sampling step, and quadratic storage, the algorithm is efficient for broad applicability. We demonstrate that, by classifying sampled structures, the algorithm enables a statistical delineation and representation of the Boltzmann ensemble. Applications of the algorithm show that alternative biological structures are revealed through sampling. Statistical sampling provides a means to estimate the probability of any structural motif, with or without constraints. For example, the algorithm enables probability profiling of single-stranded regions in RNA secondary structure. Probability profiling for specific loop types is also illustrated. By overlaying probability profiles, a mutual accessibility plot can be displayed for predicting RNA:RNA interactions. Boltzmann probability-weighted density of states and free energy distributions of sampled structures can be readily computed. We show that a sample of moderate size from the ensemble of an enormous number of possible structures is sufficient to guarantee statistical reproducibility in the estimates of typical sampling statistics. Our applications suggest that the sampling algorithm may be well suited to prediction of mRNA structure and target accessibility. The algorithm is applicable to the rational design of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), antisense oligonucleotides, and trans-cleaving ribozymes in gene knock-down studies.",,"antisense oligonucleotide; messenger RNA; ribozyme; RNA; small interfering RNA; transfer RNA; algorithm; article; computer program; controlled study; enzyme degradation; human; mathematical computing; molecular interaction; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; partition coefficient; prediction; priority journal; probability; protein motif; reproducibility; RNA structure; statistical analysis; thermodynamics; Algorithms; Base Sequence; Computational Biology; Drug Design; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Probability; RNA; RNA Stability; RNA, Protozoan; RNA, Spliced Leader; Statistical Distributions; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346888665

For the traceability of the source of contamination, information on the chemical binding conditions is very valuable. A near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) investigation is the natural development of total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) analysis of the wafer surfaces able to solve the problem of speciation. The plane grating monochromator beamline for undulator radiation of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt at the electron storage ring BESSY II, which provides photon energies between 30 eV and 1.9 keV for the specimen excitation, is an ideal excitation source for TXRF-NEXAFS experiments that require a high resolving power and a sufficient photon flux for trace analysis of low Z elements. The contaminants have been diluted and deposited as droplets on wafer pieces thoroughly cleaned after the cutting. The K edges of C, N, O have been examined. Some discrepancies have been found in the analysis of the same compounds in two different beamtimes; molecular orientation is pointed to as the cause for the difference in magnitude of the resonances.

The copolymers were prepared by emulsion polymerisation techniques, using potassium peroxodisulfate initiator at 80 ± 2°C, Films were prepared from the latex by casting and analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), For copolymer with 0.7 weight fraction of butyl acrylate the dynamic mechanical behaviour was identical to the synthetic rubber NBR (acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber), such that the storage modulus shows a rapid decay with increasing temperature. The damping characteristics, as indicated by the tan δ value, increased as the weight fraction of butyl acrylate in the copolymer increased. The dynamic mechanical data has been analysed with the WLF-Equation to study the time-temperature relationship. The dynamic mechanical properties and glass transition data point to the formation of a copolymer, whose properties vary with acrylonitrile content. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that weight loss occurring at a particular temperature decreases, along with the decomposition rate, with increase in acrylonitrile content. The activation energy (Ea) for the decomposition was calculated using the Coats &amp; Redfern equation. When temperatures for 10% copolymer decomposition are compared from TGA data, the acrylonitrile rich copolymer starts decomposing at a lower temperature, but the rate of decomposition is slower and yields higher char yields.","Butyl acrylate-acrylonitrile; Copolymerization; Dynamic mechanical properties; Thermal properties; WLF equation","Activation energy; Damping; Decomposition; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Emulsions; Glass transition; Latexes; Polymerization; Synthetic rubber; Thermal effects; Thermogravimetric analysis; Storage modulus; Copolymers; 1,3 butadiene; acrylic acid butyl ester; acrylonitrile; copolymer; latex; peroxydisulfate potassium; rubber; article; calculation; decomposition; differential scanning calorimetry; glass transition temperature; molecular dynamics; polymerization; temperature dependence; thermal analysis; thermodynamics; thermogravimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346492752

Our approach is based on the idea of using Si nanodots as discrete floating gates. To experimentally investigate such potential, we have fabricated MOS structures with Si nanocrystals. The dots have been deposited onto an ultra-thin tunnel oxide by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of SiH4, and then annealed at 1000 °C for 40 s, to crystallize all the dots. After deposition, the dots have been covered by a CVD SiO2 layer, thus resulting completely embedded into stoichiometric silicon oxide. The nanocrystal density and size have been studied by energy filtered TEM (EFTEM) analysis. An electrostatic force microscope has been used to locally inject and image charge. By applying a relatively large tip voltage and reducing the tip to sample separation down to the contact with the surface sample, a few dots have been charged, by appearing as protrusions on the surface. The charged dots have been monitored for up to 30 min, by showing no discharge effects either vertically, through the double barrier of oxide layers, or laterally, via cross talk effect between other close dots. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, electromagnetically induced transparency was used to reduce the group velocity of propagating light pulses and to reversibly map propagating light pulses into stationary spin excitations in atomic media. Here we describe and experimentally demonstrate a technique in which light propagating in a medium of Rb atoms is converted into an excitation with localized, stationary electromagnetic energy, which can be held and released after a controllable interval.

The main objective of this study is to determine the effect of the stacking sequences and the thickness of the layers on the interlaminar shear strength of E-glass/epoxy laminated composite tubular struts which will be used in superconducting magnetic energy storage.The experimental results showed that the first ply failures always happens at the middle section of the sample and the maximum interlaminar shear stress has its maximum along the neutral axis. The absence of plies perpendicular to the ±10° direction are favorable for a good stress distribution. On the other hand these plies are very important to prevent the brooming under compression loads. The results also showed that the stress distribution, due to less thick and more ±10° layers were better and gave a higher interlaminar shear strength. The interfaces between the 84° layer and ±10° layer are the most probable locations to start interlaminar shear failure, that is because of the large mismatch in engineering properties between these layers. The experimental results and the corresponding analytical calculations are in good agreement.","Composite materials; Compression; E-glass/epoxy; Failure mechanisms; Interlaminar shear stress; Laminates","Compaction; Energy storage; Failure analysis; Loads (forces); Magnetic storage; Shear strength; Shear stress; Stress concentration; Struts; Interlaminar shear failure; Stacking sequences; Laminated composites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345376829

The organic additives were very important in the milling processes to determine the characteristics of the resulting carbon nanocomposites. The mechanical milling with high energy resulted in the generation of large amounts of dangling carbon bonds in graphite with simultaneous decomposition of graphite structure. Such dangling bonds of carbon acted as sites to take up hydrogen. It has been proved by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and neutron diffraction measurements that the hydrogen taken up in the nanocomposites exists in at least two states; in the form of C-H bond formation in the graphite component and in the form of hydride in the magnesium component. The relative amounts of two types of hydrogen strongly depended upon differences in additives used (benzene, cyclohexene or cyclohexane). When C6D6 besides C 6H6 was used as additive, the hydrogen taken up was discussed from the standpoint of isotope effects. Upon addition of titanium tetraisopropoxide, the features of hydrogen uptake by the nanocomposites changed completely. © 2003 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In order for this to happen a protein must change chemical bond energy into physical displacement via some sort of a conformational change of the protein. The critical first step of this process must be the transient storage (self-trapping) of chemical energy into some metastable strained conformation of the protein.

In the simulation, carbon atoms on the tubular wall were structured according to the (m, m) armchair arrangement, and the site-to-site method was used to calculate the interaction between a methane molecule inside the tube and a carbon atom on the tubular wall. Excess volumetric and gravimetric endohedral adsorptions of methane in the (15, 15), (20, 20), (25, 25), and (30, 30) SWNT arrays were obtained. For every armchair SWNT array above, the van der Waals (VDW) gap has been varied from 0.335 to 1.0 nm to optimize methane storage in the interstices of SWNT arrays. The usable capacity ratio (UCR), which is defined as the mass of available fuel in an adsorbent-loaded vessel divided by the mass of available fuel in a vessel without adsorbent, was used as the criterion to judge the adsorption performance of SWNT arrays with different parameters. Results indicate that the (15, 15) SWNT arrays with a VDW gap of Δ = 0.8 nm is the optimal adsorbent among all of the cases studied for methane storage at room temperature. At p = 4.1 M Pa, the total volumetric and gravimetric capacities (including endohedral and exohedral adsorption) of methane on the SWNT arrays with the optimal parameters reach 216 V/V and 215 g CH4/kg C, respectively. It not only greatly exceeds the target (150 V/V) of the Department of Energy (U.S.A.) but also is slightly greater than the capacity (200 V/V) of compressed natural gas at 20 M Pa. The attainment of the exciting result attributes to the optimization of the VDW gap parameter of SWNT arrays, because the adsorption of methane in the interstices surpasses 60% of the total amount at the optimal condition, while its value is less than 15% of the total amount at a VDW gap of Δ = 0.335 and p = 4.1 M Pa.",,"Adsorbents; Adsorption; Computer simulation; Methane; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Van der Waals forces; Endohedral adsorption; Exohedral adsorption; Single walled carbon nanotube; Usable capacity ratio; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346317179

In this scheme, the secondary turn only has to be insulated from the high output voltage. Seven years ago at the High Current Electronics Institute (HCEI) a primary storage based on a linear transformer scheme and called the Linear Transformer Driver (LTD) stage was designed. In LTD stages, the primary turn, the storage capacitors with the switches, the core, and the outer conductor of the secondary turn are integrated into the stage cavity representing one separate building block of the primary storage. The body of the LTD cavity keeps ground potential during the shot allowing us to assemble them in series or in parallel depending on load requirements. Such flexibility of the storage structure and high output power of the LTD stages allows us to replace for some applications the traditional water line technology with LTD-based primary storages that are connected directly to the load (Direct Drive Scheme-DDS). In this article, we present the design of several LTD stages developed at HCEI and give examples of high-power energy storages produced by using the LTD technology.","High power energy storages; Linear transformer","Electric conductors; Electric potential; Electric transformer insulation; Electric transformers; High power energy storage; Linear transformer driver; Primary energy storages; Capacitor storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344897106

The analysis of the corrosion was carried out by x-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis, and ion chromatography analysis. Conservation materials, as well as storage and environmental conditions, were found to play a role in the development of these corrosion products. Most of the objects have been chemically cleaned to various degrees. The role of cleaning and stabilizing agents containing sodium in creating the corrosion is considered. The contributing roles of acetic acid emissions from wooden storage materials and relative humidity are examined.

The Fv/Fm ratio, which characterizes the maximum efficiency of energy storage in photosystem II (PS II), was demonstrated to decrease at MeHg concentrations higher than 1 μM. The degree of inhibition depended on the duration of the treatment and was always higher in the light (50 μE m-2 s-1) than in the dark. Similar relationships were found for ΔF/F′m, which characterizes the actual efficiency of energy storage at a given intensity of exciting light. After the cells were incubated in the presence of 5 μM HgCl2 for 5 h, the Fv/Fm and ΔF/F′m were almost equal to the control values. The decrease in Fm without any change in F0, as well as the changes in the kinetics of fast fluorescence induction, indicated that the segment of the donor side of PS II corresponding to electron transfer from QA to QB was disturbed in C. reinhardtii cells treated with MeHg. The decrease in photochemical fluorescence quenching (qP) also indicated an increase in the proportion of closed reaction centers (Q A-) of PS II in response to MeHg treatment; the increase in the steady-state P700 photooxidation was additional evidence for the disturbance of electron transfer between photosystems. It was demonstrated that MeHg damaged the photosynthetic electron transport chain (ETC) of the alga C. reinhardtii at several sites. The inhibitory effect of the MeHg+ ion was considerably stronger than that of Hg2+.

This has happened to some extent in some countries and for some consumer groups but not on the scale expected. Environmental concerns and supply security were not part of this argument. This artic le analyses the experience with liberalised energy markets in relation to environmental problems, resource exhaustion and supply security. The main environmental problem is global warming due to the increased emission of greenhouse gases. The solution includes a transition to distributed generation such as renewable energy sources combined with energy conservation and a number of new technologies like heat pumps, heat storage and fuel cells. In addition, new systems thinking is needed where dispersed cogeneration plants and wind farms are included as regulating power. It is concluded that the present deregulation poses severe problems for the transition to a sustainable energy development, and that insufficient analyses of these problems were made before the liberalisation was implemented. It appears that the liberalisation has primarily been introduced for ideological reasons. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","Liberalisation; Renewable energy; Resource exhaustion; Supply security","Deregulation; Energy conservation; Marketing; Sustainable development; Energy markets; Liberalisation; Resource exhaustion; Supply security; Sustainable energy development; Renewable energy resources; Deregulation; Energy conservation; Marketing; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; deregulation; energy market; European Union; global warming; greenhouse effect; liberalization; renewable resource; sustainable development; Eurasia; Europe; European Union",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746423077

As these composites are generally fabricated at moderate temperatures (100°C · 200°C) use of these materials at low temperatures induces severe thermal stresses, which are of great concern considering the stability of composite structures. For analysis of the thermal stresses, temperature distribution across these composite thick plates is to be obtained. A physical model is presented for this purpose. A two-dimensional finite element model with a quadrilateral element in ANSYS 5.4 is considered for this analysis. The results obtained are plotted in longitudinal and transverse directions for three different fibre materials with epoxy as matrix material. Finally, it is concluded that the temperature distribution is non-linear in transverse direction whereas uniform temperature field is obtained in the longitudinal direction for the given thermal loading in the physical model.","Cryogenic temperatures; Fibre-reinforced composites; Temperature distribution; Thermal stresses","Cryogenic temperatures; Fibre-reinforced composites; Thermal stresses; Fiber reinforced composites; Super-conducting energy storage magnets; Energy storage; Fiber reinforced materials; Finite element method; Thermal load; Thermal stress; Epoxy resins; Superconducting magnets; Temperature distribution; Composite materials; Fiber reinforced materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32944463016

Two case studies dealing with glass-water and air-metal combinations have been studied at various Reynolds numbers ranging from 10 to 10 000. The 2-equation model is based on thermal non-equilibrium between the fluid and the solid phases. It is solved over a semi-infinite region for the fluid and solid phase temperatures. The validity of thermal equilibrium between solid and fluid phases has been examined. The governing equations have been solved by the finite difference method. For the glass-water system, the thermal front in water as predicted by the 1-equation model moves faster when compared to the 2-equation model at low Reynolds numbers. The fractional heat flow rate to the solid phase has been found to be higher at low Reynolds numbers. With an increase in Reynolds number, the difference between the 1 and 2-equation models decreases. For the air-metal system, the difference between the 1 and 2-equation models is dominated by the thermal diffusivity of the metal. In this system, heat loss to the ambient at the transverse boundaries affects the temperature profiles in such a way that the temperature front becomes immobile. In a glass-water system, this effect is negligible. Since, the temperature difference between the fluid and the solid is high at high Reynolds numbers, indicating that the thermal non-equilibrium is important and should be included in modelling, particularly at short times.","1-Equation model; 2-Equation model; Air-metal system; Glass-water system; Porous medium; Thermal non-equilibrium","1-equation model; Glass-water system; Thermal non-equilibrium; Diffusion; Heat convection; Mathematical models; Porous materials; Reynolds number; Heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32544450482

The deduced amino acid sequences showed 76 and 80% similarity with the corresponding α and β subunits of C. paradisi. A high degree of similarity was also observed among the PFK β subunits when the alignment of the sugar cane sequences was compared to those of Ricinus communis and Solanum tuberosum, it appears that α and β are two distinct subunits; they were found at different concentrations in several sugar cane tissues. It remains to be determined if the different gene expression levels have some physiological importance and how they affect sucrose synthesis, export, and storage in vacuoles. A comparison between the amino acid sequences of β PFKs from a variety of organisms allowed us to identify the two critical Asp residues typical of this enzyme's activity site and the other binding sites; these residues are tightly conserved in all members of this protein family.

Ecopetrol SA invested about $20,000 in the application of ICP-developed procedures to guarantee that the gasoline and LPG transported in the polyduct would retain their properties and quality levels. This effort has resulted in earnings of $160,000/yr. The approach was to reduce the volumes of hydrocarbons flared or released into the atmosphere, increase deliveries of products within specifications, improve warehouse safety, and decrease energy consumption due to shorter processing times. The separation is made once the mix of LPG and gasoline is stored in a tank. Using thermal processes, the products are then separated. Here a heat exchange system was installed and storage tanks were internally refurbished to provide higher efficiencies to available energy and infrastructure resources, and at low cost. The more efficient separation resulted in gain in product quality and thus decrease in customer complaints. The time reductions and better efficiencies supported the constant delivery of LPG with no accumulations at the station, making the process more stable and continuous. This resulted in a threefold improvement of the efficiency of the separation system at the Chimitá station and was the basis for a similar study at the Yumbo station. The achievements include 90% recovery of the hydrocarbons that were lost before. These losses were from flaring or release into the atmosphere from the storage vessels. There also is a 75% reduction in use of energy because of the shorter compressor and fan operation times during the product's cooling process. The LPG and gasoline after separation from each other are of higher quality. There is a 75% decrease in process time, allowing for an increase in system capacity and higher flexibility and reliability in operation.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442588686

This has led to an increasing demand for new and compatible energy storage technologies. Furthermore, a growing awareness of pollution issues has provided a strong impetus for the science and technology community to develop alternatives with ever-higher energy densities, with the ultimate goal of being able to propel electric vehicles. Magnesium's thermodynamic properties make this metal a natural candidate for utilization as an anode in high-energy-density, rechargeable battery systems. We report herein on the results of extensive studies on magnesium anodes and magnesium insertion electrodes in nonaqueous electrolyte solutions. Novel, rechargeable nonaqueous magnesium battery systems were developed based on the research. This work had two major challenges: one was to develop electrolyte solutions with especially high anodic stability in which magnesium anodes can function at a high level of cycling efficiency; the other was to develop a cathode that can reversibly intercalate Mg ions in these electrolyte systems. The new magnesium batteries consist of Mg metal anodes, an electrolyte with a general structure of Mg(AlX3-nRnR′)2 (R′,R = alkyl groups, X = halide) in ethereal solutions (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, polyethers of the ""glyme"" family), and Chevrel phases of MgMo3S 4 stoichiometry as highly reversible cathodes. With their practical energy density expected to be &gt;60 Wh/Kg, the battery systems can be cycled thousands of times with almost no capacity fading. The batteries are an environmentally friendly alternative to lead-acid and nickel-cadmium batteries and are composed of abundant, inexpensive, and nonpoisonous materials. The batteries are expected to provide superior results in large devices that require high-energy density, high cycle life, a high degree of safety, and low-cost components.

However, the final thermal energy production efficiency of the CHP for drying was found to be low. In this paper we present experimental results to demonstrate the potential for improved heat-recovery/storage and the heat-release/production of hot dry air for batch drying applications using the heat enhancement mode of the CHP. A new laboratory scale experimental CHP dryer system was built utilizing the calcium oxide/calcium hydroxide hydration/dehydration reversible reaction. The aim of this study is to improve the efficiencies of the heat recovery from heat source in the heat-storage step and the hot dry air production in the heat-release step of the CHP for heating up the air to around 100°C. The results of this experimental study utilizing a new reactor design showed that the shallow reactor/heat exchanger could accomplish 94% chemical heat storage and produce 100°C air at better than 75% efficiency for the reaction heat by controlling the preheating condition. The reaction conversion reached 90% in these experiments.

Belvoir, VA 22060-5817, United States","Mathematical algorithms have been developed as the foundation of an environmental assessment model for mobile shelters. The assessment model can be used for sizing the heating and cooling equipment and for evaluating the transient thermal responses of shelters under specified initial heat-up and cool-down conditions. This model differs from standard HVAC load models in the form of the transient responses that can be predicted for the shelter. Currently available commercial and public-domain HVAC models predict transient-load variations and energy usage based upon a fixed inside design temperature. Computer codes such as TRNSYS can predict transient indoor conditions, but require detailed input, which is usually not available for the typical shelter. The new, shelter environmental assessment model has the ability to predict inside temperature as a function of variations in environment condition, HVAC equipment performance, and inside load conditions. The algorithms use a multi-node lumped-capacity model for the shelter walls, the equipment and the air inside the shelter, since each of these elements has an energy-storage capacity. The model includes provisions for modeling camouflage netting as a thermal radiation shield having a negligible energy-storage capacity. Therefore, radiation-shield temperatures are computed from iterative, steady-state energy balances for each time step. The unknown temperatures for the elements with heat capacity are calculated at each point in time using a ""marching"" solution combined with the radiation-shield temperatures. The model is designed to accommodate the energy gains from equipment and personnel, and HVAC equipment operational features, with weather data for a specific location or from standard outdoor environmental conditions. © 2003 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

We used transmission electron microscopy to demonstrate this entity in different leukemia cells of human origin (patient's blood) and in mouse leukemia cell line. At high resolution, not only close proximity but even fusion of mitochondrial and nuclear membranes can be seen. Based on available data about mRNA transport through the nuclear pore complex and observed contacts of mitochondria with nuclei, we hypothesize that such contacts can provide a gateway for energy delivery to power mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

In this article, we examine the ratings of perceptions of several environmental problems for their utility as indicators of environmental quality, and examine perceptions of future land use by people interviewed in Santa Fe, New Mexico, near the Department of Energy's (DOE) Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Overall, people with lower incomes rated environmental problems as more severe than others, were more willing to spend federal funds to solve them, and were consistent in their ratings of severity of environmental problems and their willingness to spend federal funds. Cleaning up LANL and other Department of Energy sites, received the highest rating for expenditure of federal funds. The highest rated future uses for DOE sites were for recreation and for National Environmental Research Parks. People with less education generally gave higher ratings to most future land uses for DOE than did those with more education. However, those with higher education gave higher ratings to nuclear reprocessing, and nuclear material storage. Where there were differences, the people interviewed at Santa Fe rated all environmental problems (except pesticides) as more severe than did those previously interviewed in Albuquerque (located farther from the LANL site), and they were more willing to spend federal funds on these problems. Ratings for all future land uses did not differ between the Santa Fe and Albuquerque respondents. These perception-based indicators show general agreement among people living close and farther away from LANL with respect to cleaning up LANL and the future land uses for the site. These indicators should be considered by regulators, site personnel, and policy makers in future management and land use decisions.","Department of energy; Environmental health; Future land use; Los Alamos; Perceptual indicators; Stewardship","Ecosystems; Education; Health care; Land use; Pesticides; Public policy; Recreation centers; Nuclear material storage; Environmental testing; environmental management; land use; perception; public health; academic achievement; adult; article; controlled study; demography; ecosystem; environmental health; environmental parameters; environmental sustainability; geographic distribution; health survey; human; interview; land use; national park; pollution; population research; statistical analysis; United States; Adult; Conservation of Natural Resources; Data Collection; Environment; Environmental Health; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Mexico; Perception; Public Opinion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10744220242

This paper studies compliant bistable mechanisms which may be modeled as four-link mechanisms with a torsional spring at one joint. Theory is developed to predict compliant and rigid-body mechanism configurations which guarantee bistable behavior. With this knowledge, designers can largely uncouple the motion and energy storage requirements of a bistable mechanism design problem.

The world's petroleum production is about to pass its peak, so a worldwide development effort is being directed into adapting these high-efficiency fuel cells into powering automobiles, buses, and trucks. A fuel cell can, theoretically, deliver 500 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per kilogram of hydrogen plus oxygen. Today's best lithium batteries can deliver around 120 kWh per kilogram. Fuel cells can convert fuel to electric power with an efficiency of over 80%. Even a diesel engine cannot do better than 40% at its optimum speed and load.In the past, fuel cells contained a platinum catalyst that costs $700 a troy ounce. This year, researchers at the University of Wisconsin announced the discovery of a nickel-tin catalyst that works! As a result, fuel cells can be a possible substitute for batteries in spacecraft. Fuel cell progress was the topic of three technical sessions at the 2003 International Energy Conversion Engineering Conference (IECEC). In plenary sessions, leaders in US industries and pertinent government laboratories discussed new applications for power-generating fuel cells. This conference, sponsored by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, dealt with energy conversion for generating electric power in Earth-orbit satellites, space stations, Mars-surface exploration, propulsion of deep-space probes, as well as for earth-surface vehicles, and other applications. The latest developments in the energy and power fields were described in the 206 technical papers presented. Three very thorough presentations at this IECEC provided instructions and quantitative data that can be useful to an aerospace engineer who needs to evaluate fuel cells for his power-generating application. These papers, summarized in the sections that follow, cover: 1) the present and future performance of fuel cells; 2) the options in design configurations of an aerospace power source; and 3) how to develop performance, weight, and cost data for comparing fuel cells to alternatives for meeting the requirements of a given aerospace application.",,"Automobiles; Catalysts; Costs; Cryogenic liquids; Diesel engines; Electric power generation; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Lithium batteries; Martian surface analysis; Platinum; Product design; Spacecraft; Fuel conversion; Fule-cell power; Aerospace engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0942299124

These engines and turbines run at high heat-input temperatures because their efficiency is limited by the Carnot cycle. Muscles used for propulsion by animals are not limited in efficiency by the Carnot cycle, so we see dolphins getting 3,000 miles of travel from a food quantity that contains the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline. Leaves on plants capture the energy in sunlight to extract carbon from carbon dioxide in the air, and hydrogen from water, to manufacture carbohydrates. Scientists and engineers studying these processes are amazed by the computing power and data storage required to make these processes work. For example, a tiny grape seed contains the data and structural technology required for quickly constructing the plant's fuel-producing leaves and the structures that support them. Even the stiff thorn that discourages intruders from entering the grape bush has an effective design. The data stored in the seed specifies the color of the grape plant's blossoms, commands the production of the sugar-containing fluid that goes into the grapes, and even the data content of the next-generation seeds in the globules of each grape berry.

Sci., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States","Dynamic random access memorys (DRAMs) are widely used in portable applications due to their high storage density. In standby mode, the main source of DRAM power dissipation is the refresh operation that periodically restores leaking charge in each memory cell to its correct level. Conventional DRAMs use a single refresh period determined by the cell with the largest leakage. This approach is simple but dissipative, because it forces unnecessary refreshes for the majority of the cells with small leakage. In this paper, we investigate a novel scheme that relies on small refresh blocks and multiple refresh periods to reduce DRAM dissipation by decreasing the number of cells refreshed too often. In contrast to conventional row-based refresh, small refresh blocks are used to increase worst case data retention times. Long periods are used to accommodate cells with small leakage. Retention times are further extended by adding a swap cell to each refresh block.We give a novel polynomial-time algorithm for computing an optimal set of refresh periods for block-based multiperiod refresh. Specifically, given an integer K and a distribution of data-retention times, in O(K N2) steps our algorithm computes K refresh periods that minimize DRAM dissipation, where N is the number of refresh blocks in the memory. We describe and evaluate a scalable implementation of our refresh scheme whose overhead is asymptotically linear with memory size. In simulations with a 16-Mb DRAM, block-based multiperiod refresh reduces DRAM standby dissipation by a multiplicative factor of 4 with area overhead below 6%. Moreover, our proposed scheme is robust to semiconductor process variations, with power savings degrading no more than 7% over a 20-fold increase of leaky cells.","Algorithm design; Block-based multiperiod refresh; Dynamic memory; Low-energy design; Low-power design; Process variations tolerance","Algorithms; Block codes; Data storage equipment; Design for testability; Dynamic random access storage; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Low data retention power; Low energy design; Low power design; Multiperiod dynamic memory; VLSI circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0742303964

Sanchez Pizjuan 4, Seville 41009, Spain","Leptin, the ob gene product, is an adipocyte-secreted hormone that centrally regulates weight by decreasing caloric intake and increasing energy expenditure. Expression of leptin is regulated by dietary status, insulin, glucocorticoids and catecholamines. Pancreastatin (PST), a chromogranin A-derived peptide, correlates with catecholamine levels, and may play a role in the physiology of stress, modulating endocrine secretion and metabolism. Thus, PST has been found to exert a lipolytic and anti-insulin effect in white adipocytes. The aim of the present work was to investigate a possible role of PST modulating the expression of key genes involved in lipid storage and metabolism: leptin, PPAR-γ2, UCP-1 and UCP-2. We incubated isolated rat epididymal adipocytes with 100 nM PST for 16 and 24 h. Leptin, UCP-2 and UCP-1 mRNA levels were assessed by RT-PCR, followed by Southern blot. Leptin secretion was also measured by ELISA. PST inhibited leptin expression and secretion at 16-h incubation, but this effect was no longer observed after 24 h. On the other hand, PST stimulated the expression of UCP-2 after 16 h. However, the effect was still significant after 24 h. The inhibitory effect of PST on leptin expression and secretion and the stimulation of UCP-2 expression were prevented by blocking PKC. UCP-1 and PPR-γ2 expression did not change after PST stimulation. Leptin differentially regulates the expression of key genes in the rat adipocyte, upregulating the expression of UCP-2 and inhibiting the expression and secretion of leptin by a mechanism that involves PKC activity. These effects may contribute to the metabolic action of catecholamines in physiological and pathophysiological conditions with increased sympathetic activity.","Adipocyte; Adrenergic; Chromogranin A; Leptin; Pancreastatin; PPAR-γ; UCP","chromogranin A; leptin; pancreastatin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; protein kinase C; uncoupling protein 1; uncoupling protein 2; adipocyte; animal cell; article; gene expression regulation; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; protein expression; protein induction; protein synthesis inhibition; rat; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; Adipocytes; Animals; Carrier Proteins; Ion Channels; Leptin; Membrane Proteins; Membrane Transport Proteins; Mitochondrial Proteins; Pancreatic Hormones; Protein Kinase C; Rats; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Transcription Factors; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347361462

Ions injected from a plasma source or a sputter source are hot, and at short times the yield of neutrals is usually dominated by decay of metastable ions. We have demonstrated that the decay function is close to a 1/t dependence when the internal energy of the ions is conserved, i.e., when photon emission can be ignored. Deviations from a 1/t distribution therefore gives information about the radiative lifetime or, for larger systems, about the intensity of the emitted radiation. Systematic measurements have been carried out for fullerene anions CN -, for even values of N from 36 to 96, to test a classical dielectric model. Recently we have installed an electrospray ion source with a Paul trap for bunching, which can be used to inject biomolecular ions from solution, and the first experiments on laser spectroscopy of biomolecules have been carried out. Also lifetimes of excited states have been measured for stored biomolecular ions excited by a laser pulse.","Biomolecule; Cluster; Dissociation; Green fluorescent protein; Lifetime; Nucleotide; Spectroscopy; Storage ring","anion; fullerene; conference paper; dielectric constant; electricity; energy; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; ion transport; mathematical model; radiation; spectroscopy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346993766

Such gradients are created by specific membrane-bound ion pumps [adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases)]. According to physicochemical rules passive forces equilibrate (dissipate) ion gradients. The cholesterol/phospholipid ratio of the membrane and the degree of saturation of phospholipid fatty acids are important factors for membrane molecular order and herewith a determinant of the degree of non-specific membrane leakiness. Other operative principles, i.e. specific ion channels can be opened and closed according to mechanisms that are specific to the cell. Certain compounds called ionophores can be integrated in the plasma membrane and permit specific inorganic ions to pass. Irrespective of which mechanism ions leak across the plasma membrane the homeostasis may be kept by increasing ion pumping (ATPase activity) in an attempt to restore the physiological ion gradient. The energy source for this work seems to be glycolytically derived ATP formation. Thus an increase in ion pumping is reflected by increased ATP hydrolysis and rate of glycolysis. This can be measured as an accumulation of breakdown products of ATP and end-products of anaerobic glycolysis (lactate). In certain disease entities, the balance between ATP formation and ion pumping may be disordered resulting in a decrease in inter alia (i.a.) cellular energy charge, and an increase in lactate formation and catabolites of adenylates. Cardiac syndrome X is proposed to be due to an excessive leakage of potassium ions, leading to electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, abnormal Tl-scintigraphy of the heart and anginal pain (induced by adenosine). Cocksackie B3 infections, a common agent in myocarditis might also induce an ionophore-like effect. Moreover, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the formation of extracellular amyloid deposits in the brain of patients. Perturbation of cellular membranes by the amyloid peptide during the development of Alzheimer's disease is one of several mechanisms proposed to account for the toxicity of this peptide on neuronal membranes. We have studied the effects of the peptide and fragments thereof on 45Ca2+-uptake in human erythrocytes and the energetic consequences. Treatment of erythrocytes with the β1-40 peptide, results in qualitatively similar nucleotide pattern and decrease of energy charge as the treatment with Ca2+-ionophore A23187. Finally, in recent studies we have revealed and published in this journal that a rare condition, Tarui's disease or glycogenosis type VII, primarily associated with a defect M-subunit of phosphofructokinase, demonstrates as a cophenomenon an increased leak of Ca2+ into erythrocytes.","Alzheimer's disease; ATPase; Ion leak; Ion pumping; Ionophore; Plasma membrane; Prions; Syndrome X; Tarui's disease","6 phosphofructokinase; adenosine; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); adenosine triphosphate; amino acid; amyloid; calcimycin; calcium; calcium 45; cholesterol; fatty acid; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; hydrogen potassium adenosine triphosphatase; hypoxanthine; inosine; ion; ion channel; lactic acid; lipid; magnesium; phosphate; phosphoglycerate kinase; phospholipid; proton transporting adenosine triphosphatase; sodium; thallium; unindexed drug; xanthine; Alzheimer disease; cell membrane; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; erythrocyte; gene mutation; glycogen storage disease type 7; human; infection; ion transport; microcalorimetry; nonhuman; pathophysiology; prion disease; priority journal; review; syndrome X; Alzheimer Disease; Cell Membrane; Energy Metabolism; Glycogen Storage Disease Type VII; Humans; Ion Channel Gating; Ion Channels; Ion Pumps; Microvascular Angina",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346874457

In vitro and in vivo genetic and pharmacological studies have demonstrated PPARα regulates lipid catabolism. In contrast, PPARγ regulates the conflicting process of lipid storage. However, relatively little is known about PPARβ/δ in the context of target tissues, target genes, lipid homeostasis, and functional overlap with PPARα and -γ. PPARβ/δ, a very low-density lipoprotein sensor, is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, a major mass peripheral tissue that accounts for approximately 40% of total body weight. Skeletal muscle is a metabolically active tissue, and a primary site of glucose metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and cholesterol efflux. Consequently, it has a significant role in insulin sensitivity, the blood-lipid profile, and lipid homeostasis. Surprisingly, the role of PPARβ/α in skeletal muscle has not been investigated. We utilize selective PPARα, -β/δ, -γ, and liver X receptor agonists in skeletal muscle cells to understand the functional role of PPARβ/β, and the complementary and/or contrasting roles of PPARs in this major mass peripheral tissue. Activation of PPARβ/α by GW501516 in skeletal muscle cells induces the expression of genes involved in preferential llpid utilization, β-oxidation, cholesterol efflux, and energy uncoupling. Furthermore, we show that treatment of muscle cells with GW501516 increases apolipoprotein-A1 specific efflux of intracellular cholesterol, thus identifying this tissue as an important target of PPARβ/δ agonists. Interestingly, fenofibrate induces genes Involved in fructose uptake, and glycogen formation. In contrast, rosiglitazone-mediated activation of PPARγ induces gene expression associated with glucose uptake, fatty acid synthesis, and lipid storage. Furthermore, we show that the PPAR-dependent reporter in the muscle carnitine palmitoyl-transferase-1 promoter is directly regulated by PPARβ/δ, and not PPARα in skeletal muscle cells in a PPARγ coactivator-1-dependent manner. This study demonstrates that PPARs have distinct roles in skeletal muscle cells with respect to the regulation of lipid, carbohydrate, and energy homeostasis. Moreover, we surmise that PPARβ/δ agonists would increase fatty acid catabolism, cholesterol efflux, and energy expenditure in muscle, and speculate selective activators of PPARβ/δ may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and obesity.",,"[2 methyl 4 [4 methyl 2 (4 trifluoromethylphenyl) 5 thiazolylmethylthio]phenoxy]acetic acid; apolipoprotein A1; carnitine palmitoyltransferase; fenofibrate; fructose; glycogen; lg 101305; liver X receptor; liver x receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta agonist; phenoxyacetic acid derivative; pirinixic acid; rosiglitazone; unclassified drug; very low density lipoprotein; animal cell; article; atherosclerosis; cholesterol transport; controlled study; drug receptor binding; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid synthesis; gene expression regulation; glycogen synthesis; hexose transport; hyperlipidemia; lipid storage; lipolysis; mouse; muscle cell; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; promoter region; protein function; skeletal muscle; Animals; Base Sequence; Cell Line; Cholesterol; DNA Primers; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Muscle, Skeletal; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Recombinant Proteins; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Thiazoles; Transcription Factors; Transfection; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346849699

The experimental observation of the dynamic torque-displacement relationship for a harmonic drive shows a hysteresis characteristic indicating the simultaneous presence of energy storage and energy dissipation mechanisms. To completely characterize these mechanisms and yet have a simple representation for control, we develop a new hysteresis model using the heredity concept of dynamic systems. This model represents the hysteresis phenomenon by a combination of a nonlinear stiffness component and a nonlinear damping component leading to a mathematically well-posed nonlinear differential equation. The parameters of the model are identified using optimization techniques. We present some important mathematical properties of the model that give insight into model behavior and thus establish a mathematical basis for control. Numerical simulations in comparison with experimental data using our Harmonic Drive Test Apparatus verify the accuracy of the proposed model to represent the complex hysteresis dynamics of harmonic drives.","Harmonic drive gear; Hysteresis; Nonlinear ordinary differential equation; Nonlinear stiffness","Damping; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Harmonic analysis; Hysteresis; Linear equations; Mathematical models; Optimization; Ordinary differential equations; Stiffness; Torque; Harmonic drive gears; Hysteresis dynamics; Electric drives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346686161

The rate and duration of maternal provisioning, postweaning food availability and climatic conditions are all factors likely to influence the growth strategies of infants. While numerous studies have documented differences in growth strategies at high taxonomic levels, few have investigated those of closely related species inhabiting similar environments. The present study examined the body composition, metabolism and indices of physiological development in pups of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) and subantarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus tropicalis), congeneric species with different weaning ages (4 months and 10 months, respectively), during their overlap in lactation at a sympatric breeding site in the Iles Crozet. Body lipid reserves in pre-moult pups were significantly greater (t28=2.73, P&lt;0.01) in subantarctic (26%) than Antarctic fur seals (22%). Antarctic fur seal pups, however, had significantly higher (t26=3.82, P&lt;0.001) in-air resting metabolic rates (RMR; 17.1±0.6 ml O2 kg-1 min-1) than subantarctic fur seal pups (14.1±0.5 ml O 2 kg-1 min-1). While in-water standard metabolic rate (SMR; 22.9±2.5 ml O2 kg-1 min -1) was greater than in-air RMR for Antarctic fur seal pups (t 9=2.59, P&lt;0.03), there were no significant differences between in-air RMR and in-water SMR for subantarctic fur seal pups (t12=0.82, P&gt;0.4), although this is unlikely to reflect a greater ability for pre-moult pups of the latter species to thermoregulate in water. Pup daily energy expenditure was also significantly greater (t27=2.36, P&lt;0.03) in Antarctic fur seals (638±33 kJ kg-1 day -1) than in subantarctic fur seals (533±33 kJ kg-1 day-1), which corroborates observations that pups of the former species spend considerably more time actively learning to swim and dive. Consistent with this observation is the finding that blood oxygen storage capacity was significantly greater (t9=2.81, P&lt;0.03) in Antarctic (11.5%) than subantarctic fur seal (8.9%) pups. These results suggest that, compared with subantarctic fur seals, Antarctic fur seal pups adopt a strategy of faster lean growth and physiological development, coupled with greater amounts of metabolically expensive behavioural activity, in order to acquire the necessary foraging skills in time for their younger weaning age.","Arctocephalus gazella; Arctocephalus tropicalis; Energetics; Fur seal; Growth strategy; Maternal provisioning; Metabolic rate; Resource partitioning; Weaning","oxygen; animal; Antarctica; article; basal metabolic rate; blood; body composition; comparative study; energy metabolism; geography; growth, development and aging; milk; motor activity; physiology; seal; species difference; suckling; Animals; Animals, Suckling; Antarctic Regions; Basal Metabolism; Body Composition; Energy Metabolism; Fur Seals; Geography; Milk; Motor Activity; Oxygen; Species Specificity; Animalia; Arctocephalus gazella; Arctocephalus tropicalis; Gazella; Mammalia; Phocidae; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346399702

The objective of this research was to examine the relationship between body composition and thermogenic responsiveness to MCT treatment. DESIGN: Randomized/ crossover controlled feeding trial, with diets rich in either MCT or long-chain triglyceride (LCT) (as olive oil) for periods of 4 weeks each. SUBJECTS: A total of 19 healthy overweight men aged (x ± s.e.m.) 44.5 ± 2.5 y with a body mass index of 27.8 ± 0.5kg/m2. MEASUREMENTS: EE and body composition were measured using indirect calorimetry and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively, at the baseline and end point of each feeding period. EE was measured for 30 min before consumption of a standard meal and for 5.5 h following the meal. RESULTS: Body weight (BW) decreased (P &lt; 0.05) by 1.03 ± 0.25 kg with MCT consumption compared to 0.62 ± 0.29 kg with LCT consumption. The difference in average EE between MCT and LCT consumptions was related to initial BW, such that men with lower initial BW had a greater rise in EE with MCT consumption relative to LCT on day 28 (r = -0.472, P = 0.04) but not day 2 (r = -0.368, P = 0.12). Similar results were obtained with fat oxidation on day 28 (r = -0.553, P = 0.01). The greater rise in fat oxidation with MCT compared to LCT consumption on day 2 tended to be related to greater loss of BW after MCT vs LCT consumption (r = -0.4075, P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that shunting of dietary fat towards oxidation results in diminished fat storage, as reflected by the loss of BW and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Furthermore, MCT consumption may stimulate EE and fat oxidation to a lower extent in men of greater BW compared to men of lower BW, indicative of the lower responsiveness to a rapidly oxidized fat by overweight men.","Adipose tissue; Body weight; Energy expenditure; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medium-chain triglycerides","long chain triacylglycerol; medium chain triacylglycerol; adult; article; body composition; body weight; calorimetry; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; crossover procedure; energy expenditure; fat intake; human; indirect calorimetry; lipid composition; lipid diet; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; subcutaneous fat; weight reduction; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Cross-Over Studies; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Plant Oils; Thermogenesis; Triglycerides; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346250167

It has been found that the most suitable protection scheme, in order to prevent the superconducting coils from getting overheated, is subdivision with a shunt path containing silicon diodes operating at liquid helium temperatures.

Although its stability analysis must be studied depending on a nonlinear model, most prior research attempted to make some assumptions to force this nonlinear system to be linear. As a result, the practical dynamics and the nonlinear phenomena were disregarded. In this paper, two kinds of nonlinear phenomena are detected under the conditions that are considered to be stable by the prior criteria: one is period-doubling bifurcation and the other is chaos. Stability maps and phase-plane trajectories are introduced at different loads to clarify the power factor and also the instability regions. It is clear that the output storage capacitor is a main contributing parameter on the system stability, therefore, bifurcation maps are developed to determine the accurate minimum output capacitance value that assures the system stability under all operating conditions. Also, PFC converter stability is explained and judged by comparing the consequence of charging and discharging energy in the output capacitor.","Bifurcation; Boost converter; Chaos; Instability phenomena; Nonlinear analysis; Power-factor correction (PFC); Stability","Bifurcation (mathematics); Capacitors; Electric potential; Electric power factor correction; Parameter estimation; Switching systems; System stability; Topology; Boost converters; Nonlinear analysis; Power factor correction (PFC); Power converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346055431

However, this type of diet would have an impact on manure volume and composition, and a diet treatment to improve sow welfare by reducing their persistent hunger cannot be recommended without examining its impact on manure composition and handling. This study investigated the effects of high-fiber diets on the daily production and physico-chemical characteristics of manure slurry from pregnant sows. Three isoenergetic diets, very high-fiber (VHF), high fiber (HF), and concentrated (C), were fed twice daily to two groups of four fourth parity pregnant sows. Fecal and urine production was measured separately on days 17 and 18 of the 21-day treatment period. Physico-chemical analyses were performed on a slurry sample (mixture of feces and urine). Dietary fiber addition significantly (P < 0.05) increased fecal mass but tended to decrease urine production. Consequently, manure slurry (feces plus urine) production was similar with all diets, but total solids (TS) content was significantly increased (P < 0.05) as fiber addition increased. Mean TS concentration was 3.8, 11.1, and 18.3% in the manure from sows fed the C, HF, and VHF diets, respectively. As a result, manure slurry consistency was changed from a liquid state (less than 10% TS) when the C diet was fed to a semi-solid state (TS content between 10 and 20%) with the two high fiber diets. The use of high fiber diets may thus cause a challenge with the liquid manure handling, storage, and land application systems currently used on many commercial farms. Other major changes in manure slurry characteristics due to dietary fiber incorporation included significant (P < 0.05) increases in apparent viscosity, total and soluble chemical oxygen demand, and volatile fatty acid concentrations. Total amount of mineral elements excreted in the manure slurry was not affected by dietary fiber addition.","Diet amendment; Environment; Livestock effluent; Manure characteristics; Swine manure slurry","Chemical analysis; Chemical oxygen demand; Colorimetry; Fatty acids; Manures; Nutrition; Statistical methods; Viscosity; Water; Diet amendment; Dietary fiber; Environment; Livestock effluent; Pregnant sows slurry; Swine manure slurry; Urine; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345873293

For a basic understanding of heat transfer and heat storage behaviour, experiments as well as numerical simulations were carried out. Within the framework of these investigations, two different types of tile stoves were tested: a single-walled stove without an air gap and a double-walled stove with an air gap. Findings show that the air gap influences the heat storage behaviour causing a smooth surface temperature distribution and a decline in efficiency on the other hand. In order to avoid this negative effect, variations of the width of the air gap, ceramic mass, material and length of the flue gas tube were carried out. To remedy the deficiencies of the double-walled design, an extension of the length of the flue gas tube by 10-14% is necessary. Dense chamotte also allow double-walled tile stoves with the same efficiency as single-walled stoves using standard chamotte. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Heat storage; Stove; Wood combustion","Carbon monoxide; Ceramic materials; Combustion; Computer simulation; Energy efficiency; Heat losses; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Space heating; Temperature distribution; Wood; Double-walled tile stoves; Stoves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345308559

A major effort is underway to replace these with agro-residues such as rice husk, coffee husk, and sugar cane straw and bagasse. A major disadvantage of agricultural residues as a fuel is their low bulk density, which makes handling difficult and transport and storage expensive. However, agro-residues in their compact form, i.e., briquettes, obtained by different densification technologies can be used for their better utilization and improved efficiency. The possibility of converting coffee husk into briquettes was evaluated and several technical and economical parameters that describe the regimen operation of a bakery furnace burning coffee husk briquettes were determined. A bakery furnace burning coffee husk riquettes reached a thermal efficiency of 64%, being very similar to firewood with 64.9%, which could be attributed to the high heating value and low moisture content of coffee husk. The use of coffee husk briquettes on the actual 12 bakehouses, in the rural region of Segundo Frente, could substitute for fuelwood for ∼ 3 mo/yr. Thus, the use of coffee husk briquettes for combustion purposes in a bakery furnace had similar operating parameters as those obtained with fuelwood.","Bakery furnace; Briquette; Coffee husk; Combustion; Fuelwood",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242443259

In the experimental study, the mean temperature of the water and the temperature distribution of the PCM in the tank were measured. The experimentally obtained inlet and outlet water temperatures were also taken, as inlet/outlet water temperatures in the simulation model. Thus, the theoretical temperature and stored heat energy distribution in the energy storage tank were determined by using a computer program developed previously.

The films exhibit a larger charge storage capacity, which was determined as a function of the coatings thickness. The peak occurrence in the chronoamperometric curve during the deintercalation of lithium ions in the cerium/silicon films is analyzed in terms of trapping energy levels for Li+ ions into the film. In situ UV-Vis spectroelectrochemical measurements of the CeO2-SiO 2 coatings indicated that the films remained transparent in the visible spectral range during the intercalation process.

An exponential reduction in the emission intensity of Pr3+ ions was observed on following continuous excitation with 275nm corresponding to the f-d transition band of Pr3+ ions. Such a reduction in emission intensity was observed at all temperatures investigated in the range 90-330K. The emission intensity recovered partially on dark storage only above 180K. The recovery of emission intensity was also observed on the illumination of pre-exposed sample to light in the wavelength region 300-430nm. Following illumination with 275nm, Pr3+ activated thorium oxide phosphor has displayed a weak thermally stimulated luminescence. These results thus suggest that the optical excitation dynamically changes the state of the system under observation, and that changes are occurring in the valence state of Pr ions due to e/h transfer process on 275-nm exposure. On dark storage and also on 365-nm illumination of the pre-exposed sample, e/h traps recombine to cause emission signal recovery. The analysis of data on reduction in intensity obtained with exposure to 275nm suggests the likelihood of the of Pr3+ ions existing at three different sites. The activation energies associated with the release of electrons from excited Pr3+ ions at different sites were determined from the temperature dependence of the photo-induced charge transfer process. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Initial studies at BIBRA in the UK evaluated intakes of 0, 1, 2, and 5% betaine added to a maintenance chow designed for use in toxicology studies. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were followed for up to 90 days. No toxicity occurred, but at higher betaine intakes several serum chemistries were altered slightly, the MCV, MCH, and MCHC of red cells were reduced, and hepatocytes developed fatty droplets in direct proportion to betaine intake. Females were more affected than males. In a second study to assess reversibility in females, betaine effects were induced for 28 days, followed by a 28 day betaine-free period. All perturbations, except the reduced MCV and MCH, were reversed. As a follow up to BIBRA investigations, both 28 and 90 day feeding trials were conducted at Brandeis University using a rat chow with higher levels of energy, protein, and fat, with betaine added at 0, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 5.0% of the diet. A similar broad range of clinical chemistries and physiological parameters were monitored, and hepatic lipid droplets were investigated in more detail. Liver lipid was actually reduced by betaine, and no significant adverse effects of clinical importance resulted from any dose. However, the MCV was again reduced at 5% betaine in the 28 day study. By 90 days all parameters were normal and comparable to controls. Based on these collective data, it was concluded that even at these high doses, betaine is nontoxic. Differences observed between the BIBRA and Brandeis studies were attributed to differences in the dietary formulations.

This study deals with three important subjects. First is determination of the eutectic composition ratio of the palmitic acid (PA) and stearic acid (SA) binary system and measurement of its thermophysical properties by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Second is establishment of the phase transition characteristics of the mixture, such as the total melting and solidification temperatures and times, the heat transfer modes in the melted and solidified PCM and the effect of Reynolds and Stefan numbers as initial heat transfer fluid (HTF) conditions on the phase transition behaviors. Third is calculation of the heat transfer coefficients between the outside wall of the HTF pipe and the PCM, the heat recovery rates and heat fractions during the phase change processes of the mixture and also discussion of the effect of the inlet HTF parameters on these characteristics. The DSC results showed that the PA-SA binary system in the mixture ratio of 64.2:35.8 wt% forms a eutectic, which melts at 52.3 °C and has a latent heat of 181.7 Jg-1, and thus, these properties make it a suitable PCM for passive solar space heating and domestic water heating applications with respect to climate conditions. The experimental results also indicated that the eutectic mixture of PA-SA encapsulated in the annulus of concentric double pipes has good phase change and heat transfer characteristics during the melting and solidification processes, and it is an attractive candidate as a potential PCM for heat storage in latent heat thermal energy storage systems. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of the field program was to study the transport, distribution and storage of ozone and its precursors in the urban boundary layer over a diurnal cycle. The ground level O3 as well as mean meteorological variables and turbulence were measured over the entire period, and vertical profiling (using a tethered balloon) was made during the morning transition period. Approximately half of the observational days showed the usual diurnal cycle of high O3 during the day and low O3 at night, with nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO2 + NO) showing an out of phase relationship with O3. The rest of the days were signified by an anomalous increase of O3 in the late evening (Ο 2200 LST), concomitant with a sudden drop of temperature, an enhancement of wind speed and Reynolds stresses, a positive heat flux and a change of wind direction. NOx measurements indicated the simultaneous arrival of an 'aged' air mass, which was corroborated by the wind predictions of a mesoscale numerical model. In all, the results indicate that the recirculation of O3 rich air masses is responsible for the said high-O3 events. Such air masses are produced during the transport of O3 precursors by the upslope flow toward mountainous suburbs during the day, and they return back to the city at night via downslope winds (i.e. mountain breeze). The corresponding flow patterns, and hence the high-O3 events, are determined by background meteorological conditions. The vertical profiling of O3 and flow variables during the morning transition points to a myriad of transport, mixing and chemical processes that determine the fate of tropospheric O3. How well such processes are incorporated and resolved in predictive O3 models should determine the accuracy of their predictions.","Convective boundary layer; High ozone episode; Low level jet; Nocturnal boundary layer; Recirculation of ozone; Thermal circulation; Vertical ozone profile","atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric transport; boundary layer; diffusion; ozone; urban atmosphere; United States; Phoenix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037670187

Stocking was of five months' duration and for over a period of two years, using 200 day-old chicks per batch. Control experiments were conducted using kerosene to compare process performances between the two sources of energy in chick brooding. The solar arrangement recorded 68% liquid fuel (kerosene) saving in relation to the conventional system. Chicks raised through the solar arrangement also scored significantly (p = 0.05) and were rated better in all the biological indices of performance.

The presence and evolution of surface energy at the interface between the solid matrix and voids is taken into account with non-equilibrium thermodynamic considerations that allow storage of deformational work as surface energy on growing or newly created voids. This treatment leads to a simple description of isotropic damage that can be applied to low-cohesion media such as sandstone. In particular, the theory yields two possible solutions wherein samples can either 'break' by shear localization with dilation (i.e. void creation), or undergo shear-enhanced compaction (void collapse facilitated by deviatoric stress). For a given deviatoric stress and confining pressure, the dominant solution is that with the largest absolute value of the dilation rate, , which thus predicts that shear-localization and dilation occur at low effective pressures, while shear-enhanced compaction occurs at larger effective pressure. Stress trajectories of constant represent potential failure envelopes that are ogive- (Gothic-arch-) shaped curves, wherein the ascending branch represents failure by dilation and shear-localization, and the descending branch denotes shear-enhanced compactive failure. The theory further predicts that the onset of dilation preceding shear-localization and failure necessarily occurs at the transition from compactive to dilational states and thus along a line connecting the peaks of constant- ogives. Finally, the theory implies that while shear-enhanced compaction first occurs with increasing deviatoric stress (at large effective pressure), dilation will occur at higher deviatoric stresses. All of these predictions in fact compare very successfully with various experimental data. Indeed, the theory leads to a normalization where all the data of failure envelopes and dilation thresholds collapse to a single curve.","Damage; Fracture; Sandstone","damage mechanics; failure mechanism; fluid dynamics; fracture mechanics; geodynamics; mantle convection; plate tectonics; rheology; sandstone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012370107

Usually, these lipids represent energy storage compounds, but it has also been suggested that lipids play a role in buoyancy regulation. Lipids are thought to determine the overwintering depth of large calanoid copepods, and it has been widely assumed that these organisms overwinter at some 'depth of neutral buoyancy'. However, lipids are generally more compressible, and have a larger thermal expansion than seawater. This means that any depth of neutral buoyancy will be inherently unstable. Model results show that the ascent rates attributable to this instability are small at depth (where temperature changes are small), suggesting a simple way for animals to remain at depth while overwintering. However, model results also show that the buoyant properties of a copepod (or any small plankter) are extremely sensitive to its relative biochemical composition. This presents problems to maintaining vertical position, but may also be useful for vertical migrations.","Buoyancy; Copepod; Depth distribution; Lipid; Model; Vertical migration; Zooplankton","buoyancy; lipid; vertical distribution; vertical migration; zooplankton; Animalia; Calanoida; Copepoda; Copepoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346398121

A scheme of cell reuse and cell regeneration/biotransformation for enlarging the production process and reducing process costs was established. For the recombinant strain high levels of D(+)-carnitine racemase activity were obtained by growing the cells under anaerobic conditions at 41°C. The biotransformation process depended on both cell and substrate concentrations. The addition of fumarate as an energy providing substrate during the cell resting state improved the biotransformation process at high substrate concentrations. In this way, the use of 500 mmol/1 D(+)-carnitine and 200 mmol/l fumarate provided 28.2 and 36.3 g/l L(-)-carnitine (35% and 41% product yield and 3.50 and 1.45 g/l h L(-)-carnitine productivity) for the recombinant and wild strains, respectively. A storage study showed that resting cells retained 70% of their initial biotransformation capacity after 2 months storage at 4°C. Resting cells could be reused in a biotransformation/regeneration system, cutting the overall process time by approximately 70 and 25% for the transformed and wild strain, respectively. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study has investigated the levels of mRNA expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti-related protein (AgRP) and the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) in diet-induced obese (DIO) and diet-resistant (DR) mice. Thirty C57 mice were used in this study. Twenty-four mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HF: 40% of calories from fat, 20% from saturated fat) for 4 weeks and then classified as DIO and DR according to their body weight gain. Six mice were placed on a low-fat diet (LF: 10% of calories from fat, 1% from saturated fat) and were used as controls. After 22 weeks of feeding, visceral fat deposits were more than twice as heavy in the DIO mice as in the DR and LF mice, while the latter two groups had no significant difference. Using quantitative in situ hybridization techniques, this study found that the DIO mice had a significantly lower level of Arc POMC (-29%) and AgRP (-31%) mRNA expression than the DR and LF mice, respectively. The mice on high-fat diets had higher levels of AgRP mRNA expression in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BST), and ventral part of the lateral septal nucleus (LSV) than the LF mice. Furthermore, the DIO mice had a 40% higher level of MC4-R mRNA expression in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) and posterodorsal part of the medial amygdaloid nucleus (MePD) than the LF mice. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that differential expression of POMC, AgRP and MC4-R mRNA levels exists in DIO, DR and LF mice. These differences were shown to occur in the specific nuclei of the hypothalamus and other parts of the limbic system. These findings may assist in understanding the involvement of the melanocortinergic system in the regulation of body weight via the autonomic and limbic systems. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Little is known, however, about the coupling of structure and dynamics of these biofilms to ecosystem function. Here we show that microbial biofilms changed the physical and chemical microhabitat and contributed to ecosystem processes in 30-m-long stream mesocosms. Biofilm growth increased hydrodynamic transient storage-streamwater detained in quiescent zones, which is a major physical template for ecological processes in streams-by 300% and the retention of suspended particles by 120%. In addition, by enhancing the relative uptake of organic molecules of lower bioavailability, the interplay of biofilm microarchitecture and mass transfer changed their downstream linkage. As living zones of transient storage, biofilms bring hydrodynamic retention and biochemical processing into close spatial proximity and influence biogeochemical processes and patterns in streams. Thus, biofilms are highly efficient and successful ecological communities that may also contribute to the influence that headwater streams have on rivers, estuaries and even oceans through longitudinal linkages of local biogeochemical and hydrodynamic processes.",,"Biochemical engineering; Biofilms; Estuaries; Hydrodynamics; Mass transfer; Rivers; Stream flow; Energy flow; Nutrient cycling; Ecosystems; biofilm; ecosystem; freshwater; microbial activity; stream; aquatic environment; article; bioavailability; biofilm; confocal laser microscopy; estuary; flow kinetics; geochemical analysis; habitat structure; hydrodynamics; mesocosm; microhabitat; nonhuman; ocean environment; physical chemistry; priority journal; river ecosystem; suspended particulate matter; tillage; transport kinetics; Arabinose; Biofilms; Biological Availability; Biomass; Diffusion; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Glucose; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345414146

The Fe and Pt elemental analysis was conducted on both individual nanoparticles and granular films using energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy.

Provided an ansatz of a many-electron theory model, TCE performs valid contractions of creation and annihilation operators according to Wick's theorem, consolidates identical terms, and reduces the expressions into the form of multiple tensor contractions acted upon by permutation operators. It subsequently determines the binary contraction order for each multiple tensor contraction with the minimal operation and memory cost, factorizes common binary contractions (defines intermediate tensors), and identifies reusable intermediates. The resulting ordered list of binary tensor contractions, additions, and index permutations is translated into an optimized program that is combined with the NWCHEM and UTCHEM computational chemistry software packages. The programs synthesized by TCE take advantage of spin symmetry (within the spin-orbital formalisms), real Abelian point-group symmetry, and index permutation symmetry at every stage of the calculations to minimize the number of arithmetic operations and storage requirement, adjust the peak local memory usage by index-range tiling, and support parallel I/O interfaces and dynamic load balancing for parallel executions. We demonstrate the utility of TCE through automatic derivation and implementation of parallel programs for a range of predictive computational methods - configuration-interaction theory (CISD, CISDT, CISDTQ), generalized many-body perturbation theory [MBPT-(2), MBPT(3), MBPT(4)], and coupled cluster theory (LCCD, CCD, LCCSD, CCSD, QCISD, CCSDT, and CCSDTQ), some for the first time - and discuss the performance of the implemented programs.",,"Computational chemistry software packages; Configuration-interaction theory; Coupled cluster; Many-body perturbation theroies; Tensor contraction engine; Computational methods; Computer software; Electron energy levels; Mathematical operators; Molecular dynamics; Molecular structure; Perturbation techniques; Molecular physics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345566357

Objective: This dietary intervention is based on the different metabolic pathways of long-chain saturated fatty acids (LCFA), which are mostly stored in adipocytic triacylglycerols, medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) which are preferentially available for hepatic mitochondrial β-oxidation and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) suggested to modulate fat oxidation and storage by stimulating the peroxisomal β-oxidation. Combined dietary MCFA and n-3 LCPUFA without LCFA may synergistically stimulate fatty acid oxidation resulting in blood lipid clearance and LCFA release from adipocytes. Design: In a short term, parallel, randomized, double-blind trial effects on the fatty acid metabolism of 10 healthy volunteers (Body Mass Index 25-30) of a formula containing 72% MCFA and 22% n-3 LCPUFA without LCFA (intake: 1.500 kcal/day; fat: 55.5% of energy) were measured in comparison to an isoenergetic formula with equal fat amount and LCFA dominated lipid profile. Results: The plasma triacylglycerol (p < 0.1) and cholesterol (p < 0.05) content decreased in the test group. The n-3/n-6 LCPUFA (≥ C 20) ratio increased (p < 0.0001) after 4 days treatment. The LCFA content was similar in both groups despite missing LCFA in the test formula indicating LCFA release from adipocytes into the plasma. Both groups significantly reduced body weight considerably 4 kg (p < 0.01) and fat mass up to 50% of weight loss (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Combined dietary 72% MCFA and 22% n-3 LCPUFA without LCFA stimulate the fatty acid oxidation and release from adipocytes without affecting any safety parameters measured.",,"arachidonic acid; fatty acid; long chain fatty acid; medium chain fatty acid; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; stearic acid; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; adult; article; blood level; body fat; body mass; body weight; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; diet therapy; fat intake; fatty acid metabolism; human; lipid diet; nutrient content; plasma; short course therapy; triacylglycerol blood level; urine level; weight reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042570234

Black Pearls 2000® (BP) and Vulcan® XC-72 R (XC) were used as supporting materials. Samples of the composite were calcined in nitrogen atmosphere at temperatures from 130 to 450°C. Chemical and structural characterization of the precursor and the composites was performed by using energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXRFS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These techniques showed that the oxide impregnated into carbon support is hydrous and amorphous. The amorphous structure is maintained if the composite is calcined up to 300°C, while the low-intensity peak at 2θ position that corresponds to the most intensive peak of the rutile structure was registered at 450°C. The capacitance of the composite was determined using cyclic voltammetry. It was found that the capacitance is dependent on calcination temperature and surface area of the carbon black support. The highest specific capacitance of about 700 F g -1 of composite was registered for RuO x H y supported on BP and calcined at 300°C while four times lower values was obtained for RuO x H y supported on XC. The capacitance measurements indicated that XC-supported RuO x H y composite is highly porous while BP-supported one is more compact. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In this model, the particles interact with their nearest neighbors via nonlinear Morse potentials. In addition, each particle is subject to nonlinear friction, modeling the transfer of energy between the translational degree of freedom and energy depots, representing further (internal) degrees of freedom. Depending on the momentary state of the system, this energy exchange mechanism can decrease or increase the kinetic energy of the particles on the cost of the depots. In particular, the clusters are assumed to have the ability to store parts of their initial energy in the depots. In later stages of a collision process, the stored depot energy can be used for an acceleration of the fragments, i.e., it can be converted into kinetic energy of motion. Both, analytically and by means of computer simulations, we investigate the dependence of the fragmentation channels, observed after the collisions, on different initial conditions (e.g. initial particle energy, cluster size) and system parameters. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In response to pancreatic glucagon and adrenal cortisol, the cAMP-responsive transcription factor CREB activates gluconeogenic and fatty acid oxidation programmes by stimulating expression of the nuclear hormone receptor coactivator PGC-1 (refs 2-5). In parallel, fasting also suppresses lipid storage and synthesis (lipogenic) pathways, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we show that mice deficient in CREB activity have a fatty liver phenotype and display elevated expression of the nuclear hormone receptor PPAR-γ, a key regulator of lipogenic genes. CREB inhibits hepatic PPAR-γ expression in the fasted state by stimulating the expression of the Hairy Enhancer of Split (HES-1) gene, a transcriptional repressor that is shown here to be a mediator of fasting lipid metabolism in vivo. The coordinate induction of PGC-1 and repression of PPAR-γ by CREB during fasting provides a molecular rationale for the antagonism between insulin and counter-regulatory hormones, and indicates a potential role for CREB antagonists as therapeutic agents in enhancing insulin sensitivity in the liver.",,"Biosynthesis; Fatty acids; Genes; Glucose; Insulin; Lipids; Oxidation; Antagonism; Lipogenic genes; Therapeutic agents; Metabolism; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; hormone receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; biology; lipid; animal cell; article; controlled study; diet restriction; fatty liver; gene; gene control; hairy enhancer of split gene; in vivo study; inhibition kinetics; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; liver metabolism; male; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; stimulation; Animals; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Cell Line, Tumor; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; Fasting; Fatty Liver; Gene Expression Regulation; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Insulin; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Phenotype; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Transcription Factors; Triglycerides; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344010662

The obtained storage and loss moduli for the system were well described with the sum of two Maxwell models possessing two sets of a relaxation time and strength: τf and Gf and τs (&gt;τf) and Gs, whereas the viscoelastic behavior of organogels consisting of N, N', N""-tris(3,7-dimethyloctyl)benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (DO3B) and n-alkanes is well described with only one Maxwell model. The value of G f is proportional to c2 as observed in entangled flexible polymer systems and the organogels of DO3B. On the contrary, the value of Gs is approximately proportional to c1.3 similarly to the behavior predicted for rigid rodlike polymer solutions. The value of τf is essentially independent of c, while that of τs is kept at a constant and is followed by increasing above c = 10 gL-1. The activation energies of both the relaxation times are less than that for the viscosity of C10. Supramolecular polymeric structure bearing 2-type, rigid rodlike and flexible, portions are generated in the system due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The fast relaxation mode is attributed to the entanglement release between the flexible portions as observed in the organogels of DO3B, and the other is attributed to rotational relaxation of the rigid rodlike portion.","Maxwell model; Organogel; Relaxation time; Rotational diffusion; Viscoelasticity","Micelles; Solutions; Viscoelasticity; Supramolecular polymeric systems; Organic polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242367988

Body-brain interaction is circular because the brain immediately integrates an input to an output, and because part of this response may be that the brain modulates the sensitivity of this perception. First, we describe how the brain senses the body through neurons and blood-borne factors. Direct neuronal connections report the state of various organs. In addition, humoral factors are perceived by the blood-brain barrier and circumventricular organs. We describe how circulating energy carriers are sensed and what signals reach the brain during food intake, exercise and an immune response. We describe that the brain regulates the homeostatic process at two fundamentally different levels during the active and inactive states. The unbalanced output of the brain in the metabolic syndrome is discussed in relation with such circadian rhythms and with regional activity of the autonomic nervous system. In line with the above, we suggest a new approach for the diagnosis and therapy of the metabolic syndrome. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Current theories consider obesity a result of overeating and sedentary life style and most efforts to treat or prevent weight gain concentrate on exercise and food intake. This approach does not improve the situation as may be seen from the steep increase in the prevalence of obesity. This encouraged us to reanalyse existing information and look for biochemical basis of obesity. Our approach was to ignore current theories and concentrate on experimental data which are described in scientific journals and are available from several databases. We developed and applied a Knowledge Discovery in Databases procedure to analyse metabolic data. We began with the contradictory information: in obesity, more calories are consumed than used up, suggesting that obese people should have excess energy. On the other side, obese people experience fatigue and decreased physical endurance that indicates diminished energy supply in the body. The result of our work is a chain of metabolic events leading to obesity. The crucial event is the inhibition of the TCA cycle at the step of aconitase. It disturbs energy metabolism and results in ATP deficiency with simultaneous fat accumulation. Further steps in obesity development are the consequences of diminished energy supply: inhibition of beta-oxidation, leptin resistance, increase in appetite and food intake and a decrease in physical activity. Thus, our theory shows that obesity does not have to be caused by overeating and sedentary life-style but may be the result of the ""obese"" change in metabolism which is forcing people to overeat and save energy to sustain metabolic functions of cells. This ""obese"" change is caused by environmental factors that activate chronic low-grade inflammatory process in the body linking obesity with the environment of developed countries. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Broader pH tolerance and higher heat stability could be achieved by this method. Immobilized lipase retained 74% residual activity after ten hydrolysis cycles and 67% after 7 days of storage. Kinetic parameters Vmax and K m and the energy of activation (Ea) were determined for the immobilized lipase. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

CHICSi measures charged particles and fragments from nuclear reactions. It operates at internal targets of storage rings. In order to optimize space and momentum-space coverage and minimize the low-energy detection limits, CHICSi is designed for use in ultra-high vacuum (UHV, ∼10-8Pa) inside a cluster-jet target chamber. This calls for materials in mechanical support, detectors, Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) electronics, connectors, cables and other signal transport devices with very low outgassing. Two auxiliary detector systems, which will operate in coincidence with CHICSi, a heavy-recoil, time-of-flight system (HR-TOF) also placed inside the target chamber and a projectile fragmentation wall (PF-WALL) located outside the chamber, have also been constructed.

One of the drawbacks of many of the proposed techniques is that the value predictors require very large hardware structures which use up many transistors and can consume a large amount of energy. In this study, we use data-widths to partition the value prediction structures into multiple smaller structures, and then use data-width prediction to select from these tables. A width-partitioned value predictor requires less space because small bit-width values get allocated to smaller storage locations instead of using a full 64 bits. The total energy consumption of the predictor is also reduced because only a single smaller predictor table needs to be accessed. Width-partitioning provides a 25.7-46.5% reduction in energy consumption for last value predictors and finite context matching (FCM) predictors. For FCM predictors, width partitioning allows the total size of the second-level tables to be reduced by 75% while still maintaining the same prediction rates of a conventional FCM predictor. Our performance studies indicate that width partitioning does not degrade the geometric mean IPC on the SPEC2000 integer benchmarks, thus showing that width partitioning is an effective technique to reduce the size and energy requirements of value predictors.",,"Data-width distributions; Finite context matching (FCM); Load value predictors; Prediction algorithms; Algorithms; Computer architecture; Energy utilization; Mathematical models; Optimization; Program processors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942752405

The ns-C films exhibit an ohmic behavior with a room temperature resistivity in the range of 107-109 Ω cm depending on the growth and storage conditions.

Nanocomposite carbon-metal films have been obtained by adding small amounts of metallorganic precursors containing molybdenum and cobalt during the formation of carbon clusters prior to deposition. The films are characterized by porous carbon networks containing small metal and metal carbide clusters. Electrical transport properties of these films have been studied as a function of temperature, gas pressure and relative humidity.

H. theeli attained its maximum density at lowest tidal level (0 m) with 3.05 ind m-2 and was concentrated in shallow tide pools. Holothuria theeli fed on invertebrates and microscopic algae. 65% of the gut contents consisted of eight zoobenthic groups, where the most dominant species were meiobenthic crustaceans (46.5%, of which 35.5% were harpacticoid copepods), and microphytobenthos (35%, of which 91% were diatoms). May was the transition period (during water temperature changes) in which the population was dormant after spawning. The seasonal variation in the quantity and type of ingested matter may be related to several related factors, such as: (1) availability of food resources, (2) high food consumption rate in the dry season for energy storage to offset the lean rainy season, and (3) high energetic needs for reproductive activities. Holothuria theeli is a non-selective generalist species, which probably plays an important role in determining benthic community structure in the rocky intertidal at the central coast off Ecuador.",,"diet; food availability; population density; seasonal variation; stomach content; tidal flat; Ecuador; Guayas; Puntilla Santa Elena; South America; algae; Aspidochirotida; Bacillariophyta; Copepoda; Crustacea; Harpacticoida; Holothuria; Holothuriidae; Holothuroidea; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942454398

The model consists of the system of conservation equations of momentum, energy, and mass for the air phase, and the energy and mass for the product phase without considering the internal gradient in temperature and moisture in the product phase. The interaction between the airflow and the porous media is described by an Ergun-type equation based on experimental data. Heat of respiration is included in the model as an empirically derived function of temperature. A finite volume code is used to solve the model equations. The results show a good agreement between the model and the experiments. Differences between predicted and measured weight loss only amount to a maximum 10% after the initial cooling period. The non-ideal experimental conditions (high velocity, low relative humidity of the air), the various sizes of the products, the small scale of the porous region compared to the size of the product, and the estimation of transfer correlations contribute to the observed differences between experiment and simulation. The model can be applied to study the cooling process in an industrial cold store to find the optimal process settings to improve product quality and reduce product weight loss.","Chicory; Cooling; Heat and mass transfer; Simulation models; Storage losses; Storage quality","Continuum model; Ergun-type equations; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Continuum mechanics; Cooling; Mass transfer; Moisture; Porous materials; Heat transfer; agricultural engineering; airflow; computational fluid dynamics; cooling; crop; heat transfer; mass transfer; storage; Cichorium intybus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542439259

We analyze its response when subjected to an external field along its in-plane hard axis. We derive the exact trajectories of the magnetization. The switching versus non switching behavior is delimited by a bifurcation trajectory, for applied fields equal to half of the effective anisotropy field. A magnetization going through this bifurcation trajectory passes exactly along the hard axis and exhibits a vanishing characteristic frequency at that unstable point, which makes the trajectory noise sensitive. Attempting to approach the related minimal cost in applied field makes the magnetization final state unpredictable. We add finite damping in the model as a perturbative, energy dissipation factor. For a large applied field, the system switches several times back and forth. Several trajectories can be gone through before the system has dissipated enough energy to converge to one attracting equilibrium state. For some moderate fields, the system switches only once by a relaxation dominated precessional switching. We show that the associated switching field increases linearly with the damping parameter. The slope scales with the square root of the effective anisotropy. Our simple concluding expressions are useful to assess the potential application of precessional switching in magnetic random access memories. © EDP Sciences, Società Italiana di Fisica, and Springer-Verlag 2003.",,"Energy dissipation; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetization; Magnets; Random access storage; Switching; Anisotropy fields; Nanomagnets; Switching behavior; Thin macrospin; Nanostructured materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542280898

Where land managers are required to make decisions about restoration, remediation and future land use, understanding attitudes and future land use preferences is essential. In this paper I synthesize data on five surveys of recreational rates and preferences for future land use for the Department of Energy's Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Subjects were interviewed at several well-attended events at different distances from INEEL, representing local and regional views. Between 24 and 59% of the subjects hunted, between 55 and 71% fished, and up to 87% camped, indicating potential for exposure if INEEL were open for recreation. Average recreational rates varied by location, with the Shoshone-Bannock Indians having higher hunting, fishing, hiking and camping rates than all others. There were significant differences in future land use preferences; subjects living close to the site rated nuclear material processing very high, while those living farther away ranked it intermediate. Indians ranked this use the lowest. Using the land as a National Environmental Research Park (NERP) was rated the highest (or nearly the highest) for all groups. Industrial uses were generally rated low by all groups. These data can be used by local planners and policy makers in decision making regarding levels of clean-up, future land use, future end-states and long-term protection and stewardship of these contaminated lands. The relative unanimity in future land use preferences for NERP and recreation, rather than new industrial purposes, provides guidance for remediation, suggesting that residential clean-up standards may be more stringent than required. Further, the relative approval of continued nuclear reprocessing (but not nuclear storage) also provides guidance for risk-based end-state planning.",,"attitudinal survey; cleanup; contaminated land; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; land use planning; recreational activity; Idaho; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0942302045

To cope with this problem, we propose a new coil design, the tilted toroidal coil (TTC). The TTC, obtained from the toroidal field coil (TFC) system by varying two pitching angles, allows the balancing of the electromagnetic force in the major radius direction, maintaining the same manufacturing simplicity of the TFC system. After determining balanced configurations through computer simulation, we built an experimental device to confirm the feasibility of the balancing effect.","Electromagnetic force balance; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems; Toroidal coil systems","Computer simulation; Electric coils; Electric power systems; Electric windings; Electromagnetism; Energy storage; Magnetic fields; Electromagnetic force balance; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SEMS) systems; Toroidal coil systems; Superconducting magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347537830

ViaCyte™, a proprietary experimental preservative solution (comprising D-ribose, D-glucose, Hanks solution, Hepes solution, bovine serum albumin, tic anticoagulant peptide and sterile water), was tested in comparison with the presently accepted storage solution, citrate-dextrose-phosphate-plasma (CDP-P), to evaluate its ability to preserve platelet function during storage. Materials and Methods: Platelets stored in ViaCyte and platelets suspended in CDP-P were transferred to polypropylene tubes with PL732 covers and analysed for adenine nucleotide levels (ATP molecules), in vitro agonist-mediated P-selectin expression and aggregation. Results: After 5 days of storage at room temperature, 12.20% of platelets stored in ViaCyte exhibited P-selectin expression at rest, and 64.2% exhibited P-selectin expression upon activation with thrombin challenge, an increase of 52%. Platelets stored in CDP-P exhibited 44.4% P-selectin expression at rest, suggesting significant activation during storage, and thrombin stimulation resulted in P-selectin expression of 47.9%, an increase of only 2.5% (P ≤ 0.002, untreated vs. treated). ViaCyte also maintained ATP levels throughout the storage period, while these levels became depressed in platelets stored in CDP-P (P ≤ 0.02, untreated vs. treated). Storing platelets in the experimental preservative solution maintained their ability to aggregate, while control platelets lost their ability to aggregate in response to agonist. Conclusions: ViaCyte appears to protect platelets during storage, reflected by a low level of induced lesions. Platelets stored in ViaCyte maintain energy levels at their resting state, which preserves their ability to aggregate and se crete granule contents, and ensures the availability of additional platelets for activation upon in vitro challenge.","D-ribose; Function; Platelets; Preservation; Storage","adenosine triphosphate; anticoagulant agent; bovine serum albumin; calcium chloride; disodium hydrogen phosphate; glucose; magnesium chloride; magnesium sulfate; PADGEM protein; peptide; potassium chloride; potassium dihydrogen phosphate; preservative; ribose; sodium chloride; thrombocyte concentrate; article; blood bank; blood component therapy; blood storage; flow cytometry; human; human cell; priority journal; thrombocyte activation; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombocyte function; thrombocyte transfusion; Adenosine Triphosphate; Blood Platelets; Blood Preservation; Citrates; Glucose; Humans; Isotonic Solutions; P-Selectin; Platelet Aggregation; Temperature; Thrombin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347504846

Their interaction with dams is the main objective of this paper. We studied how varying the dam height could shorten a granular avalanche run-out thanks to a set of simple laboratory experiments carried out on different scales. Shortening the run-out was expected to depend on two effects: (i) storage of the granular material upstream of the dam, and (ii) local energy dissipations. A scaling law is highlighted. As suggested by dimensional arguments, the contribution of the local energy dissipation was shown to be more dominant than the storage effects.","Dams; Dimensional analysis; Granular flows; Protection measures; Reduced models; Snow avalanches","Avalanches (snowslides); Dams; Energy dissipation; Granular materials; Avalanche flows; Geophysics; avalanche; barrier (equipment); energy dissipation; granular medium; scale effect; snow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347270206

Matrotrophy is the nourishment of viviparous embryos by resources provided between fertilization and parturition, while lecithotrophy describes embryo nourishment provided before fertilization. In fishes and reptiles, embryo nourishment encompasses a continuum from solely lecithotrophic to primarily matrotrophic. Matrotrophy has evolved independently from lecithotrophic ancestors many times in many groups. We assumed matrotrophy increased the number of offspring a viviparous female could gestate and evaluated conditions of food availability favoring lecithotrophy or matrotrophy. The matrotrophic strategy was superior when food resources exceeded demand during gestation but at a risk of overproduction and reproductive failure if food intake was limited. Matrotrophic females were leaner during gestation than lecithotrophic females, yielding shorter life spans. Our models suggest that matrotrophic embryo nourishment evolved in environments with high food availability, consistently exceeding energy requirements for maintaining relatively large broods. Embryo abortion with some resorption of invested energy is a necessary preadaptation to the evolution of matrotrophy. Future work should explore trade-offs of age-specific mortality and reproductive output for females maintaining different levels of fat storage during gestation.","Lecithotrophy; Life history; Matrotrophy; Poecilia latipinna; Trade-off; Viviparity","fish; life history; resource allocation; trade-off; viviparity; animal; animal embryo; article; biological model; egg yolk; energy metabolism; evolution; fish; metabolism; oocyte; physiology; reproduction; time; Animals; Egg Yolk; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Energy Metabolism; Evolution; Fishes; Models, Biological; Ovum; Reproduction; Time Factors; Animalia; Pisces; Poecilia; Poecilia latipinna; Reptilia; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345581391

This analysis presents field assessment of abdominal fat deposits (API) from large samples of marked birds which showed increasing rates of fuel deposition throughout January-April. Historical records show that geese rarely depart en masse before 17 April, a pattern followed by all but one of the tagged birds. Timed positions obtained from 12 geese fitted with satellite transmitters in 1997, 1998 and 1999 suggested that all geese departed winter quarters on tailwinds between 16 and 19 April. Tracked geese flew directly to staging areas in Iceland, although one staged for 10 days in Northern Ireland in 1997 and another may have stopped briefly in western Scotland. Average migration duration of all tagged birds departing Ireland (including the 1997 bird that stopped over within Ireland) was 25 hours (range 13-77). Four geese apparently overshot and returned to Iceland during strong E to ESE winds. APIs in Iceland snowed more rapid and linear increases in stores during the mean 19-day (range 13-22) staging period there than on the winter quarters. Geese continued their migration to Greenland when APIs attained or exceeded levels at departure from Ireland and all departed on assisting tailwinds between 1 and 11 May. Tracked birds continued the journey to West Greenland in between 24 and 261 (mean 82) hours, although one bird turned back during the traverse of the Greenland Ice Cap and summered on the east coast. Seven of the birds staged for 1-20 hours at, or near, the East Greenland coast and several made slow progress crossing the inland ice, all in the direction of their ultimate destination (i.e. not necessarily taking the lowest or shortest crossing routes). It is suggested that the energy-savings of departing on tailwinds may favour geese to wait for such conditions once threshold fat storage levels have been reached, but more research is needed to confirm this.",,"arrival date; biotelemetry; fat reserve; migration route; migratory behavior; stopover; waterfowl; Arctic; Iceland; Anas; Anatidae; Anser; Anser albifrons flavirostris; Anser sp.; Apis; Aves",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345014873

This method provides a quantitative picture of the ATP distribution close to the in vivo situation. ATP concentrations were always highest within the axis. In pre-storage cotyledons, the level was low, but it increased strongly in the course of further development, starting from the abaxial region of cotyledons and moving towards the interior. Greening pattern, chlorophyll distribution and photosynthetic O2 production within embryos temporally and spatially corresponded to the ATP distribution, implicating that the overall increase of the energy state is associated to the greening process. ATP patterns were associated to the photosynthetic capacity of the embryo. The general distribution pattern as well as the steady state levels of ATP were developmentally regulated and did not change upon dark/light conditions. The major storage protein legumin started to accumulate in abaxial regions with high ATP, whereas starch localized in regions with relatively lower ATP levels. This suggests a role of the energy state in the partitioning of assimilates into the different storage-product classes.

The stress has a linear-upturn power-law relation with the strain, resulting in an elastic modulus, and consequently a wave speed, that increase with the strain. Though appearing to be ""supersonic"", the local wave speed in the crack tip vicinity of the solid with a sufficient upturn stress-strain relation exceeds the crack extension speed. A pre-request for such a supersonic crack growth is the storage of sufficient deformation energy within the solid to nurse the energy flux drawn to the crack tip that extends at an ""apparent supersonic"" speed. The idea is demonstrated for the simplest case, the anti-plane shear. We examine the steady-state supersonic crack growth in a hyperelastic material. The governing equation is elliptical in the crack tip vicinity but hyperbolic elsewhere. The boundary between two regions is determined with a certain extent. An asymptotic solution is constructed within the super-hardening zone. The solution connects to the hyperbolic radiation strips by weak discontinuity boundaries and to the pre-stressed frontal field by a strong discontinuity boundary. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The value of the E s, (the energy stored by the polymeric molecules during shear flow) was experimentally determined as a function of composition and shear rate from the viscoelastic material functions of the blend by using two different methods proposed by Marrucci and Wolf. The evaluated Es (proposed by Marrucci) from the entanglement plateau modulus, GN0, and dynamic shear viscosity at a given shear rate,η(γ̇), were found to well describe the behavior of shear-induced mixing for the present system; i.e., a negative deviation of Es from the linear-mixing rule has been detected, which is a necessary condition for the elevation of the cloud points to higher values under shear flow. However, on the other hand, the calculated Es from the viscoelastic relaxation time, τ 0 and zero shear viscosity, η0 (Wolf model), predicted both shear-induced mixing and shear-induced demixing for the large and small concentration range of PαMSAN, respectively; i.e., negative and positive deviation of Es from the linear-mixing rule was observed dependent on the concentration of PαMSAN. It is concluded that the viscoelastic material functions of the blend are very helpful for qualitatively anticipating the phase behavior of the blend under the effect of shear flow.","Shear flow; Storage energy; Viscoelastic properties","Composition; Concentration (process); Elastic moduli; Gibbs free energy; Phase diagrams; Shear flow; Solubility; Viscoelasticity; Linear mixing; Copolymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242665540

In addition to fatty acids, WAT produces many hormones and can therefore be designated as a traditional endocrine gland actively participating in the integrative physiology of fuel and energy metabolism, eating behaviour and the regulation of hormone secretion and sensitivity. WAT is controlled by humoral factors, para- and intracrine factors and by neural regulation. Sympathetic nerve fibres innervate WAT and stimulate lipolysis, leading to the release of glycerol and free fatty acids. In addition, recent research in rats has clearly shown a functional parasympathetic innervation of WAT. There appears to be a distinct somatotopy within the parasympathetic nuclei: separate sets of autonomic neurones in the brain stem innervate either the visceral or the subcutaneous fat compartment. We therefore propose that the central nervous system (CNS) plays a major role in the hitherto unexplained regulation of body fat distribution. Parasympathectomy induces insulin resistance with respect to glucose and fatty acid uptake in the innervated fat depot and has selective effects on local hormone synthesis. Thus, the CNS is involved not only in the regulation of hormone production by WAT, but also in its hormone sensitivity. The developments in this research area are likely to increase our insights in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders such as hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes mellitus type 2 and lipodystrophy syndromes.","Insulin resistance; Leptin; Lipolysis; Parasympthetic; Sympathetic","fatty acid; glucose; glycerol; humoral antibody; insulin; lipid; triacylglycerol; autonomic nervous system; body fat; brain stem; central nervous system function; endocrine gland; energy metabolism; fatty acid transport; feeding behavior; glucose transport; hormonal regulation; hormone release; hormone sensitivity; hormone synthesis; human; hypertriglyceridemia; insulin resistance; lipid storage; lipodystrophy; lipolysis; medical research; metabolic disorder; nerve cell; neuroendocrine system; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; paracrine signaling; parasympathetic innervation; pathogenesis; priority journal; rat; regulatory mechanism; review; subcutaneous fat; sympathetic innervation; sympathetic nerve; vagotomy; viscera; white adipose tissue; Adaptation, Physiological; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Endocrine System; Humans; Leptin; Parasympathetic Nervous System; Sympathetic Nervous System",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242636684

Ghrelin was also proposed to regulate leptin and insulin release and to be important for the normal function of stomach, heart, kidney, lung, testis, and placenta. To help determine a definable physiological role for ghrelin, we generated ghrelin-null mice. In contrast to predictions made from the pharmacology of ghrelin, ghrelin-null mice are not anorexic dwarfs; their size, growth rate, food intake, body composition, reproduction, gross behavior, and tissue pathology are indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. Fasting produces identical decreases in serum leptin and insulin in null and wild-type mice. Ghrelin-null mice display normal responses to starvation and diet-induced obesity. As in wild-type mice, the administration of exogenous ghrelin stimulates appetite in null mice. Our data show that ghrelin is not critically required for viability, fertility, growth, appetite, bone density, and fat deposition and not likely to be a direct regulator of leptin and insulin.

The thermophysical properties and long-term stability of this binary COC/CN mixture were examined by using the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and microscopic Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer combined with DSC system. Its long-term thermo-responsive efficacy was also evaluated by in vitro drug penetration study via a step-wise change in temperature cycle. The results indicate that the IR spectral peak intensity near 1265-1252 and 1172cm-1 at 37°C were markedly stronger than those peaks at 30°C, as the C-O stretching mode of ester for binary COC/CN mixture exhibited more intense IR spectral absorption at higher temperature. The phase transition temperature obtained from the microscopic FT-IR/DSC system was 35.7°C, almost near the endothermic peak at 34.8°C in the DSC curve. The result of isothermal FT-IR/DSC microscopic system also confirmed the good temperature response in precision, sensitivity, obedience and reproducibility of the binary COC/CN mixture after eight repeated temperature cycles. Long-term stability revealed that this solid-cholesteric transitional temperature at 34.8°C was, respectively, transited to 30.2, 44.1 or 50.9°C after storage at 4, 25 or 37°C for 3 days and then maintained almost constant, suggesting the constant thermal-stability of the binary COC/CN mixture.

Today's growing consumption of fuels indicates that, in the next 50 years, the world's petroleum resources will be approaching exhaustion. For example, suppose that every family in China had two cars that are driven everyday as far as American family cars are driven today. Then, China would need 80 million barrels of petroleum each day. However, the world's current production of petroleum is only 74 million barrels per day. China's approach to their air-pollution and energy problems is constructing new nuclear power plants plus the 18.2 gigawatt Three Gorges hydro-power-plant. The increasing carbon dioxide content in our atmosphere, and a rising global temperature, accompany the world's growing fuel consumption. Archeological evidence relates the growth and decline of the ice ages to air temperature. Many popular techniques for reducing carbon-dioxide emissions have defects. For example, replacing nuclear power plants with wind-power plants is proposed in Germany. During no-wind conditions, hydropower would be imported from Switzerland. At night, the Swiss would pump, with nuclear power from France, water from the lake back up into the high-elevation storage reservoirs. These and other power-generation technologies are evaluated in this report.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Electric power generation; Gas emissions; Natural gas wells; High elevation storage reservoirs; Petroleum prospecting",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242456362

The occurrence of arbuscules (branched hyphal structures) and vesicles (lipid storage organs) was compared with the amounts of signature fatty acids. The fatty acid 16:1ω5 was used as a signature for both AM fungal phospholipids (membrane constituents) and neutral lipids (energy storage) in roots (intraradical mycelium) and in soil (extraradical mycelium). The formation of arbuscules and the accumulation of AM fungal phospholipids in intraradical mycelium followed each other closely in both fungal species. In contrast, the neutral lipids of G. intraradices increased continuously in the intraradical mycelium, while vesicle occurrence decreased after initial rapid root colonization by the fungus. S. calospora does not form vesicles and accumulated more neutral lipids in extraradical than in intraradical mycelium, while the opposite pattern was found for G. intraradices. G. intraradices allocated more of its lipids to storage than did S. calospora. Thus, within a species, the fatty acid 16:1ω5 is a good indicator for AM fungal development. The phospholipid fatty acid 16:1ω5 is especially suitable for indicating the frequency of arbuscules in the symbiosis.

X-ray energy responses of these detectors are characterized before and after irradiation by the use of synchrotron radiation from a 2.5GeV positron storage ring at the Photon Factory of High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK). A recovery of the degraded X-ray energy response after the neutron irradiation has been found at fluences beyond around 1013 neutrons/cm2. A further novel finding is followed as a ""re-degradation"" by a neutron irradiation level over about 10 14 neutrons/cm2. This ""non-linear response"" may be physically interpreted in terms of a type inversion from n- to p-type silicon in the detectors.

Instead, these facilities must rely on engineering, administrative, and institutional controls to ensure the level of cleanup performed at the site remains adequately protective of public health and the environment. In order for these controls to remain effective, however, a plan for long-term stewardship of these sites must be developed that is approved by the U.S. Congress. Although this sounds simple enough for the present, serious questions remain regarding how best to implement a program of stewardship to ensure its effectiveness over time, particularly for sites with residual contamination of radionuclides with half-lives on the order of thousands of years. Individual facilities have attempted to answer these questions at the site-specific level. However, the complexities of the issues require federal support and oversight to ensure the programs implemented at each of the facilities are consistent and effective. The Department of Energy recently submitted a report to Congress outlining the extent of long-term stewardship needs at each of its facilities. As a result, the time is ripe for forward thinking Congressional action to address the relevant issues and ensure the remedy of long-term stewardship successfully carries out its intended purpose and remains protective of public health and the environment. The regulatory elements necessary for the stewardship program to succeed can only be implemented through the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress.","Contamination, environmental; Nuclear weapons; Regulations; Waste management","article; atomic bomb; environmental management; environmental protection; government; law; priority journal; public health; radioactive waste processing; radioactive waste storage; regulatory mechanism; United States; waste management; Decontamination; Environmental Pollution; Government Agencies; Hazardous Substances; Nuclear Warfare; Policy Making; Radiation Protection; Radioactive Waste; Risk Assessment; Safety Management; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142245670

The present work is an attempt to explain such behaviour on the basis of thermodynamical arguments. The approach assumes that a nanometric amorphous layer is submitted to the crystal field leading to a gradient of atomic density across the glassy layer. It is shown that the stabilisation of the glassy layer is expected when approaching a thickness of few nanometers. This study is closely related to the concerns of the phase change optical storage because such a technology involves both the use of very thin films and fast structural transitions between the two states (amorphous and crystalline) of the active material. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

M5S 3B3, Canada","The environmental performance of hemp based natural fiber mat thermoplastic (NMT) has been evaluated in this study by quantifying carbon storage potential and CO2 emissions and comparing the results with commercially available glass fiber composites. Non-woven mats of hemp fiber and polypropylene matrix were used to make NMT samples by film-stacking method without using any binder aid. The results showed that hemp based NMT have compatible or even better strength properties as compared to conventional flax based thermoplastics. A value of 63 MPa for flexural strength is achieved at 64% fiber content by weight. Similarly, impact energy values (84-154 J/m) are also promising. The carbon sequestration and storage by hemp crop through photosynthesis is estimated by quantifying dry biomass of fibers based on one metric ton of NMT. A value of 325 kg carbon per metric ton of hemp based composite is estimated which can be stored by the product during its useful life. An extra 22% carbon storage can be achieved by increasing the compression ratio by 13% while maintaining same flexural strength. Further, net carbon sequestration by industrial hemp crop is estimated as 0.67 ton/h/year, which is compatible to all USA urban trees and very close to naturally, regenerated forests. A comparative life cycle analysis focused on non-renewable energy consumption of natural and glass fiber composites shows that a net saving of 50 000 MJ (∼3 ton CO2 emissions) per ton of thermoplastic can be achieved by replacing 30% glass fiber reinforcement with 65% hemp fiber. It is further estimated that 3.07 million ton CO2 emissions (4.3% of total USA industrial emissions) and 1.19 million m3 crude oil (1.0% of total Canadian oil consumption) can be saved by substituting 50% fiber glass plastics with natural fiber composites in North American auto applications. However, to compete with glass fiber effectively, further research is needed to improve natural fiber processing, interfacial bonding and control moisture sensitivity in longer run. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Recent studies have shown that the ABB system owns the capability for reducing radial vibrations of the rotating spindle-disk assembly by counter-acting the inherent imbalance. To extend the analysis to be practical, non-planar dynamic modeling and analysis are conducted in this study to re-affirm the pre-claimed capability of the ABB system. Euler angles are first utilized to formulate potential and kinetic energies. Lagrange's equations are next applied to derive governing equations of motion. Numerical simulations of non-planar motions are finally carried out to calculate two performance indices, the level of residual radial vibration and the tilting angle of the rotating assembly. It is obtained that the levels of residual vibration as compared to those without the ABB, are significantly reduced. On the other hand, the tilting angle of the rotating assembly can be kept small if the ABB is installed below the inherent imbalance of the spindle-disk system. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The whole energy system was considered from natural resources to the required energy services. District heating, electric heat pumps, electric boilers, natural-gas-, oil- or pellet-fired local boilers were considered when supplying heat to a detached house. The district heat production included wood-chip-fired and natural-gas-fired cogeneration plants. Electricity other than cogenerated electricity was produced in wood-chip- and natural-gas-fired stand-alone power plants. The analysis includes four tax scenarios, as well as the external cost of environmental and health damage arising from energy conversion emission based on the ExternE study of the European Commission. The most cost-efficient systems were the natural-gas and oil boiler systems, followed by the heat pump and district heating systems, when the external cost and taxes were excluded. When including the external costs of CO2 emission, the wood-fuel-based systems were much more cost efficient than the fossil-fuel-based systems, also when CO2 capture and storage were applied. The external costs are, however, highly uncertain. Taxes steer towards lowering energy use and lowering CO2 emission if they are levied solely on all the fossil-fuel-related emission and fuel use in the systems. If consumer electricity and heat taxes are used, the taxes have an impact on the total cost, regardless of the fuel used, thereby benefiting fuel-based local heating systems. The heat pump systems were the least affected by taxes, due to their high energy efficiency. The electric boiler systems were the least cost-efficient systems, also when the external cost and taxes were included. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Polypropylene bottles and laminated flexible pouches were used. Ascorbic acid loss, colour, viscosity and sensory characteristics were measured during storage at 0-15 °C. Ascorbic acid degradation rates were lower for high pressurised juice, leading to an extension of its shelf life compared to conventionally pasteurised juice. Kinetic modelling established a higher temperature dependence of ascorbic acid loss for high pressurised juice as expressed by activation energy values (61.1 and 43.8 kJ/mol respectively for high pressurised and thermally treated bottled juice). Based on ascorbic acid retention, the increase of shelf life of high pressurised juice stored in bottles compared to thermally pasteurised one ranged from 11% (storage at 15 °C) to 65% (storage at 0 °C). Respective values of shelf life increase for juices in pouches were 24% and 57%. Colour was not substantially affected by type of processing.

The catalyst layer was superheated in the liquid-film state, which gave much higher hydrogen evolution rates and conversions at 210°C than those in the suspended state. Requirements concerning high-evolution rates of hydrogen or high-power densities for practical fuel-cell vehicle operations would be fulfilled enough at around 280°C.

The solar wind MHD generator is an unique energy source for all magnetospheric processes. Field-aligned currents directly transport the energy and momentum of the solar wind plasma to the Earth's ionosphere. The magnetospheric lobe and plasma sheet convection generated by the solar wind is another magnetospheric energy source. Plasma sheet particles and cold ionospheric polar wind ions are accelerated by convection electric field. After energetic particle precipitation into the upper atmosphere the solar wind energy is transferred into the ionosphere and atmosphere. This way of the energy transfer can include the tail lobe magnetic field energy storage connected with the increase of the tail current during the southward IMF. After that the magnetospheric substorm occurs. The model calculations of the magnetospheric energy give possibility to determine the ground state of the magnetosphere, and to calculate relative contributions of the tail current, ring current and field-aligned currents to the magnetospheric energy. The magnetospheric substorms and storms manifest that the permanent solar wind energy transfer ways are not enough for the covering of the solar wind energy input into the magnetosphere. Nonlinear explosive processes are necessary for the energy transmission into the ionosphere and atmosphere. For understanding a relation between substorm and storm it is necessary to take into account that they are the concurrent energy transferring ways.","Magnetospheric energy; Solar wind-magnetosphere interactions","astronomy; atmosphere; calculation; conference paper; energy transfer; magnetic field; magnetism; nonlinear system",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142027536

A two-step reaction path that involves the reaction of gaseous CO with the oxygen species of PdO (pre-oxidized supported palladium particles in the 500-700°C range) and of the back-spillover of the oxygen process from ceria to the oxygen vacant sites of surface PdO has been proven to better describe the outlet CO pulse transient response and the experimentally measured quantity of OSC (μatoms of O/g) obtained in a CSTR microreactor. With the proposed mathematical model, the transient rates of the CO oxidation reaction and of the back-spillover of the oxygen process can be calculated. In the 500-700°C range, the transient rate of CO oxidation was always greater than that of the back-spillover of oxygen. The ratio, ρ, of the maximum CO oxidation rate to the maximum back-spillover of the oxygen rate was found to decrease with increasing reaction temperature in the 500-700°C range. In particular, at 500 and 700°C the value of ρ was found to be 1.6 and 1.2, respectively. The present mathematical model allows also the calculation of the intrinsic rate constant k1 (s-1) of the Eley-Rideal step for the reaction of gaseous CO with surface oxygen species of PdO to form CO 2. An activation energy of 9.2 kJ/mol was estimated for this reaction step. In addition, an apparent rate constant k2 app (s-1) was estimated for the process of back-spillover of oxygen. The ratio of the two rate constants (k1/k2 app) was found to be greater than 100 in the 500-700°C range. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood surface elementary reaction step of adsorbed CO with atomic oxygen of PdO failed to describe the experimental transient kinetics of CO oxidation in the 500-700°C range. The results of the present work provide the means for a better understanding of the effects of various additives and contaminants present in a three-way commercial catalytic converter and other related model catalysts on their OSC kinetic behavior. In addition, intrinsic effects of a given regeneration method for a commercial three-way catalyst on the OSC phenomenon could better be studied by making use of the results of the present mathematical model. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The bags were characterised by tensiometry (free energy and its polar and dispersed components) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) before and after various periods of storage of solutions for total parenteral nutrition containing L-aminoacids, electrolytes or glucose. In most of the cases, after storage of these solutions, tensiometric characterisation and atomic force microscopy analysis of the internal surface of bags showed deep modifications which highlight the adsorption of the solutes. The changes of surface characteristics were found to depend on the time of contact, the wettability of the polymer and the compounds present into the solutions, while their concentration has a negligible effect. Generally, the aminoacid solutions produced a higher increase in the polar component even after short storage times. Poly-ethylene and the copolymer ethylene-vinylacetate showed a greater inertia if compared with the poly-vinylchloride bags. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The polyesters possess a common cyanosubstituted azobenzene chromophore as a side chain, but differ in their main-chain polyester composition. Seventeen different polymers from the E1aX family divided into four classes, depending on the type of the main-chain substituent (one-, two-, and three-ring aromatic or alicyclic) have been thoroughly investigated. Various parameters characterizing the photoinduced birefringence in these materials, such as the response time, thermal and light stability, and long-term stability under ambient light at room temperature have been measured. Each of these parameters is quantitatively represented and therefore it is possible to make a clear comparison between the properties of the polymers. The results indicate that the long-term stability at ambient temperature is closely related to the thermal stability of the photoinduced birefringence. A strong correlation has also been found between the response time and the stability of the induced anisotropy toward illumination with unpolarized white light. One of the classes of E1aX polymers characterized by two-ring aromatic substituent in the main chain is a good candidate for optical data storage media. A recording energy of approximately 2 J/cm2is sufficient to induce high refractive-index modulations of Δn = 0.13 in these materials, which is retained even at elevated temperatures (&lt;130 °C). Long-term stability of greater than one year for the induced anisotropy has also been achieved. © 2003 Optical Society of America.",,"Anisotropy; Chromophores; Lighting; Polyesters; Refractive index; Photoinduced anisotropy; Optical data storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142093687

After UV irradiation, the adhesive strength of a PSA compositioning including a diacrylourethane oligomer (UDA) decreased drastically compared with other compositions. Because of network formation via UV irradiation, this composition had a greater volume contraction that might yield microvoids at the interface between the adhesive and the wafer, resulting in the loose adhesion. Its storage modulus increased up to about 1000 times that before UV curing, which was due to the crosslinking of the UDA component. It was suggested that the increased crosslinking density and the high internal coagulant energy of the UDA backbone structure caused a remarkable decrease of the adhesive strength. Furthermore, it was ascertained that the UV-irradiated UDA adhesives left few residual deposits on the wafer released from the tape.","Adhesive deposit; Dicing tape; Pressure-sensitive adhesives; Silicon wafer; UV curing","Adhesion; Composition; Crosslinking; Curing; Elastic moduli; Irradiation; Oligomers; Semiconductor device manufacture; Structure (composition); Ultraviolet radiation; Backbone structure; Crosslinking density; Diacrylourethane oligomer; Peelable dicing tapes; Pressure sensitive adhesives; Storage modulus; Plastic adhesives; polymer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042788761

The V films were deposited on silicon substrates covered by 100 nm thermal SiO2. For a few experiments sapphire substrates were used. Nitride formation at high temperatures (900 and 1100°C) and interface reactions and diffusion of oxygen out of the SiO 2-layer into the metal lattice at moderate temperatures (600 and 700°C) were studied. For characterisation complementary analytical methods were used: X-ray diffraction (XRD) for phase analysis, secondary neutral mass spectrometry (SNMS) and Rutherford Backscattering (RBS) for acquisition of depth profiles of V, N, O, C and Si, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in combination with electron energy filtering for imaging element distributions (EFTEM) and recording electron energy loss spectra (EELS) to obtain detailed information about the initial stages of nitride, oxide and oxynitride formation, respectively, and the microstructure and element distributions of the films. In these experiments the SiO2-layer acts as diffusion barrier for nitrogen and source for oxygen causing the formation of substoichiometric vanadium oxides and oxynitrides near the V/SiO2-interface primarily at temperatures ≤ 900°C. At a temperature of 1100°C just a small amount of oxynitride forms near the interface because rapid diffusion of nitrogen and fast formation of VN (diffusion barrier for oxygen) inhibit the outdiffusion of oxygen into the metal layer. In the 600°C regime, in argon atmosphere oxynitride phases observed in the surface region of these films originate from reaction of residual oxygen in the argon gas, whereas NH 3 as process gas does not lead to oxide or oxynitride formation at the surface (apart from the oxidation caused by storage). NH3 seems to support the diffusion of oxygen out of the SiO2-layer. During the decomposition of ammonia at higher temperatures hydrogen is formed, which could attack the SiO2. In contrast, sapphire substrates do not act as oxygen source in the 600°C regime and change the nitridation behaviour of the vanadium films.","Interface reaction (V/SiO2); Nitridation; Oxynitride; Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP); SNMS depth profile; TEM/EELS; Vanadium nitride","ammonia; argon; carbon; chemical compound; nitrogen; oxygen; sapphire; silicon; silicon dioxide; unclassified drug; vanadium derivative; vanadium nitride; analytic method; article; chemical reaction; electron energy loss spectroscopy; film; high temperature procedures; mass spectrometry; nitridation; stoichiometry; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141763682

In this work we compare several polyfluorenes with respect to their stability against degradation, namely a poly(9,9 dialkylfluorene) with two hexahydrofarnesyl sidebranches (PF 111/12), a slightly branched PF 2/6 with tetrabromospiro(fluorene-9,9′-fluorene) as branch (PF A193) and the same polyfluorene with triphenylamine endcappers (PF A207). The degradation of these polymers upon storage at an elevated temperature in vacuum and in air is compared using PL and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. We find that the stability of the spiro-type PFs is significantly improved compared to the regular PF. Essentially the same trend is observed in operated devices. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, these two signals eventually trigger quite different metabolic pathways. Hypoxia induces glycolysis, resulting in anaerobic ATP production, while insulin increases glycolysis for energy storage. Hypoxia-induced gene expression is mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) that consists of HIF-1α and the aromatic hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (Arnt). Hypoxia-induced gene expression is initiated by the stabilization of the HIF-1α subunit. Here we investigated whether insulin-induced gene expression also requires stabilization of HIF-1α. Our results indicate that hypoxia but not insulin stabilizes HIF-1α protein levels, whereas both insulin- and hypoxia-induced gene expression require the presence of the Arnt protein. Insulin treatment fails to inactivate proline hydroxylation of HIF-1α, which triggers recruitment of the von Hippel-Lindau protein and oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF-1α. Insulin-induced gene expression is inhibited by the presence of the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and the dominant negative mutant of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, whereas hypoxia-induced gene expression is not. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a scavenger of H2O2, reduces insulin-induced gene expression but not hypoxia-induced gene expression. Although both hypoxia and insulin induce the expression of common target genes through a hypoxia-responsive element- and Arnt-dependent mechanism, insulin cannot stabilize the HIF-1α protein. We believe that insulin activates other putative partner proteins for Arnt in PI 3-kinase- and H2O 2-dependent pathways.",,"Enzymes; Genes; Insulin; Metabolism; Hypoxia; Biochemistry; 2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; adenosine triphosphate; aromatic hydrocarbon; dithiocarbamic acid derivative; glycolytic enzyme; hydrogen peroxide; hypoxia inducible factor 1; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; insulin; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor; proline; protein p85; pyrrolidine derivative; scavenger; tumor suppressor protein; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; von hippel lindau protein; aerobic metabolism; animal cell; article; controlled study; energy transfer; gene expression; gene targeting; glycolysis; human; human cell; hydroxylation; hypoxia; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear localization signal; priority journal; protein degradation; protein stability; signal transduction; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; 3T3 Cells; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Anoxia; Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator; Base Sequence; Blotting, Northern; Blotting, Western; Cell Line; Cell Nucleus; Chromones; Cobalt; Dimerization; DNA-Binding Proteins; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Genes, Dominant; Glutathione Transferase; Glycolysis; Hela Cells; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Insulin; Ligases; Luciferases; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Morpholines; Mutation; Plasmids; Pyrrolidines; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; RNA; Thiocarbamates; Time Factors; Transcription Factors; Transfection; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases; Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141643339

He notes that sodium-borohydrides have far greater hydrogen absorption potential than conventional metal hydrides, NaBH4, which can generate up to 10.8 percent of hydrogen by hydrolysis on a weight basis. Although Suda believes Japan is the world's most advanced country in fuel cell technology, particularly in the automotive sector, he expects the U.S. to come ahead in hydrogen storage technology.",,"Absorption; Fuel cells; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Hydrolysis; Japan; Sodium compounds; Materials Energy Research Institute (MERIT); Metal hydrides; Pressurized hydrogen storage systems; Automotive industry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448960871

The SMB was expected to be applied to the electric power storage flywheel system because no friction causes the rotation speed degradation and decreases the energy storage capability. However, it was found that the electromagnetic friction of the SMB was not zero, due to electromagnetic forces; (1) the magnetic force interaction between the inhomogeneous magnetic field of the PM rotor and the eddy current it induces in the cryostat, (2) the magnetic force between the inhomogeneous magnetic field of the PM rotor and the shielding current it induces in the superconductor, (3) the magnetic force between the magnetic field of superconductors yielding the levitation force and the eddy current induced in the PM rotor. The magnetic field of superconductor is inhomogeneous too, because the superconductors consist of several HTSC bulks. We improved the PM rotor and succeed in suppressing the rotation speed degradation by inhomogeneous magnetic field of HTSC bulks by preventing the eddy current with many insulator thin films in the PM rotor [Trans. Supercond. (in press)]. On the other hand, the rotation speed degradation by inhomogeneous magnetic field of the PM rotor have not been able to be removed. The induced eddy currents generate temperature rise with Joule heat in HTSC bulks. Therefore we are able to estimate the rotation speed degradation by evaluating the temperature rise. Furthermore temperature rise can cause inhomogeneous magnetic field because physical properties is varied by it. The purpose of this research is to develop the electromagnetic field analysis method coupled with thermal analysis. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The TSDC spectra in general comprise of three maxima namely β, β′ and α with their respective location around 35, 122 and 155°C. The β-peak has been attributed to the dipolar orientation relaxation of PET rich phase. The α-peak has been ascribed to the space charge relaxation. A major contribution towards α-relaxation comes from PHB-rich phase and the cold crystallization of PET-rich phase. The presence of a rigid amorphous phase (γ-relaxation) appears to affect the true nature of α-peak. A high temperature maxima around 190°C in TSDC spectra of high temperature poled samples is due to melting (δ-relaxation). The β′-peak is ascribed to the extremely fast reacting dipoles of PHB and PET phase.

The primary purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the significant negative impacts that a minor deficiency in the parameterization of canopy evaporation may have on offline and coupled land surface model simulations. In this research, using the offline NCAR Land Surface Model (LSM) and the locally coupled NCAR Single-column Community Climate Model (SCCM) as examples, intensive effort has been focused on the exploration of the mechanisms involved in the activation of unrealistically high canopy evaporation and thus unreasonable surface energy partitions because of a minor deficiency in the parameterization of canopy evaporation. The main causes responsible for exacerbating the impacts of the deficiency of the land surface model through the coupling of the two components are analyzed, along with possible impacts of land surface parameters in triggering the problems. Results from experimental runs show that, for a large number of randomly generated physically realistic land surface parameter sets, this model deficiency has caused the occurrences of negative canopy water with a significantly high frequency for both the offline NCAR LSM and the coupled NCAR SCCM, suggesting that land surface parameters are not the only important factors in triggering the problems associated with the model deficiency. In addition, the concurrence of intense solar radiation and enough precipitation is identified to be mainly responsible for exacerbating the negative impacts of the parameterization deficiency. Finally, a simple adjustment has been made in this study to effectively prevent the occurrences of negative canopy water storages, leading to significantly improved model performances.",,"evaporation; land surface; latent heat flux; numerical model; parameterization; surface flux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344286971

Of these, the closed loop type thermosyphon system, which hires the concept of a wickless heat pipe, is extensively studied in the present analysis. The system under consideration consists of a rectangular shape solar collector and a circular cylindrical shape storage tank, the most common design of a natural circulation type SDHWS. A closed circulation loop runs through these units carrying heat from the collector to the storage tank. The working fluid (heat transfer medium) makes infinite number of roundtrips via this loop as long as the sun's energy hit the collector area and delivers the fuel needed for the trip. This paper reports the experimental results obtained in a series of tests where the operational characteristics of various working fluids are examined along with the whole performance of the system. The working fluids experimented in the present study are ethanol, water, and a binary mixture of ethanol and water(ethanol/water). Various amounts of working fluid were tested where the working fluid occupies 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% or 70% of the loop volume. Among these, in the cases of 30% and 40%, dry-out phenomena were observed. Also investigated in this study were the flow patterns and the mechanism of heat transfer within the loop. Flow patterns of the binary mixture of working fluid near the entry of the storage tank were analyzed where they were recorded with the aid of a high speed camera. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Binary mixtures; Ethanol; Flow patterns; Heat transfer; High speed cameras; Solar energy; Water; Thermosyphon systems; Solar collectors; heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242381279

Raw humic, epihumic, and endohumic horizons of four acidic sandy forest soils were selected for this study. Specific areas and water adsorption energies were estimated from water vapor adsorption isotherms, micropore (nanometer range) parameters from desorption isotherms, mesopore (micrometer range) parameters from mercury intrusion porosimetry, and macropore (millimeter range) parameters from water retention curves measured using combined suction plate and pressure chamber methods. In the studied soils, pore volumes in all pore ranges were proportional to soil organic matter content. Thin column wicking technique was used to determine migration velocity vs. time dependence in the samples beds for a range of liquids of various surface tensions. From these dependencies the surface free energy and its components were estimated that were used for calculation of water contact angles and forces of interparticle interaction via a water meniscus. The dominant interactions in the studied soils were dispersive Lifshitz-Van der Waals forces. In the two upper horizons polar acid-base interactions were absent, however in the deepest horizons, high input of polar interactions occurred, due practically to electron-donor component of the surface free energy. The electron-acceptor contribution was low. The wettability of the soils was low in upper horizons as indicated by high water contact angles.","Porosity; Sandy soils; Surface free energy; Water retention; Wettability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242339535

In this note, we prove that for a class of RLC circuits with convex energy function and weak electromagnetic coupling it is possible to ""add a differentiation"" to the port terminals preserving passivity - with a new storage function that is directly related to the circuit power. The result is of interest in circuits theory, but also has applications in control as it suggests the paradigm of power shaping stabilization as an alternative to the well-known method of energy shaping. We show in this note that, in contrast with energy shaping designs, power shaping is not restricted to systems without pervasive dissipation and naturally allows to add ""derivative"" actions in the control. These important features, that stymie the applicability of energy shaping control, make power shaping very practically appealing. To establish our results we exploit the geometric property that voltages and currents in RLC circuits live in orthogonal spaces, i.e., Tellegen's theorem, and heavily rely on the seminal paper of Brayton and Moser in 1964.","Nonlinear control; Passivity; Stability theory","Capacitors; Electric currents; Electric inductors; Electric potential; Nonlinear control systems; Partial differential equations; Resistors; Electromagnetic coupling; Energy balancing control; Orthogonal spaces; Passivity-based control; Power shaping; Control system analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242333996

Humphry Davy is often credited with the discovery of the arc discharge, which later led to the development of the carbon arc lamp. Indeed, as early as 1800, he obtained short pulsed arcs with his Voltaic pile. Independently, and earlier than Davy in the sense of continuous discharges, the Russian Vasilii Petrov of St. Petersburg made carbon arcs in 1802. Petrov used a pile of 4200 electrochemical cells to drive what was the most powerful discharge at that time. Petrov's publication of 1803 appeared only in Russian, and his work was ignored and forgotten for over a century. Davy pursued highly successful electrochemical experiments and was unaware of Petrov's work. He increased the size of his battery in several steps, which led to increasingly powerful discharges, most likely an undesired side effect. After 1808, using the new battery of the Royal Institution, Davy demonstrated continuous arc discharges. The exact dates and circumstances of early arc demonstrations around 1810 are still the subject of research, but later arc experiments such as those at the London Institution of 1821 are well documented. While Petrov could claim priority for continuous carbon arcs, it was Davy who made a lasting impact on further development.","Arcs; Carbon arc lamp; Electrochemical cell; History; Humphry davy; Vasilii petrov; Voltaic battery","Arc lamps; Electric arcs; Electric energy storage; Electrochemistry; Arc plasma science; Carbon arc lamp; Continuous discharges; Voltaic battery; Plasma theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242323724

Methods: Parecoxib sodium for injection is a lyophilized product for single use. It is intended for the management of acute pain. Six diluent types were initially evaluated for physical compatibility with PSI. Reconstituted PSI was visually inspected at 8, 24 and 48 h after reconstitution with 0.9% sodium chloride injection (NS), lactated ringers injection (LR), bacteriostatic 0.9% NaCl injection (BNS), lactated ringers and 5% dextrose injection (LR + D5W), 5% dextrose injection (D5W), and 5% dextrose + 0.45% NaCl injection (D5W + 1/2NS). Reconstituted PSI, stored in glass vials and glass or plastic syringes at 5° and 25°C, under 500 lx light intensity for 48 h or subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, were tested for chemical stability by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: The PSI reconstituted with NS, BNS, D5W, and D5W + 1/2NS met visual acceptance criteria and showed almost no (<0.5% total) degradation under all storage conditions. No significant differences were seen between storage in glass vials or polypropylene/glass syringes. PSI reconstituted with LR and LR + D5W showed visual precipitation in many vials which was confirmed by the decrease in the HPLC assay values at all time points. The needlelike crystals (precipitate), analyzed by Infrared Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (SEM-EDS) analyses, were identified as the free acid form of the active drug. Conclusion: PSI is stable after reconstitution, with NS, BNS, D5W, and D5W + 1/2NS, when stored at room temperature in glass vials or glass/plastic syringes for up to 48 h* LR and LR + D5W are not recommended for reconstitution because of crystallization of the drug (free acid).","Dynastat; Parecoxib; Reconstitution","diluent; glass; glucose; parecoxib; polypropylene; Ringer lactate solution; sodium chloride; article; drug packaging; drug stability; drug storage; high performance liquid chromatography; light intensity; pain; syringe; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Drug Stability; Drug Storage; Injections; Isoxazoles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242298779

In each case variation mapped away from the enzyme-encoding loci, indicating that trans-acting regions of the genome are important sources of variation within the metabolic network. Individual QTL associated with variation in metabolic rate and flight performance explained between 9 and 35% of the phenotypic variance. Bayesian QTL analysis identified epistatic effects underlying variation in flight velocity, metabolic rate, glycogen content, and several metabolic enzyme activities. A region on the third chromosome was associated with expression of the glucose-6-phosphate branchpoint enzymes and with metabolic rate and flight performance. These genomic regions are of special interest as they may coordinately regulate components of energy metabolism with effects on whole-organism physiological performance.

A GCFR concept derived from the symbiosis of the British advanced gas-cooled reactor and the prototype fast reactor technologies is reviewed. Application of the reactor would permit the continued growth of plutonium to cease and the stocks of depleted uranium already mined would sustain a large fleet of such reactors indefinitely. The GCFR has high potential for the incineration of the ultra-long-term heavy metal waste arising from fuel processing. Reports of exciting GCFR possibilities, covering a spectrum of developments - from coated particle fuel to direct cycle gas turbines are to be found in the literature and in the archives. The secure platform of experiences with the AGR would permit advances to be made in the use of nuclear fuel in ways that have never been undertaken before - to release the vast energy from the uranium already mined with an ability to reduce substantially the plutonium and other long-term metallic waste that would otherwise be consigned to deep storage for disposal.

A supply of stored food is beneficial during periods when food is scarce, but building up and managing such a supply also entails costs. The optimal number of caches will be reached when the net benefit is at its maximum. If dominants can steal more stored food from subordinates than the other way around, the optimum will differ between these categories. A previous theoretical model of hoarding in groups with dominant and subordinate members produced three testable predictions: (1) hoarders should store more food as anticipated future conditions get worse; (2) subordinate flock members should store more food than dominants; and (3) dominants should increase hoarding relatively more than subordinates as conditions get worse. Here we present a field experiment on willow tits (Parus montanus) designed to test these predictions. We found support for all three.

Recent findings: Altered macrophage functions contribute to the pathogenesis of many infectious, immunological and inflammatory disease processes. Pharmacological modulation of macrophage gene expression therefore represents an important strategy for the prevention and treatment of inflammation-related diseases, such as atherosclerosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors are lipid-activated transcription factors that control lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, glucose and energy homeostasis, as well as cellular differentiation and proliferation. Recent data suggest that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ activators may decrease the incidence of cardiovascular disease, not only by correcting metabolic disorders, but also by directly acting at the level of the vascular wall. In this context, ligand-activated peroxisome proliferator- activated receptors control cellular functions by regulating gene expression in different cell types, including monocytes, macrophages and foam cells. Summary: These findings identify the crucial roles of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors in macrophages, improving the comprehension of the patho-physiological mechanisms of atherogenesis. Moreover, a scientific rationale for the evaluation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activators in the treatment of inflammatory disorders such as atherosclerosis is thus provided. © 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Atherosclerosis; Inflammation; Lipid homeostasis; Nuclear receptors","cholesterol; glucose; ligand; linoleic acid; lipid; lipoprotein; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; pioglitazone; transcription factor; troglitazone; unclassified drug; atherogenesis; atherosclerosis; blood vessel wall; cardiovascular disease; cell differentiation; cell function; cell proliferation; cell type; cholesterol metabolism; drug conjugation; drug effect; drug mechanism; drug targeting; energy; foam cell; gene expression; gene expression regulation; gene function; genetic analysis; glucose metabolism; homeostasis; human; immunopathology; incidence; infection; inflammation; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipoprotein metabolism; macrophage; metabolic disorder; monocyte; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein targeting; respiratory burst; review; Animals; Arteriosclerosis; Cholesterol; Foam Cells; Gene Expression Regulation; Homeostasis; Humans; Inflammation; Lipid Metabolism; Macrophages; Monocytes; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Respiratory Burst; Transcription Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142093152

An enhanced shear in poloidal phase velocity was found in the same region with reduction of the fluctuation levels and the coherences between fluctuations. The results suggest that the improved confinement in the IBW and LHCD plasma is at least partially due to the modification of shear in poloidal velocity and then the suppression of fluctuations and fluctuation induced fluxes via de-correlation effect.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142022047

Etching of trenches suffers from a dynamic reactive ion etching (RIE) lag mechanism caused by constriction of trench openings during the etch process. Also, at high aspect ratios (accentuated by constriction of trench openings), reduced ion energy and etchant species flux to the trench bottom (etch front) results in slower etch rates leading to etch stop. This dynamic RIE lag effect and potential etch stop pose significant challenges towards obtaining deeper trenches. In this paper, two methods are proposed to minimize these problems. Short duration cleaning steps, predominantly etching in nature without any builtin deposition component, are used intermittently during the multistep etching sequence. Mask selectivity is preserved as these cleaning steps do not contribute significantly to the mask etch rate. The first method decreases the constriction of the trench opening by thinning the sidewall deposition, thus partially restoring the design dimension of the trench opening. The second method removes the etch-stop or blocking layer at the bottom of the trench without significantly contributing to sidewall thinning. These methods increase the differential etch rate of silicon at high aspect ratios, thereby help achieve the higher silicon depths required to meet the manufacturing process tool utilization targets. © 2003 The Electrochemical Society.

As a type of custom power device devoid of any significant energy-storage capability, the process of voltage restoration by the regulator has to depend on the power in-feed from an external supply system. As a consequence, the analysis shows that there are inherent limits imposed on the device for achieving successful voltage restoration. Pertinent expressions are derived which relate the limits to the parametric values describing the supply system and loads. When the expressions are used in conjunction with a proposed computational procedure, a method to determine suitable regulator design for the purpose of power quality enhancement is obtained.","Phase angle shift; Power quality enhancement; Step-dynamic voltage regulator; Voltage magnitude","Computational methods; Electric network synthesis; Electric power factor correction; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy storage; Phase shift; Voltage control; Phase angle shift; Power quality enchancement; Step dynamic voltage regulators; Voltage magnitude; Voltage restoration; Voltage regulators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141986751

Unexpectedly, we identified a large cluster of genes that are (1) maximally expressed only in the mature nerve, after myelination is complete, and (2) tied to the metabolism of storage (energy) lipids. Many of these late-onset genes are expressed by adipocytes, which we find constitute the bulk of the epineurial compartment of the adult nerve. However, several such genes, including SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and Lpin1, are also expressed in the endoneurium. We find that Lpin1 null mutations lead to lipoatrophy of the epineurium, and to the dysregulation of a battery of genes required for the regulation of storage lipid metabolism in both the endoneurium and peri/epineurium. Together with the observation that these mutations also result in peripheral neuropathy, our findings demonstrate a crucial role for local storage lipid metabolism in mature peripheral nerve function, and have important implications for the understanding and treatment of peripheral neuropathies that are commonly associated with metabolic diseases such as lipodystrophy and diabetes.","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; Fat metabolism; Microarray analysis; Peripheral nerve development; Peripheral neuropathy; Schwann cells","adipocyte; animal cell; animal tissue; article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; DNA microarray; gene; gene cluster; gene expression; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipodystrophy; lpin 1 gene; mouse; myelination; nerve growth; nonhuman; peripheral nerve; peripheral neuropathy; priority journal; sciatic nerve; srebp 1 gene; srebp 2 gene; Adipocytes; Animals; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Mice, Mutant Strains; Multigene Family; Mutation; Myelin Sheath; Nuclear Proteins; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Sciatic Nerve; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2; Transcription Factors; Animalia; Eukaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141594942

The figures of merit in these applications are different from those that guide most adsorbent design processes today. A quantity to be optimized is the total sorptive heat stored over a cycle period rather than selectivity or total adsorption capacity. This optimization requires a detailed understanding of the link between cycle thermodynamics and microscopic adsorbent characteristics. We show that a simple statistical Langmuir model of adsorption is sufficient to analyze some of the key relationships. The influence of energetic heterogeneity on cycle performance is analyzed in a model system in relation to the energy and entropy change upon adsorption. For a homogeneous system of monoenergetic adsorption sites, it is shown that for each value of the adsorbed state entropy there is an optimal adsorbent-adsorbate interaction energy. Further, the largest possible entropy change upon adsorption is generally desired. When the model is extended to energetically heterogeneous adsorbents, it is shown that in many but not all cases heterogeneity is deleterious.",,"Entropy; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Statistical methods; Adsorption capacity; Adsorption; adsorbent; Adsorption; heat pump; Heat transfer; industrial application; Thermodynamics; adsorption; article; energy; entropy; freezing; heat transfer; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141566560

State diagrams were constructed from real experimental results that described the glass transition and melting curves for starch and proteins as a function of water content. Wheat gluten protein is the main component responsible for bread dough structural formation, while starch is mainly involved in final textural properties and stability. During processing, hydration of wheat flour induces the glass transition of wheat gluten proteins. The input of mechanical energy during the mixing allows the development of continuous viscoelastic dough due to interactions between rubbery proteins. During baking, irreversible modifications of starch and proteins at high temperatures (> 200 °C) and superficial dehydration are responsible for bread crust formation. In the central part of the mixture, starch gelatinization and protein coagulation induce breadcrumb formation. After cooling, the low water content of the crust (3-7%) is sufficient for the transition of bread components from the rubbery to the glassy state. Consequently, structural hardening occurs and is responsible for crust crispness. The higher final water content of the crumb (35-40%) is responsible for rubbery behaviour, which gives structural mobility, smooth breadcrumb behaviour and explains the sensitiveness to starch retrogradation during storage.","Gelatinization; Glass transition; Gluten; Starch; Texture","State diagrams; Coagulation; Glass transition; Hydration; Proteins; Starch; Viscoelasticity; Food products; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141541661

It is involved in the regulation of fat deposition and energy expenditure and in other functions, such as reproduction. The presence of leptin has been reported in several reproductive organs. However, few studies have addressed its expression in the ovary. Moreover, the existing information is not consistent with regard to the particular cell types responsible for leptin expression. In this work we studied the distribution of leptin in the rat ovary by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH). Leptin staining was found in steroid-producing cells: thecal, luteal, and interstitial cells. The strongest signal with both techniques was found in the cytoplasm of oocytes. A weak reaction for leptin mRNA was detected in granulosa of all growing follicles, although leptin protein was found only in the mature follicle. Western blotting analysis detects a strongly reactive 16-kD band, giving further support to the presence of leptin in the rat ovary. Variations in this immunoreactive band were found throughout the estrous cycle. Localization of leptin in the ovary may contribute to a better understanding of female reproductive function.","Corpora lutea; Estrous cycle; Follicular cells; Immunohistochemistry; In situ hybridization; Interstitial gland; Leptin; Oocyte; Ovary; Western blotting","leptin; messenger RNA; adipocyte; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; corpus luteum; cytoplasm; energy expenditure; estrus cycle; female; genital system; granulosa cell; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization; Leydig cell; lipid storage; luteal cell; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oocyte; ovary; ovary follicle; priority journal; rat; reproduction; theca cell; Western blotting; Animalia; Fallopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141507841

SOMA involves the chemical preparation of self-assembled arrays of alloyed nanoparticles (such as FePt), which can be subsequently annealed to form an L10 high magnetocrystalline anisotropy chemically ordered phase. However, during the anneal of the nanoparticles the system can further lower its energy by the elimination of surface area which is brought about by another solid-state reaction which is sintering. Therefore, the combined reactions of ordering and sintering must be understood in a systematic way. Previous work on L1 0 bulk alloys are reviewed with particular emphasis on the role of combined reactions such as ordering and recrystallization. A methodology is described to help in the understanding of combined reactions involving ordering and solid-state reactions concerning the elimination of crystalline defects such as dislocations, grain boundaries and external surfaces. As a first attempt, this framework based on bulk solid-state reactions is developed and further discussed for the case of SOMA nanoparticles. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Self-assembly of procollagen and its final processing into collagen fibrils occurs extracellularly. The formation of crosslinked collagen fibers results in the conversion of weak liquid-like embryonic tissues to tough elastic solids that can store energy and do work. Collagen fibers in the form of fascicles are the major structural units found in tendon. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on collagen self-assembly and tendon development and to relate this information to the development of elastic energy storage in non-mineralizing and mineralizing tendons. Of particular interest is the mechanism by which energy is stored in tendons during locomotion. In vivo, collagen self-assembly occurs by the deposition of thin fibrils in recesses within the cell membrane. These thin fibrils later grow in length and width by lateral fusion of intermediates. In vitro, collagen self-assembly occurs by both linear and lateral growth steps with parallel events seen in vivo; however, in the absence of cellular control and enzymatic cleavage of the propeptides, the growth mechanism is altered, and the fibrils are irregular in cross section. Results of mechanical studies suggest that prior to locomotion the mechanical response of tendon to loading is dominated by the viscous sliding of collagen fibrils. In contrast, after birth when locomotion begins, the mechanical response is dominated by elastic stretching of crosslinked collagen molecules. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The practical use of SMES at field sites requires ensuring its reliability, as well as reducing costs with minimum component set-ups. In order to quantitatively verify its reliability and performance limit, two kinds of tests were conducted on ESK: a long-term and over-load operation. In the long-term operation test, a DC500 triangle waveform up to 1000 A was applied to ESK 10,000 times. Further, the compensation ability for distribution line load fluctuation was observed for three days. The results revealed that ESK functioned adequately and in a stable manner. In the other test, a power output 1.2 times that of the rated output was attained, along with an energy storage capacity 1.44 times the rated value. This allowed us to confirm the over-load operation limit of ESK. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The transfer current exceeded the previous value of 13.5 A at 77 K in the contact when the sample surfaces were carefully polished.

To avoid extra energy costs by using cooling systems the internal climate of potato bulk stores is controlled with outdoor air. A conventionally designed controller is difficult to adapt for an optimal climate control to reduce quality loss. However, a controller designed with fuzzy logic is found as advantageous for adapting control parameters to improve the control process. A test stand is built to ventilate and to control two samples of potato bulks simultaneously with the same outdoor weather conditions for comparisons. Several experiments were carried out to compare climate controllers with different control algorithms, i.e. conventional to a different conventional and conventional to fuzzy. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The electrochemical double-layer (ECDL) capacitor is a new type of capacitor with features intermediate between those of a battery and a conventional capacitor. ECDL capacitors have been made using various types of CNT and activated carbon (a-C) as electrode material. The specific capacitance per surface area of the electrodes depends on the thickness and the specific surface area of the active material. The CNT electrodes show a specific capacitance from 0.8 and 280 mF cm-2 and 8 to 16 F cm-3, respectively. Increasing the mass density also helps to increase the capacitance. Commercially available activated carbon (a-C) electrodes were also tested in order to study their specific capacitance as a function of their physical properties. The various a-C electrodes have specific capacitance per surface area ranging from 0.4 to 3.1 F cm-2 and an average specific capacitance per volume of 40 F cm-3 due to their larger mass density. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Four environmental test chambers with different thermal mass levels were monitored under different ceiling types in Nairobi, Kenya, during the warm period between January and March 1997. Walling for two test chambers was natural stone while for the other two was timber paneling. Further to this, roofing for two test chambers was heavy concrete tile while for the other two was lightweight galvanized corrugated iron (GCI) sheets. The effect of thermal mass in lowering the maximum indoor daytime temperatures was evaluated. The low mass test chambers closely followed outdoor conditions and did not offer any significant thermal storage. All the light-mass test chambers without ceilings recorded small effect on the indoor maxima. However, high thermal mass was very effective in lowering indoor maximum temperatures below the high outdoor maxima. On a hot day in February, when maximum outdoor temperature was over 33 °C (91 °F), the indoor maximum temperature in high mass building was 25.4 °C (77.7 °F), which is within the comfort zone. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Box 200 Lilleaker, 0216 Oslo, Norway","This paper presents a method for the scheduling and operation of energy storage for wind power plants in electricity markets. A dynamic programming algorithm is employed to determine the optimal energy exchange with the market for a specified scheduling period, taking into account transmission constraints. During operation, the energy storage is used to smooth variations in wind power production in order to follow the scheduling plan. The method is suitable for any type of energy storage and is also useful for other intermittent energy resources than wind. An application of the method to a case study is also presented, where the impact of energy storage sizing and wind forecasting accuracy on system operation and economics are emphasized. Simulation results show that energy storage makes it possible for owners of wind power plants to take advantage of variations in the spot price, by thus increasing the value of wind power in electricity markets. With present price estimates, energy storage devices such as reversible fuel cells are likely to be a more expensive alternative than grid expansions for the siting of wind farms in weak networks. However, for areas where grid expansions lead to unwanted interference with the local environment, energy storage should be considered as a reasonable way to increase the penetration of wind power. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The microstructure of alloys with different X was a fine columnar structure as solidified at the high cooling rate of about 106 K s-1. XRD analysis revealed that over-stoichiometry alloys would segregate TiNi3 secondary phase as the X ≥ 0.4 and segregated Ni as the X ≥ 0.7. XRD analysis also indicated that the cell parameters were changed and the cell volume contracted with the X increased from 0 to 1.0. Electrochemical testing showed that the capacity of alloys Ml(NiCoMnTi)5+X were closely related to the X, and the capacity of alloys was decreased quickly from 310 to 155 mA h g-1 as the X increased from 0 to 1.0. But all of the alloys with different stoichiometry X were activated within 5 charging/discharging cycles. Cycle life of the alloy was greatly prolonged as the X increased. The capacity decay rate kept very small as the X reached above 0.7, which was ascribed to the small cell expansion and pulverization in charging/discharging process due to their small capacity. High rate dischargeability of alloys was obviously improved as the X increased due to the secondary phase, both Ni and/or TiNi3, segregated in the grain boundary to help to conduct the hydrogen atoms. Among the alloys Ml(NiCoMnTi)5+X investigated, Ml(NiCoMnTi)5.1(X = 0.1) had the best comprehensive electrochemical properties with high discharge capacity and longer cycle life and suitable for practical use in Ni/MH batteries. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

In this study we investigated the role of trehalose metabolism in nematodes, using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, and also identified complementary DNA clones putatively encoding genes involved in trehalose pathways in filarial nematodes. In C. elegans two putative trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (tps) genes encode the enzymes that catalyse trehalose synthesis and five putative trehalase (tre) genes encode enzymes catalysing hydrolysis of the sugar. We showed by RT-PCR or Northern analysis that each of these genes is expressed as mRNA at all stages of the C. elegans life cycle. Database searches and sequencing of expressed sequence tag clones revealed that at least one tps gene and two tre genes are expressed in the filarial nematode Brugia malayi, while one tps gene and at least one tre gene were identified for Onchocerca volvulus. We used the feeding method of RNA interference in C. elegans to knock down temporarily the expression of each of the tps and tre genes. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed that expression of each gene was silenced by RNA interference. We did not observe an obvious phenotype for any of the genes silenced individually but gas-chromatographic analysis showed >90% decline in trehalose levels when both tps genes were targeted simultaneously. This decline in trehalose content did not affect viability or development of the nematodes. © 2003 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to preserve the small bowel mucosal barrier by using oxygenated luminal perfusion with a proven amino acid (AA)-based solution. Methods. Rat small bowel (n=4) was flushed vascularly with modified University of Wisconsin solution and flushed luminally as follows: group 1, none (control); group 2, AA solution; group 3, 1-hr perfusion then storage with AA; group 4, continuous perfusion with AA. Energetics, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (reduced), and histology were assessed over 24 hr at 4°C. Results. Within 4 hr, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) dropped by 25% to 65% in all groups except for group 4, which remained unchanged from fresh tissue values throughout 12 hr. After 12 hr, ATP in groups 1 through 3 had dropped to 0.5 to 0.9 μmol/g, compared with 1.5 μmol/g for group 4. Even after 24 hr, group 4 levels were more than twofold greater than groups 1 through 3. MDA increased transiently in tissues subjected to simple flush (no perfusion), whereas levels in perfused tissues remained elevated throughout the 24-hr period. Glutathione in group 1 dropped by greater than 50% from fresh tissue values but increased over 24 hr in groups 2 and 3 by 50% to 55%. Overall, histologic injury was markedly less in groups 2 through 4; however, after 24 hr, the lowest injury was observed in group 3 (median, grade 2) compared with groups 1 and 4 (grades 7 and 4). Conclusions. Our data indicate that perfusion clearly improves tissue energetics. However, mucosal integrity is markedly superior, with only a brief 1-hr period of perfusion; oxidative and mechanical stress are the factors likely responsible for injury resulting from continuous perfusion.",,"adenosine triphosphate; amino acid; glutathione; malonaldehyde; University of Wisconsin solution; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; graft survival; histology; ileum; intestine graft; intestine mucosa; intestine transplantation; jejunum; lipid peroxidation; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; small intestine; Adenine Nucleotides; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Equipment Design; Intestinal Mucosa; Intestine, Small; Male; Models, Animal; Organ Preservation; Perfusion; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141544970

A SWNT sample was exposed to D2 or H2 at a pressure of 2 MPa for 1 h at 298 or 873 K. The desorption spectra were measured by thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). A main reversible desorption site was observed throughout the range 77 to 320 K. The activation energy of this peak at about 90 K was calculated assuming first-order desorption. This corresponds to physisorption on the surface of the SWNTs (19.2±1.2 kJ/mol). A desorption peak was also found for multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and also for graphite samples. The hydrogen desorption spectrum showed other small shoulders, but only for the SWNT sample. They are assumed to originate from hydrogen physisorbed at sites on the internal surface of the tubes and on various other forms of carbon in the sample. The nanosized metallic particles (Co:Ni) used for nanotube growth did not play any role in the physisorption of molecular hydrogen on the SWNT sample. Therefore, it is concluded that the desorption of hydrogen from nanotubes is related to the specific surface area of the sample. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","A. Carbon nanotubes; C.

Formal inversion of the observed flare frequency-energy distribution is shown to imply a distribution P(l) ∝ l-1 of the separator lengths in active regions. A simulation confirms the basic results of the model.

In nickel Schiff base complexes C-C σ bonds are formed upon reduction, while in nickel porphyrinogen complexes C-C σ bonds are formed upon oxidation. In both systems the formation or the cleavage of C-C bonds avoids a variation in the oxidation state of the metal. The lack of variation in the oxidation state of the metal is the first step towards the reversibility of the redox process. The complementary behaviour in redox processes of nickel Schiff base complexes and nickel porphyrinogen complexes can be considered in a reversible electrochemical cell with the discharge process based on C-C bonds breaking and the recharge based on C-C bonds formation. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the second period, the technique was essentially used to measure the two components of photochemical activity detected in the gas phase: energy storage (photothermal effect) and gas exchange (photobaric effect). In the third period, the time resolution and sensitivity of detection in liquid phase were significantly improved. In reviewing this last period, we shall focus on three aspects: conformation changes, thermodynamic parameters, and quantum yield spectra.","David Mauzerall; Electrostriction; Excitation energy transfer; Photoacoustics; Quantum yield spectra; René Delosme; Shmuel Malkin; Silvia E.

The previous paper erroneously rejected a set of sheet-prominence solutions, the recovery of which allows for a simple theoretical estimate of the mass of a quiescent prominence. For coronal fields of 5-10 G, these hydromagnetic solutions suggest that a prominence mass of (1-26) × 1016 g is needed to hold detached magnetic fields of intensity comparable to the coronal fields in an unbounded atmosphere such that the global magnetic field is energetically able to spontaneously open up and still have enough energy to account for the kinetic and gravitational potential energies carried away in a CME. This simple result is discussed in relation to observed prominence magnetic field intensities, densities, and masses, pointing to the relevance of such observations to the question of magnetic energy storage in the solar corona.","MHD; Sun: corona; Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs); Sun: prominences",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242593021

Such assumption is reasonable only for the regions dominated by short vegetation or for warm climates where snow processes are absent. The major goals of this paper are (i) modification of the latest version of SWAP by incorporation of tall vegetation into the cold-season parameterizations to make the model applicable for simulating heat and water transfer within a boreal forest biome and (ii) validation of the modified version using the data from a forested catchment located in the boreal zone. Modification of SWAP required to parameterize radiative and turbulent exchange between the forest crown and forest floor, partitioning snowfall between interception by the canopy (in doing so, snow interception differs from rain interception) and falling to the ground, formation of snow cover on the forest crown and forest floor including snow accumulation (both in solid and liquid fractions), snow evaporation, and snowmelt. The advanced model was validated using a set of hydrometeorological data measured during 18 years (1966-1983) at the Tayozhniy catchment (covered by boreal spruce forest), Valdai, Russia. Simulations of annual and monthly snow/rain interception, daily runoff at the catchment outlet, snow density, snow depth, snow water equivalent, soil water storage in three layers (0-20, 0-50 and 0-100 cm), and monthly evapotranspiration from the catchment were compared with observations. Analysis of the results of validation shows that the new version of the model SWAP reproduces the heat and water exchange processes occurring in mid-latitude boreal forest quite reasonable. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, only limited information is available about bone mineral density (BMD). Using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, we studied both cross-sectional and longitudinal lumbar spine areal BMD (BMDareal in g/cm2), areal BMD corrected for delayed bone maturation (BMDbone age in g/cm2), and volumetric BMD (BMDvol in g/cm3).

Our longitudinal study, showing a stable BMDareal but a trend to a decrease in BMDvol in prepubertal patients during follow-up, did not clarify whether the difference in BMD between prepubertal and adolescent/adult patients reflects a diminished accretion of BMD during childhood or reflects historical differences in treatment. In adolescent and adult GSD Ia patients, BMDareal and BMDvol were reduced but stable during follow-up. Especially patients with delayed bone maturation were at risk for reduced BMD. No correlation between parameters of metabolic control and BMD could be detected. Daily calcium intake was within recommended allowances ranges. Abnormal biochemical results included hypomagnesaemia (29%), hypercalciuria (34%) and reduced tubular resorption of phosphate (21%).

Methods: Twelve isolated pig hearts were subjected to a protocol consisting of 30 minutes of control perfusion, cardiac arrest, 12-hour cold storage at 1-2°C, and 1-hour reperfusion. The hearts in group 1 (n = 6) were arrested with modified, extracellular-type, UW solution while the hearts in group 2 (n = 6) were stopped with regular UW solution. Myocardial energy metabolites were monitored using 31P magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy throughout protocol. Results: 31P MR spectra showed no significant differences between the two groups in myocardial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr) during 12 hours of preservation. During reperfusion, however, the hearts in group 1 showed improved recovery in myocardial ATP, PCr, inorganic phosphate (Pi), and intracellular pH (pHi) relative to the hearts in group 2. Recovery of contractile function was also significantly better in group 1 than in group 2. Coronary resistance during reperfusion was significantly lower in group 1 (43.2 ± 4.2 mmHg.min.g/ml) than in group 2 (122 ± 21.9 mmHg.min.g/ml). Furthermore, the release of creatine kinase (CK) measured at early reperfusion was significantly less (P&lt;0.05) in the group 1 (82.4 ± 53 U/L) than in the group 2 (324 ± 143 U/L).

In general, the low energy transitions accompanying the T g of methylcellulose (MC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and hydroxypropylcelluloses of low (L-HPC) or medium-high (HPC) degree of substitution were difficult to characterize using DSC. Non-reversing heat flow signals obtained in TMDSC experiments were more sensitive. However, the best resolution was obtained using oscillatory rheometry since these cellulose ethers undergo considerable changes in their storage and loss moduli when reaching the Tg. Oscillatory rheometry also appears as a useful technique to characterize the viscoelastic behavior and thermal stability of pharmaceutical tablets. Tg values followed the order HPC (105°C)&lt;HPMC (170-198°C)&lt;MC (184-197°C)&lt;L-HPC (220°C). For HPMCs, the Tg increases as the methoxyl/hydroxypropoxyl content ratio decreases. The results indicate that Tg depends strongly on the structure of the cellulose ethers. In general, increasing the degree of substitution of cellulosic hydroxyls, the hydrogen bonding network of cellulose decreases (especially when the substituents cannot form hydrogen bonds) and, in consequence, Tg also decreases.","Glass transition; Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC); Hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC and L-HPC); Methylcellulose (MC); Modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC); Oscillatory rheometry","Cellulose; Differential scanning calorimetry; Glass transition; Hydrogen bonds; Hydroxylation; Oscillations; Rheometers; Annealing; Plasticizers; Sorption; Structure (composition); Substitution reactions; Thermodynamic stability; Viscoelasticity; Oscillatory rheometry; Modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC); Ethers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041881706

However, the matrix converter has some practical problems such as the necessity of the bi-directional power devices, necessity of special commutation sequence, and complexity of the control method. Thus, there are no practical systems in which the matrix converters are used. In this paper, the control strategy for matrix converters with basic configuration is investigated to realize the practical matrix converters. First of all, the necessity of the phase detector for the input voltage and the output current sensor is pointed out from the viewpoint of realization of the basic operation. With these sensors required in the basic configuration, the instantaneous control of the output current is realized. It is also pointed out that the three phase switching is effective to improve the input current waveforms. Some methods for implementation of the three phase switching are proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed control methods is confirmed by some experimental results employing a test system. © 2003, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Therefore, an energy storage medium that uses power efficiently and reduces above-mentioned problems is much concerned about. In recent years, development of energy storage medium is remarkable for drive-power supplies of electric vehicles. A number of applications of energy storage, for instance, battery and flywheel, have been investigated so far. A large-sealc electric double-layer capacitor which is rapidly charged and discharged and offers long life, maintenance-free, low pollution and high efficiency, has been developed in wide range. We have compared the ability to charge batteries and electric double-layer capacitors. Therefore, we carried out fundamental studies about electric double-layer capacitors and its control. And we produced a prototype of energy storage for the DC electric railway system that consists of electric double-layer capacitors, diode bridge rectifiers, chopper system and PWM converters. From the charge and discharge tests of the prototype, useful information was obtained. This paper describes its characteristics and experimental results of energy storage system. © 2003, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Passive pulse-shaping methods are often used. An alternative is to use switches to commutate energy from a storage medium into the load. The type of storage medium and the power levels used define the switch type. For capacitive storage, one requires a turn-on switch, for inductive storage, a turn-off switch is required, and for battery storage, a turn-on/turn-off switch is generally required. Such a system usually requires a staged energy transfer. In order to shape the pulse, either a final pulse-shaping stage can be included in the system or a modular system can be employed. This paper discusses the use of PWM to approximate the pulse shape as required. This allows the reduction of the number of modules and greater control over the discharge pulse shape. Results using a two-module system are presented and a comparison is made to a four-module system not using PWM.","Inductive Storage; Pulse Forming Network; Pulse Power; Pulse Width Modulation; PWM","Capacitive-storage based systems; Inductive storage; Pulse forming networks; Pulse power; Electric generators; Electric inductors; Electric potential; Energy transfer; Insulated gate bipolar transistors; Optimization; Pulse width modulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18444368672

The energy, environmental, and economic characteristics of fuel cell CHP systems are investigated for single-family residential applications. Hourly energy use profiles for electricity and thermal energy are determined for typical residential applications. A mathematical model of a residential fuel cell based CHP system is developed. The CHP system incorporates a fuel cell system to supply electricity and thermal energy, a vapor compression heat pump to provide cooling in the summer and heating in the winter, and a thermal storage tank to help match the available thermal energy to the thermal energy needs. The performance of the system is evaluated for different climates. Results from the study include an evaluation of the major design parameters of the system, load duration curves, an evaluation of the effect of climate on energy use characteristics, an assessment of the reduction in emissions, and a comparison of the life cycle cost of the fuel cell based CHP system to the life cycle costs of conventional residential energy systems. The results suggest that the fuel cell CHP system provides substantial energy and environmental benefits but that the cost of the fuel cell sub-system must be reduced to roughly $500/kWe before the system can be economically justified.","Cogeneration; Energy; Fuel cell; Heat; PEMFC; Power; Residential","Combined cycle power plants; Cooling; Costs; Electric power distribution; Environmental impact; Heat pump systems; Industrial economics; Mathematical models; Combined heat and power systems; Thermal energy; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842577115

Assessments of monetarized external impacts of the fusion fuel-cycle were previously performed (SERF1 and SERF2). Three different power plant designs were studied, with the main difference being the structural materials and cooling system used. In this third phase of the SERF project the external costs of three additional fusion power plant models using silicon carbide as structural material have been analysed. A comparison with other advanced generation technologies expected to be in use around 2050, when the first fusion power plant would be operative, has also been performed. These technologies include advanced fossil technologies, such as Natural Gas Combined Cycle, Pressurised Fluidised Bed Combustion and Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle with carbon sequestration technologies; fuel cells and renewable technologies including geothermal energy, wind energy and photovoltaic systems with energy storage devices. Fusion power plants using silicon carbide as structural material have higher efficiencies than plants using steel and this fact has a very positive effect on the external costs per kW h. These external costs are in the lowest range of the external costs of advanced generation technologies indicating the outstanding environmental performance of fusion power. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Specifically, noninvasive attacks using power and timing measurements to extract the cryptographic key have drawn a lot of negative publicity for smart card usage. The power measurement techniques rely on the data-dependent energy behaviour of the underlying system. Further, power analysis can be used to identify the specific portions of the program being executed to induce timing glitches that may in turn help to bypass key checking. Thus, it is important to mask the energy consumption when executing the encryption algorithms. The instruction set architecture of a simple five-stage pipelined smart card processor with secure instructions to mask the energy differences due to key-related data-dependent computations in DES and Rijndael encryptions is augmented. The secure versions operate on the normal and complementary versions of the operands simultaneously to mask the energy variations due to value-dependent operations. However, this incurs the penalty of increased overall energy consumption in the data-path components. Consequently, we employ secure versions of instructions only for critical operations; that is we use secure instructions selectively, as directed by an optimising compiler.

Past studies have shown that the cache is responsible for a large part of the power dissipation in a system chip. Thus, reducing the power dissipation in the cache has become an important research topic. In this paper, we present a cache architecture, the CoC, that reduces cache energy dissipation in embedded systems. The CoC can reduce the access frequency at wordlines and bitlines, which are the main power consuming components, in both tag and data arrays. In addition, we use a hierarchical address comparison (HAC) scheme to optimize energy reduction and the comparison time. Experimental results show that the CoC is practical in reducing energy dissipation in the L1 cache, and that the HAC scheme can effectively minimize the comparison penalty in the CoC.","CAM; Comparator; Data reuse; Hierarchical address; Low power cache; Power evaluation","Associative storage; Cache memory; Computer aided manufacturing; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Embedded systems; Real time systems; Cache architecture; Hierarchical address comparison; Power dissipation; Computer architecture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344065043

The maximum amount of real power that the DVR can provide to the load is a deciding factor in determining the capability of the restorer. This paper proposes a concept of interline dynamic voltage restoration (IDVR) in which several DVRs in different feeders are connected to a common DC-link energy storage. The cost of installation of a group of DVRs protecting various parts of a power system can be reduced by the sharing of a common energy storage system. While one of the DVRs carries out voltage compensation during sags, the other DVRs can replenish energy to the DC-link to maintain the DC-link voltage at a specific level. A closed-loop controller that consists of an inner current loop and an outer voltage loop is incorporated into the IDVR system in both the voltage control and the power flow control modes. Simulation results are presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed IDVR design.",,"Closed loop control systems; Control system analysis; Electric power factor; Electric power system protection; Power control; Voltage control; Interline dynamic voltage restorer; Interline power quality; Real power; Electric power system interconnection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142135090

Repletion indices of the gut of T. gratilla varied seasonally, in such a way that higher amounts of food occurred in the gut in winter than in other seasons. Conversely, a more detailed analysis of one summer and one winter sample of the gut tissue dry weights revealed higher weights in summer (February) than in winter (August). This was interpreted as a varying capability of nutrient storage and closely related to the feeding activity of the echinoid. This inverse relationship between feeding activity and nutrient storage was suggested to be dependent on gonadal growth. Indeed, higher food consumption was observed during the post-spawning period (August), that is, when most of the energy accumulated was used up for gonadal growth. Low feeding activity occurred when a sufficient amount of energy was accumulated in gut tissues (February), the time corresponding to the initiation of gonadal growth. Investigations on the feeding habits, using Ivlev's electivity index, revealed preferential feeding of T. gratilla on Syringodium isoetifolium, the dominant seagrass species found in the gut. This was partly related to the higher availability of that particular seagrass species in the field. However, its soft and terete leaf blade's morphology also makes it easier to manipulate and ingest. Studies on the feeding behaviour indicated the presence of a diel feeding cycle in T. gratilla individuals in both summer and winter seasons. Yet, its pattern varied between the two studied months (one summer and one winter) as the cycle was less contrasted during period of active feeding, i.e. in winter compared to summer. This study provides novel information on how intrinsic factors, such as physiological state, can govern the feeding activity of T. gratilla living in a seagrass habitat.",,"echinoderm; feeding behavior; food preference; seasonal variation; Madagascar; Echinodermata; Echinoidea; Halophila; Syringodium isoetifolium; Tripneustes gratilla",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142124166

Ghrelin is produced mainly in the stomach, but its expression has also been demonstrated in many other organs such as pituitary, hypothalamus, bowel, kidney, heart, pancreas, testis. It is active on the central nervous system, where it is involved in the regulation of GH secretion, mainly through a GH RH-independent mechanism and directly at the pituitary level. Furthermore, ghrelin controls energy balance, enhancing fat mass deposition and food intake through the activation of the hypothalamic nuclei and the promotion of NPY (neuropeptide Y) and AGRP (Agouti related protein) expression; since it stimulates weight gain, ghrelin is considered a possible important factor in the etiology of obesity. Besides these main actions, ghrelin is active in the cardiovascular, reproductive and endocrine systems, and displays antineoplastic activity. Even though most studies have been conducted in humans and rats, there is increasing interest in the role of ghrelin in domestic species. We have integrated the first studies on ghrelin action with recent data on its involvement in modulating several central and peripheral activities.","Energy balance; GH; Ghrelin; Metabolism","agouti related protein; ghrelin; growth hormone; growth hormone releasing factor; leptin; neuropeptide Y; antineoplastic activity; energy balance; food intake; half life time; heart; homeostasis; hormone release; human; hypophysis; hypothalamus; in vitro study; intestine; kidney; lipid storage; nonhuman; obesity; pancreas; protein binding; protein blood level; protein expression; review; stomach; testis; weight gain; Animals; Central Nervous System; Energy Metabolism; Growth Hormone; Humans; Peptide Hormones; Receptors, Cell Surface; Tissue Distribution",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142122029

The flying heads developed in this project take advantage of glass patterning for the air bearing surface generation. Glass slider prototypes were produced and evaluated, yielding a head-to-disk spacing within the desired range of 500-700 nm. To improve the flatness and roughness of injection moulded plastic media the Ni electroplating technology for stamper production was improved to yield a roughness below 3 nm. The coatings used to protect disks and heads from damage consist of amorphous diamond-like carbon (DLC). First investigations on DLC deposition showed the potential to achieve a bandgap in the order of 3 eV, as is required for blue laser optical recording technology.",,"Amorphous materials; Density (optical); Diamond like carbon films; Energy gap; Mechanical testing; Optical recording; Protective coatings; Surface properties; Surface roughness; Amorphous diamond like carbon; Flatness; Flyability testing; Flyable media for slider based ultra-high density optical recording; Optical data storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141939095

A set of three-dimensional (3D) pencil beam dose distributions have been computed for a cylindrical phantom. The 6 MV pencil beams were computed using a superposition-based dose engine commissioned for an Elekta SL20 linear accelerator. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the phantom, the pencil beam dose distributions for any arbitrary beam angle can be determined by simply rotating the pencil beam data sets. Thus, the full accuracy is maintained without the need for additional dose calculations or large data storage requirements. In addition to the pencil beam data sets, tools are included for (1) rotating the pencil beams, (2) calculating the beam's eye view, (3) drawing structures, (4) writing the pencil beam dose data out to the optimizer, and (5) visualizing the optimized results. The pencil beam data sets and the corresponding tools are available for download at http://medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/radiationoncology/pencilbeam/.

The number of electrons per ZnO quantum dot is controlled by the electrochemical potential of the assembly; the charge of the electrons is compensated by ions present in the pores. We show with optical and electrical measurements that the injected electrons occupy the S, P, and D type conduction electron levels of the quantum dots; electron storage in surface states is not important. With this method of three-dimensional charge compensation, up to ten electrons per quantum-dot can be stored if the assembly is permeated with an aqueous electrolyte. The screening of the electron charge is less effective in the case of an assembly permeated with a propylene carbonate electrolyte solution. Long-range electron transport is studied with a transistor set-up. In the case of ZnO assemblies permeated with an aqueous electrolyte, two quantum regimes are observed corresponding to multiple tunnelling between the S orbitals (at a low occupation) and P orbitals (at a higher occupation). In a ZnO quantum-dot assembly permeated with a propylene carbonate electrolyte solution, there is a strong overlap between these two regimes.","Electrochemistry; Electron mobility; Quantum dots; Semiconductors","Carbonation; Electrochemistry; Electrolytes; Electron mobility; Electron transport properties; II-VI semiconductors; Nanocrystals; Propylene; Quantum chemistry; Semiconductor materials; Wide band gap semiconductors; Zinc oxide; Aqueous electrolyte; Conduction electrons; Electrical measurement; Electrochemical potential; Long range transport; Propylene carbonate electrolyte; Quantum dot assemblies; Structural disorders; Semiconductor quantum dots; electrolyte; propylene carbonate; zinc oxide; aqueous solution; article; chemical interaction; chemical structure; electric conductivity; electric potential; electrochemistry; electron; electron transport; energy; measurement; optical rotation; porosity; quantum mechanics; semiconductor; structure analysis; synthesis; technique; transport kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141683508

In order to analyze these systems, undergoing a solid/liquid phase change, in many situations the heat transfer process can be considered conduction-dominated. However, in the past years, it has been shown that natural convection in the liquid phase can significantly influence the phase change process in terms of temperature distributions, interface displacement and energy storage. In this paper, a procedure to analyze systems undergoing liquid/solid phase change in presence of natural convection in the liquid phase based on the utilisation of a commercial computer code (FLUENT), has been developed. This procedure is applied to the study of a cylinder cavity heated from above and filled with a phase change material. It was found that when the coupling with the environment, even if small, is considered, natural convection in the liquid phase occurs. The numerical results are then compared with available experimental data.

Specific somatic energy content varied between 4.3 and 6.1 kJ·g-1 in spawners and between 4.8 and 6.6kj·g-1 in immatures. Corresponding values for specific somatic lipid energy were 0.5-1.6kJ·g-1 for spawners and 0.7-2.1 kJ·g-1 for immatures. The temporal pattern in storage energy residuals (deviation from mean storage energy, all sampling periods pooled) indicated that total, protein and lipid energy accumulated in the autumn and early winter. This increase was followed by a winter decrease in somatic energy (January to April). A new increase in total somatic energy and somatic lipid energy occurred during late winter (March/April to June), while the lake was still ice covered and water temperatures ranged between 0.5 and 2.5°C. The observed seasonal pattern of specific energy storage and lipid deposition demonstrated a considerable potential for energy accumulation in Arctic char at low temperatures.

Evaluations showed that the direction of preferential water transfer was dependent on the state of charge (SOC) of the vanadium electrolytes employed. When the vanadium electrolytes are at an initial SOC of 100 and 50% the direction of water transfer is toward the positive half-cell. As the electrolyte discharges from 50 to 0% SOC the direction of water transfer reverses toward the negative half-cell. It appears that the most significant level of water transfer occurs as the cell goes into over-discharge where the V(III) and V(IV) electrolytes become fully mixed below the 0% SOC state.

The study investigates the influence of two-step curing of a BisGMA/TEGDMA based polymer on degree of conversion (DC) and on hardness before and after 1 day ethanol storage. Methods. The specimens were pre-cured at 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 mW/cm2 for 10, 20, or 40 s. The final cure as well as the cure of the control group was carried out at 750 mW/cm2 for 20 s. DC was determined on thin films by FTIR. Hardness was determined on disks by the method of Wallace. Results. At intermediary energy densities of the pre-cure, the DC was reduced as compared to that of the control group. The hardness before ethanol storage was not influenced by the curing mode. Except for the lowest and the two highest energy densities of the pre-cure, the two-step curing mode resulted in polymers that after ethanol storage were softer than the control polymer.

The main consideration in infant nutrition has been the amount of fat that can be tolerated and digested by infants and young children. The significance of the composition of dietary fat has received little attention. Presently, there is a growing interest in the quality of dietary lipid supply in early childhood as a major determinant of growth, infant development and long-term health. Thus, the selection of dietary lipids during the first years of life is now considered to be critically important for health and good nutrition throughout the life course. Over the past decades interest has focused on the role of essential lipids in central nervous system development and of fatty acids and cholesterol in lipoprotein metabolism throughout life. Lipids are structural components of all tissues and are indispensable for cell and plasma membrane synthesis. The brain, retina and other neural tissues are particularly rich in long-chain PUFA. Some (n-6) and (n-3) fatty acids are precursors for eicosanoid formation; these are powerful mediators of numerous cell and tissue functions. Recommendations for infant nutrition and implications of these for the nutrient composition of complementary foods are presented and discussed. There is more to fat than its role as a key fuel in energy metabolism and body energy storage; lipids are essential for tissue growth, cardiovascular health, brain development and function throughout the life course.","Complementary foods; Dietary lipids; Infant nutrition","essential fatty acid; fatty acid; high density lipoprotein; lipid; low density lipoprotein; polyunsaturated fatty acid; conference paper; diet supplementation; energy metabolism; fat intake; food composition; human; infant nutrition; lipid composition; lipid metabolism; nutritional requirement",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042330245

The M-line maintains myosin myofilaments in register, links the contractile apparatus to the cytoskeleton for external force transfer and localizes CK-based energy storage and transfer to the site of highest ATP demand. We establish here that the muscle group responsible for movements of the eye, extraocular muscle (EOM), is divergent from other striated muscles in lacking both an M-line and its associated CK-M. Although an M-line forms during myogenesis, both in vivo and in vitro, it is actively repressed after birth. Transcripts of the major M-line structural proteins, myomesin 1 and myomesin 2, follow the same pattern of postnatal downregulation, while the embryonic heart-specific EH-myomesin 1 transcript is expressed early and retained in adult eye muscle. By immunocytochemistry, myomesin protein is absent from adult EOM sarcomeres. M-line suppression does not occur in organotypic co-culture with oculomotor motoneurons, suggesting that the mechanism for suppression may lie in muscle group-specific activation or workload patterns experienced only in vivo. The M-line is, however, still lost in dark-reared rats, despite the developmental delay this paradigm produces in the visuomotor system and EOMs. EOM was low in all CK isoform transcripts except for the sarcomeric mitochondrial (Ckmt2) isoform. Total CK enzyme activity of EOM was one-third that of hindlimb muscle. These findings are singularly unique among fast-twitch skeletal muscles. Since EOM exhibits isoform diversity for other sarcomeric proteins, the M-line/CK-M divergence probably represents a key physiological adaptation for the unique energetics and functional demands placed on this muscle group in voluntary and reflexive eye movements.","Creatine kinase; Extraocular muscle; M-line, myomesin; Myogenesis; Rat; Rattus norvegicus","Adaptation, Physiological; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Creatine Kinase; Creatine Kinase, MM Form; DNA Primers; Immunohistochemistry; Isoenzymes; Molecular Sequence Data; Muscle Proteins; Oculomotor Muscles; Protein Structure, Secondary; Rats; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sarcomeres; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Rattus; Rattus norvegicus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042239570

In an attempt to investigate whether the storage site can be exploited as target for modulating hepatic glucose production, α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins were identified as moderate mixed-type competitive inhibitors of GPb (with respect to glycogen) with Ki values of 47.1, 14.1, and 7.4 mM, respectively. To elucidate the structural basis of inhibition, we determined the structure of GPb complexed with β- and γ-cyclodextrins at 1.94 Å and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively. The structures of the two complexes reveal that the inhibitors can be accommodated in the glycogen storage site of T-state GPb with very little change of the tertiary structure and provide a basis for understanding their potency and subsite specificity. Structural comparisons of the two complexes with GPb in complex with either maltopentaose (G5) or maltoheptaose (G7) show that β- and γ-cyclodextrins bind in a mode analogous to the G5 and G7 binding with only some differences imposed by their cyclic conformations. It appears that the binding energy for stabilization of enzyme complexes derives from hydrogen bonding and van der Waals contacts to protein residues. The binding of α-cyclodextrin and octakis (2,3,6-tri-O-methyl)-γ-cyclodextrin was also investigated, but none of them was bound in the crystal; moreover, the latter did not inhibit the phosphorylase reaction.","α-cyclodextrin; β-cyclodextrin; γ-cyclodextrin; Glycogen phosphorylase; Oligosaccharide binding; Protein-carbohydrate interactions; X-ray crystallography","alpha cyclodextrin; beta cyclodextrin; gamma cyclodextrin; glucose; glycogen; glycogen phosphorylase b; glycosyltransferase inhibitor; maltoheptaose; maltopentaose; oligosaccharide; unclassified drug; allosterism; article; binding site; catalysis; clinical trial; competitive inhibition; conformation; crystal structure; energy; enzyme inhibition; enzyme inhibitor interaction; gluconeogenesis; glycogenolysis; human; hydrogen bond; kinetics; liver; molecular stability; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; optical resolution; priority journal; protein carbohydrate interaction; protein interaction; X ray crystallography; alpha-Cyclodextrins; Animals; beta-Cyclodextrins; Binding Sites; Circular Dichroism; Crystallography, X-Ray; Cyclodextrins; gamma-Cyclodextrins; Glucans; Glucose; Glycogen; Glycogen Phosphorylase, Muscle Form; Hydrogen Bonding; Kinetics; Models, Chemical; Oligosaccharides; Phosphorylation; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Rabbits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042011174

Six well-trained cyclists undertook a study of 8-h recovery (2 meals), and another nine cyclists undertook a separate 24-h protocol (4 meals). In each study, subjects completed three trials in crossover order: control (C) diet [meals providing carbohydrate (CHO) of 1.75 g/kg]; alcohol-displacement (A) diet (1.5 g/kg alcohol displacing CHO energy from C) and alcohol + CHO (AC) diet (C + 1.5 g/kg alcohol). Alcohol intake reduced postmeal glycemia especially in A trial and 24-h study, although insulin responses were maintained. Alcohol intake increased serum triglycerides, particularly in the 24-h study and AC trial. Glycogen storage was decreased in A diets compared with C at 8 h (24.4 ± 7 vs. 44.6 ± 6 mmol/kg wet wt, means ± SE, P < 0.05) and 24 h (68 ± 5 vs. 82 ± 5 mmol/kg wet wt, P < 0.05). There was a trend to reduced glycogen storage with AC in 8 h (36.2 × 8 mmol/kg wet wt, P = 0.1) but no difference in 24 h (85 ± 9 mmol/kg wet wt). We conclude that 1) the direct effect of alcohol on postexercise glycogen synthesis is unclear, and 2) the main effect of alcohol intake is indirect, by displacing CHO intake from optimal recovery nutrition practices.","Ethanol; Glycogen resynthesis","alcohol; glucose; glycogen; insulin; triacylglycerol; adult; alcohol consumption; article; bicycle ergometry; carbohydrate intake; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; crossover procedure; cycling; diet; exercise; glucose blood level; glycogen metabolism; glycogen muscle level; glycogen synthesis; human; human experiment; insulin response; normal human; nutrition; priority journal; triacylglycerol blood level; vastus lateralis muscle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041922435

We examined whether ASP might also have effects on islet function. In clonal INS-1 cells, ASP dose-dependently augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The lowest effective dose of ASP at 10 mmol/l glucose was 5 μmol/l. The effect was glucose-dependent because ASP did not increase insulin secretion at 1 mmol/l glucose but had clear effect at 10 and 20 mmol/l glucose. Similarly, ASP augmented glyceraldehyde-induced insulin secretion but the hormone did not enhance insulin secretion in response to depolarization by 20 mmol/l of KCI. ASP-induced insulin secretion was completely abolished by competitive inhibition of glucose phosphorylation by glucokinase with 5-thio-glucose and was partially inhibited by the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, and by the protein kinase C inhibitor, GF109203. Furthermore, thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPase in the endoplasmic reticulum, did not affect ASP-induced insulin secretion. ASP (&gt; 5 μmol/l) also augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from islets isolated from C57BL/6J mice, and intravenous administration of ASP (50 nmol/kg) augmented the acute (1 and 5 min) insulin response to intravenous glucose (1 g/kg) in C57BL/6J mice. This was accompanied by an increased rate of glucose disposal. Minimal model analyses of data derived from the intravenous glucose tolerance test revealed that whereas ASP augmented insulin secretion, the hormone did not affect insulin sensitivity (S1) or glucose effectiveness (SG). We conclude that ASP augments glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through a direct action on the islet beta cells. The effect is dependent on glucose phosphorylation, calcium uptake and protein kinase C. Stimulation of insulin secretion by ASP in vivo results in augmented glucose disposal.","Acylation stimulating protein; ASP; In vivo; INS cells; Insulin secretion; Insulin sensitivity; Mice","2 [1 (3 dimethylaminopropyl) 3 indolyl] 3 (3 indolyl)maleimide; acylation stimulating protein; adenosine triphosphatase (calcium); calcium channel blocking agent; glucokinase; glucose; nifedipine; protein kinase C inhibitor; thapsigargin; thioglucose; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; depolarization; dose response; drug antagonism; drug mechanism; endoplasmic reticulum; energy transfer; female; glucose tolerance test; hormonal regulation; hormone action; insulin release; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas islet; phosphorylation; priority journal; rat; signal transduction; Animals; Blood Glucose; Blood Proteins; Calcium Channel Blockers; Cells, Cultured; Complement C3a; Enzyme Inhibitors; Female; Glucokinase; Glucose; Indoles; Insulin; Islets of Langerhans; Maleimides; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nifedipine; Phosphorylation; Protein Kinase C; Radioimmunoassay; Thapsigargin; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041818412

We studied 11 obese subjects (BMI 49±2 kg/m2) before and 24 months after BPD. Skeletal muscle SREBP1c mRNA expression was determined using RT-competitive PCR. Intramyocytic triglycerides were quantified by HPLC. Insulin sensitivity (M/I) was assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Energy expenditure and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured over 24 h in a calorimetric chamber. Total cardiovascular risk dropped from 2 before to -2.5 after BPD (P&lt;0.0001). The M/I value was normalized after surgery (0.036±0.0148 to 0.095±0.0147 μmol kgFFM-1 min-1 pmoles-1 P&lt;0.001). SREBP-1c mRNA levels were decreased (from 4.12±2.43 to 2.69±1.83% of cyclophilin mRNA, P=0.02) after BPD. In a multiple regression analysis, M/I values (P&lt;0.0001) as well as the intramyocytic triglyceride levels (P=0.039) were the most powerful independent variables for predicting cardiovascular risk. Our results show that the reduction of cardiovascular risk after bariatric massive weight loss is strongly related to the reversion of insulin resistance and to the lowering of intramyocytic triglyceride depots. These two parameters are associated with a significant reduction in SREBP-1c mRNA expression in skeletal muscle, suggesting that this transcription factor might be involved in the accumulation of triglycerides in muscle cells of morbidly obese subjects. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The presented approach avoids several drawbacks arising with classical methods. The ""neural meshing"" outperforms standard techniques in terms of memory requirements and accuracy.

The next generation of HEP experiments at CERN (European Laboratory for High Energy Physics), is being designed around the new Large Hadron Collider (LHC) project, and will have to cope with gigabyte-per-second data flows. As a consequence, LHC experiments will require challengingly new equipment for detector readout, event filtering, event building and storage. The Fastbus and VME-based tree architectures of the eighties run out of steam when applied to LHC's requirements. New concepts and architectures from the nineties have substituted rack-mounting backplane buses for high speed point-to-point links, abandoned centralized event building, and instead use switched networks and parallel architectures. Following these trends, and in the context of DAQ and trigger systems for LHC experiments, this paper summarizes the earlier architectures and presents the new concepts for DAQ. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In this study of forelimb muscle morphology and primate locomotion, fiber architecture is examined in the intrinsic muscles of the shoulder (musculi deltoideus, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, subscapularis, teres major, and t. minor) and arm (m. coracobrachialis, biceps brachii, brachialis, and triceps brachii) in the semiterrestrial vervets (Chlorocebus aethiops) and arboreal red-tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius). Wet weights and lengths of whole muscles, lengths of fasciculi and their associated proximal and distal tendons, and angles of pinnation were measured to estimate morphologic correlates of physiologic properties of individual muscles: force, velocity/excursion, energy expense, and relative isometric or isotonic contraction. Neither mean total-shoulder:total-arm ratios for muscle mass nor total reduced physiological cross-sectional area exhibited significant (P < 0.05) interspecific differences, thus emphasizing the importance of fine-tuning musculoskeletal analyses by the data collected here. The results generally support those previously published for quadriceps femoris and triceps surae of the hind limb in these species (Anapol and Barry [1996] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 99:429-447). The fiber architecture of the semiterrestrial vervets is largely suited for higher velocity while running on the ground. By contrast, the architectural configuration of red-tailed monkeys implies relatively isometric muscle contraction and passive storage of elastic strain energy for exploitation of the compliant canopy, where substrate components are situated beneath the sagittal plane of the animal. With respect to relative distribution of maximum potential force output among muscles of either shoulder or arm groups in these otherwise hind limb-dominated quadrupedal primates, statistically significant interspecific differences are best interpreted in light of braking, climbing, and, for vervets, the transition between ground and canopy. The interspecific differences shown here for the intrinsic muscles of the shoulder and arm underscore the significance of intramuscular morphology in reconciling structure and function with regard to locomotor behavior.

If whole cryohydrocytosis blood is anticoagulated in heparin or EDTA and stored on ice overnight, about 50% of the cells will lyse. Citrate phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDa) anticoagulant, empirically verified as an optimal anticoagulant for storage of normal blood before transfusion, very markedly ameliorated this overnight lysis, suggesting that these cells might form an informative model in which cold storage of the red cell could be studied in a short time scale. Accordingly, we conducted studies of ion flux, cell swelling and lysis in different media used historically for blood preservation and compared the experimental data with an 'integrated red cell model', which seeks mathematically to model the osmotic behaviour of red cells under different conditions. Upon experiment, lysis in these cells was reduced by additives that could be regarded as impermeant extracellular solutes (citrate, mannitol) and by low pH, but not by those agents that are regarded as protecting the cell against energy depletion or oxidation (adenine, glucose, nicotinic acid). The protective effects of these extracellular additives were all reproduced by the computer simulation, confirming the validity of this model, although the effect of pH could be simulated only semi-quantitatively, possibly because Na+ permeability itself depends on pH.","Cryohydrocytosis; Erythrocyte; Hereditary stomatocytosis; Osmotic lysis; Storage; Transfusion","adenine; citric acid; glucose; mannitol; nicotinic acid; article; blood storage; cell swelling; computer simulation; controlled study; cryohydrocytosis; cryopreservation; cytolysis; erythrocyte; hemolytic anemia; human; human cell; ion current; mathematical model; model; osmosis; oxidation; permeability; pH; priority journal; solute; Anemia, Hemolytic; Citrates; Computer Simulation; Cryopreservation; Culture Media; Erythrocyte Membrane; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Iron; Mannitol; Models, Biological; Water-Electrolyte Balance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041410230

It can be seen as time-inverse photo-ionization, auto-ionization, or electron-impact ionization. Here, we show how these processes can be measured with cooler-storage rings, such as CRYRING at MSL, with very high accuracy. The status of theoretical modeling is briefly reviewed and anomalies are uncovered. We discuss some examples of recombination for ions where strong dielectronic recombination resonances occur. With cooler-storage rings, these resonances can today be measured with meV accuracy, and from the spectra of the dielectronic resonances, very accurate values for energy splittings and resonance strengths are derived. These allow crucial tests of relativistic, correlation, and QED effects in these systems. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This single-layer model simulates the effects of heat exchange, stomatal blocking and changed humidity deficit close to the canopy as a function of canopy water storage. Evaporation depends on the distribution of water over the canopy and the energy exchange between wet and dry parts. Transpiration depends on the dry canopy surface resistance that is described with a Jarvis-type response. The explicit functions obtained for water vapour fluxes facilitate a straightforward identification of the various processes. Canopy water storage amounts and xylem sapflow were measured simultaneously during drying episodes after rainfall in a dense, partially wet, Douglas-fir forest. Estimates of evaporation and transpiration rates are derived from these observations. The analysis shows that evaporation induced transpiration reduction is mainly caused by energy consumption. Changes in water vapour deficit have a minor effect due to a compensating stomatal reaction. The remaining difference between observed and modelled transpiration reduction can be attributed to partial blocking of stomata by the water layer.","Evaporation; Forest; Hydrology; Interaction; Penman-Monteith equation; Transpiration; Wet canopy","Energy utilization; Evaporation; Heat exchangers; Rain; Transpiration; Stomatal blocking; Forestry; evaporation; forest; numerical model; Penman-Monteith equation; stomata; transpiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037927514

The MARKAL energy-system modeling tool was used to build a model of China's energy system representing all sectors of the economy and including both energy conversion and end-use technologies. Different scenarios for the evolution of the energy system from 1995 to 2050 were explored, enabling insights to be gained into different energy development choices. The analysis indicates a business-as-usual strategy that relies on coal combustion technologies would not be able to meet all environmental and energy security goals. However, an advanced technology strategy emphasizing (1) coal gasification technologies co-producing electricity and clean liquid and gaseous energy carriers (polygeneration), with below-ground storage of some captured CO2; (2) expanded use of renewable energy sources (especially wind and modern biomass); and (3) end-use efficiency would enable China to continue social and economic development through at least the next 50 years while ensuring security of energy supply and improved local and global environmental quality. Surprisingly, even when significant limitations on carbon emissions were stipulated, the model calculated that an advanced energy technology strategy using our technology-cost assumptions would not incur a higher cumulative (1995-2050) total discounted energy system cost than the business-as-usual strategy. To realize such an advanced technology strategy, China will need policies and programs that encourage the development, demonstration and commercialization of advanced clean energy conversion technologies and that support aggressive end-use energy efficiency improvements. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To restore load voltage, DVR should inject the equivalent of dropped voltage, which represents the voltage difference between pre-fault and fault voltage through series connected transformer. Voltage restoration of DVR needs to inject active power and energy from DVR to distribution system. However, the capability of energy storage that usually consists of capacitors in DVR is limited. Therefore, it must be considered how the injection energy can be minimized and the load voltage can be made close to the pre-fault voltage. This paper describes conventional restoration techniques like pre-sag compensation, in-phase compensation, and phase advance method. In addition, this paper proposes a new concept of restoration technique to inject minimum energy during DVR compensation. The proposed method is based on the definition of voltage tolerance of the load. In the proposed method, some particular disturbances can be corrected with less amount of energy discharge than those of conventional methods. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In contrast to the relatively short momentum relaxation time (∼10 ns) that can be understood on the basis of acoustic phonon emission, the spin-flip relaxation time is found to be extremely long (∼200 μs). The spin relaxation process in our QDs is actually dominated by a cotunnelling process, and thus the intrinsic spin relaxation should have a longer relaxation time. The long relaxation time is discussed in terms of potential applications to spin-based quantum information storage. On the other hand, the extremely long spin relaxation process can induce considerable fluctuation of the spin, charge, and total energy of the QD. The absence of efficient spin relaxation processes can cause highly non-equilibrium transport, which actually 'breaks down' the single-electron tunnelling scheme. The non-equilibrium effects must be considered when electrons and spins are manipulated in the CB regime.",,"Coulomb blockade; Electric variables measurement; Electron tunneling; Relaxation processes; Acoustic phonon emission; Electrical pulse measurement; Inelastic relaxation; Non-equilibrium transport; Spin-flip relaxation time; Semiconductor quantum dots",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042783074

No one preservation solution, including the gold standard University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, has been able to maintain graft integrity for storage periods paralleling that of other commonly transplanted intra-abdominal organs. We investigated the role for the luminal administration of preservation solutions in a small animal model, documenting significantly improved graft quality. The current study addresses direct clinical applicability using human SB. Methods. Human SB was obtained at the time of standard multiviscera procurement. After a common intraarterial UW flush, the SB was immediately removed from the abdomen, randomly divided into three segments, and treated as follows (n=6-9): group 1, no luminal flush; group 2, luminal flush with UW solution; and group 3, luminal flush with an amino acid-enriched solution. Analysis of cellular energetics, permeability, and histologic injury was performed throughout 24 hr of cold storage. Results. Mucosal barrier function, measured by mannitol permeability, was significantly better overall in groups 2 and 3, with 24-hr values measuring 31 and 34 nmol/cm2/hr versus 57 nmol/cm2/hr, respectively (both P&lt; 0.05). Significantly less morphologic injury was also noted in the luminally treated specimens (groups 2 and 3) compared with the clinical standard (vascular flush with UW solution). Damage in group 1 reached gross villus denudation with an obvious elevated risk of villus tissue loss, whereas groups 2 and 3 only exhibited epithelial clefting to varying degrees. Conclusion.

Ozone clusters could be synthesized by this method, which detaches ozone from silica gel without requiring any additional energy. These ozone clusters didn't decompose at room temperature and atmospheric pressure over a half-day. We confirmed that the cluster was heavier than a heavy standard gas, the presence of clusters with an analysis using GC/MS, and the existence of ozone clusters by the bondin energy using a computer simulation by MOPAC.","Capillary Condensation; MOPAC; Ozone; Ozone Clusters; Ozone Storage; Silica Gel; Storage of Ozone","Atmospheric pressure; Computer simulation; Silica gel; Synthesis (chemical); Ozone clusters; Ozone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041733123

In this article, we review β3-adrenergic receptor agonists, agents in development both to increase energy expenditure and counteract energy expenditure decline following a calorie restriction program. β3-adrenergic receptor agonists are very effective thermogenic anti-obesity and insulin-sensitising agents in rodents. Their main sites of action are white and brown adipose tissue, and muscle. β3-adrenergic receptor mRNA levels are lower in human than in rodent adipose tissue, and adult humans have little brown adipose tissue. Nevertheless, β3-adrenergic receptors are expressed in human white as well as brown adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle, and they play a role in the regulation of energy balance and glucose homeostasis. It is difficult to identify β3-adrenergic receptor agonist drugs because the pharmacology of both β3- and β 3-adrenergic receptors can vary. Since their discovery in 1983, hundreds different compounds have been synthesized with β 3-adrenergic receptor agonist profile. We identified in the literature 32 molecules in development: 9 molecules are in discovery phase (from 10 October 2001 to 25 November 2002: five molecules in 2002 and 4 in 2001), 5 molecules are in different clinical phases, 10 molecules were discontinued, for 8 molecules no development was reported. Here we have tried to demonstrate that the preclinical and clinical studies on β 3-adrenergic receptors and β3-adrenergic receptor agonists as anti-obesity drugs is yet active, even if no conclusive therapeutic agents have been identified. With the huge recent increase in our knowledge on the molecular processes involved in adipose cell biology and adaptive thermogenesis, there may yet be a future for β3-adrenergic receptor agonists.","β3-adrenergic receptor; β3-adrenergic receptor agonists; Anorectic drugs; Anti-obesity drugs; Brown adipose tissue; Energy balance; Mitochondria; Obesity; Thermogenic drugs; Uncoupling protein","4 [2 [(2 hydroxy 2 phenylethyl)amino]ethoxy]phenylacetic acid; 4 [2 [(2 hydroxy 2 phenylethyl)amino]propyl]benzoic acid methyl ester; 4 [2 [[2 (3 chlorophenyl) 2 hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]phenoxyacetic acid methyl ester; 5 [2 [[2 (3 chlorophenyl) 2 hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl] 1,3 benzodioxole 2,2 dicarboxylic acid; 6 [2 [[2 (3 chlorophenyl) 2 hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl] 1,4 benzodioxan 2 carboxylic acid; [[7 [[2 (3 chlorophenyl) 2 hydroxyethyl]amino] 5,6,7,8 tetrahydro 2 naphthyl]oxy]acetic acid ethyl ester; AJ 9677; anorexigenic agent; antiobesity agent; az 40140; beta 1 adrenergic receptor; beta 3 adrenergic receptor; beta 3 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; bms 187413; bms 194449; bms 196085; bms 210285; cl 314698; cp 114271; cp 331679; cyclic AMP; cyclic GMP; cyclohexyl[4 [2 [2 hydroxy 3 (4 hydroxyphenoxy)propylamino]ethyl]phenoxymethyl]phosphinic acid; fr 165914; gr 265261; ici 198157; l 742791; l 751250; l 796568; ly 362884; ly 377604; messenger RNA; nitric oxide; nitric oxide synthase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; sb 220646; sb 251023; sb 418790; solabegron; sr 58878; swr 0335; swr 0342 sa; tak 677; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 1; unindexed drug; way 172881; way 173860; way 174231; brown adipose tissue; caloric intake; caloric restriction; clinical trial; drug targeting; energy balance; energy expenditure; glucose homeostasis; human; nonhuman; obesity; review; thermogenesis; white adipose tissue",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041733140

The mega-pixel imager will acquire and process a burst of 32 frames captured at inter-frame time ∼200 ns. Real time signal processing and storage requirements for entire frames, of rapidly acquired pixels impose severe demands on the space available for the electronics in a standard monolithic approach. As such, a 3D arrangement of detector and circuit elements is under development. In this scheme, the readout integrated circuits (ROICs) are stacked vertically (like playing cards) into a cube configuration. Another die, a fully depleted pixel photo-diode focal plane array (FPA), is bump bonded to one of the edge surfaces formed by the resulting ROIC cube.

A novel Li-containing luminescent material perspective for a direct neutron conversion and storage is discussed. Irradiation of LiBaF3 crystals results in generation of Frenkel defect pairs and creation of F-type centres responsible for three absorption bands in UV-and visible spectral region. Because photo-stimulation in each of these absorption bands leads to bleaching of induced absorption, the F-type colour centres are convenient for storage of radiation dose. Photo-stimulated decay of F-centres causes recombination luminescence of impurity centres. Thermoactivated decay of F-type centres is governed by ionic process. The thermal stability of F-centres at RT and consequent material storage characteristics can be improved by doping of the LiBaF3 with heterovalent oxygen impurities. The obtained radiation energy storage, photo- and thermostimulated read-out characteristics justify that LIBaF3 is a suitable active media for imaging of slow neutrons. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Imaging plate; LiBaF3; Photo-stimulated bleaching; Radiation defects; Storage phosphor; Thermal neutrons","Crystals; Ionizing radiation; Light absorption; Luminescence; Neutrons; Thermodynamic stability; Photo-stimulated bleaching; Radiation detectors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041560007

Such energy must be above and beyond that of a potential (current-free) magnetic field, and thus the pre-CME coronal magnetic field should contain significant electric currents. Given the diffuse nature of the corona, the coronal magnetic field is likely to be largely force free, implying that electric currents are closely aligned with the field itself. In this work we explore such force-free fields, in the spherical geometry appropriate to the solar corona, with the aim of understanding how the magnetic flux distribution at the coronal base affects the storage of magnetic energy. We find that energy storage is enhanced when a region of strong potential field overlies a nonpotential field whose footpoints are confined to low solar latitudes. Furthermore, those flux distributions consistent with strong overlying potential fields may enable larger energy buildup, when examined in the context of limits imposed by the scalar virial theorem and the Aly-Sturrock theorem. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of force-free fields containing detached flux ropes, with energies that lie above the Aly-Sturrock limit.","MHD; Sun: corona; Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs); Sun: magnetic fields",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042287824

In this work, we report on a systematic study of the effect of varying the beam energy (0.65-2 keV) and the dose (10 15-1016 cm-2) on the positioning of 2D-arrays of ncs within 10 nm thick oxide after annealing at 950 and 1050 °C. For this, different Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) methods have been used including High Resolution Electron Microscopy (HREM) for imaging isolated ncs and Fresnel contrast imaging of populations of ncs. Our results show that the 'injection distance' can be precisely tuned in the 5-8 nm range by varying the beam energy. Moreover, very large swelling of the SiO2 layer has been observed when increasing the implanted dose which could be the result of a partial oxidation of the Si ncs layer and/or of the SiO2/Si interface. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

We here present a method for cryopreservation of mitochondria in various muscle types including human biopsies. Mitochondrial function was analyzed after freeze-thawing permeabilized muscle fibers using glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide as cryoprotectant. Using optimal freeze-thawing conditions, high rates of adenosine 5′-diphosphate-stimulated respiration and high respiratory control were observed, showing intactness of mitochondrial respiratory function after cryopreservation. Measurement of adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) formation showed normal rates of ATP synthesis and ATP/O ratios. Intactness of the outer mitochondrial membrane and functional coupling between mitochondrial creatine kinase and oxidative phosphorylation were verified by respiratory cytochrome c and creatine tests. Simultaneous confocal imaging of mitochondrial flavoproteins and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide revealed normal intracellular arrangement and metabolic responses of mitochondria after freeze-thawing. The method therefore permits, after freezing and long-term storage of muscle samples, mitochondrial function to be estimated and energy metabolism to be monitored in situ. This will significantly expand the scope for screening and exchange of human biopsy samples between research centers, thus providing a new basis for functional analysis of mitochondrial defects in various diseases. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

However, they weigh so much for sufficient amounts of hydrogen, therefore, light hydrogen storage materials with much higher storage capacities are required. Alkaline complex hydrides are promising candidates as light hydrogen storage materials. In this study we tried to prepare a sample based on the Na-Li-Al system using the dry process of ball-milling as mechanical synthesis and investigate their hydrogen reaction characteristics. The same study for the sample with 10 wt.% La2O3 was also carried out and its hydrogen reactivity compared. The starting materials were LiAlH4, NaH. They were ball-milled with hexane dehydrated in 1 bar Ar. The hydrogen reactivity of the samples obtained were measured by the high-pressure Sievert's type apparatus. For the sample of NaH+LiH+Al, about 1.9∼2.0 wt.% of hydrogen was absorbed reversibly within 150 min. The addition of 10 wt.% La2O3 improved both the ab/desorption reaction rate and cyclable hydrogen capacity. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

With this in mind, this article revisits important experiments. Thermal desorption spectroscopy as a quantitative tool to measure the hydrogen storage capacity needs an appropriate calibration using a suitable hydride. Single-walled carbon nanotubes that have been treated by ultra-sonication show hydrogen uptake at room temperature. However, this storage can be assigned to metal particles incorporated during the sonication treatment. Reactive high-energy ball milling of graphite leads to a high hydrogen loading, however the temperatures for hydrogen release are far too high for application. In view of today's knowledge, which is mainly based on experiments with small quantities and poorly characterised samples, carbon nanostructures at around room temperature cannot store the amount of hydrogen required for automotive applications. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The crystallographic structure, composition and morphology of the composites were analysed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). XRD patterns show that no alloy formation takes place during milling. EDX data show that milling time is a key parameter to control the morphology of the composites. Short milling times of 10 min give composites with the IMC attached to the Mg particle surface, while it is irregularly distributed in the Mg bulk for longer milling times of 70 min. Hydriding/dehydriding properties of the composites were studied by the solid-gas reaction method. Composites with a distribution of the IMC in the Mg bulk are easily activated and show faster hydriding/dehydriding kinetics than untreated Mg, which indicates that ZrCr2 acts as a catalytic compound for the Mg-hydrogen reaction. © 2002 Elsevier B.V.

Beside these compounds, relatively few works have been devoted to RM3 compounds since the binary compounds exhibit rather low reversible capacities. New interests for this stoichiometry appear recently with ternary systems R-Mg-Ni (R=Lanthanide, Ca or Y) within the atomic composition 1:2:9. These compounds crystallise in an ordered variant of the PuNi3-type rhombohedral structure (R3m space group) and can be described as a stacking of RNi5 (Haücke phase) and MgNi2 (Laves phase) units. In this paper, we will review the different structural and thermodynamic properties of RM3-type compounds. Recent results on new ternary systems will be presented and discussed in relation with other systems. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, platinum group metals (PGMs) have been employed to surface modify Mg- or Mg2Ni-based compounds. Nanocrystalline powders have been synthesised by high energy ball milling in hydrogen or argon atmospheres. The effects of co-milling time with the PGM, the use of pre-hydrided Mg for inert milling and blending with minor amounts of Ni are investigated.

Instr. and Meth. A 343 (1994) 644), the 1.5 GeV electron storage ring at MAX-lab, Lund, Sweden. The measurements with scrapers in MAX II have shown to give a number of useful results, such as the vertical and horizontal acceptance, which are 7.4 × 10-6 and 9.6 × 10-6m, respectively, the lifetime limitations due to scattering on residual gas in the vacuum system, the Touschek effect and the quantum effect. The vertical acceptance of MAX II corresponds to a total vertical aperture of 10.04 mm and a total horizontal aperture of 22.4 mm at the position of the scraper, i.e. in the straight sections. The lifetime in MAX II at the measurement with 180 mA of stored beam at full energy, 1.5 GeV, was 23.8 h. The 23.8 h of lifetime is the total lifetime which is determined by the following lifetime limiting effects: Touschek effect 37 h, quantum effect ≫100 h, elastic scattering on the residual gas 134 h, and inelastic scattering on the residual gas 132 h. It has shown possible to inject into and ramp the MAX II storage ring with a total vertical aperture in the straight sections as small as 9.34 mm. The measurements have shown that it is possible to install an insertion device in MAX II with a 10 mm aperture without decreasing the beam lifetime, provided that the insertion devices do not deteriorate the vacuum situation. The gas mixture of the residual gas in the MAX II storage ring at operation has been measured and the absolute gas pressure is given by the results from the scraper measurements. In MAX II, as in most accelerators, the residual gas is dominated by hydrogen.

A number of researchers have subsequently verified and enhanced the rate of dehydrogenation in this system using combined transition metal catalytic additions along with different methods of their introduction into the NaAlH4 compound. The most potent catalytic addition identified thus far is TiCl3 added through ball milling, however, ZrCl3 and other transition metal chlorides have also been found useful. To this date, the role of the catalysts are still unknown as well as their disposition within the NaAlH4 compound. This investigation has sought to identify the extent catalytic dehydrogenation reaction rate of a number of transition metal additions to NaAlH4 at 120°C. Two mol% catalysts were added, primarily as chlorides, in a number of valance states. High energy ball mill attrition of the catalyst and the alanate were made with optimum milling times determined. Comparison of dehydrogenation rates with ion radius has shown an optimum catalyst ion radius ratio to be readily identifiable as being midway between that of Al(III) and Na(I). Cation valance, while an important factor in hydrogen discharge kinetics, was shown not to be the primary contributing factor for catalytic activity. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Since then, engineering designs and prototypes have been developed for the use of superconductive materials in electric power transmission, transformers, and machinery. The development of superconducting magnetic energy storage systems also held great promise. Superconductivity was even used to build marine propulsion systems and levitated track vehicles. Despite that, and despite the financial support of governments for prototype developments, the only commercial application of the technology, outside of laboratories, is for MRI magnets. Similar experience is encountered in superconducting applications to electronics, although some success has been achieved in the communication industry. The discovery of high temperature superconductivity, despite its promise, did not significantly change the situation. The developments will be reviewed, and some of the reasons why superconductivity is still mainly confined to the laboratory will be given with the view of what we, as scientists, can do in order to enhance and hasten the commercial adoption of superconducting technology.",,"conductance; conference paper; electric power plant; electronics; energy; high temperature; machine; magnet; materials; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141567857

Escherichia coli, in which iron metabolism is particularly well understood, contains at least 7 iron-acquisition systems encoded by 35 iron-repressed genes. This Fe-dependent repression is mediated by a transcriptional repressor, Fur (ferric uptake regulation), which also controls genes involved in other processes such as iron storage, the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle, pathogenicity, and redox-stress resistance. Our macroarray-based global analysis of iron- and Fur. dependent gene expression in E. coli has revealed several novel Fur-repressed genes likely to specify at least three additional iron-transport pathways. Interestingly, a large group of energy metabolism genes was found to be iron and Fur induced. Many of these genes encode iron-rich respiratory complexes. This iron- and Fur-dependent regulation appears to represent a novel iron-homeostatic mechanism whereby the synthesis of many iron-containing proteins is repressed under iron-restricted conditions. This mechanism thus accounts for the low iron contents of fur mutants and explains how E. coli can modulate its iron requirements. Analysis of 55Fe-labeled E. coli proteins revealed a marked decrease in iron-protein composition for the fur mutant, and visible and EPR spectroscopy showed major reductions in cytochrome b and d levels, and in iron-sulfur cluster contents for the chelator-treated wild-type and/or fur mutant, correlating well with the array and quantitative RT-PCR data. In combination, the results provide compelling evidence for the regulation of intracellular iron consumption by the Fe2+-Fur complex.",,"Escherichia coli; Genes; Iron; Metabolism; Pathology; Synthesis (chemical); Mutants; Biochemistry; cytochrome b; cytochrome d; iron; article; bacterial gene; bacterial metabolism; electron spin resonance; Escherichia coli; gene control; gene mutation; gene repression; homeostasis; iron balance; iron storage; iron transport; nonhuman; priority journal; Biological Transport; DNA, Complementary; Down-Regulation; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Iron; Magnetics; Mutation; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA; Transcription, Genetic; Up-Regulation; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043032822

In this study, tissue mass and biochemical composition were determined for various tissues of the bivalve Laternula elliptica (King & Broderip) over a 2 yr period, and its storage and use of energy reserves were investigated with respect to seasonal changes in food level and water temperature. Total ash-free dry mass (AFDM) accumulated rapidly following phytoplankton blooms (with peak values immediately before and after spawning) and was depleted considerably during the spawning and winter periods. Most of the variation was in the muscle, gonads and digestive gland. Spawning peaked in January and February and caused considerable protein and lipid losses in the muscle, gonads and digestive gland. In winter (March to August), the muscle and digestive gland lost considerable mass, while gonad mass increased; this suggests that the muscle tissue and digestive gland serve as major energy depots for both maintenance metabolism and gonad development in winter. There were also marked year-to-year differences in the seasonal patterns of mass variation and reproduction. Overall, the relative and absolute tissue-mass values were positively correlated with chlorophyll concentration, and were not related to water temperature; thus, for the first time, this study clearly shows that food is an important factor governing growth and gonad maturation in this bivalve. It is also noteworthy that protein, constituting ∼75% of AFDM, served as the major energy reserve throughout the study, closely following the AFDM variation. In particular, during the winter months, protein comprised >60% of AFDM loss, while lipids and glycogen served as minor (<20% each) reserves. Protein loss was most substantial in the muscle tissue, which comprised half of the body tissue. Thus, protein use, with muscle tissues as a depot for protein reserves, may be a result of selective pressure on Antarctic marine herbivores undergoing a prolonged period of food shortage in winter.","Antarctic bivalve; Biochemical composition; Energy reserve; Growth; Laternula elliptica; Protein; Reproduction","bioenergetics; chemical composition; growth; mollusc; reproduction; seasonality; Antarctica; King George Island; South Shetland Islands; algae; Bivalvia; Bivalvia; Fraxinus; Invertebrata; Laternula; Laternula elliptica; Laternula elliptica; Laternulidae; Laternulidae; Mollusca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041353713

Up until now, almost all reported resonator arrays (often designated as ""electronic noses"" or ""electronic tongues,"" respectively, dependent on their application) are assembled from single QMBs. We fabricate arrays with up to 36 QMBs on a single AT-cut quartz blank. Mass sensitive devices based on AT-cut quartz resonators are suitable as (bio)chemical sensors. A frequency shift caused by mass accumulation on the sensor surface increases theoretically with f 2, hence the detection limits for the application as chemical sensors should be decreased with increasing frequency. Since the quality factor Q of a quartz crystal decreases with f, the frequency stability is reduced, thus limiting mass sensitivity. The mass sensitivity of resonators with different resonant frequencies was examined by means of electrochemical copper deposition on their surface. Subsequently, the manufactured resonators were coated with different layers (polystyrene, amyl-calix[8]arene, β-cyclodextrine). In order to examine the applicability of such coatings as sensitive layers, their sensitivities to toluene in water were investigated. Moreover, arrays with up to four different resonant frequencies on one chip were fabricated for comparing the resonator behavior of the same coating at different frequencies. In another test setup, different layers were sprayed onto an array of microbalances having all the same resonant frequency. This allowed for comparing the different coating behavior under equivalent test conditions. Arrays were tested for viscosity measurement to find an optimum resonant frequency.","Chemical sensor; Mass sensitivity; QCM; Sensor array","Acoustic waves; Biosensors; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Electrodes; Energy storage; Natural frequencies; Quartz; Resonators; Spurious signal noise; Viscosity; Mass sensitivity; Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM); Sensor arrays; Shear modes; Chemical sensors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042820791

The recent identification of the LXR-dependent ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) pathway for cholesterol release from peripheral cells has led us to address the question of the expression and function of ABCA1 in adipocytes. In 3T3-L1 adipose cells, we observed a strong induction of ABCA1 mRNA during adipose differentiation, but only limited variations in ABCA1 protein. Lipid efflux onto apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which depends on ABCA1, was comparable in adipocytes and preadipocytes, demonstrating a differential regulation of ABCA1 mRNA and cholesterol efflux. We also found that total cell cholesterol remained stable during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, but membrane cholesterol was lower in adipocytes than in preadipocytes, suggesting redistribution of cholesterol to the lipid droplet. Finally, we show that under standard lipolytic stimulation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes do not release cholesterol onto apoA-I, a process that required long exposures to lipolytic agents (24 h). In conclusion, despite large induction of ABCA1 mRNA during differentiation, cholesterol efflux through the ABCA1 pathway remains limited in adipocytes and requires prolonged lipolysis. This is consistent with the view of the adipocyte behaving as a cholesterol sink, with plasma cholesterol-buffering properties.","Adipocyte; ATP binding cassette transporter A1; Lipid droplet","ABC transporter; apolipoprotein A1; cholesterol; fat droplet; liver X receptor; messenger RNA; transcription factor; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; adipose tissue cell; animal cell; article; cell differentiation; cholesterol metabolism; cholesterol transport; energy conservation; gene expression regulation; lipolysis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; proadipocyte; protein function; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Animals; Apolipoprotein A-I; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Cell Differentiation; Cholesterol; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Receptors, Retinoic Acid; Retinoid X Receptors; RNA, Messenger; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142010586

We present a detailed study of photosynthetic capacity of cyanobacterial communities measured under natural conditions using chlorophyll fluorescence techniques. Cyanobacteria of extensive and diverse communities grow epi- and endolithically on the bare rock of inselbergs in the tropics where they are exposed to extreme and rapid fluctuations in irradiance, temperature and water availability. Extreme and rapidly changing environmental conditions impose various stresses on cyanobacteria and lead to small-scale niches of different communities along the furrows of an inselberg in French Guiana. These different cyanobacterial communities can easily be separated from each other by their species composition. Moreover, cyanobacteria of these zonal areas show significantly different rates of apparent quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII), are differently adapted to utilize early morning light energy and have different strategies to face rapid cycles of desiccation. These different physiological strategies have led to the development of different cyanobacterial communities in distinct zones which are determined by different resistance to dehydration, water transport and storage capacity. In spite of the extreme environmental conditions with very high solar radiation, predawn measurements of potential quantum yield of PS II showed that they are not photoinhibited. We describe the manifold photosynthetic strategies that have developed in cyanobacteria under these extreme and highly fluctuating natural conditions.","Biological crust; Chlorophyll a fluorescence; Cyanobacterial communities; French Guiana; Gloeocapsa; Inselberg; Light reaction; Photosynthesis; Quantum yield; Scytonema; Stigonema","cyanobacterium; environmental conditions; inselberg; microbial community; photosynthesis; French Guiana; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cyanobacteria; Gloeocapsa; Scytonema; Stigonema",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141907264

Single-sugar solutions were tested on ant workers in a long-term laboratory bioassay in which acceptance of the solutions and ant survival were recorded. The acceptance of the sugars was confirmed in a second bioassay in which feeding time was established. Enzymatic hydrolysis of sucrose, maltose and melibiose was investigated through HPLC analyses of workers fed these disaccharides. Sugar acceptance and feeding time were related to ant survival. Considering the monosaccharide units of which the sugars are composed, fructose seems especially suitable as a short-term energy source, while glucose appears to be used both directly and for storage. The presence of a galactose unit appears to reduce sugar suitability. It is suggested that the workers possess invertase and maltase and to a lesser degree also galactosidase. The gustatory perception is correlated with the profitability of sugars in further metabolic processes.","Acceptance; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Formicidae; Nutritive value; Survival","ant; food preference; metabolism; nutritive value; sugar; survival; animal; ant; article; carbohydrate metabolism; feeding behavior; female; flower; male; physiology; plant; taste; Animals; Ants; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Female; Flowers; Male; Plants, Edible; Taste; Animalia; Formicidae; Hymenoptera; Insecta; Myrmica; Myrmica rubra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141680962

Hepatosomatic indices [HSI: (liver weight/body weight-liver weight)x100] of cultured fish were significantly higher than those of wild fish. Females in the cultured group had significantly lower HSIs than males. The liver of both wild and cultured L. ferruginea was interspersed with pancreatic tissue. The main components of the liver tissue were irregular cords of hepatocytes arranged in tubules which surrounded vascular sinusoids. The hepatocytes contained an abundance of lipid, much of which appeared to be neutral lipids, in both sexes of the cultured fish. Total and neutral lipid droplets were larger, and the area occupied by these droplets was significantly greater in both cultured females and males compared to the wild fish, suggesting lipidosis in the cultured fish. In the cultured fish these differences were sex-dependent, the females having significantly more total and neutral lipids in hepatocytes than the males.

Thus, soil temperature and its variation at various depths are unique parameters that are useful in understanding both the surface energy processes and regional environmental and climatic conditions. Yet, despite the importance, long-term quality data of soil temperatures are not available for the United States. The goal of this study is to fill this data gap and to develop a soil temperature dataset from the historical data of U.S. cooperative stations. Cooperative station soil temperatures at various depths from 1967 to 2002 are collected and examined by a set of quality checks, and erroneous data of extended periods are estimated using methods constructed in this study. After the quality control, the data are used to describe the climatic soil temperature as well as soil temperature change in the contiguous United States. The 35-yr climatological dataset shows that the annual soil temperature at 10-cm depth, at which most stations have soil temperature measurements, decreases gradually from 297 K in the coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico to below 281 K on the United States-Canada border. In seasonal variation, the largest change occurs from spring to summer, during which time soil temperatures are adjusted from the cold season to the warm season, particularly in snow-cover regions. Mild changes are observed from autumn to winter, during which time the soil heat storage still dominates the soil temperature variations. An analysis of the soil temperature variation reveals a warming trend of soil temperatures in most of the stations in the northern and northwestern United States and a large cooling trend in some stations in the southeastern United States. Significant warming is found in the winter and spring season. Potential effects of these trends on regional agriculture are discussed.",,"Cooling; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Interfacial energy; Radiation; Snow; Soils; Soil temperature; Climatology; annual variation; climate conditions; climatology; data set; seasonal variation; soil temperature; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141625690

Since the on-chip caches usually consume a significant amount of power, it is one of the most attractive targets for power reduction. This paper presents a two-level filter scheme, which consists of the L1 and L2 filters, to reduce the power consumption of the on-chip cache. The main idea of the proposed scheme is motivated by the substantial unnecessary activities in conventional cache architecture. We use a single block buffer as the L1 filter to eliminate the unnecessary cache accesses. In the L2 filter, we then propose a new sentry-tag architecture to further filter out the unnecessary way activities in case of the L1 filter miss. We use SimpleScalar to simulate the SPEC2000 benchmarks and perform the HSPICE simulations to evaluate the proposed architecture. Experimental results show that the two-level filter scheme can effectively reduce the cache power consumption by eliminating most unnecessary cache activities, while the compromise of system performance is negligible. Compared to a conventional instruction cache (32 kB, two-way) implemented with only the LI filter, the use of a two-level filter can result in roughly 30% reduction in total cache power consumption. Similarly, compared to a conventional data cache (32 kB, four-way) implemented with only the LI filter, the total cache power reduction is approximately 46%.","Block buffer; Filter scheme; Low-power cache; Power consumption; Unnecessary cache activity","Buffer storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Estimation; Low-power cache; VLSI circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141509028

In this study, we investigate the consequences of such an assumption and we show that it is clearly inappropriate for many classes of inhomogeneous bodies. We choose specific boundary value problems to illustrate the fact that we could be grossly in error, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with regard to local measures such as stresses and strains. In the examples considered, we find that, for global quantities such as applied forces and moments, the error could be significant. Not only could the material parameters found from, say, an extension test and torsion test, which neglect the inhomogeneity of the body, be quite different from one that incorporates the inhomogeneity, but also the values for the material parameter in the homogenized approximation gleaned from these different experiments could be different. In the process of elucidating our thesis, we investigate an important class of deformations, which in view of the paucity of boundary value problems that have been solved for non-linear inhomogeneous solids is worth documenting in its own right.","Extension; Inflation; Inhomogeneous body; Isotropic; Stored energy; Stress","Concretes; Continuum mechanics; Deformation; Difference equations; Elasticity; Energy storage; Inverse problems; Strain; Stress analysis; Tensile testing; Tissue; Torsion testing; Inhomogeneous elastic solids; Composite materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043094059

A number of physiological functions have been ascribed to mannitol, including serving as a reserve carbon source, as an antioxidant, and to store reducing power. In this study, we cloned and characterized the A. niger mpdA gene, which encodes mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase (MPD), the first enzyme in the mannitol biosynthesis pathway. The mpdA promoter contains putative binding sites for the development-specific transcription factors BRLA and ABAA. Furthermore, increased expression of mpdA in sporulating mycelium suggests that mannitol biosynthesis is, to a certain extent, developmentally regulated in A. niger. Inactivation of mpdA abolished mannitol biosynthesis in growing mycelium and reduced the mannitol level in conidiospores to 30% that in the wild type, indicating that MPD and mannitol 1-phosphate phosphatase form the major metabolic pathway for mannitol biosynthesis in A. niger. The viability of spores after prolonged storage and germination kinetics were normal in an mpdA null mutant, indicating that mannitol does not play an essential role as a reserve carbon source in A. niger conidia. However, conidiospores of a ΔmpdA strain were extremely sensitive to a variety of stress conditions, including high temperature, oxidative stress and, to a lesser extent, freezing and lyophilization. Since mannitol supplied in the medium during sporulation repaired this deficiency, mannitol appears to be essential for the protection of A. niger spores against cell damage under these stress conditions.",,"Aspergillus niger; Binding Sites; Cell Death; Cells, Cultured; DNA-Binding Proteins; Energy Metabolism; Fungal Proteins; Genes, Regulator; Mannitol; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Oxidative Stress; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Spores, Fungal; Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases; Transcription Factors; Aspergillus; Aspergillus niger; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042733043

For sensornets, where the content of the data is more important than the identity of the node that gathers them, researchers have found it useful to move away from the Internet's point-to-point communication abstraction and instead adopt abstractions that are more data-centric. This approach entails naming the data and using communication abstractions that refer to those names rather than to node network addresses [1,11]. Previous work on data-centric routing has shown it to be an energy-efficient data dissemination method for sensornets [12]. Herein, we argue that a companion method, data-centric storage (DCS), is also a useful approach. Under DCS, sensed data are stored at a node determined by the name associated with the sensed data. In this paper, we first define DCS and predict analytically where it outperforms other data dissemination approaches. We then describe GHT, a Geographic Hash Table system for DCS on sensornets. GHT hashes keys into geographic coordinates, and stores a key-value pair at the sensor node geographically nearest the hash of its key. The system replicates stored data locally to ensure persistence when nodes fail. It uses an efficient consistency protocol to ensure that key-value pairs are stored at the appropriate nodes after topological changes. And it distributes load throughout the network using a geographic hierarchy. We evaluate the performance of GHT as a DCS system in simulation against two other dissemination approaches. Our results demonstrate that GHT is the preferable approach for the application workloads we analytically predict, offers high data availability, and scales to large sensornet deployments, even when nodes fail or are mobile.","Algorithms; Distributed systems; Performance; Sensor networks","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Distributed computer systems; Internet; Network protocols; Sensors; Topology; Geographic hash tables (GHT); Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042564491

Broiler chickens from 2 to 6 weeks of age received one of three isoenergetic diets containing different macronutrient ratios (low-lipid (LL) 30 v. 77 g lipid/kg; low-protein (LP) 125 v. 197 g crude protein (N X 6.25)/kg; low-carbohydrate (LC) 440 v. 520 g carbohydrate/kg). LP chickens were characterised by significantly lower body weights and food intakes compared with LL and LC chickens (-47 and -38% respectively) but similar heat production/kg metabolic body weight, as measured by indirect calorimetry, in the three groups. However, heat production/g food ingested was higher in animals receiving the LP diet (+41 %, P<0.05). These chickens also deposited 57% less energy as protein (P<0.05) and 33% more as fat. No significant differences in energy and N balances were detected between LL and LC chickens. The diets with the higher fat contents (i.e. the LP and LC diets) induced slightly but significantly higher relative expressions of avian UCP mRNA in gastrocnemius muscle, measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, than the LL diet (88 and 90 v. 78% glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase respectively, P<0.05). Our present results are consistent with the recent view that UCP homologues could be involved in the regulation of lipid utilisation as fuel substrate and provide evidence that the macronutrient content of the diet regulates energy metabolism and especially protein and fat deposition.","Broiler chickens; Energy metabolism; Macronutrients; Uncoupling proteins","carbohydrate; fatty acid; glucose; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; hormone; liothyronine; lipid; messenger RNA; nitrogen; protein; thyroxine; triacylglycerol; uncoupling protein; uric acid; animal experiment; animal model; article; bird; body weight; calorimetry; chicken; controlled study; dietary intake; energy balance; energy metabolism; fat content; fatty acid blood level; food composition; food intake; gastrocnemius muscle; glucose blood level; hormone blood level; ingestion; lipid storage; macronutrient; male; metabolic parameters; metabolic regulation; metabolite; nonhuman; nutrient content; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; skeletal muscle; thermogenesis; thyroid hormone blood level; triacylglycerol blood level; uric acid blood level; Animal Nutrition Physiology; Animals; Avian Proteins; Body Weight; Chickens; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Iodide Peroxidase; Male; Mitochondrial Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Thermogenesis; Thyroxine; Triiodothyronine; Animalia; Aves; Gallus gallus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042563153

The concept of optimality serves as the basis for introducing the various approaches to optimal control of thermal energy storage. Optimal strategies minimizing either energy or demand costs, near-optimal rule based control minimizing total cost, comfort-based energy optimal control, and combined optimal sizing and energy cost optimal control are discussed and contrasted with mathematically non-optimal, but heuristically improved operating strategies. Fully optimal control based on perfect knowledge is introduced and subsequent developments of predictive optimal control subject to uncertain weather, load, and utility rate information illustrated.

We used a simple model containing the essential elements of this functional system to investigate which musculoskeletal features are important for increasing the mechanical work done in a muscle-powered acceleration. The muscle model consisted of a muscle-like actuator with frog hindlimb muscle properties, operating across a lever to accelerate a load. We tested this model in configurations with and without a series elastic element and with and without a variable mechanical advantage. When total muscle shortening was held constant at 30%, the model produced the most work when the muscle operated with a series elastic element and an effective mechanical advantage that increased throughout the contraction (31 J kg-1 muscle vs 26.6 J kg -1 muscle for the non-compliant, constant mechanical advantage configuration). We also compared the model output with the dynamics of jumping bullfrogs, measured by high-speed video analysis, and the length changes of the plantaris muscle, measured by sonomicrometry. This comparison revealed that the length, force and power trajectory of the body of jumping frogs could be accurately replicated by a model of a fully active muscle operating against an inertial load, but only if the model muscle included a series elastic element. Sonomicrometer measurements of the plantaris muscle revealed an unusual, biphasic pattern of shortening, with high muscle velocities early and late in the contraction, separated by a period of slow contraction. The model muscle produced this pattern of shortening only when an elastic element was included. These results demonstrate that an elastic element can increase the work output in a muscle-powered acceleration. Elastic elements uncouple muscle fiber shortening velocity from body movement to allow the muscle fibers to operate at slower shortening velocities and higher force outputs. A variable muscle mechanical advantage improves the effectiveness of elastic energy storage and recovery by providing an inertial catch mechanism. These results can explain the high power outputs observed in jumping frogs. More generally, our model suggests how the function of non-muscular elements of the musculoskeletal system enhances performance in muscle-powered accelerations.","Acceleration; Elastic; Frog; Jumping; Locomotion; Muscle power; Muscle work; Rana catesbeiana; Tendon","animal; article; biological model; biomechanics; comparative study; elasticity; electromyography; frog; gait; motor activity; muscle contraction; physiology; skeletal muscle; Animals; Biomechanics; Elasticity; Electromyography; Gait; Models, Biological; Motor Activity; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Rana catesbeiana; Animalia; Anura; Rana catesbeiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042427696

This is the first common-garden study of geographic variation in cryoprotective responses to freezing and the degree of freeze tolerance. We studied the gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor and H. chrysoscelis) from sympatric sites in Minnesota, Indiana and Missouri. Patterns in the literature suggest that northern frogs produce more cryoprotectants upon freezing, but we found no geographic variation in cryoprotective responses or degree of freeze tolerance. The concentration of glucose produced upon freezing was higher than previously reported for this species (liver: 475 μmol g-1 dry mass). Unfrozen frogs had high levels of glycerol (liver: approx. 150 μmol g -1 dry mass), and did not produce more upon freezing. Liver glycogen content (concentration multiplied by liver mass) was highest in frogs from Minnesota and Missouri, and was stored in preference to lipids in Minnesota frogs, possibly to provide energy for the longer northern winters. Minnesota frogs accumulated more ice (53.4±1.8%) after freezing to -2.5°C than Indiana frogs (45.5±3.3%). The two species differed in body size but not in any of the physiological parameters measured. We conclude that these populations show no adaptive variation in freeze tolerance and that comparing published studies may be misleading because of different acclimation and feeding regimes.","Cryoprotection; Freeze tolerance; Glucose; Glycogen; Gray treefrog; H. chrysoscelis; Hyla versicolor; Liver","cryoprotective agent; glucose; glycerol; glycogen; lactic acid; acclimatization; animal; article; comparative study; evolution; freezing; frogs and toads; geography; metabolism; physiology; United States; Acclimatization; Animals; Anura; Cryoprotective Agents; Evolution; Freezing; Geography; Glucose; Glycerol; Glycogen; Lactic Acid; Midwestern United States; Animalia; Anura; Hyla; Hyla chrysoscelis; Hyla versicolor; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042427418

Seventeen patients underwent iliac crest bone biopsy for histomorphometric analyses. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements were performed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Most patients had growth retardation and delayed bone age. BMD was low especially at the lumbar spine. Serum IGF-I levels were almost always low. Bone histomorphometry revealed increased osteoid thickness, osteoid maturation time, and mineralization lag time, which indicate impaired bone matrix maturation and defective mineralization. In addition, iron deposits appeared along mineralization fronts and osteoid surfaces. Moreover, focal thickened osteoid seams were found together with focal iron deposits. Dynamic bone formation study revealed reduced bone formation rate.

For example, the combination of SQP and FEM has been proven to be an efficient tool in the optimization of low temperature superconductors (LTS) superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) magnets. The procedure can also be applied for the optimization of HTS magnets. However, due to a strongly anisotropic material and a slanted electric field, current density characteristic high temperature superconductors HTS optimization is quite different from that of the LTS. In this paper the volumes of solenoidal conduction-cooled Bi-2223/Ag SMES magnets have been optimized at the operation temperature of 20 K. In addition to the electromagnetic constraints the stress caused by the tape bending has also been taken into account. Several optimization runs with different initial geometries were performed in order to find the best possible solution for a certain energy requirement. The optimization constraints describe the steady-state operation, thus the presented coil geometries are designed for slow ramping rates.

The energetic formulation has the major advantage that it is defined for a larger class of processes since it does not involve any derivatives of the strains or the internal variables, thus allowing for an analysis of processes involving sharp interfaces, localization or microstructure. Two new quantities are derived from ψ̂ and Δ̂. First, this is the global dissipation distance D̂ on the manifold of internal states. Second, the reduced stored-energy density ψred contains the comprised information of the elastic and plastic material properties via minimization of ψ̂+D̂ over the new internal variable.

Four solutions were used to flush and store porcine hearts: St. Thomas Hospital Solution (STHS), University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, and UW+90mM histidine, and UW+90 mM histidine+11 mM glucose. Despite equivalent increases in lactate in the two histidine-buffered groups throughout 10 h of storage, glycogen utilization was evident in the group without supplemental glucose. The presence of glucose resulted in a reduction in energy production, presumably mediated by direct inhibition of glycogenolysis. Furthermore, UW + histidine was the only group to show consistent improvements in ATP and total adenylates. It was concluded that inclusion of the buffering agent, histidine, to UW solution promotes anaerobic energy production as a result, in part, of preserved high levels of the regulatory control enzyme, phosphofructokinase.","Anaerobic metabolism; Cardiac preservation; Energetics; Glycolysis; PH buffer","adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; glucose; glycogen; histidine; lactic acid; preservative; St Thomas Hospital solution; University of Wisconsin solution; anaerobic metabolism; animal tissue; article; controlled study; energy transfer; energy yield; glucose metabolism; glycogenolysis; heart preservation; nonhuman; pH; swine; Adenine Nucleotides; Animals; Body Water; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Glycogen Phosphorylase; Glycolysis; Histidine; Isocitrate Dehydrogenase; Lactates; Myocardium; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Phosphocreatine; Phosphofructokinase-1; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042265177

The films were compared to currently employed magnetron sputtered CNx overcoats in terms of functionality-determining film properties. X-Ray reflectivity (XRR) was used to determine film thicknesses and has been proved to be accurately applicable to carbon coatings down to ∼1 nm thickness. Time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) sputter depth profiling has proved similar carbon penetration depths into the unerlying magnetic media, both for HCA deposition and magnetron sputtering (MS), in spite of considerably higher deposition energies occurring during the HCA process. This fact suggests no negative impact on the macroscopic magnetic properties due to HCA deposition. The minimum thicknesses for full coverage of the media were evaluated by applying X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to the different film types. The results show a coverage limit of ∼1.0 nm for HCA coatings in contrast to ∼2.0-3.0 nm for CNx coatings indicating a significantly improved corrosion performance for overcoat thicknesses below 3 nm. Characterization with an AFM-based Nanoscratching technique suggests a more than two times increased resistivity against plastic deformation for HCA films compared to magnetron sputtered CNx overcoats. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Many animal and human states of insulin resistance have increased muscle triglyceride content, and there are now plausible mechanistic links between muscle lipid accumulation and insulin resistance, which go beyond the classic glucose-fatty acid cycle. We postulate that muscle cytosolic accumulation of the metabolically active long-chain fatty acyl CoAs (LCA-CoA) is involved, leading to insulin resistance and impaired insulin signalling or impaired enzyme activity (e.g. glycogen synthase or hexokinase) either directly or via chronic translocation/activation of mediators such as a protein kinase C (particularly PKC θ and ε). Ceramides and diacylglycerols (DAGs) have also been implicated in forms of lipid-induced muscle insulin resistance. Dietary lipid-induced muscle insulin resistance in rodents is relatively easily reversed by manipulations that lessen cytosolic lipid accumulation (e.g. diet change, exercise or fasting). PPAR agonists (both γ and α) also lower muscle LCACoA and enhance insulin sensitivity. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by AICAR leads to muscle enhancement (especially glycolytic muscle) of insulin sensitivity, but involvement of altered lipid metabolism is less clear cut. In rodents there are similarities in the pattern of muscle lipid accumulation/PKC translocation/altered insulin signalling/insulin resistance inducible by 3-5-h acute free fatty acid elevation, 1-4 days intravenous glucose infusion or several weeks of high-fat feeding. Recent studies extend findings and show relevance to humans. Muscle cytosolic lipids may accumulate either by increased fatty acid flux into muscle, or by reduced fatty acid oxidation. In some circumstances muscle insulin resistance may be an adaptation to optimize use of fatty acids when they are the predominant available energy fuel. The interactions described here are fundamental to optimizing therapy of insulin resistance based on alterations in muscle lipid metabolism.","Acyl CoAs; Ceramide; Diacylglycerol; Dietary fat; Fatty acid tracers; In vivo insulin action; Muscle; Protein kinase C","acyl coenzyme A; ceramide; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; diacylglycerol; fatty acid; glucose; glycogen synthase; hexokinase; hexosamine; insulin; lipid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; protein kinase C; bioaccumulation; conference paper; cytosol; fat intake; fatty acid transport; glucose metabolism; human; insulin resistance; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; muscle level; muscle metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; Acyl Coenzyme A; Animals; Ceramides; Cytosol; Dietary Fats; Diglycerides; Glucose; Hexosamines; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Models, Biological; Muscles; Protein Kinase C",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042160182

Fatty acid transport has been studied by the complementary approaches of cell biology and biophysics. According to the latter approach, specific proteins that enhance the uptake and storage of fatty acids are posited as fatty acid translocases, which facilitate fatty acid movement from the outer to inner leaflets of the plasma membrane. According to biophysical studies conducted in vitro, fatty acid translocation occurs by a rapid diffusive process that does not require a protein.

All measurements were carried out using the heavy-ion Test Storage Ring at the Max-Planck-Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. We have also calculated these resonance strengths and energies using three independent, state-of-the-art perturbative techniques: a multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) method using the code AUTOSTRUCTURE, a multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) method, and a relativistic configuration interaction method using the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC). Overall, reasonable agreement is found between our experimental results and our theoretical calculations. The most notable discrepancies tend to occur for relative collision energies ≤3 eV. We have used our measured 2 → 2 results to produce Maxwellian-averaged rate coefficients for Fe XXI and Fe XXII. Our experimentally derived rate coefficients are estimated to be accurate to better than ≈20% both for Fe XXI at kB Te &gt; 0.5eV and for Fe XXII at kBTe &gt; 0.001 eV. For these results, we provide fits that are accurate to better than 0.5% for Fe XXI at 0.001 eV ≤ kBTe ≤ 10,000 eV and for Fe XXII at 0.02 eV≲kBTe ≤ 10,000 eV. Our fitted rate coefficients are suitable for ionization balance calculations involving Fe XXI and Fe XXII in photoionized plasmas. Previous published Burgess formula and LS-coupling calculations are in poor agreement with our experimentally derived rate coefficients. None of these published calculations reliably reproduce the magnitude or temperature dependence of our experimental results. Our previously published Fe XXI MCDF results are in good agreement with our experimental results for kBTe≲0.07 eV. For both ions in this temperature range our new MCBP, MCDF, and FAC results are in excellent agreement with our experimentally derived rate coefficient.","Atomic data; Atomic processes; Methods: laboratory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042073181

The H. pylori nikR product acts as a pleiotropic metal-dependent regulator. We constructed a non-polar isogenic mutant deleted for the nikR gene. NikR was essential for the survival of H. pylori in the presence of high nickel and cobalt ion concentrations in vitro. We screened a DNA macroarray for genes that were differentially expressed in parental and nikR-deficient H. pylori strains grown in the presence of excess nickel. We found that H. pylori NikR mediates the expression of nickel-activated and -repressed genes. In the presence of excess nickel, NikR activated the transcription of ureA-ureB (hp72-73), nixA (hp1077), copA2 (hp1072), hpn (hp1427) and hpn-like (hp1432) genes and repressed the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in ferric iron uptake and storage [pfr (hp0653), fur (hp1027), frpB4 (hp1512), exbB/exbD (hp1339-1340), ceuE (hp1561)], motility [cheV (hp616), flaA (hp0601), flaB (hp0115)], stress responses [hrcA-grpE-dnaK (hp111-110-109)] and encoding outer-membrane proteins [omp11(hp0472), omp31 (hp1469), omp32 (hp1501)]. Slot blot DNA/RNA hybridization experiments using RNA from three independent bacterial cultures confirmed the transcriptome data for 10 selected genes. The results of gel shift experiments using purified native NikR, β-galactosidase assays with the region between nikR and the exbB/exbD divergent operon, and the study of exbB gene expression using a gentamicin/apramycin reporter gene in H. pylori indicated that NikR is an autorepressor that binds to this intergenic region and also controls the expression of the exbB/exbD/tonB operon, which provides energy for ferric iron uptake. Thus, as previously suggested for Fur in H. pylori, NikR appears to be a global regulator of the metabolism of some divalent cations within a highly complex regulated network.",,"apramycin; bacterial protein; bacterial RNA; beta galactoside; cobalt; ferric ion; gentamicin; heat shock protein; nickel; outer membrane protein; protein NikR; unclassified drug; article; autoregulation; bacterial gene; bacterial survival; ceue gene; cheV gene; copA2 gene; DNA hybridization; DNA microarray; dnaK gene; exbB gene; exbD gene; flaa gene; flaB gene; frpB4 gene; fur gene; gene activation; gene deletion; gene expression; gene repression; grpE gene; Helicobacter pylori; hpn gene; hpn like gene; hrcA gene; hybrid gene; iron storage; iron transport; NikR gene; nixA gene; nonhuman; omp11 gene; omp31 gene; omp32 gene; operon; pfr gene; priority journal; protein analysis; protein function; reporter gene; RNA hybridization; TonB gene; transcription regulation; ureA gene; ureB gene; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Chromosomes, Bacterial; Escherichia coli Proteins; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genetic Vectors; Helicobacter pylori; Molecular Sequence Data; Nickel; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Open Reading Frames; Operon; Recombinant Proteins; Repressor Proteins; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Helicobacter; Helicobacter pylori",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042065267

The role of CPA in regulating the oxidation and esterification of palmitate, the hydrolysis of intramuscular lipids, and the activation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was examined in isolated rat soleus muscles at rest. CPA (40 μM) was added to the incubation medium to levels that resulted in subcontraction increases in muscle tension, and lipid metabolism was monitored using the previously described pulse-chase procedure. CPA did not alter the cellular energy state, as reflected by similar muscle contents of ATP, phosphocreatine, free AMP, and free ADP. CPA increased total palmitate uptake into soleus muscle (11%, P &lt; 0.05) and was without effect on palmitate oxidation. This resulted in greater esterification of exogenous palmitate into the triacylglycerol (18%, P &lt; 0.05) and phospholipid (89%, P &lt; 0.05) pools. CPA decreased (P &lt; 0.05) intramuscular lipid hydrolysis, and this occurred as a result of reduced HSL activity (20%, P &lt; 0.05). Incubation of muscles with 3 mM caffeine, which is also known to increase Ca2+ without affecting the cellular energy state, reduced HSL activity (24%, P &lt; 0.05). KN-93, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CaMKII), blocked the effects of CPA and caffeine, and HSL activity returned to preincubation values. The results of the present study demonstrate that CPA simultaneously decreases intramuscular triacylglycerol (IMTG) hydrolysis and promotes lipid storage in isolated, intact soleus muscle. The decreased IMTG hydrolysis is likely mediated by reduced HSL activity, possibly via the CaMKII pathway. These responses are not consistent with the increased hydrolysis and decreased esterification observed in contracting muscle when substrate availability and the hormonal milieu are tightly controlled. It is possible that more powerful signals or a higher [Ca2+] may override the lipid-storage effect of the CPA-mediated effects during muscular contractions.","Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibitor; Fat; Metabolism","adenosine diphosphate; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; caffeine; calcium ion; cyclopiazonic acid; fatty acid; palmitic acid; phospholipid; protein kinase (calcium,calmodulin); protein kinase inhibitor; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; animal tissue; article; controlled study; enzyme activity; esterification; fatty acid oxidation; female; hormone sensitivity; hydrolysis; lipid metabolism; metabolite; muscle contraction; muscle tone; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; skeletal muscle; soleus muscle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041846865

As part of a project to sequence the entire S. kunkelii genome, we analyzed an 85-kb DNA segment from the pathogenic strain CR2-3x. This genome segment contains 101 ORFs and two tRNA genes. The majority of the ORFs code for predicted proteins that can be assigned to respective clusters of orthologous groups (COGs). These COGs cover diverse functional categories including genetic information storage and processing, cellular processes, and metabolism. The most notable gene cluster in this genome segment is a super-operon capable of encoding 24 ribosomal proteins. The organization of genes in this operon reflects the unique evolutionary position of the spiroplasma. Gene duplications, domain rearrangements, and frameshift mutations in the segment are interpreted as indicators of phase variation in the spiroplasma.

The solar still is of greenhouse asymmetric type, the basin of which is in direct contact with a hot water storage tank as an integral part of the still, ensuring thus continuos transfer of heat from the hot water tank to the basin saline water. The thermal behavior of the system was investigated by several series of measurements with the saline water temperature kept constant in different temperature levels. It has been found that this design leads to higher water outputs as the water temperature increases but more important is the shift of water production towards night periods. Moreover, water production rate is almost constant through out the whole period. It has also been found that coupling solar still with hot water tank changes the whole behavior of the solar still in such way that in the coupled system solar still acts as a condensing unit and not also as a energy collecting unit, the case of the solar still itself. For this, changes in solar radiation do not affect the system productivity. Finally, experimental data concerning day and night distilled water production are compared with the ones already taken in the solar still only, indicating the effectiveness and benefits of coupling the storage tank with the still. It is proven that the operation of the solar still-storage tank system is advantageous over the still itself regarding production quantity, distribution, rate pattern with the ability to exploit in an optimum way available heat sources nearby such as waste heat, geothermal energy, conventional heat, etc.","Distilled water productivity; Heat source; Heat storage; Solar still","Condensation; Geothermal energy; Heat transfer; Industrial laboratories; Solar radiation; Solar still-storage tank systems; Water resources; distillation; experimental method; performance; solar still; storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041704535

We have taken a global approach to gene expression analysis of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in response to iron by combining efficient, high-throughput methods with sensitive, luminescent reporting of gene expression using a random promoter library. Real-time expression profiles of the library were generated under low- and high-iron conditions to identify iron-regulated promoters, including a number of previously identified genes. Our results indicate that approximately 7% of the genome may be regulated directly or indirectly by iron. Further analysis of these clones using a Fur titration assay revealed three separate classes of genes; two of these classes consist of Fur-regulated genes. A third class was Fur independent and included both negatively and positively iron-responsive genes. These may reflect new iron-dependent regulons. Iron-responsive genes included iron transporters, iron storage and mobility proteins, iron-containing proteins (redox proteins, oxidoreductases, and cytochromes), transcriptional regulators, and the energy transducer tonB. By identifying a wide variety of iron-responsive genes, we extend our understanding of the global effect of iron availability on gene expression in the bacterial cell.",,"bacterial protein; carrier protein; cytochrome; gene product; iron regulatory factor; oxidoreductase; protein TonB; unclassified drug; article; bacterial gene; concentration response; energy transfer; gene expression profiling; gene library; iron responsive element; iron storage; iron transport; luminescence; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; promoter region; Salmonella enterica; titrimetry; transcription regulation; Bacterial Proteins; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Library; Genome, Bacterial; Iron; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Repressor Proteins; Salmonella typhimurium; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Prokaryota; Salmonella; Salmonella enterica; Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041530033

After 2 and 3 months on the diet, LSD rats showed increased amounts of lipid in carcass and retroperitoneal tissue. In both LSD and NSD, extending the feeding period from 2 to 3 months resulted in a marked reduction in the in vivo rates of adipose tissue fatty acid synthesis that was accompanied by increases in liver lipogenesis and in the activity of adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL). However, these increases were more marked in LSD rats. Thus, in vivo rates of liver fatty synthesis and LPL activity in LSD rats, which were already higher (by about 35% and 20%, respectively) than in controls after 2 months, attained levels 50% higher than those in NSD animals after another month on the diet. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic capacity, estimated after 2 and 3 months by the tissue temperature response to norepinephrine (NE) injection and by guanosine diphosphate (GDP) binding to BAT mitochondria, did not change in controls, but was significantly reduced in LSD rats. This raises the possibility that a decrease in overall energy expenditure, together with an LPL-induced increased uptake of preformed fatty acids from the circulation, may account for the excessive lipid accumulation in LSD rats. Taken together, the data indicate that prolonged dietary sodium restriction exacerbates normal, age-related changes in white and BAT metabolism. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In different tests, slow electrons, and 4 keV electrons were used to charge surfaces of 50 μm polyimide to about 500 V while the opposite surfaces were copper metalized and grounded. The subsequent decay of surface voltage can be interpreted as a current through the resistivity of the dielectric. The same samples tested by classical ASTM and IEC methods provided resistivities of order 1E16 Ωcm, but when tested by our evacuated charge decay method the resistivity was 5E19-5E20 Ωcm or more. Charging with low energy electrons produced resistivity data reasonably similar to that produced by charging with 4 keV electron beams. The gamma irradiation, followed by one month of rest under no bias, reduced the resistivity by a factor of 2 in both materials. Raising temperature from the normal 20-50 °C reduced the resistivity in Kapton, but the reduction was not observable in the LaRC-SI material. Even after 20 days of ""constant-bias"" the rate of fractional charge loss continued to decline indicating that polarization current rather than ideal resistivity may be the cause of most voltage decay, and that the true resistivity is higher than the values determined here, and much higher by several orders of magnitude than the values determined in classical ASTM and IEC test procedures. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In the common rest frame of the ion and the electron beam the ion is subjected to a drag force and it experiences a loss or a gain of energy which eventually reduces the energy spread of the ion beam. A calculation of this process is complicated as the electron velocity distribution is anisotropic and the cooling process takes place in a magnetic field which guides the electrons. In this paper the drag force and the energy loss are calculated in a model of binary collisions between ions and magnetized electrons, in which the Coulomb interaction is treated up to second order as a perturbation to the helical motion of the electrons. The energy loss is related to the transfer of relative velocity in a collision. Particular attention must be paid to the non-conservation of the center-of-mass motion in the presence of a magnetic field. Three kinetic regimes can be identified, depending on the relative magnitude of the distance of closest approach, the cyclotron radius and the pitch of the helical motion. Closed expressions for the energy loss are derived for monochromatic electron beams, which are folded with the velocity distribution of the electrons. Hard collisions are taken into account by regularizing the integrals with respect to the impact parameter at small distances. The resulting energy loss of the ion and the drag force are evaluated for anisotropic Maxwell velocity distributions of the electrons. The influence of the magnetic field is as follows: the energy loss is reduced if the ion moves parallel to the field, while it is enhanced if the ion velocity has a component transverse to the field. This enhancement is not as large as in the dielectric theory and in previous kinetic models. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Three key questions are asked: (i) when is it cost-effective to carry out the transition away from gasoline/diesel; (ii) to which fuel is it cost-effective to shift; and (iii) in which sector is biomass most cost-effectively used? These questions are analyzed using a global energy systems model (GET 1.0), with a transportation module, where vehicle costs (fuel cell, reformer and storage tank), infrastructure and primary energy availability are treated explicitly. The model is run under the assumption that atmospheric concentrations of CO2 should be stabilized at 400 ppm. Three main results emerge: (i) despite the stringent CO2 constraints, oil-based fuels remain dominant in the transportation sector over the next 50 years; and (ii) once a transition towards alternative fuels takes place, the preferred choice of fuel is hydrogen, even if we assume that hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are substantially more costly than methanol fuel cell vehicles. There may, under some circumstances, be a transient period of several decades with a significant share of methanol in the transportation sector. (iii) Biomass is most cost-effectively used in the heat and process heat sectors. If carbon sequestration from biomass is allowed, biomass is primarily used for hydrogen generation since small-scale heat applications are not suitable for carbon sequestration. Detailed sensitivity analyses show that these results are robust with respect to several parameters. Some policy conclusions are drawn. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis technique was applied to the PCMs after 0, 120, 560, 850 and 1200 melt/freeze cycles in order to measure the melting temperatures and the latent heats of fusion of the PCMs. The DSC results indicated that the change in melting temperature for the PCMs was in the range of 0.07-7.87 °C, and the change in latent heat of fusion was -1.0% to -27.7%, except for stearic acid between 560 and 1200 melt/freeze cycles. However, the decrease in the latent heats of fusion for all the PCMs was not regular with increasing thermal cycles.

This facility utilizes intra-cavity back-scattering of the FEL photons in order to produce a γ-flux enhancement of approximately 103 over the existifig sources. At present, gamma-ray beams with energies ranging from 2 to 50 MeV are available with intensities of 105-107 γ/s, energy spreads of 1% or better (with lower intensities), and 100% linear polarization. An upgrade is presently underway which will allow for the production of γ rays up to an energy of about 225 MeV having intensities in excess of 108 γ/sec. The primary component of the upgrade is a 1.2 GeV booster-injector which will provide for efficient injection at any chosen operating energy of the storage ring from 300 MeV to 1.2 GeV. In addition, an upgrade of the present OK-4 FEL to a helical undulator system (OK-5) is underway. This new system has many advantages over the present one, including making switchable linear and circularly polarized beams available, an increase in power and a decrease in mirror-damaging radiation. The full system, including the booster injector, is expected to be ready for use by 2006. TUNL researchers, in collaboration with outside theoretical and experimental colleagues, have proposed a broad based research program in nuclear physics which is designed to exploit the unique flux, energy resolution and polarization of the HIγS beams. A description of the presently available facility and the anticipated facility following the present upgrades will be given in this review, along with a description of recent and planned experiments.","Free-electron laser; Laser Compton backscattering, γ-rays","deuterium; helium; oxygen; proton; gamma radiation; laser; mathematical analysis; nuclear physics; photon; polarization; radiation beam; short survey",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043028394

First, an effective temperature change that equivalently describes the distribution of the residual strains is implemented into a two-dimensional stress analysis. The locations and magnitudes of the maximum radial stress and strains are then derived and the delamination indices are accordingly defined in terms of the inner and outer radius ratio and the material properties. The present method is numerically validated using the results from the cure-simulation program WINDTHICK. Thick rings are made of T300/epoxy, and the residual strains in the radial and hoop directions are measured using a split-ring method, i.e., cutting the ring in the radial direction and releasing the residual stresses. The measured residual stains are in good agreement with the analytical results. It is shown that the effective temperature change remains the same over a wide range of the ring thickness. Delaminations observed in the tests are successfully predicted using the present method, and the rings of the geometric similarity experience a delamination at the same temperature drop.","Delamination; Flywheel; Residual strains; Split-ring test; Thick wound composite ring","Composite materials; Delamination; Energy storage; Flywheels; Residual stresses; Strain; Split-ring test; Rings (components)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037481663

Yet, the issue of the effects of energy dissipated on the metallurgical changes has not been found to be resolved successfully. The systems modelling approach of the dynamic materials model (DMM) has been extended to a study of the stress-strain curve. Definition of a parameter called the energy storage ratio (ESR) enables tracking of the metallurgical processes that underlie the stress-strain curve. It is established that the onset of dynamic recrystallisation corresponds to a constant critical value of the ESR which is independent of strain rate and temperature. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The performance of the battery charged using the VCD protocol was compared with the performance of batteries charged with conventional constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) and constant voltage (CV) protocols. The destructive physical analysis tests at the end of 150 cycles indicated higher impedance for the cells cycled using the VCD protocol compared to the cell charged using the conventional (CC-CV) mode. The observed increase of the impedance was due to a small increase of the potential above the cut-off value of 4.2 for short times.

Small bowels from Sprague-Dawley rats (n=4) were flushed vascularly with modified UW solution and flushed luminally: group 1, none (clinical control); group 2, UW solution; group 3, 1-hr oxygenated perfusion then static storage with UW; and group 4, 24-hr continuous oxygenated perfusion with UW. Energetics, lipid peroxidation, and histology were assessed during 24 hr at 4°C. Results. After 12 hr, adenosine triphosphate ranged from 0.5 to 0.8 μmol/g in groups 1 to 3 compared with 1.5 μmol/g in group 4. Even after 24 hr, levels in group 4 were more than twofold greater than levels in groups 1 to 3. Energy charge values ([adenosine triphosphate+adenosine diphosphate/2]/total adenylates) decreased from fresh tissue values of 0.69 in all groups except group 4 throughout 24-hr perfusion. Malondialdehyde (MDA; a product of lipid peroxidation) doubled within 4 hr in group 1 and remained high throughout storage. In groups 3 and 4, MDA levels increased as the time of perfusion increased; group 2 showed no elevated MDA levels at any time. After 12 hr, histologic integrity was superior in groups 3 and 4; however after 24 hr, the best Park's grade was observed in group 3 (median grade 4) compared with groups 1 (grade 7) and 4 (grade 6). Conclusions. Our data indicate that perfusion clearly improves tissue energetics; however, mucosal integrity is superior with only a brief 1-hr period of luminal perfusion, despite limited improvements in energetics.",,"adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; malonaldehyde; University of Wisconsin solution; animal tissue; article; controlled study; energy transfer; histology; hypothermia; intestine perfusion; lipid peroxidation; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; small intestine; tissue preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038638403

Since hypothalamus is a key brain region involved in many peripheral signals and neuronal pathways that control energy homeostasis and food intake, we investigated if during pregnancy the increase in food intake is mediated by stimulating orexigenic and/or inhibiting anorexigenic neural pathways. We examined hypothalamic gene expressions of Ob-Rb, NPY, AgRP, POMC, MC4-R, and preproorexins in pregnant Wistar rats at day 19 of gestation. Food intake and body weight were increased progressively during the pregnancy. Visceral fat mass depots and serum leptin levels were also increased when compared with virgin animals. No differences were found in mRNA expression of Ob-Rb, POMC, MC4-R, NPY or preproorexin between virgin and pregnant animals. However, pregnancy produced a selective increase in AgRP mRNA levels. These results indicate that the positive energy balance that occurred during pregnancy can hardly be explained by changes in Ob-Rb despite hyperleptinemia associated with pregnancy. The enhanced expression of AgRP suggests the involvement of this neuropeptide in mediating pregnancy-associated hyperphagia. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The design characteristics and dynamics of the bearing associated with the rotor part are presented. The instrumentation measures the out of balance force and magnetomechanical stiffness associated with the rotor. A study of the rotational losses was performed using free spin down experiments associated with magnetic field variation measurements.

It retains the photochromic and spectroscopic properties of each individual molecular component and the changes in the property of one component influence the fluorescence quantum yield of the other. The write form is a polar closed structure molecule that does not fluoresce. When transformed into the read form it exhibits an open structure, is non-polar and allows for intense fluorescence. The read form excited state is located at 660 nm, which is at lower energy than the excited state of the write form, therefore no erasing occurs while reading. Erasing is achieved by excitation at 400 nm, which is higher than 530 nm write energy.

This study examined the levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY), and of Y1, Y2, Y5 and leptin receptor mRNA expression in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Arc) of chronic high-energy diet-induced obese (DIO) and resistant (DR) mice. Forty mice were divided into two groups and fed either a high-fat (HF: 40% of calories from fat, 20% of calories from saturated fat; n=34) or low-fat (LF: 10% of calories from fat, 1% from saturated fat; n=6) diet. After 22 weeks of feeding, visceral fat accumulation was 69% higher in DIO mice compared with DR mice, and the former showed a moderate level of glucose intolerance. In DIO mice, the levels of NPY and leptin receptor mRNA expressions were significantly higher than in LF mice (+32 and +14%, P<0.001 and 0.05 respectively), indicating central leptin resistance, whereas the DR and LF groups did not differ. The level of Y2 receptor mRNA expression was similar between the DIO and LF groups but, importantly, was reduced ≈20% in DR mice (P<0.005). The level of Y5 receptor mRNA was 36% lower in DR mice than DIO mice (P<0.05). The differences between DIO and DR mice identified by this study may assist in a better understanding of genetic predisposition to an increased fat deposition induced by a chronic high-fat diet. A low level of Y2 and Y5 receptor mRNA expression may contribute to the prevention of chronic high-energy diet-induced obesity in DR mice. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The mechanisms involved have implications for the pathogenesis of obesity and type II diabetes. Recent findings: Recent studies have identified some of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms which control whole body and hepatic carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, thus providing the basis of the liver's role in the control of food intake, metabolism, and body weight. Fatty acids are known to effect gene transcription in various ways. Advances in our understanding of the control of glucose and lipid utilization by the liver include (1) a better functional characterization of some newly discovered transcription factors, (2) new discoveries concerning the physiological and pathophysiological role of hepatic glucokinase and of the glycogen-targeting subunits of protein phosphatase-1, and (3) the demonstration of substantial overlap in the molecular control mechanisms of glucose-lipid utilization. Also, impaired insulin signaling due to a certain gene (Foxo1) has emerged as a possible unifying mechanism for various common metabolic abnormalities of type II diabetes. Finally, recent findings confirm and extend previous knowledge about the important role of hepatic nerves in the control of liver and whole body glucose-lipid utilization. Summary: The identification of new molecular and neural mechanisms of the hepatic control of glucose-lipid utilization and body weight provides a focus for future studies and may eventually help to develop new treatments for obesity and type II diabetes. © 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Eating; Fat synthesis; Fatty acid oxidation; Gluconeogenesis; Glycogenolysis; Insulin; Obesity; Type II diabetes","body weight; carbohydrate metabolism; energy balance; fatty acid oxidation; food intake; gluconeogenesis; glucose utilization; glycogenolysis; human; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; liver function; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; review; weight gain; Body Weight; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucose; Humans; Insulin; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Obesity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4944238844

The market model is a simplified version of the New Zealand wholesale electricity market, with prices modelled by a first-order Markov process. The demand for electricity is not explicitly modelled. The hydroelectric generator is assumed to be unable to influence market prices (i.e., to be a price-taker). We discuss the resulting stochastic dynamic program, methods for its solution, and the explicit optimal offer curves that it produces. It is shown that the utility function is monotone increasing with respect to both reservoir level and current price; however, the optimal offer curves need not be monotone. This is shown by example.

The different components of chloroplast were isolated and the concentration of REEs in each component was determined by ICP-MS. The experimental data indicated that about 8% of total leaf REEs was present in the chloroplast of Dicranopteris dichotoma. In order to thoroughly study the distribution of REEs among different components of chloroplast, the membrane of chloroplast, the intact thylakoid and the photosystem II (PS II system) of D. dichotoma were isolated from the chloroplast. It was found that half of total chloroplast REEs was stored at the membrane of the chloroplast and another half was in the thylakoid. And 25% of total chloroplast REEs was bound with PS II system of D.dichotoma. The concentration of REEs in chlorophyll a was only at the level of μg/g on the bases of chlorophylls.

N2N 2GL, United States","With the increase in the drainage and extraction of peat for horticultural, agricultural and energy purposes worldwide, there is an increased pressure to restore hydrological conditions essential to the re-establishment of Sphagnum mosses and, therefore, carbon sequestration. Measurements of ecosystem CO 2 were conducted at a recently restored vacuum harvested bog in Eastern Québec, Canada. The peatland was restored by blocking the drainage networks to return optimal water table positions for the growth of Sphagnum mosses and the spreading of a dense straw mulch layer to reduce evaporative losses and stabilize the surface for the moss re-growth. However, the return of the moss species is a gradual process and previous studies have suggested that initially the carbon loss from the system actually increase as the mulch decomposes. We examined old and new mulch CO2 production in lab incubations and scaled these results to the ecosystem level in order to determine if mulch decomposition is impeding the net carbon sink function of this peatland. At mean growing season temperatures fresh mulch was observed to release 151.5 μmol CO2 g-1 per day, while older mulch released 145 μmol CO2 g-1 per day. Furthermore, under moist conditions the CO2 release increased for all mulches. However, contrary to most assumptions, Q10 values for all mulches decreased with increasing temperatures and were greater for older mulch than for fresh. Thus, in the short term, the application of a surface straw mulch layer can have significant effects on the carbon balance of a restored peatland. Due to the decomposition of this mulch layer over the first several seasons of restoration, the peatland became a larger source of CO2, despite the increase in production of a re-emerging vegetation layer. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A diet with addition to normal barley of malt from transgenic barley expressing a protein engineered, thermotolerant Bacillus (1,3-1,4)-β- glucanase during germination has previously been demonstrated to provide a broiler chicken weight gain comparable to maize diets. It also reduced dramatically the number of birds with adhering sticky droppings, but did not entirely eliminate sticky droppings. One of the objectives of the broiler chicken trials reported here was to determine if higher concentrations of transgenic malt could alleviate the sticky droppings. 2. Another aim was to investigate the feasibility of using mature transgenic grain containing the thermotolerant (1,3-1,4)-β-glucanase as feed addition and to compare diets containing transgenic grain to a diet with the recommended amount of a commercial β-glucanase-based product. 3. Inclusion of 75 or 151 g/kg transgenic malt containing 4.7 or 98 mg/kg thermotolerant (1,3-1,4)-β- glucanase with 545 or 469 g/kg non-transgenic barley instead of maize yielded a weight gain in Cornish Cross broiler chickens indistinguishable from presently used maize diets. The gene encoding the enzyme is expressed in the aleurone with a barley α-amylase gene promoter and the enzyme is synthesised with a signal peptide for secretion into the endosperm of the malting grain. 4. Equal weight gain was achieved, when the feed included 39 g/kg transgenic barley grain [containing 66 mg/kg thermotolerant (1,3-1,4)-β-glucanase] and 581 g/kg non-transgenic barley instead of maize. In this case, the gene encoding the enzyme has been expressed with the D-hordein gene (Hor3-1) promoter during grain maturation. The enzyme is synthesised as a precursor with a signal peptide for transport through the endoplasmic reticulum and targeted into the storage vacuoles. Deposition of the enzyme in the prolamin storage protein bodies of the endosperm protects it from degradation during the programmed cell death of the endosperm in the final stages of grain maturation and provides extraordinary heat stability. The large amount of highly active (1,3-1,4)-β-glucanase in the mature grain allowed the reduction of the transgenic grain ingredient to 0.2 g/kg diet, thus making the ingredient comparable to that of the trace minerals added to standard diets. 5. A direct comparison using transgenic grain supplement at the level of 1 g/kg of feed with the standard recommended addition of the commercial enzyme preparation Avizyme 1100® at 1 g/kg yielded equal weight gain, feed consumption and feed efficiency in birds fed a barley-based diet. 6. The production of sticky droppings characteristic of broilers fed on barley diets was avoided with all 9 experimental diets and reduced to the level observed with a standard maize diet by supplementation with transgenic barley. 7. The excellent growth and normal survival of the 400 broilers tested on barley diets supplemented with transgenic grain or malt showed the grain and malt not to be toxic. 8. The barley feed with added transgenic grain or malt containing thermotolerant (1,3-1,4)-β-glucanase provides an environmentally friendly alternative to enzyme additives, as it uses photosynthetic energy for production of the enzyme in the grain and thus avoids use of non-renewable energy for fermentation. The deposition of the enzyme in the protein bodies of the grain in the field makes coating procedures for stabilisation of enzyme activity superfluous. 9. Barley feed with the small amount of transgenic grain as additive to normal barley provides an alternative for broiler feed in areas where grain maize cannot be grown for climatic reasons or because of unsuitable soil and thus has to be imported.",,"glycosidase; licheninase; animal; animal food; article; barley; cereal; chemistry; chicken; digestion; eating; enzymology; feces; genetics; growth, development and aging; maize; metabolism; nutritional value; randomization; standard; transgenic plant; weight gain; Animal Feed; Animals; Cereals; Chickens; Digestion; Eating; Feces; Glycoside Hydrolases; Hordeum; Nutritive Value; Plants, Genetically Modified; Random Allocation; Weight Gain; Zea mays; Animalia; Aves; Gallus gallus; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242407194

Engineering Building, University Park, PA 16802, United States","A mobile, programmable, multiple supplement cattle feeder for pasture use was designed, constructed, and evaluated. The feeder is capable of feeding an individualized ration of liquids and solids to cattle in a grazing system without the need for AC power in a research pasture setting. The feeder is electrically powered by solar energy (with battery backup). Additional energy is stored in the form of compressed air held in two 53-L (13.5-gal) tanks, which must be charged by an external source. The design includes storage and metering equipment for up to five separate feed ingredients. Two pressure tanks with approximately 115-kg (254-lb) capacity are provided for fats or molasses-based liquid supplements; two small bins with approximately 40-kg (88-lb) capacity are provided for small quantities of solids, and one 1.2-m3 (42-ft3) bin is provided for grain concentrates. Animal identification is achieved using radio transponder ear tags, and control is handled through the use of a programmable logic controller. A mixed group of 10 dairy heifers and cows were used to complete testing. Animals adapted readily to feeder use after initial training and no problems were encountered with tag reading. Liquids, grains, and small-specialized solids were all metered accurately and consistently (coefficient of variation was 0.45% for liquids, 5.8% for small solids, and 2.3% for large solids) based on an individual animal program. Though effective for delivering molasses-based feeds, air leaks in the liquid-metering system required constant monitoring. Computer simulation of the power system suggests that it should handle supplemental feeding of up to 20 grazing dairy cows at a central Pennsylvania location.","Cattle feeding; Feeding system; Grazing; Pasture; Solar power","Agriculture; Computer simulation; Electric batteries; Pressure vessels; Programmable logic controllers; Radio equipment; Solar energy; Transponders; Cattle feeder; Feeding system; Grazing; Pasture; Agricultural machinery; Animalia; Bos taurus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242274070

In jerboa, hibernation processes are characterized by changes in the size of mitochondria, the number of peroxisomes in liver and in the expression of enzymes linked to fatty acid metabolism. In liver and kidney, cold acclimatization shows an opposite effect on the activities of the mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (-50%) and the peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) (+50%), while in brown and white adipose tissues, both activities are decreased down to 85%. These enzymes activities are subject to a strong induction in brown and in white adipose tissue (3.4- to 7.5-fold, respectively) during the hibernation period which is characterized by a low body temperature (around 10 °C) and by starvation. Expression level of AOX mRNA and protein are increased during both pre-hibernation and hibernation periods. Unexpectedly, treatment with ciprofibrate, a hypolipemic agent, deeply affects lipolysis in brown adipose tissue by increasing acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity (3.4-fold), both AOX activity and mRNA levels (2.8- and 3.8-fold, respectively) during pre-hibernation. Therefore, during pre-hibernation acclimatization, there is a negative regulation of fatty acid degradation allowing to accumulate a lipid stock which is later degraded during the hibernation period (starvation) due to a positive regulation of enzymes providing the required energy for animal survival. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

Materials and Methods: Seven currently used silicone maxillofacial prosthetic materials were used. Storage modulus, loss modulus, and loss tangent were determined over the frequency range from 0.01 to 100 Hz at both 23 and 37°C using a dynamic viscoelastometer. Contribution ratios of type of material, temperature, and frequency for each rheologic parameter were also determined. Results: Storage modulus, loss modulus, and loss tangent of all materials were greater at higher frequencies. Loss tangent and loss modulus were especially affected; the contribution ratios of frequency were 72% and 48%, respectively. These three rheologic parameters were insensitive to changes in temperature over the range tested; contribution ratios of temperature were less than 3%. There were significant differences in dynamic mechanical properties among the materials. Elasto Synsil showed higher storage modulus and loss modulus than the other materials (Cosmesil T001, Elastosil M3500, Episil, Ideal, Premium, Silskin 2000) at all frequencies and temperatures tested. Loss tangent values ranged from 0.02 to 0.20. Silicone maxillofacial prosthetic materials had almost no viscous component and exhibited elastic behavior. However, a wide range of ability in energy absorption was found among the materials. Conclusion: The results suggest that a maxillofacial prosthesis should have a laminate or hybrid structure consisting of both the material with a greater cushioning effect and that with a higher elastic recovery.",,"elastomer; silicone; article; comparative study; dynamics; energy absorption; flow kinetics; frequency analysis; hybrid; maxillofacial prosthesis; parameter; physical chemistry; prosthesis material; silicone prosthesis; storage; temperature; viscoelasticity; young modulus; Analysis of Variance; Biomechanics; Elasticity; Humans; Materials Testing; Maxillofacial Prosthesis; Rheology; Silicone Elastomers; Stress, Mechanical; Temperature; Time Factors; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141851154

The proposed scheme employs a pulsewidth-modulation ac-ac converter (four insulated gate bipolar transistors per phase) along with an autotransformer. During a disturbance such as voltage sag, the proposed scheme supplies the missing voltage and helps in maintaining rated voltage at the terminals of the critical load. The approach does not employ any energy storage components such as bulk capacitors/inductors and provides fast response at low cost. Under normal conditions the approach works in bypass mode, delivering utility power directly to the load; this method of control allows the transformer to be rated only for transient conditions, thus reducing its required size. A four-step switching technique to drive the ac-ac converter is employed to realize snubberless operation. A design example is presented, and simulation results are shown for a three-phase 230-V 5-kVA system. Experimental results on a single-phase unit are discussed. The proposed approach can be easily integrated into a distribution transformer supplying critical loads.","AC chopper; Critical loads; Duty cycle; Four-step switching; Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT); Pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) ac-ac converter; Voltage sags","AC machinery; Computer simulation; Critical currents; Electric converters; Electric current distribution; Electric inductors; Electric instrument transformers; Insulated gate bipolar transistors; Pulse width modulation; Transients; Voltage control; Duty cycle measurements; Choppers (circuits)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141532106

Trial 2 used three groups of each material, one first exposed to 37WV97 followed by 37DW, the other two were immediately immersed in 37DW or artificial saliva (37AS). Trial 3: two groups of each material were vacuum desiccated at 37°C, then exposed to 37 °C, ∼ 100% RH (37WV100), then immersed in 37DW or 37AS. Trial 4: four groups of HR were treated similarly to Trial 3; one was left under desiccation, and another in 37WV100 for the remaining period. Three-point bend tests for flexural strength (F), flexural modulus (E), and total energy to failure (W) were performed at the end of Trials 2-4. Results. Environmental moisture absorption was substantial at 24WV50(c. 0.2%), at least 40% of that in 37DW (HR: c. 0.7%, TC: c. 0.5%). Saturation was achievable in 37WV100. Mass loss on desiccation (HR: c. 0.4-0.5%, TC: c. 0.25%) was reversible in 37WV100. There were some significant effects of exposure conditions on mechanical properties (e.g. F for HR: after desiccation, 85.7 ± 1.4 MPa; after 37WV100, 73.2 ± 3.6 MPa; difference: p &lt; 0.0002), but overall the results were unclear. After a rapid gain in mass, there was a gradual loss in both 37DW and 37AS for both materials, slightly more in 37AS than 37DW. Significance. Water vapor absorption is substantial, hence attention must be paid to the laboratory working environment and conditions of storage and testing, i.e. temperature and RH must be stated to assist interpretation of data and comparisons between studies. Test conditions need to be standardized and with reference to normal oral conditions, immediate immersion in artificial saliva at 37 °C is the preferred treatment for these materials, whatever time of testing is chosen. © 2003 Academy of Dental Materials.

Sedimentation into ice-dammed lakes in Glen Roy and Glen Spean associated with shorelines at 260 m, 325 m and 350 m is well-documented, yet little is known about later, lower level lakes near Spean Bridge. Excavations on the northern flanks of the Lundy Channel revealed exposures into a 35-40 m thickness of sand and gravel. These sediments reflect deposition in a subaqueous environment experiencing repeated short-lived periods of high-energy subaerial deposition. Deformation structures within subaqueous deposits are associated with at least two ice-push events. This study presents new evidence for the existence of ice-dammed lakes at elevations between 260 m and 113 m and for periodic jökulhlaups draining southwest via the Lundy Channel. Active glacier ice associated with the deposits flowed northwest to southeast, driving meltwater across the Great Glen to the Lundy Channel. Glacier retreat was punctuated by periodic minor readvances. Progressive ice retreat was accompanied by ice thinning, and changes in ice-flow direction and subglacial meltwater routing. These findings add to knowledge of Loch Lomond Stadial deglaciation around Spean Bridge and have implications for our understanding of lacustrine glacier margins during deglaciation.

Two particularly important elements, for that management involve existing surface industrial facilities for the management of very low level, intermediate and low level and the ongoing investigations dealing with high-level long-lived waste. In the case of intermediate and low level short-lived waste, a well-performing surface industrial facility is already implemented in the Aube Department. It was commissioned in 1992 and superseded the former Centre de la Manche. The new facility, with a disposal capacity of 1 million cubic metres has demonstrated its industrial maturity and its ability to accommodate waste packages with flexibility, but without neglecting a constant concern for the environment. In the summer of 2003, it will be expanded in order to include a facility for very-low-level waste. As for high-level long-lived waste, investigations are regulated by the Act of 30 December 1991 prescribing three research areas (partitioning and transmutation; geological disposal, and storage and conditioning). Disposal investigations are conducted by Andra. Two types of formations are under study, clay and granite, with a view to presenting in 2005 a report to the government for decisions to be taken in 2006 on future waste-management guidelines. In the case of clay, Andra relies on a site that has been selected in Bure in Eastern France. In 2001 a summary report was prepared and is currently undergoing an international peer review. With regard to granite, investigations are based on a generic approach and co-operative efforts with foreign partners. Radioactive-waste management constitutes an issue of particular interest in France. The main objective is to ensure the availability of reliable and robust management solutions capable of protecting human beings and the environment against any contact with the waste.",,"Environmental protection; Nuclear energy; Radioactive elements; Radioactive wastes; Public opinion; Radioactive waste disposal",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042744091

The leaves that were naturally acclimated to winter conditions of freezing temperatures and high irradiance displayed the recently discovered cold-hard-band or CHB feature of the chlorophyll a fluorescence spectra (Gilmore & Ball, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 97:11098-11101, 2000). A streak-camera-spectrograph was used and the double convolution integral method for global analysis was applied to simultaneously acquire and simulate, respectively, the time- and wave-length-dependence of all major chlorophyll a components (Gilmore et al. Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. B-London 355:1371-1384, 2000). The CHB coincided with changed amplitudes and decreased excited state lifetimes for the main F685 nm and F695 nm emission bands from the photosystem II (PSII) core-inner-antenna. The CHB dissipates energy as heat separate from PSII while also reducing the PSII quantum yield by competing for both photon absorption and antenna excitation. The CHB did not correlate with changes in the decay kinetics of the PSI antenna F740 nm band. The spectral-kinetic features of the altered energy flow were similar in the unrelated evergreen species. These results are consistent with a functional association between the CHB, PSII energy dissipation and protective storage of chlorophyll in overwintering evergreens.","Chlorosis; Cold-hardening; Double convolution integral; Fluorescence lifetime distribution; Global analysis; Photoinhibition; Time-resolved emission spectrum; Violaxanthin; Xanthophyll cycle; Zeaxanthin","cold tolerance; overwintering; photosynthesis; Amyema; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus pauciflora; Viscum; Viscum album",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041848574

Based on the solution of this system, it gives a recurrent network of n multistate neurons with complex and symmetric synaptic weights, which operates on the finite state space {1,2,..., K}n to minimize this quadratic functional. Maximum number of integral vectors that can be embedded into the energy landscape of the network by this method is investigated by computer experiments.

These plasmas, transiently created in several tokamaks, have exhibited high-performance as measured by normalized stored energy and neutron production rates. A critical issue with extending the duration of these plasmas is the need to maintain the off-axis-peaked current distribution required to support the minimum in the safety factor q at large radii. We present equilibrium and transport simulations that explore the use of electron cyclotron heating and current drive to maintain this negative shear configuration.

The electron beam energy is modulated by applying a tera-watt laser with a length of 100 fs in parallel to the electron beam running through a wiggler. Pulsed X-rays, emitted from a bending magnet, are separated from the X-rays due to the beam bunch with a slit. Parameters of the system are optimized based on a formalism with respect to the laser beam interaction in a wiggler, beam dynamics and laser beam optics. Numerical calculations of the interaction are carried out taking into account a Gaussian distribution of electron and laser beams. The expected flux is 8.1 × 104photons/s/mrad/0.1% bandwidth at a bunch beam current of 10mA with a pulse length of 240fs in full width. If the lattice functions are modified such that an undulator is used as a radiator in a negative dispersion section, we can expect the pulsed X-rays with a flux of 2.9 × 107photons/s/0.1% bw and a pulse length 180 fs. Because of a high beam energy of 8GeV, a very high laser field is required, which induces limitations in the laser beam optics.

While the prevalence of obesity in the developed countries is caused by the increased consumption of caloriedense foods, in the developing nations, because obesity coexists with undernutrition, additional factors are necessary to account for it. The evidence suggests that an important contributing factor for obesity in the developing nations is a reduced fat oxidation and increased metabolism of carbohydrate that has been brought about by the chronic undernutrition experienced during prenatal and postnatal growth. This shift toward a preferential metabolic use of carbohydrate rather than of fat results in an increased deposition of body fat. This tendency, along with the general decrease of energy expenditure in physical activity associated with urbanization, and the culturally mediated acceptance of fatness leads to obesity among populations from the developing nations. A joint effect of these factors is that in the developing nations obesity is associated with short stature resulting from developmental undernutrition, while in the developed countries obesity is associated with tall stature. It is hoped that future research will address the mechanisms whereby undernutrition increases the tendency toward obesity. Understanding how to modify fat oxidation could affect our ability to prevent weight gain among undernourished populations of the developing nations. Therefore, future research on the interaction of undernutrition and the development of obesity is of prime importance for anthropology concerned with the origins of human variability. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"anthropology; body fat; caloric intake; carbohydrate metabolism; comorbidity; cultural anthropology; developed country; developing country; disease association; energy expenditure; environmental factor; human; lipid metabolism; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; malnutrition; medical research; obesity; physical activity; postnatal growth; prenatal growth; prevalence; priority journal; review; short stature; urbanization; Culture; Developing Countries; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Malnutrition; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Socioeconomic Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038388269

Vapour compression heat pumps driven by electric motors or engines provide the real capability of upgrading low temperature sources of ambient and waste heat to match the desired load temperatures in such heating applications. Major source of ambient heat stem from the storage of solar energy in the ground, in lakes and rivers, and in atmospheric air. Heat pumps can therefore be used to effectively harness indirectly the daily solar radiation input. In addition many industries have major sources of waste low grade heat in the form of air or water discharged from the industrial process heat stream. Heat pumps are generally formally classified therefore as air source, ground source or water source units although there has also been considerable interest recently in hybrid units combining the attributes of two or more of these specific types mentioned above.

The peak temperature, related to the PIP reaction, decreased with increasing absorbed irradiation dose. Furthermore, it was observed that this reaction consists of two reactions. The first reaction is relatively slow, and its activation energy was calculated to be 19.43kcal/mol (81.5kJ/mol). The second reaction seems to be very fast, and its activation energy depends on the absorbed radiation dose. The influence of storage time on the PIP reaction was also studied.

The aim is to overcome some limitations of currently available software designed either for general purpose or for highly specialised modelling applications. In fact, general purpose tools usually impose explicit coding of mathematical model equations or non-intuitive system representations, whereas specialised software use domain-specific notations that allow efficient and convenient model building only for special classes of systems. The aim of the present study is to pursue intuitive representation of various, possibly interacting, types of biological systems described as interconnected physical components, such as mass and energy storage elements, active and passive transport or biochemical transformations. The presented software generates automatically the mathematical model equations that can be coded in different formats. This allows interoperability with other existing software, e.g. for numerical simulation, symbolic analysis or text processing. A multi-domain structural language has been defined for an intuitive, hierarchical and self-explanatory specification of physiological models. The proposed strategies may become useful for dissemination and integration of multidisciplinary modelling knowledge. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

The carotenoids lycopene and β-carotene, ascorbic acid, rutin and total phenolics were analysed. The antioxidant activity was measured using (a) the xanthine oxidase (XOD)/xanthine system, which generates superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, and (b) the linoleic acid/CuSO4 system, which promotes lipid peroxidation. The ascorbic acid content decreased even at 30°C, following pseudo-first-order kinetics, with an activation energy of 105 200 J mol-1 for tomato pulp and 23 600 J mol-1 for tomato paste. The lower the initial ascorbic acid content, the higher was the degradation rate. Variations in phenolic compounds occurred at 40°C and higher, following pseudo-zero order kinetics. The antioxidant activity of the hydrophilic fraction of the tomato products depended on both antioxidant degradation and the Maillard reaction and could not be described by a kinetic model. The β-carotene content decreased even at 30°C, whereas the lycopene content was stable in all samples. The antioxidant activity of the lipophilic fraction of the tomato products decreased following pseudo-first order kinetics, with an activation energy of 22 200 J mol-1 for tomato pulp and 20 200 J mol-1 for tomato paste.

Research and Extension Center, Texas A and M University, Amarillo, TX 79106, United States","The use of cattle manure (referred to as feedlot biomass, FB) as a fuel source has the potential to solve both waste disposal problems and reduce fossil fuel based CO2 emissions. Previous attempts to utilize animal waste as a sole fuel source have met with only limited success due to the higher ash, higher moisture, and inconsistent properties of FB. Thus, a co-firing technology is proposed where FB is ground, mixed with coal, and then fired in existing pulverized coal fired boiler burner facilities. A research program was undertaken in order to determine: (1) FB fuel characteristics, (2) combustion characteristics when fired along with coal in a small scale 30 kWt (100,000 BTU/h) boiler burner facility, and (3) combustion and fouling characteristics when fired along with coal in a large pilot scale 150 kWt (500,000 BTU/h DOE-NETL boiler burner facility). These results are reported in three parts. Part I will present a methodology of fuel collection, fuel characteristics of the FB, its relation to ration fed, and change in fuel characteristics due to composting. It was found that FB has approximately half the heating value of coal, twice the volatile matter of coal, four times the N content of coal on heat basis, and due to soil contamination during collection, the ash content is almost 9-10 times that of low ash (5%) coal. The addition of &lt;5% crop residues had little apparent effect on heating value. The main value of composting for combustion fuel would be to improve physical properties and to provide homogeneity. The energy potential of FB diminished with composting time and storage; however, the DAF HHV is almost constant for ration, FB-raw, partially composted and finished composted. The fuel N per GJ is considerably high compared to coal, which may result in increased NOx emissions. The N and S contents per GJ increase with composting of FB while the volatile ash oxide% decreases with composting. Based on heating values and alkaline oxides, partial composting seems preferable to a full composting cycle. Even though the percentage of alkaline oxides is reduced in the ash, the increased total ash percentage results in an increase of total alkaline oxides per unit mass of fuel. The adiabatic flame temperature for most of the biomass fuels can be empirically correlated with ash and moisture percentage. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A novel sizing method is introduced. It is a developed version of similar earlier sizing methods, taking into account a further design parameter. The techno-economic optimisation of autonomous energy systems should include the following design parameters at the same time: the level of autonomy, i.e. the fraction of time for which the specified load can be met, and the cost of the system. Without one of these, the techno-economic optimisation would be incomplete. New concepts, which combine the system autonomy and cost, are also introduced to be used in the techno-economic optimisation process. The sizing of a PV-wind hybrid system on a yearly basis requires a detailed analysis of the solar radiation and wind speed on a monthly basis. It is common to size such renewable systems for the worst month. It is, however, shown that the worst month scenarios lead to too costly and, therefore, non-optimal a system in terms of techno-economics. It is, therefore, suggested that alternative solutions be sought, rather than using the worst month scenario. An alternative method is applied in the present article. It suggests a third energy source (auxiliary source) be incorporated into the system instead of increasing the hardware sizes excessively for the worst month. It is shown that this leads to techno-economically more optimum systems. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Dynamic mechanical analysis revealed possible structural changes in the nanocomposites even during the small deformation occurring during shear oscillatory measurements, as evidenced by a V-shaped modulus change in the plot of the dynamic storage modulus as a function of stepwise increased temperature. X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded at different simulated temperatures during the various stages of dynamic measurements. The X-ray data indicate that the structural changes can be ascribed to a further intercalation of the PCL matrix chains into the silicate layers. This further intercalation is a consequence of the heat treatment during the dynamic mechanical measurements. Furthermore, there is a considerable vertical shift in addition to the horizontal shift in the higher temperature regime, which allows the mapping of a master curve through the application of the time-temperature superposition principle to the dynamic storage an the loss modulus data obtained at various isothermal temperatures. The present study is also concerned with the relative molecular mobility of both PCL nanocomposites in the given experimental conditions considering the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) equation and the Arrhenius relationship between the horizontal shift factor and the activation energy of flow. Moreover, the extent of the vertical shift as a function of temperature made it possible to determine the apparent activation energy of the further intercalation of PCL into the silicate layers. This intercalation is caused by the additional exposure to heat during the dynamic mechanical measurements after mixing, which led to a comparison of the relative diffusivity of the PCL matrix in the two nanocomposites.","Activation energy; Clay; Modulus; Nanocomposites; Poly(ε-caprolactone)","Composite materials; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Intercalation compounds; Melting; Molecular structure; Nanostructured materials; Organic polymers; Relaxation processes; Silicates; Thermal effects; Viscoelasticity; X ray diffraction analysis; Nanocomposites; Polymer composites; Macromolecules; polycaprolactone; article; molecular dynamics; nanoparticle; particle size; structure analysis; thermal analysis; viscoelasticity; X ray diffraction; young modulus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037818778

The asymptotic behaviour with a well-defined load-scaling factor shows distinctly into which category a given shell problem falls. The objective of this paper is to present a shell problem and its solution for which there is no convergence to a well-defined load-scaling factor as the thickness of the shell decreases. Such shells are unduly sensitive in their behaviour because the ratio of membrane to bending energy stored changes significantly and indeed can fluctuate with changes in shell thickness.

It is shown that the prepolymer based on 1,3-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)benzene dianhydride and the diacetyl derivative of 2,2-bis(4-(4-aminophenoxy)phenyl)sulfone diamine after removing less than 5% by weight of the volatile components can be melted at 220-240°C to give a fluid with a viscosity of 10-20 Pas. This low viscosity of the prepolymer facilitates blending it with magnetic particles at relatively high volume fractions (up to 85 vol%) that are not possible using conventional methods.

These effects implicate leptin as a major regulator of energy homeostasis, which may serve to limit excess energy storage. As plasma leptin concentrations are tightly coupled with fat mass in humans, decreases in adipose mass with weight loss coincide with decreased concentrations of circulating leptin. However, due to many confounding factors, the effects of exercise on circulating leptin are less clear. The data from investigations examining single exercise bouts suggest that serum leptin concentrations are unaltered by short duration (41 minutes or less), non-exhaustive exercise, but may be affected by short duration, exhaustive exercise. More convincingly, studies investigating long duration exercise bouts indicate that serum leptin concentrations are reduced with exercise durations ranging from one to multiple hours. These findings raise speculation that exercise-associated reductions in leptin may be due to alterations in nutrient availability or nutrient flux at the level of the adipocytes, the primary site of leptin production and secretion. Thus, one purpose of this review is to discuss the effects of exercise on circulating leptin concentrations with special emphasis on studies that have examined single exercise bouts that are associated with high levels of energy expenditure and energy deficit. In addition, a 'nutrient sensing pathway' (the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway), which regulates leptin gene expression, will be discussed as a possible mechanism by which exercise-induced energy deficit may modulate serum leptin concentrations.",,"hexosamine; leptin; adipose tissue; body fat; energy expenditure; exercise; gene expression regulation; homeostasis; human; lipid metabolism; nutrient; protein blood level; review; satiety; weight reduction; Adipose Tissue; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Homeostasis; Humans; Hyperlipidemias; Leptin; Lipid Metabolism; Obesity; Satiety Response",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037782098

Micellar surfactant solutions were found to increase gas hydrate formation rate and storage capacity. With the presence of surfactant, hydrate could form quickly in a quiescent system and the energy costs of hydrate formation reduced. Surfactants (an anionic surfactant, a non-ionic surfactant and their mixtures) and liquid hydrocarbons (cyclopentane and methylcyclohexane) were used to improve hydrate formation. The experiments of hydrate formation were carried out in the pressure range 3.69-6.82 MPa and the temperature range 274.05-277.55 K. The experimental pressures were kept constant during hydrate formation in each experimental run. The effect of anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)) on natural gas storage in hydrates is more pronounced compared to a non-ionic surfactant (dodecyl polysaccharide glycoside (DPG)). The induction time of hydrate formation was reduced with the presence of cyclopentane (CP).

The experimental data for three kinds of faults in rotating machinery: rotor-to-stator rub, oil whirl, coupling misalignment and the actual measurement data from a Pumped Storage Power Generator Unit are analyzed by the scalogram and the reassigned scalogram, and the results by FFT analysis are also given. A comparison among three kinds of analysis results is carried out, and the comparison results indicate that the scalogram can not only reveal the time-frequency features of vibration signal but also highlight the components of low energy. Therefore, it is suitable to extract features of faults at an early stage. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here we report water solubility of Mg-perovskites with different compositions observed in peridotite and MORB systems. IR spectra of pure MgSiO3-perovskite show bands at 3397, 3423, 3448, and 3482 cm-1 and suggest about 100 ppm H2O. The H2O content in Al-Mg-perovskite (4-7 wt% Al2O3; Mg#=100) is 1000-1500 ppm (major band at 3448 cm-1), whereas Al-Fe-Mg-perovskite in MORB (Al2O3=13-17 wt%; Mg#=58-61) contains 40-110 ppm H2O (major band at 3397 cm-1). The H2O content in Al-Fe-Mg-perovskite observed in peridotite (Al2O3=5-6 wt%; Mg#=88-90) is 1400-1800 ppm (major band at 3397 cm-1). Al-Fe-Mg-perovskite from the MORB system has a high Fe3+ content, Fe3+/∑Fe=0.6, determined by electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements. Water can enter into the perovskite structure with oxygen vacancies originating from the substitution of Si by Al and Fe3+. Oxygen vacancy incorporation is favored for aluminous perovskite synthesized from the MgO-rich peridotite system. The substitution of Si4++Mg2+=2(Al,Fe)3+ prevails however in the Al-Fe-Mg-perovskite from the MORB system (MgO-poor, Al- and Fe-rich), explaining its restricted water solubility. The maximum amount of water stored in the lower mantle is estimated to be 3.42×1021 kg, which is 2.5 times the present ocean mass. Comparison of the phase relations in hydrous pyrolite and hydrous MORB indicates that pyrolite is more important as water container and water carrier in the mantle. Pyrolite contains: (1) dense hydrous magnesium silicates, existing under conditions of subducting slabs, and (2) hydrous wadsleyite, hydrous ringwoodite and water-bearing perovskite under the normal mantle and hotter conditions. Distribution of water to the MORB is restricted at the conditions of the transition zone and lower mantle. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

A lumped thermodynamic model of the vapour region is coupled with the Navier-Stokes and energy equations governing heat, mass and momentum transport in the liquid. These equations are discretized using a Galerkin finite-element method with implicit time integration. Three case studies are considered based on three different heating configurations imposed on the tank wall: liquid heating, vapour heating and uniform heating. For each case, the pressure and temperature rise in the vapour and the flow and temperature distributions in the liquid are determined. Results are compared to a lumped thermodynamic model of the entire tank. It is shown that the final rate of pressure rise is about the same in each case and close to that predicted by thermodynamics even though the actual pressures are different because of varying degrees of thermal stratification. Finally, a subcooled liquid jet is used to mix the liquid and limit the pressure rise. Even so, there is still some thermal stratification in the liquid, and as a result the final vapour pressure depends on the particular heat distribution.",,"Cryogenic liquids; Finite element method; Mass transfer; Navier Stokes equations; Thermal stratification; Thermodynamics; Energy equations; Two phase flow; cryogenic fluid; finite element method; Navier-Stokes equations; space technology; storage tank; thermodynamics; vapor pressure; vapor-liquid system",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037929554

The results of direct nanoscale imaging of the novel magnetization configurations present in rings with different geometrical parameters (including discs) are discussed. These results give valuable insight into the influence of the magnetic anisotropies governing the magnetic states. The different types of domain walls that arise are compared quantitatively to micromagnetic simulations. The magnetodynamic switching between the different magnetic states is described in detail. In particular we elaborate on the different geometry-dependent magnetic switchings, since the different transitions occurring allow us to determine which energy terms govern the reversal process.

This procedure can be investigated by the calculations of thermal generation derived by each parameter. These approaches were done for the advanced Li-ion batteries for hybrid electric vehicle and electric vehicle applications. The thermal generation of Qp that is exothermic during both charge and discharge processes corresponds to the energy loss due to a polarization, and the thermal generation of Qj due to an electrical resistance of batteries will be produced. The thermal generation of Qr implies battery reactions. As a result, the total thermal generation: Qt will be expressed as below. Qt = Qr + Qp + Qj = nFT(δEe/δT) + Qp + Qj. Another topic is surface and bulk controls of electrode materials in any type of battery. A battery life will be determined by several factors like material designing, battery temperature or charge-discharge stress etc. Particularly, the stress of high temperature over 40 °C accelerated the degrading velocity of Li-ion batteries. Electron spin resonance data indicated the existence of Mn(II) instead of the original Mn(III) of a positive electrode in Li-ion batteries. This fact will support the decomposition of Mn(III) in LiMn2O4 to Mn(II) and Mn(IV) by the action of electrolyte. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data for the surface profiles on the negative electrode materials showed the existence of ether and phosphate compound on the surface of graphite carbon. It is thought that the decomposition of LiPF6 in the electrolyte took place. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The paper elaborates on the compensation of three different cases of nonperiodic current: single-phase disturbance, three-phase sub-harmonics, and three-phase stochastic current. Simulation results give credibility to the applicability of the definition for a diversity of load currents. According to different compensation cases and the goals to be achieved, different averaging time intervals for the compensator are chosen which will determine the compensator's energy storage requirement and the extent of residual distortion in the source current.","Active filter; Nonactive power; Reactive power; Shunt compensator","Active filters; Computer simulation; Electric converters; Electric currents; Electric loads; Energy storage; Harmonic analysis; Reactive power; Nonactive power; Polyphase systems; Shunt compensators; Power electronics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442475639

In this paper, an ICPT pick-up is analyzed under conditions where the pick-up tuning is assumed to be essentially perfect, and all diodes are assumed to have continuous current flow in them. The analysis proceeds by replacing the existing parallel resonant tank and rectifier circuit with a dc source and transformer equivalent, thereby reducing the complexity of the circuit, and eliminating the diodes. The dc equivalent is shown to have the same energy storage and power capability as the original circuit and is accurate under all loadings for both transient and steady-state conditions. With this simplification, analytic transfer functions for the pick-up with respect to its excitation current and its control switch duty cycle are developed. The ICPT system model is shown to have multiple poles, with complex zeroes on the right half plane. The model allows a sophisticated controller to be designed to give the ICPT system the required stability at high efficiency.","Control systems; Electromagnetic induction; Power control; State space systems","Control equipment; Control system analysis; Diodes; Electric coils; Electric rectifiers; Electric transformers; Power control; State space methods; Electromagnetic induction; Inductively coupled power transfer (ICPT); State space systems; Electric power transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442427675

This action exerted by the mediators of the stress system has two modes of operation. The immediate response mode driven by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) organises via CRH-1 receptors the behavioural, sympathetic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) responses to a stressor. In the other - slower - mode, which facilitates behavioural adaptation, the urocortins acting through CRH-2 receptors seem prominent. Corticosteroid hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex are implicated in both modes through their high affinity type 1 (mineralocorticoid receptors - MR) and lower affinity type 2 (glucocorticoid receptors - GR) receptors that are co-localised in limbic neural circuitry. Current data suggest that MR controls in specific afferents the threshold or sensitivity of the fast CRH-1 driven stress system mode and thus prevents disturbance of homeostasis, while GR facilitates its recovery by restraining in these very same circuits stress responses and by mobilising energy resources. In preparation for future events GR facilitates behavioural adaptation and promotes storage of energy. The balance in the two stress system modes is thought to be essential for cell homeostasis, mental performance and health. Imbalance induced by genetic modification or chronic stressors changes specific neural signalling pathways underlying psychic domains of cognition and emotion, anxiety and aggression. This Yin-Yang stress concept is fundamental for genomic strategies to understand the mechanistic underpinning of cortisol-induced stress-related disorders such as i.e. severe forms of depression and co-morbid diseases.","Behaviour; Brain; Corticosteroids; Genes; Stress","corticosteroid; corticotropin releasing factor; corticotropin releasing factor receptor; corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1; corticotropin releasing factor receptor 2; glucocorticoid receptor; glycoprotein P; hormone; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mineralocorticoid receptor; multidrug resistance protein; transcription factor AP 1; unclassified drug; urocortin; DNA modification; genetic screening; homeostasis; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; limbic cortex; mental performance; neuroendocrine system; review; signal transduction; stress; synthesis; Animals; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Hormones; Humans; Receptors, Glucocorticoid; Receptors, Mineralocorticoid; Receptors, Steroid; Stress",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242491480

Recently large size magnets have been developed, according as the improvement of high temperature superconducting wire. In DC reactor type SFCL, the purpose of magnet is to store generated electric energy of power system immediately after fault. Therefore most of inductors are designed with air core since magnetic core inductor is too easy saturated to absorb the energy. Therefore the inductor consumes so much superconducting wire to make large inductance and these expensive coils are weak point of DC reactor type SFCL. To solve this problem, Reverse Magnetization Bias (RMB) method is introduced. The energy capacity of magnetic core is expanded to several times. With the shorter length of HTC superconducting wire, the more good effect was obtained in 40V prototype SFCL.","DC reactor; Magnetic core; Power system; Reverse magnetization bias (RMB); Superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL)","Electric energy storage; Electric fault currents; Electric inductors; Electric power systems; Inductance; Limiters; Magnetic cores; Magnetization; Superconducting cables; Superconducting magnets; Reverse magnetization bias (RMB); Current limiting reactors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042974907

However, little is known about the product quality of this species, including body composition and flesh quality which are relevant for processing, storage and marketing. The experimental investigations indicate that tench are favorable in several parameters of body composition, e.g. carcass yield and fillet percentage, when compared with common carp. Organ weights show a trend toward a lower percentage than in other cyprinids. Composition of the tench fillets is similar to that of common carp. However, tench are able to store large amounts of fat on the fillet surface and intramuscularly, significantly affecting the sensorial characteristics. Technological parameters indicate that tench fillet is quite favorable for processing. In most of the samples analyzed, the water-binding capacity of raw muscle was significantly better than in other species. Owing to a high energy content in tench muscle, the post-mortem decrease in pH is very pronounced, which may lead to a rapid autolytic degradation of the tissue. When compared with common carp, tench fillets were favorable in terms of appearance due to a lighter flesh.

Because such a large-sized superconducting coil quenches far away from its critical current, the recovery current is frequently used as a stability criterion in the coil fabrication. Therefore, we first investigated the recovery current characteristics of the large current conductor, which was used in our SMES coil fabrication. The test results indicate that the recovery currents measured in the conductor are nearly identical to those based on the single wire. This implies that the recovery current is affected by the conductor's cooling condition rather than its size and current capacity. In the SMES coil test the first quench occurred at 1250 A, which is equivalent to the stored energy of about 2 MJ. It corresponds to the quench current density of about 130 A/mm2. This value is much higher in comparison with that reported in the other work.

The SMB system consists of the superconductor stator and the PM rotor, and is a no-contact bearing system using the levitation force between them. The SMB was expected to be applied to the electric power storage flywheel system because friction causes the rotation speed degradation and decreases the energy storage capability. However, it was found that the electromagnetic friction of the SMB was not zero, due to electromagnetic forces; 1) the magnetic force interaction between the inhomogeneous magnetic field of the PM rotor and the eddy current it induces in the cryostat, 2) the magnetic force between the inhomogeneous magnetic field of the PM rotor and the shielding current it induces in the superconductor, 3) the magnetic force between the magnetic field of superconductors yielding the levitation force and the eddy current induced in the PM rotor. This magnetic field of superconductor is inhomogeneous too, because the superconductors consist of several HTSC bulks. In this research, it was found that the 3rd phenomenon is most significant. So, we use the advanced PM rotor including the layered insulator thin films to suppress its eddy current and the degradation of the rotation speed. Using our SMB equipment, the rotation speed degradation was measured using the PM rotors with/without the insulator thin films and the electromagnetic frictions were compared to each other.","Eddy current; Insulating film; Rotation speed degradation; Superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB)","Eddy currents; Electric insulators; Electromagnetic field effects; Magnetic bearings; Permanent magnets; Rotors; Stators; Thin films; Rotation speed degradation; High temperature superconductors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042466178

A natural autumn community of Arctic sea ice microalgae was collected for dark survival experiments from the Greenland Sea during the ARKTIS-X1/2 Expedition of RV Polarstern in October 1995. After a dark period of 161 days, species dominance in the algal assemblage have changed from initially pennate diatoms to small phytoflagellates ( &lt;20 um). Over the entire dark period, the mean algal growth rate was -0.01 d-1. Nearly all diatom species had negative growth rates, while phytoflagellate abundance increased. Resting spore formation during the dark period was observed in less than 4.5% of all cells and only for dinoflagellates and the diatom Chaetoceros spp. We assume that facultative heterotrophy and energy storage are the main processes enabling survival during the dark Arctic winter. After an increase in light intensity, microalgal cells reacted with fast growth within days. Phytoflagellates had the highest growth rate, followed by Nitzschia frigida. Further investigations and experiments should focus on the mechanisms of dark survival (mixotrophy and energy storage) of polar marine microalgae.","Arctic; Competition; Dark; Marine microalgae; The Greenland Sea","alga; competition (ecology); light availability; marine environment; polar region; Greenland Sea; algae; Bacillariophyta; Chaetoceros; Dinophyceae; Nitzschia frigida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042268049

The JHF 50-GeV main ring will require 104 MW of total active power and 28.8 MW of dissipation power by estimation. Moreover, the charging and discharging cycle is repeated with 3.64 s of the cycle time at the initial operation, and the repeating frequency will be raised up by twice in future. Taking this situation into consideration, energy storage system using adjustable speed type flywheel and IGBT power converter are studied in the JHF project. In this paper, the power supply using SMES is proposed. The power supply can absorb the fluctuation of active and reactive power caused by charging and discharging the synchrotron magnet. The system is composed of current source ac/dc converter, chopper circuits and superconducting magnets. The chopper circuits for superconducting magnets and synchrotron magnets can be connected to the same dc bus of the power supply and this feature can reduce the power rating of ac/dc converters.","Accelerator; Power supply; SMES; Synchrotron","Choppers (circuits); Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Particle accelerators; Power converters; Power supply; Superconducting magnets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041973437

However, these studies were done for the direct current (DC) mode because the applications of the superconducting system are mainly used in DC mode. On the other hand, since commercial electric power is mainly used in the alternating current (AC) mode, the future studies for superconducting application should move toward AC mode. Therefore, the studies of PCL in the AC mode are necessary. The subjects to study in the alternating current PCL (AC-PCL) are switching devices, transportation phenomena in thermoelectric semiconductor in AC mode, and thermal transportation of current lead in the AC operation. We study the AC-PCL numerically.","Alternating current; Current ripple; Effective value; Heat leak; Peltier current lead (PCL); Thermoelectric element (TE)","Cryogenics; Electric energy storage; Nuclear reactors; Peltier effect; Superconducting cables; Switching; Thermoelectric semiconductors; Superconducting materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041973328

Because nitric oxide (NO) modulates mitochondrial O2 uptake and energy levels, we analyzed cold effects (30 days at 4°C) on rat liver and skeletal muscle mitochondrial NO synthases (mtNOS) and their putative impact on BMR. Cold exposure delimited two periods: A (days 1-10), with high systemic O2 uptake and weight loss, and B (days 10-30), with lower O2 uptake and fat deposition. mtNOS activity and expression decreased in period A and then increased in period B by 60-100% in liver and skeletal muscle (P &lt; 0.05). Conversely, mitochondrial O2 uptake remained initially high in the presence of L-arginine and later fell by 30-50% (P &lt; 0.05). On this basis, the estimated fractional contribution of liver plus muscle to total BMR varied from 40% in period A to 25% in period B.

Artificial oxygen carriers may improve oxygen supply to vital organs while avoiding the need for allogencic transfusion. Methods: Rats were subjected to hemorrhagic hypotension (mean arterial pressure = 35-40 mmHg for 120 min) and were subsequently resuscitated with (1) stored whole rat blood, (2) pentastarch, or (3) pentastarch combined with perflubron emulsion (PFE; 2.7 or 5.4 g/kg body weight), a second-generation artificial oxygen carrier. Recovery of liver adenosine triphosphate, hepatocellular injury, and expression of glutamine synthetase 1, a gene that is induced by exposure of hepatocytes to low partial pressure of oxygen, were studied at 4 h of resuscitation. Results: Stored whole blood or pentastarch failed to restore liver adenosine triphosphate concentrations after prolonged shock as compared to sham controls and resulted in increased gene expression of glutamine synthetase 1. Addition of 2.7 g PFE/kg restored liver adenosine triphosphate to control, whereas 5.4 g PFE/kg resulted in adenosine triphosphate concentrations significantly above control. Improved hepatocellular oxygen supply was also confirmed by restoration of the physiologic expression pattern of glutamine synthetase 1. Serum enzyme concentrations were highest after resuscitation with stored blood, whereas addition of PFE failed to further decrease enzyme concentrations as compared to pentastarch alone. Conclusions: Resuscitation with PFE is superior to stored blood or asanguineous resuscitation with respect to restoration of hepatocellular energy metabolism. The improved hepatocellular oxygen availability is reflected in normalization of oxygen-dependent gene expression. However, improved oxygen availability failed to affect early hepatocellular injury.",,"adenosine triphosphate; glutamate ammonia ligase; hetastarch; oxygen; perfluorooctyl bromide; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; blood storage; controlled study; emulsion; energy metabolism; enzyme blood level; gene expression; hemorrhagic shock; hypotension; liver cell; liver cell damage; liver dysfunction; male; mean arterial pressure; nonhuman; oxygen supply; priority journal; rat; resuscitation; Acid-Base Equilibrium; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Blood Substitutes; Blotting, Western; Emulsions; Energy Metabolism; Fluorocarbons; Gene Expression; Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase; Hematocrit; Hepatocytes; Hetastarch; Immunohistochemistry; Liver; Liver Circulation; Male; Oxygen; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Resuscitation; Shock, Hemorrhagic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038781759

On day 1 of lactation, the median two male pigs (by weight) from each litter were randomly allocated to one of two doses of pST (0 or 1 mg/kg per d) until weaning on day 21. Pigs were weaned and offered feed ad libitum until slaughter at 134 d of age. Body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at 21, 49, 77, 105 and 133d of age. There was no significant difference in growth rates between day 1 and 21 of lactation in pigs injected with either saline (9 g/l NaCl/l) or pST (258 v. 246 g/d for control and pST-treated pigs respectively, P=0-61), and as a consequence there was no significant difference in liveweight at weaning (7.13 v. 6.84 kg, P=0.59). However, fat mass at weaning tended to be decreased (1.18 v. 0.96 kg, P=0.064), while the % fat in the body at weaning was significantly (16.7 v. 13.9%, P=0.008) decreased by exogenous pST treatment. In the immediate post-weaning period there was a reduction in lean tissue deposition (347 v. 300 g/d, P=0.021) but no effect on fat deposition (35 v. 33 g/d, P=0.72). Over the entire weaning-to-slaughter period, pST treatment of neonatal pigs decreased the rate of fat deposition (130 v. 112 g/d, P=0.033), but had no effect on lean tissue deposition (550 v. 538 g/d, P=0.49). Therefore, treatment of nursing pigs with high doses of pST for a short period before weaning may provide a means of reducing the fat content of pork and pork products.","Body composition; Growth; Lactation; Neonate; Pig; Somatotropin","growth hormone; sodium chloride; animal experiment; animal food; article; body composition; body fat; body mass; body weight; controlled study; cross breeding; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; growth rate; lactation; lean body weight; lipid storage; litter size; meat; newborn; nonhuman; randomization; suckling; swine; weaning; Adipose Tissue; Animal Nutrition Physiology; Animals; Animals, Suckling; Body Composition; Depression, Chemical; Growth Hormone; Male; Swine; Animalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038759728

Two types of 2 kWh-class modules for stationary use have almost attained the target of initial performance, but the cycle lives are still about 1000 cycles. Similarly, two types of 3 kWh-class modules for EV application have achieved the targets of 150 Wh/kg and 400 W/kg. The energy density of each single cell exceeded the target by about 20%, but in the case of the single cells of cylindrical shape, the target could not be achieved because of dead space in the modules. Cell performance under severe conditions of -20 °C or continuous discharge at 1.0C were suitable for practical use.

The aim of this review is to evaluate the role of hormone-sensitive lipase in this process. Recent findings: Hormone-sensitive lipase exhibits a broad specificity for lipid substrates such as triglycerides, diglycerides, cholesteryl esters, and retinyl esters and the enzyme is in a wide variety of tissues. The high enzyme activity in adipose tissue was considered rate-limiting in the degradation of stored triglycerides. This view of a single enzyme controlling the catabolism of stored fat was challenged by recent findings that in hormone-sensitive lipase deficient mice adipose tissue triglycerides were still hydrolyzed and that these animals were leaner than normal mice. These results indicated that in adipose tissue hormone-sensitive lipase cooperates with other yet unidentified lipases to control the mobilization of fatty acids from cellular depots and that this process is coordinately regulated with lipid synthesis. Induced mutant mouse lines that overexpress or lack hormone-sensitive lipase also provided evidence that hormone-sensitive lipase-mediated cholesteryl ester hydrolysis is involved in steroid-hormone production in adrenals and affects testis function. Finally, hormone-sensitive lipase deficiency in mice results in a lipoprotein profile characterized by low triglyceride and VLDL levels and increased HDL cholesterol concentrations. Summary: The 'anti-atherosclerotic' plasma lipoprotein profile and the fact that hormone-sensitive lipase deficient animals become lean identifies the inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase as a potential target for the treatment of lipid disorders and obesity.","Diabetes; Energy metabolism; Hormone sensitive lipase; Obesity","cholesterol ester; fatty acid derivative; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipid; steroid hormone; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; adipose tissue; adrenal gland; catabolism; enzyme activity; enzyme deficiency; enzyme degradation; enzyme inhibition; hormone sensitivity; human; hydrolysis; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; review; testis function; Adipose Tissue; Adrenal Glands; Animals; Arteriosclerosis; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Cholesterol Esterase; Cholesterol Esters; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fatty Acids; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Obesity; Testis; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038509024

Samples were collected from Lorbé (Galicia, north-western Spain) between November 1994 and October 1995. The gametogenic cycle of the sea urchin was annual, with a long, single spawning period from May to August 1995. Most of the biochemical components in gonad showed clear seasonal variation, which was related to the gonad cycle. The main component was protein, which ranged between 36 and 60% of the dry weight, with maximum levels coinciding with the minimum levels of glycogen. Gonad glycogen therefore seemed to be the energy source employed for protein synthesis during gametogenesis. Seasonal variation in total lipids in the gonad was less evident; the main lipidic component was triacylglycerol (around 10% of the dry weight), whereas total cholesterol accounted for less than 1%. The gut does not seem to act as a storage tissue in P. lividus and seasonal variation in biochemical components may be a consequence of fluctuations in the availability of food.",,"biochemical composition; echinoderm; reproductive cycle; seasonal variation; Spain; Echinodermata; Echinoidea; Invertebrata; Paracentrotus lividus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038399937

Such data are crucial for predicting the power consumption and data rate of storage devices using state-of-the-art CMOS manufacturing technology to achieve its associated minimum feature sizes. We describe the fabrication process and critical issues in connection with a complex device process that merges mix and match e-beam/optical lithography with the micro/nano electromechanical system (M/NEMS) fabrication technique.

The priming effect, i.e. the increase in soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition rate after fresh organic matter input to soil, is often supposed to result from a global increase in microbial activity due to the higher availability of energy released from the decomposition of fresh organic matter. Work to date, however, suggests that supply of available energy induces no effect on SOM mineralization. The mechanisms of the priming effect are much more complex than commonly believed. The objective of this review was to build a conceptual model of the priming effect based on the contradictory results available in the literature adopting the concept of nutritional competition. After fresh organic matter input to soils, many specialized microorganisms grow quickly and only decompose the fresh organic matter. We postulated that the priming effect results from the competition for energy and nutrient acquisition between the microorganisms specialized in the decomposition of fresh organic matter and those feeding on polymerised SOM. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We hypothesized that African-American obese adolescents are more insulin resistant than their white peers, but have lower insulin secretion, thus increasing their risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The present study investigated insulin sensitivity and secretion, visceral adiposity (VAT), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profile in black obese adolescents (BOA) vs. white obese adolescents (WOA). Twenty-four BOA and 26 WOA underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp to assess insulin sensitivity, a hyperglycemic clamp to determine insulin secretion, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry for body composition and computed tomography scan at L4-L5 to measure VAT and sc abdominal adipose tissue. Fasting lipid and automated blood pressure measurements were obtained. The WOA and BOA groups were divided into low VAT and high VAT groups. BOA compared with WOA of similar body mass index and percent body fat had less visceral adiposity, lower hepatic glucose production, and lower lipid levels. Visceral adiposity was associated with lower insulin sensitivity in both groups [low vs. high VAT; BOA, 2.9 ± 0.4 vs. 1.7 ± 0.2 μmol/kg·min per pmol/liter (P = 0.016); WOA, 2.6 ± 0.5 vs. 1.5 ± 0.1 (P = 0.032)]. However, this was compensated by higher insulin secretion in whites (low VAT, 934.8 ± 121.8; high VAT, 1590.6 ± 232.8 pmol/ liter; P = 0.037), but not in blacks (low VAT, 1398.9 ± 214.0; high VAT, 1423.7 ± 108.7 pmol/liter). Glucose disposition index (insulin sensitivity x first phase insulin) was lower in high VAT vs. low VAT BOA, but not in WOA. In each racial group, high VAT groups had elevation of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, but dyslipidemia was worse in WOA with high VAT. In conclusion, a given level of body mass index confers different metabolic risks for WOA vs. BOA. Although differences in fat patterning may help explain the more atherogenic risk profile in whites, the cause of the more diabetogenic insulin sensitivity/secretion profile in blacks remains unknown and needs to be investigated further.",,"adipose tissue; adolescence; adolescent; article; atherogenesis; body composition; body fat; body mass; cardiovascular disease; Caucasian; clinical article; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diabetogenesis; diastolic blood pressure; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; dyslipidemia; female; gluconeogenesis; glucose blood level; human; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; insulin release; insulin sensitivity; lipid blood level; lipid storage; male; medical assessment; Negro; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; race difference; risk factor; syndrome X; boa; Pierinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038305833

Feeding the feed with lower energy content (pre-starter) for the first 4 days resulted in lower body weight at the age of 21 days as compared with broilers that from the very beginning were fed mixture with an increased energy level. In the later period growth compensation took place and the differences in the body weights were insignificant between the analogical groups. The lowest feed conversion for 1 kg of gain was observed in broilers fed mixtures of increased energy content as compared to the NRC standards however, the use of pre-starter caused the decrease of feed conversion. The reduction of energy level in the first days decreased the number of mortality cases in chicken during the whole period of rearing. The increase of the amino acid level in the starter mixtures did not affect the results of chicken rearing. EYC was lowest in chicken from groups fed the feed with the lowest energy level. Carcass dressing percentage, as the shares of breast and leg muscles in the carcass were similar and the differences were statistically insignificant. The amount of abdominal fat was lowest in chicken fed the starter mixture with the highest energy level and enriched with amino acids. The differences in the chemical composition of breast and leg muscles, although statistically significant, had no practical value. Breast and leg muscles in chicken fed the pre-starter mixture were characterised by a lower cholesterol level than those fed the starter mixture from right after hatching. The composition of fatty acids in the breast and leg muscles depended in a significant way on the energy level in the mixtures - with the lower energy level the content of saturated fatty acids was significantly higher than in the muscles of chicken fed mixtures supplemented with oil. It also affected the intensity of the oxidation processes during storage. The abdominal fat showed a slower increase in peroxide number and TBARS during cold storage and while deep frozen as compared with the fat of chickens fed mixtures of a higher energy level. The intramuscular fat in chicken fed less energetic feed contained more palmitic, oleic and palmitoleic acid as well as twice less linoleic acid and 2-3 times less linolenic acid as compared with fat of broilers fed mixtures of a higher energy contents.","Amino acids; Broiler; Carcass quality; Cholesterol; Fatty acids; Metabolizable energy; Nutrition; Performance; Pre-starter; TBARS","Gallus gallus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038266522

The concepts of 'passivity' of waste and its 'passive storage' have been much discussed, and their attributes defined. However, there has been a tendency to take 'passive' as an absolute, which it simply cannot be. This paper discusses passivity and passive storage, suggests definitions for relevant terms, and makes a case for a semi-quantitative index to measure the level of passivity represented by a given waste inventory. It also suggests that such an index would prove a valuable tool for judging the progress of waste treatment and decommissioning programmes. Further, increasing passivity may well reduce security concerns, and a preliminary discussion of this concept is presented.","Radiation protection; Safety & hazards; Waste management & disposal","Accident prevention; Decommissioning (nuclear reactors); Radiation hazards; Radiation protection; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive waste storage; Waste management; Passive storage; Passivity; Nuclear energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038199590

Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Population-based sample. Body composition was assessed in the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and interviews were conducted at the patient's home. Subject(s): One hundred two women from the Melbourne Women's Midlife Health Project. Data, physical measures, and blood were obtained by interview when the longitudinal study commenced (baseline) and at the time of the total body scan approximately 5 years later. Body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Total body fat and central abdominal fat. Result(s): The 102 women were either premenopausal or in the early menopausal transition at baseline. At the time of their dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, 31 were in the early menopausal transition, 22 were in the late menopausal transition, and 49 were postmenopausal. Multiple regression analysis found that total percentage of body fat was associated with weight measures, whereas central abdominal fat was also positively associated with baseline free T index (FTI) and with the increase in FTI since baseline. Conclusion(s): The major hormonal change associated with central adiposity during the menopausal transition is the increase in the FTI. This effect is significant even after allowing for baseline and final weight. © 2003 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.","Central abdominal fat; Estradiol; Free testosterone index; Menopausal transition; Percent body fat; Weight","estradiol; fat; follitropin; hormone; testosterone; abdomen; adult; anthropometry; article; blood analysis; body composition; body fat; body weight; climacterium; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; hormone blood level; human; interview; lipid storage; longitudinal study; multiple regression; normal human; obesity; population research; postmenopause; premenopause; priority journal; testosterone blood level",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038173304

To do this will require proper attention to the prompt radiation hazards due to the release of energy in the annihilations of antiprotons with nuclei, under either planned or accidental circumstances. In this paper, the potential storage of very low energy antiprotons is discussed, and the major features of the radiation fields produced by their annihilations are reviewed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Detailed Monte Carlo shielding calculations for a conceptual source of annihilating antiprotons nearly at rest are presented. It is concluded that these radiation fields are readily understood and that the radiation hazards can be mitigated using conventional means.","Dose assessment; Monte Carlo; Photons; Shielding","article; atom; elementary particle; energy; Monte Carlo method; nuclear physics; photon; priority journal; proton radiation; radiation field; radiation hazard; Air; Elementary Particles; Energy Transfer; Equipment Design; Models, Theoretical; Monte Carlo Method; Protons; Quantum Theory; Radiation Dosage; Radiation Protection; Radiometry; Risk Assessment; Stainless Steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038103480

The two processes correspond to the inflow of either a low or high temperature liquid stream into an enclosure initially filled with a uniformly high or low temperature liquid, respectively. The level of internal entropy generation due to thermal mixing between the inflow and the initial liquid volume corresponds to losses in the usable fraction of the stored volume and therefore decreased efficiency. Empirically, the observed behavior of direct sensible storage devices spans the range of nearly mixed to highly stratified. In the present work, analytical models for the fully-mixed and ideally-stratified limits are used to bound these behaviors and to analytically determine the corresponding entropy generation levels. The ratio of total entropy gene ration for the ideally-stratified limit relative to that of the fully-mixed limit is shown to vary as √8/(πPe). The limiting behaviors therefore define a continuum of entropy generation levels separated by up to several orders of magnitude for typical Peclet numbers. A published numerical model which accounts for aspects of the observed thermal mixing is then examined in relation to these limits. The model predicts entropy generation levels midway between the limiting behaviors which suggests significant potential for Improvements in the efficiency of direct sensible storage devices.",,"Continuum mechanics; Heat storage; Mixing; Thermodynamic stability; Internal entropy generation; Entropy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038080209

Electrochemical characterization was performed by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and charge-discharge experiments in aqueous medium. Two types of electrochemical phenomenon were observed; the first is based on electrostatic energy storage in the double layer at the interface solution/carbon polyacrylonitrile (PAN) aerogel, the other is associated with the redox processes in polyaniline, for which the faradaic charge depends on the potential range. The performance of the supercapacitor was tested for capacity, energy and power density and self-discharge. Specific capacitance as high as 230 F g-1 was reached. A symmetrical supercapacitor showed good cyclability (over 3000 cycles) during repeated charge-discharge cycles. The results are very promising and demonstrate the viability of a symmetric supercapacitor based on carbon PAN aerogel covered by an electronically conducting polymer.","Carbon aerogel; Conducting polymer; Polyacrylonitrile; Polyaniline; Supercapacitor","Aerogels; Capacitors; Electric discharges; Electropolymerization; Polyacrylonitriles; Redox reactions; Supercapacitors; Electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038036155

If such systems must achieve high transmission in addition to their isochronicity, they must be designed such that their lateral phase-space acceptance is larger than the corresponding emittance of the injected ion beam. It furthermore is advantageous to construct the system from matched unit cells, a technique also used in the design of accelerator storage rings. One such time-of-flight mass spectrometer has been built as a system in which ions are repeatedly reflected between two grid-free ion mirrors whose optic axes coincide.

Histological evidence suggests that atresia in many oviparous vertebrates involves proteolytic degradation of the energy-rich yolk storage proteins within the oocyte. This study tests the hypothesis that physiological conditions that promote atresia (hormone withdrawal) lead to increased lysosomal protease activity in rainbow trout oocytes. We subjected rainbow trout ovarian follicles to conditions that promote atresia (serum-free culture) for up to 72 hr, and measured the activity of lysosomal proteases using routine enzymatic assays. Furthermore, we used high performance liquid chromatography to quantify the increase in free amino acids resulting from proteolysis of yolk proteins. Concomitantly, we evaluated the extent of follicular apoptosis during prolonged serum-free culture, using caspase-3-like activity and DNA fragmentation as indicators of apoptosis. Our results show a significant, time-dependent increase in cathepsin L-like, but not cathepsin D-like, activity levels during culture in serum-free medium; increased cathepsin L-like activity is confirmed by a significant increase in oocyte free amino acid content after 72 hr culture. In contrast, we detected only a transient increase in apoptosis during prolonged serum-free culture, as revealed through both radioactive 3′end-labeling of oligonucleosomal DNA fragments, and caspase-3-like activity.

We also analysed the effect of metabolites, co-enzymes and enzymatic blockers on sperm motility behaviour and viability. Similar to other teleostean species, African catfish spermatozoa have the capacity for glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, lipid catabolism, β-oxidation and osmoregulation. In immotile spermatozoa, lipid catabolism, β-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation were important primary energy-delivering pathways; sperm oxygen consumption was 0.39-0.85 μg O2/min/ ml of testicular semen. During motility, glycolysis, lipid catabolism and β-oxidation of fatty acids occurred simultaneously, which is atypical for teleosts, and the spermatozoal respiration rate increased drastically by 15-25-fold. Also in contrast to other teleostean sperm cells, ATP levels remained stable during motility and immotile storage. The sperm cell status was unstable in the African catfish. Although the spermatozoa have osmoregulation ability, and even though balanced physiological saline solutions were used for sperm motility activation and sperm incubation, the motility and viability of spermatozoa quickly decreased at 28°C, the spawning temperature of the African catfish. Cyclic AMP and inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity could not prolong sperm motility and viability. In contrast, at 6-10°C motility was prolonged from approximately 30 s to &gt;5 min, probably due to decreased metabolic rates. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

After about 1 min of ischemic muscle contraction in diseased muscle a significant acceleration in phosphocreatine breakdown was observed, along with a significant decrease in adenosine triphosphate. During both contractions the absence of glycolysis was shown by a significant alkalinization. Furthermore, in patients we observed a greater increase in the S-EMG amplitude than in control subjects. We conclude that early on during moderate exercise, a small number of muscle fibers reach metabolic depletion, indicated by a reduction in the adenine nucleotide pool. An increasing number of motor units, which are still in a high-energy state, are continuously recruited to compensate for muscle fatigue.

Recently, α-tocopherol was shown to decrease 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) levels. We investigated the involvement of DAG in cardiac hypertrophy due to energy metabolism disorder by evaluating the effects of α-tocopherol administration on the hearts of JVS mice. Methods: Both JVS and control mice were fed a high α-tocopherol diet or a standard diet from 4 to 8 weeks of age. Myocardial DAG levels and fatty acid composition were assessed at 8 weeks of age. Results: The ventricular to body weight ratio in the JVS mice was significantly higher than that in the control mice [11.2±0.1 (mean±S.E.M.) versus 3.8±0.1 mg/g, P<0.01], and was reduced by α-tocopherol treatment (9.7±0.2 mg/g, P<0.01 versus JVS mice). However, echocardiographic analysis showed the exaggeration of left ventricular dilatation in the α-tocopherol treated JVS mice (P<0.01 versus JVS mice). The myocardial thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substance level was not affected by α-tocopherol treatment. The myocardial DAG level was 2.5-fold higher in the JVS mice compared with that in the control mice (2004±136 versus 806±36 ng/mg dry weight, P<0.01) with a significant increase in 18:1 and 18:2 fatty acids. α-Tocopherol treatment reduced myocardial DAG levels in the JVS mice (1443±49 ng/mg dry weight, P<0.01 versus JVS mice) without any alteration of the fatty acid composition. Conclusions: α-Tocopherol treatment may partially reduce cardiac hypertrophy but it may also depress cardiac function in the JVS mice by decreasing the myocardial DAG level. An increase in DAG might be involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and in the maintenance of cardiac function in energy metabolism disorder of the heart. © 2003 European Society of Cardiology.

Leptin acts centrally to regulate appetite and energy expenditure and has peripheral effects to coordinate wholebody energy metabolism. Leptin acts as an energy balance and nutrient sensor; its expression and function are regulated by endocrine and dietary factors. Leptin regulates lipid metabolism, specifically lipid storage in adipocytes as well as in skeletal muscle, liver and the pancreas. Effects of leptin on tissue lipid metabolism include regulation of lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Leptin resistance is a hallmark of rodent and human obesity and appears to be due to defects in leptin-receptor signalling (proximal and perhaps distal) as well as impaired leptin transport into the brain. Dietary composition, especially dietary fatty acid intake and profile, impacts on the expression of genes encoding leptin and leptin receptors as well as downstream leptin effectors. Dietary fat consumption, especially consumption of saturated fatty acids, can induce leptin resistance. Leptin has been implicated in nutritional programming during fetal and neonatal growth with long-term effects on susceptibility to obesity, diabetes and CHD in adults.","Energy metabolism; Leptin; Lipid homeostasis; Nutritional programming; Obesity","leptin; lipid; saturated fatty acid; adipocyte; appetite; brain; cardiovascular disease; dietary intake; disease predisposition; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; food composition; homeostasis; human; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; nonhuman; nutrition; obesity; protein function; protein synthesis; protein transport; review; signal transduction; Rodentia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037790639

Theoretically, because energy flow is fundamental to the function of decomposer organisms and ecosystems, energetics could provide complimentary fundamental constraints on soil C dynamics. Often, however, C is considered as a surrogate for energy in studies of detrital decay and C turnover in soil. Bomb calorimetry has long been used to measure stored energy in organic matter, but in detritus not all of the energy is bioavailable. Here I outline an approach to quantify the flux of bioavailable energy dissipated by resident heterotrophic communities in soil organic horizons in situ. I used the principle of energy balance together with a biogeochemical process model parameterized through calorimetric analysis of field samples. I also tested relationships between C and energy across samples of forest detritus (foliar and fine root litter, well-decayed Oea material, and woody debris), across decay stages, and between a deciduous and coniferous forest at the Harvard Forest, MA, USA. As a first approximation, energy and C concentrations were closely related (within ca. 10%), as were ratios of heterotrophic energy dissipation to C mineralization across types of detritus (within 16%). Differences in energy content and energy: C ratios were measurable in forest detritus (particularly woody vs nonwoody), but did not vary reliably enough between forest types or through detrital stages to indicate that soil C models could be improved by including energetics. Model results indicated that there are strong similarities in energy flows and storage in the O horizons of the contrasting forest types studied at this location. Future research could focus on broader patterns across climates or biomes.","Carbon cycling; Coarse woody debris; Decomposition; Energetics; Litter quality; Soil ecology","bioavailability; carbon cycle; decomposition; energetics; forest soil; global change; soil carbon; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037743686

These modifications improve the thermal stability at high charge level or overcharge, as well as cycling and storage properties. Commercial material is now available at large industrial scale, which allows its use in big ""industrial"" Li ion batteries. Using low cost raw material (Ni), it is expected to be cost competitive with the manganese based systems usually mentioned as low cost on the total cell $/Wh basis. Providing higher energy density, and demonstrating excellent behavior on storage and extended cycle life, LiNiO2 has definite advantages over the manganese system. Thanks to their properties, these batteries have demonstrated their ability to be used in lot of applications, either for transportation or standby. Their light weight makes them attractive for powering satellites. Although safety improvements are always desirable for all non-aqueous batteries using flammable organic electrolytes, suitable battery designs allow the systems to reach the acceptable level of safety required by many users.

Plasticizer loss was a significant ageing mechanism only for those samples aged unconfined. In addition, there was an indication that ambient humidity had a significant but reversible effect on propellant mechanical properties. Arrhenius mathematical relationships were derived in order to ascertain the extent to which ageing was accelerated by increased propellant temperature. An activation energy for binder oxidation of between 71 and 74 kJ/mol was determined.","Ageing; Propellant; Rocket","Aging of materials; Degradation; High temperature applications; Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; Rockets; Ageing kinetics; Solid propellants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037706155

The cell consists of an improved manganese spinel as the positive electrode and hard carbon for the negative electrode. The Mn-based Li ion cell for HEVs was developed by adding a high power density modification to a pure-EV (EV) cell of high energy density specification. It has a power density as high as 2000 W/kg at 50% depth of discharge (DOD) and 25 °C. Storage tests at various temperatures suggest a practical calendar life of more than 5 years. The 48-cell battery module was developed for use in an HEV. It also proved to have an excellent output power density of 1350 W/kg at 50% DOD. Based on the excellent characteristics of the lithium ion battery, it seems very promising to apply this battery not only to EV, HEV and other motor-assisting drive systems but also to other high power applications. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Krishnan Road, New Delhi 110 012, India","Metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) storage capacitors based on electron beam deposited Y2O3 extrinsic dielectric on Si show changes in capacitance density depending on the amorphous and crystalline phases. Bias stress cycle-dependent changes in capacitance density occur due to the non-equilibrium nature of defect states at the Y2O3/Si interface after O2 annealing as a result of the emergence of a 4-8 nm thick SiO2 film at the interface. Leakage currents show instability under repeated dc bias stress, the nature and extent of which depend upon the structure of the Y2O3 gate dielectric and the polarity of dc bias. With amorphous Y2O3, leakage currents drift to lower values under gate injection due to electron trapping, and to higher values under Si-injection due to the generation of holes. Though leakage current drift is minimal for crystalline Y2O3, its magnitude increases as the energy of injected electrons from mid-gap states is low and the local field due to asperity is high. The emergence of interfacial SiO2 reduces the magnitude of Si-injection leakage current substantially, but causes transient changes resulting in switching to higher values at a threshold dc bias. Thermal detrapping of holes and reverse bias stress studies confirm that the instability of current is caused by an increase in the cathodic field from hole trapping at interface states. Leakage current instability limits the application of extrinsic high dielectric constant dielectrics in a high density DRAM storage capacitor, unless a new interface layer scheme other than SiO2 and a method to form a defect-free dielectric layer can be implemented.",,"Deposition; Dielectric materials; Dynamic random access storage; Electron beams; Interfaces (materials); Leakage currents; Permittivity; Yttrium compounds; Capacitance density; Current instability; Electron beam deposition; Thermal detrapping; MOS capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037596475

We hypothesised that fat tissue nutritive blood flow and volume, and thereby water content, would increase during weight loss and weight maintenance in obese persons. DESIGN: Longitudinal clinical intervention with a 9-week very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) followed by one year of weight maintenance. SUBJECTS: Obese men (n = 13) and women (n = 14) with the metabolic syndrome. MEASUREMENTS: Water content of abdominal subcutaneous fat tissue as estimated by a sensor on the skin surface measuring the dielectric constant at 300 MHz. Anthropometric measures of fatness and fat distribution. Biochemical measures related to insulin resistance. RESULTS: Subjects lost 14.5±3.4% of body weight during the VLCD, and generally sustained this weight loss during weight maintenance. Insulin sensitivity as estimated by an index (qualitative insulin sensitivity check index) increased during the VLCD, and remained increased throughout weight maintenance. The dielectric constant increased from 23.3±2.3 to 25.0±2.1 (P<0.001) during the VLCD, and further to 27.84±1.9 (P<0.001) during weight maintenance, indicating an increase in the water content of subcutaneous fat. The increase in subcutaneous fat water content did not correlate with weight loss and other measures of adiposity during the VLCD, but there was an inverse correlation that strengthened in significance from baseline to 6, 9 and 12 mo (r=-0.32 to -0.64, P=0.079-0.002). Increases in subcutaneous fat water content also correlated with improvements in insulin sensitivity at 6, 9 and 12 months of weight maintenance (r = 0.34-0.54, P = 0.094-0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Water content of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue increases with weight loss in obese persons with the metabolic syndrome, and may reflect increased subcutaneous fat tissue nutritive blood flow. The increase in water content correlates with the increase in insulin sensitivity, suggesting that weight loss and consequent improved insulin sensitivity could mediate the increase in abdominal subcutaneous fat hydration.","Insulin resistance; Metabolic syndrome; Subcutaneous fat tissue; Very-low-calorie diet; Weight maintenance","adipose tissue; adult; anthropometric parameters; article; clinical article; correlation analysis; dielectric constant; female; human; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; low calory diet; male; obesity; priority journal; subcutaneous fat; water content; weight reduction; Abdomen; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Blood Glucose; Body Composition; Body Water; C-Peptide; Cholesterol, HDL; Double-Blind Method; Energy Intake; Female; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Lipoproteins, LDL; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Subcutaneous Tissue; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037499523

Hydrogen is relevant to all of the energy sectors - transportation, buildings, utilities and industry. It can provide storage options for baseload (geothermal), seasonal (hydroelectric) and intermittent (PV and wind) renewable resources, and when combined with emerging decarbonization technologies, can reduce the climate impacts of continued fossil fuel utilization. However, hydrogen energy systems still face a number of technical and economical barriers that must first be overcome for hydrogen to become a competitive energy carrier. Advances must be made in hydrogen production, storage, transport and utilization technologies and in the integration of these components into complete energy systems. To expedite the advancement of hydrogen technologies and realize a hydrogen future, nations have come together under the auspices of the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Hydrogen Program to collaborate and address the important barriers that impede hydrogen's worldwide acceptance. Through well-structured, collaborative projects, experts from around the world address many of the technical challenges and long-term research needs that face the hydrogen community. These collaborations have already led to significant advances in renewable hydrogen production and solid storage materials and to the development of tools to evaluate and optimize integrated hydrogen energy systems. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen energy; Hydrogen storage; IEA","Energy storage; Environmental protection; Hydrogen; Hydrogen energy; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037409136

The results obtained from DSC were applied to autocatalytic and diffusion controlled kinetic models. The reaction mechanism broadly showed autocatalytic behaviour regardless of the presence of PEEK-T. At higher PEEK-T concentration, more diffusion controlled mechanism was observed. The rate of curing reaction decreased with increase in thermoplastic content and also with the lowering of curing temperature. The activation energies of the blends are higher than that of the neat resin. The blends showed a phase separated morphology. The dispersed phase showed a homogeneous particle size distribution. The Tg of the neat resin decreased with the decrease in cure temperature. Two Tg's corresponding to the epoxy rich and thermoplastic rich phases were observed in the dynamic mechanical spectrum.

Excess adsorption of hydrogen on the SWCNT with diameters of 1.225, 2.04, and 2.719 nm at 77 K and at ambient temperature, T = 300 K, has been calculated. DFT calculations indicate that the excess gravimetric storage capacity of exohedral adsorption of hydrogen on SWCNT array is as much as 30% of that of endohedral adsorption when the van der Walls (VDW) gap was fixed at 0.335 nm, while excess adsorption of hydrogen outside the nanotubes is close to or exceeds the excess endohedral adsorption for isolated nanotubes. The total excess gravimetric storage capacity (including endohedral and exohedral adsorptions) of hydrogen on open nanotube arrays of 2.719 nm is 7.1 wt % at 77 K and 4 MPa, while the total excess adsorption of hydrogen on open isolated nanotubes of 2.719 nm reaches 9.5 wt % at the same temperature and pressure. The two results both reach the gravimetric density of Department of Energy (DOE) target, 6.5 wt %, which means that the adsorption storage of hydrogen on S WCNTs has a practical significance. However, the total excess adsorption of hydrogen both on carbon nanotube arrays and on isolated nanotubes at 300 K does not exceed 1 wt % in the range of pressures that we studied and almost linearly increases with the increase of pressure. This is because the hydrogen molecules have enough kinetic energy to overcome the adsorption potential of SWCNTs at T = 300 K. For carbon nanotube arrays, the effect of VDW gap on hydrogen adsorption was investigated. Results indicate that in the range from 0.335 to 2.0 nm a larger VDW gap implies a greater excess gravimetric capacity and a smaller volumetric storage capacity, simultaneously. In addition, we also note that the choice of method used to determine the bulk density is key because it significantly affects the excess adsorption of hydrogen. In this work. DFT method is used to determine both the gas density in the confined space and the density in the bulk states simultaneously. It is more accurate than MBWR equation of state in solving the bulk density. In short, the predicted results of hydrogen storage capacities in SWCNTs at T = 300 and 77 K in this work are in reasonable agreement with experimentally measured data.",,"Adsorption; Calculations; Density (specific gravity); Equations of state; Gravimetric analysis; Hydrogen; Kinetic energy; Potential energy; Pressure effects; Probability density function; Thermal effects; Van der Waals forces; Adsorption potential; Bulk density; Gravimetric storage capacity; Hydrogen adsorption storage; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037526432

The importance of sizing the included components in the energy system is presented in economic terms. The size of the fuel cell system and the energy storage system (battery, hot-water storage and hydrogen storage) are discussed in relation to the yearly distribution of the buildings' power demand. The main design idea is to decrease the size of the fuel cell system without making the battery too expensive and that the power requirements are fulfilled over test periods with decided length and power output. The fuel cell system installation is not economically viable for the presented conditions, but in the paper future feasible scenarios are presented. The calculated incomes are shown as a function of the size of the fuel cell system and energy storage, the electricity costs, the fuel costs including transportation, the prices of electricity and heat, and the fuel cell system costs and efficiencies. The main factor in the system's economic performance is the fuel price, which contributes more than half the costs for the fuel cell system-based energy system. The cost of the power grid is also determining for the result, where the distance to the main power grid is the important factor. The evaluation is performed from the utility company's point of view. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The blanks attained capacities in the range 150-200 mAhg-1, although these values were largely exceeded by some IMC + Fe composites due, presumably, to storage on hydrogen. The electrocatalytic properties of Fe are probably not sufficient to explain the activation of hydrogen absorption in the inhibited IMC, since X-ray and energy-dispersive analysis (EDAX) of activated samples did reveal that deep modifications occurred in some composites, in which the formation of new phases may have been induced by charging-discharging cycles. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Povidone-iodine (PI) (Betadine, Purdue Fredrick Co., Norwalk, CT) is used during pancreas transplantation to provide duodenal decontamination without any intestinal complications. Methods. This study assessed the combined effect of a luminal pretreatment with PI followed by a proven amino acid (AA)-rich preservation solution on small bowel (SB) storage quality. Rat SB was procured using intra-arterial University of Wisconsin solution followed by luminal administration with combinations of AA±PI pretreatment as follows: group 1, 20 mL AA solution; group 2, 20 mL PI and 20 mL AA solution; group 3, 100 mL AA solution; and group 4, 20 mL PI and 100 mL AA solution. Cellular energetics, permeability, and histology were analyzed throughout 10-hr cold storage. Results. After 10 hr, adenosine triphosphate levels remained 2.9 to 3.2 μmol/g protein lower in the PI-treated groups than in groups 1 and 3. Functional parameters were also negatively affected by PI treatment. Mannitol permeability was 203 and 66 nmol/cm2 per hr in groups 2 and 4 versus 46 and 44 nmol/cm2 per hr in groups 1 and 3. Median grades of histologic injury (Park's) at 10 hr were 3, 5.5, 4, and 5 for groups 1 through 4, respectively. Luminal flushing with PI or AA solution resulted in an equivalent clearance greater than 95% of enteric bacteria present. Conclusion. Short-duration luminal PI exposure potentiates SB injury and provides no improved intestinal decontamination.",,"amino acid; mannitol; povidone iodine; University of Wisconsin solution; animal tissue; article; bacterial count; cell kinetics; conductance; controlled study; cryopreservation; energy transfer; histology; histopathology; intestine mucosa permeability; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; small intestine; storage; time series analysis; tissue preservation; Animals; Anti-Infective Agents, Local; Bacterial Translocation; Colony Count, Microbial; Decontamination; Intestine, Small; Male; Povidone-Iodine; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038247845

While it is primarily regulated by AMP and ATP, high muscle glycogen has also been shown to repress its activation [2, 3]. Mutations in the γ2 and γ3 subunit isoforms lead to arrhythmias associated with abnormal glycogen storage in human heart [4-7] and elevated glycogen in pig muscle [8], respectively. A putative glycogen binding domain (GBD) has now been identified in the β subunits. Coexpression of truncated β subunits lacking the GBD with α and γ subunits yielded complexes that were active and normally regulated. However, coexpression of α and γ with full-length β caused accumulation of AMPK in large cytoplasmic inclusions that could be counterstained with anti-glycogen or anti-glycogen synthase antibodies. These inclusions were not affected by mutations that increased or abolished the kinase activity and were not observed by using truncated β subunits lacking the GBD. Our results suggest that the GBD binds glycogen and can lead to abnormal glycogen-containing inclusions when the kinase is overexpressed. These may be related to the abnormal glycogen storage bodies seen in heart disease patients with γ2 mutations.",,"Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038814313

Furthermore, metformin and rosiglitazone, frontline drugs used for the treatment of type II diabetes, activate AMPK [4]. Mammalian AMPK is an αβγ heterotrimer with multiple isoforms of each subunit comprising α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2, and γ3, which have varying tissue and subcellular expression [5, 6]. Mutations in the AMPK γ subunit cause glycogen storage disease in humans [7], but the molecular relationship between glycogen and the AMPK/Snf1p kinase subfamily has not been apparent. We show that the AMPK β subunit contains a functional glycogen binding domain (β-GBD) that is most closely related to isoamylase domains found in glycogen and starch branching enzymes. Mutation of key glycogen binding residues, predicted by molecular modeling, completely abolished β-GBD binding to glycogen. AMPK binds to glycogen but retains full activity. Overexpressed AMPK β1 localized to specific mammalian subcellular structures that corresponded with the expression pattern of glycogen phosphorylase. Glycogen binding provides an architectural link between AMPK and a major cellular energy store and juxtaposes AMPK to glycogen bound phosphatases.",,"Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037799908

These employ differential scanning calorimetry to monitor thermal effects at elevated temperatures (around 200 °C) and heat conduction calorimetry to record thermal effects at much lower temperatures (below 100 °C). The work shows that, due to the generally high thermal stability of many high explosive compositions, heat generation rates are very low, if detectable at all, at normal storage temperatures, even when using a very sensitive instrument. The sensitivity and reproducibility of this technique has been investigated in detail by Wilker et al. [S. Wilker, U. Ticmanis, G. Pantel, Detailed investigation of sensitivity and reproducibility of heat flow calorimetry, in: Proceedings of the 11th Symposium on Chemical Problems Connected with the Stability of Explosives, Sweden, 1998] and shown to be capable of recording heat generation rates of less than a microwatt. This allows continuous measurement of decomposition processes in nitrate ester based propellants at temperatures as low as 40 °C. However, the measurement of very low levels of heat generation is difficult, time consuming and therefore expensive. If the assumption is made that the life limiting process is invariably the slow decomposition of the energetic component, this will frequently lead to very long service lifetime predictions. A number of possible complications are identified. Firstly, due to its low detection threshold, a heat conduction calorimeter may detect other reactions which will not lead to failure, but which may still dominate the heat flow signal. Secondly, the true failure process may generate little energy and be overlooked. In view of these considerations, at present it seems unwise to rely on heat conduction microcalorimetry as the only tool for the assessment of the life of high explosive energetic systems. Based on examples of life terminating processes in high explosives during storage and use, it is clear that decomposition of the energetic material is not invariably the cause of system failure. It is also by no means the only reaction that may take place in, and be observed by, a heat conduction calorimeter. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The NRG images were obtained by not only a simple transmission method but also a tomographic one, which could clearly visualize hydrogen distribution in the alloys. The hydrogen diffusion coefficient in these alloys was estimated to be ≈2×10-7 cm2 s-1 from the change in hydrogen absorption depth with hydrogenation time. The comparison of the volume expansion rate due to hydrogen absorption for the alloys showed that Mg3Ni has better toughness than Mg2Ni until Mg3Ni was partly degraded to form magnesium hydride.

Cartilage softens and can be reshaped when heated using laser, RF, or contact heating sources. The objectives of this study were to: (1) measure temperature dependent flexural storage moduli and mechanical relaxation in cartilage, (2) determine the impact of tissue water content and orientation on these mechanical properties, and (3) use these measurements to estimate the activation energy associated with the mechanical relaxation process. Study Design/Materials and Methods: Porcine nasal septal cartilage specimens (30 × 10 × 2 mm) were deformed using a single cantilever arrangement in a dynamic thermomechanical analyzer. Stress relaxation measurements were made at discrete temperatures ranging from 25 to 70°C in response to cyclic deformation (within the linear viscoelastic region). The time and temperature dependent behavior of cartilage was measured using frequency multiplexing techniques (10-64 Hz), and these results were used to estimate the activation energy for the phase change using the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) equation and the Arrhenius kinetic equation. In addition, the effect of tissue orientation was examined with specimens oriented in both transverse and longitudinal directions at room temperature. Results: The storage moduli of porcine cartilage decreased with increasing temperature, and a critical change in mechanical properties was observed between 58 and 60°C with a reduction in the storage modulus by 85-90%. The shift of the stress relaxation behavior from viscoelastic solid to viscoelastic liquid was observed between 50 and 57°C and likely corresponds to the transition temperature region in which structural changes in the tissue occur. The storage moduli for transverse and longitudinally oriented specimens were 19-22 and 14-16 MPa, respectively at ambient temperature. Reducing the water content (<10% mass loss) by allowing it to dry under ambient conditions resulted in reduction in the storage modulus by 31-36%. The activation energy associated with the mechanical relaxation of cartilage was 147 kJ/mole at 60°C. This value was calculated by measuring stress-strain relationship under conditions where linear viscoelastic behavior was observed (0.09-0.15% of strain) within the transition temperature region (58-60°C). Conclusions: The anisotropic mechanical behavior of cartilage was quantitatively analyzed in the transversely and longitudinally oriented specimens. Viscoelastic behavior appeared to be strongly dependent on the water content. Using empirically determined estimates of the transition zone temperature range accompanying stress relaxation, the activation energy for stress relaxation was calculated using time and temperature superposition theory and WLF equation. Further investigation of the molecular changes, which occur during laser irradiation, may assist in understanding the thermal and mechanical behavior of cartilage and how the reshaping process might to be optimized. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Activation energy; Arrhenius relation; Biomechanics; Cartilage reshaping; Dynamic mechanical analyzer; Flexural storage modulus; Otolaryngology; Plastic surgery; Shift factor; Stress relaxation; WLF equation","animal tissue; anisotropy; article; biomechanics; controlled study; energy; heating; kinetics; laser; liquid; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; nose cartilage; otorhinolaryngology; phase transition; plastic surgery; priority journal; stress strain relationship; swine; temperature dependence; theory; thermometer; time; viscoelasticity; water content; Animals; Anisotropy; Biomechanics; Body Water; Elasticity; Lasers; Nasal Septum; Stress, Mechanical; Swine; Temperature; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037624934

It is in general preferred that an absorbing boundary method be capable of broadband absorption, be efficient in terms of memory and computation time, and be widely stable in connection with sophisticated numerical schemes. Here we discuss these issues for a promising absorbing boundary method, perfectly matched layers (PML), as implemented in the widely used fourth-order accurate three-dimensional (3-D) staggered-grid velocity-stress finite difference (FD) scheme. Numerical results for point (explosive and double couple) and extended sources, velocity structures (homogeneous, 1-D and 3-D), and different thickness PML zones are excellent, in general, leaving no observable reflections in PML seismograms compared to the amplitudes of the primary phases. For both homogeneous half-space and 1-D models, typical amplitude reduction factors (with respect to the maximum trace amplitude) range between 1/100 and 1/625 for PML thicknesses of 5-20 nodes. A PML region of thickness 5 outperforms a simple exponential damping region of thickness 20 in a homogeneous half-space model by a factor of 3. We find that PML is effective across the simulation bandwidth. For example, permanent offset artifacts due to particularly poor absorption of long-period energy by the simple exponential damping are effectively absent when PML is used. The computational efficiency and storage requirements of PML, compared to the simple exponential damping, are reduced due to the need for only narrow absorbing regions. We also discuss stability and present the complete PML model for the 3-D velocity-stress system.","Absorbing boundary conditions; Finite differences; Numerical modeling; Perfectly matched layers; Three-dimensional simulations; Wave propagation","layered medium; seismic velocity; seismic wave; three-dimensional modeling; wave propagation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042885467

The development of a reliable and reproducible method for TL dating with zircon requires detailed knowledge of the process taking place during exposure to ionizing radiation, long-term storage, annealing at moderate temperatures and heating at a constant rate (TL measurements). To understand these processes one needs a kinetic model of TL. This paper is devoted to the construction of such a model. The goal is to study the qualitative behaviour of the system and to determine the parameters and processes controlling TL phenomena of zircon. The model considers the following processes: (i) Filling of electron and hole traps at the excitation stage as a function of the dose rate and the dose for both (low dose rate) natural and (high dose rate) laboratory irradiation. (ii) Time dependence of TL fading in samples irradiated under laboratory conditions. (iii) Short time annealing at a given temperature. (iv) Heating of the irradiated sample to simulate TL experiments both after laboratory and natural irradiation. The input parameters of the model, such as the types and concentrations of the TL centres and the energy distributions of the hole and electron traps, were obtained by analysing the experimental data on fading of the TL-emission spectra of samples from different geological locations. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data were used to establish the nature of the TL centres. Glow curves and 3D TL emission spectra are simulated and compared with the experimental data on time-dependent TL fading. The saturation and annealing behaviour of filled trap concentrations has been considered in the framework of the proposed kinetic model and compared with the EPR data associated with the rare-earth ions Tb 3+ and Dy 3+, which play a crucial role as hole traps and recombination centres. In addition, the behaviour of some of the SiO m n- centres has been compared with simulation results.",,"Mineral zircon; Rare earth ions; Thermoluminescence emission spectra; Annealing; Charge carriers; Computer simulation; Emission spectroscopy; Ionizing radiation; Mathematical models; Paramagnetic resonance; Positive ions; Reaction kinetics; Thermoluminescence; Zircon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038813805

Here we investigated the site of action of orexin-A-induced thermogenesis in urethane-anesthetized rats. Microinjection of 1-10 pmol orexin-A into the arcuate nucleus (Arc) specifically increased whole-body O2 consumption (VO2), an index of energy expenditure; whereas it had no effect on VO2 when injected into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), dorsomedial nucleus (DMH), lateral hypothalamus (LH), ventromedial nucleus (VMH) or medial preoptic nucleus (MPO) of the hypothalamus or into in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) or pontine locus coeruleus (LC). VO2 increased immediately after an orexin-A injection into the Arc, and this increase was accompanied by a simultaneous tachycardiac response and a gradual increase in colonic temperature (Tco), whereas an injection of the saline vehicle into the Arc had no effect. The effective dose of orexin-A into the Arc was 10 times less than that into the cerebral ventricle to induce a similar level of response. In addition, intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A (100 pmol) elicited a significantly smaller VO2 response in Arc-lesioned rats than that in sham-operated control rats. These results suggest that the orexin-induced energy expenditure is mediated, at least in part, by the Arc. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Initial insights into the genetic pathways that regulate energy metabolism have been provided by a discrete number of obesity-related genes that have been identified in mammals. Here, we report the identification of the adipose (adp) gene, the mutation of which causes obesity in Drosophila. Loss of adp activity promotes increased fat storage, which extends the lifespan of mutant flies under starvation conditions. By contrast, adp gain-of-function causes a specific reduction of the fat body in Drosophila. adp encodes an evolutionarily conserved WD40/tetratricopeptide-repeat-domain protein that is likely to represent an intermediate in a novel signalling pathway.",,"fat; gene product; lipid; peptide; protein adp; protein WD 40; tetrapeptide; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; protein; TPR protein; WD40 protein; adipose tissue; article; cell mutant; controlled study; Drosophila melanogaster; fat body; female; gene identification; gene mutation; genetic code; genetic conservation; genetic identification; human; lifespan; lipid storage; male; metabolic disorder; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein domain; signal transduction; starvation; adp gene; amino acid sequence; Article; centromere; Drosophila; fat content; gene; gene expression; gene function; gene loss; gene overexpression; lipid storage; mouse; mutant; obesity; phenotype; protein structure; tissue specificity; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Complementary; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins; Energy Metabolism; Evolution, Molecular; Fat Body; Larva; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Obesity; Phenotype; Proteins; Sequence Alignment; Triglycerides; Drosophila melanogaster; Mammalia; Melanogaster",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17144437761

The outer cylinder is filled with phase change material (PCM), while working fluid flows inside the inner pipe. The system works periodically. The related governing equations are solved by a control volume-based finite difference method. The effects of different parameters such as PCM size and melting point temperature are examined on the irreversibility of the system. The results show that the irreversibility of thermal storage module is strongly affected by the size of PCM (diameter and length of the external cylinder) and melting temperature. Based on the obtained results, the irreversibility of the system can be reduced by proper selection of PCM size and melting temperature.",,"Cylinders (containers); Exergy; Finite difference method; Numerical methods; Pipe; Temperature; Melting point temperature; Phase change material; Thermal energy storage system; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344945690

We predicted that dominant territorial hummingbirds will use torpor less than subordinate nonterritorial species because unrestricted access to energy by territory owners allows for fat storage. Entry into torpor was monitored using open-flow respirometry on hummingbirds allowed to accumulate fat normally during the day. Fat accumulation was measured by solvent fat extraction. Territorial blue-throated hummingbirds (Lampornis clemenciae) had the highest fat accumulation and used torpor only 17% of the time. Fat storage by L. clemenciae averaged 26% of lean dry mass (LDM) in 1995 and 18% in 1996, similar to that measured for other nonmigratory birds. Fat storage by magnificent hummingbirds (Eugenes fulgens; trapliner) and black-chinned hummingbirds (Archilochus alexandri; nectar robber) averaged 19% and 16% of LDM, respectively, and they used torpor frequently (64% and 92% of the time, respectively). All species initiated torpor if total body fat dropped below 10% of LDM, indicating the existence of a torpor threshold. The ability of L. clemenciae to store enough fat to support nighttime metabolism is likely an important benefit of territoriality. Likewise, frequent torpor use by subordinates suggests that natural restrictions to energy intake can impact their energy budget, necessitating energy conservation by use of torpor.",,"bioenergetics; bird; fat reserve; foraging behavior; territoriality; torpor; animal; article; bird; body composition; circadian rhythm; comparative study; energy metabolism; feeding behavior; physiology; territoriality; United States; Animals; Arizona; Birds; Body Composition; Circadian Rhythm; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Territoriality; Animalia; Archilochus alexandri; Aves; Eugenes fulgens; Lampornis; Lampornis clemenciae; Trochilidae; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043195420

However, aerobic exercise is hindered in many type 2 diabetic patients because of advancing age, obesity, and other comorbid conditions. Weight lifting or progressive resistance training (PRT) offers a safe and effective exercise alternative for these people. PRT promotes favorable energy balance and reduced visceral fat deposition through enhanced basal metabolism and activity levels while counteracting age- and disease-related muscle wasting. PRT improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic control; increases muscle mass, strength, and endurance; and has positive effects on bone density, osteoarthritic symptoms, mobility impairment, self-efficacy, hypertension, and lipid profiles. PRT also alleviates symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in individuals with clinical depression and improves exercise tolerance in individuals with cardiac ischemic disease and congestive heart failure; all of these aspects are relevant to the care of diabetic elders. Moreover, PRT is safe and well accepted in many complex patient populations, including very frail elderly individuals and those with cardiovascular disease. The greater feasibility of using PRT over aerobic exercise in elderly obese type 2 diabetic individuals because of concomitant cardiovascular, arthritic, and other disease provides a solid rationale for investigating the global benefits of PRT in the management of diabetes.",,"aged; aging; anxiety; basal metabolic rate; comorbidity; depression; disease association; exercise tolerance; geriatric disorder; human; insomnia; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intermethod comparison; lipid storage; muscle atrophy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; physical activity; progressive resistance training; review; risk benefit analysis; safety; treatment indication; weight lifting; Aged; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Exercise; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Life Style; Obesity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043170850

The vast majority of the transcriptome is not influenced by dietary zinc intake, high or low. Of the genes that are zinc regulated, most are involved in signal transduction (particularly influencing the immune response), responses to stress and redox, growth and energy utilization. Among the genes identified are uroguanylin (UG), cholecystokinin, lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), T-cell cytokine receptor, heat shock proteins and the DNA damage repair and recombination protein-23B. Zinc transporters (ZnT) help regulate the supply of this micronutrient to maintain cellular functions. Expression of ZnT-1 and -2 is regulated by dietary zinc in many organs including small intestine and kidney. ZnT-4 is ubiquitously expressed but is refractory to zinc intake. Expression of ZnT-1, -2 and -4 changes markedly during gestation and lactation from highly abundant to undetectable. Each ZnT has an endosomal-like appearance in the tissues examined. Upregulation of ZnT-1 and ZnT-2 by dietary zinc strongly implicates these transporters in zinc acquisition and/or storage for subsequent systemic needs. THP-1 cells were used as a model to examine the response of human cells to changes in zinc status. Based on mRNA quantities, Zip1 and ZnT-5 were the most highly expressed. Zinc depletion of these cells decreased expression of all transporters except Zip2, where expression increased markedly. Collectively, these findings provide a genomic footprint upon which to address the biological and clinical significance of zinc and new avenues for status assessment.","Gene regulation; Genomics; Metabolism; Transporters; Zinc","cholecystokinin; complementary DNA; heat shock protein; messenger RNA; protein tyrosine kinase; T lymphocyte receptor; uroguanylin; animal tissue; conference paper; dietary intake; DNA damage; DNA repair; gene control; growth; human; human cell; monocyte; mouse; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; rat; signal transduction; small intestine; thymus; zinc metabolism; Animalia; Eukaryota",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038752579

At those relativistic velocities, the energies of optical transitions, such as for lasers, are boosted into the X-ray region and the high-charge state ions generate electric and magnetic fields of exceptional strength. Together with high beam intensities a range of important experiments can be anticipated, for example electronic transitions in relativistic heavy-ion collisions such as dynamically induced e+e- pairs, test of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in strong fields, and ions and electrons in ultra-high intensity femtosecond laser fields. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The n-differential data were obtained at the heavy ion storage ring CRYRING by increasing the ion energy in two steps from 3 to 5 MeV/u and from 5 to 7.5 MeV/u. The accompanying increase of the magnetic field in the storage - ring dipole magnets leads to a decrease of the cutoff quantum number nc associated with the field ionization of intermediate N3+(1s22p nl) states. By comparing measurements at two different ion energies the enhancement of DR due to electromagnetic fields is derived for the narrow bandwidths of Rydberg states n ≈ 17-21 and 19-24. The applied electric fields ranged from 0 to 300 V/cm.

This report summarizes the presentations and discussions at a Single Topic Conference held September 20-22, 2002, and sponsored by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. The conference focused on fatty liver disorders. Estimates based on imaging and autopsy studies suggest that about 20% to 30% of adults in the United States and other Western countries have excess fat accumulation in the liver. About 10% of these individuals, or fully 2% to 3% of adults, are estimated to meet current diagnostic criteria for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Sustained liver injury leads to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis in a fraction, possibly up to one third, of those with NASH, and NASH may be a cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis. NASH is now a significant health issue for obese children as well, leading to cirrhosis in some. The diagnostic criteria for NASH continue to evolve and rely on the histologic findings of steatosis, hepatocellular injury (ballooning, Mallory bodies), and the pattern of fibrosis. Generally recognized indications for biopsy include establishing the diagnosis and staging of the injury, but strict guidelines do not exist. Liver enzymes are insensitive and cannot be used reliably to confirm the diagnosis or stage the extent of fibrosis. Older age, obesity, and diabetes are predictive of fibrosis. The pathogenesis of NASH is multifactorial. Insulin resistance may be an important factor in the accumulation of hepatocellular fat, whereas excess intracellular fatty acids, oxidant stress, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, and mitochondrial dysfunction may be important causes of hepatocellular injury in the steatotic liver. Efforts are underway to refine the role of insulin resistance in NASH and determine whether improving insulin sensitivity pharmacologically is an effective treatment. An altered lifestyle may be a more effective means of improving insulin sensitivity. The research agenda for the future includes establishing the role of insulin resistance and abnormal lipoprotein metabolism in NASH, determining the pathogenesis of cellular injury, defining predisposing genetic abnormalities, identifying better noninvasive predictors of disease, and defining effective therapy.",,"acetylcysteine; adenosine triphosphate; alcohol; alpha tocopherol; antidiabetic agent; antilipemic agent; antioxidant; atorvastatin; betaine; bezafibrate; clofibrate; cytokine; fatty acid; gemfibrozil; histamine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; lazaroid; leptin; liver enzyme; metformin; pioglitazone; rosiglitazone; s adenosylmethionine; taurine; tetrahydrolipstatin; troglitazone; unindexed drug; ursodeoxycholic acid; very low density lipoprotein; age; alcohol abuse; autopsy; clinical feature; clinical trial; conference paper; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic accuracy; diet therapy; disease association; disease course; disease model; disorders of mitochondrial functions; energy metabolism; ethnology; exercise; fatty liver; gastroplasty; gender; genetic predisposition; heredity; histopathology; homeostasis; human; imaging; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; laboratory test; lifestyle; lipid storage; lipodystrophy; lipoprotein metabolism; liver biopsy; liver cell damage; liver cirrhosis; liver fibrosis; liver injury; liver toxicity; liver transplantation; Mallory body; non invasive measurement; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; prediction; prevalence; priority journal; prognosis; recurrent disease; reliability; risk factor; staging; stomach bypass; symptom",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038644536

The characteristics of the proposed next-generation facility at GSI, the Super-FRS, will be presented and compared to other projects. The Super-FRS is a large-acceptance superconducting fragment separator followed by different experimental branches including a combination with a new storage-cooler ring system. This system consists of a collector ring (CR) and a new experimental storage ring (NESR) which allow precision mass and lifetime measurements as well as in-ring reaction studies. The NESR can be operated in combination with an electron ring to measure electron scattering with exotic nuclei.

Charge state at emergence, secondary electron multiplicity and X-rays are measured simultaneously. These conditions allow to study the competition between mechanical electron capture (MEC) and radiative electron capture (REC) as a function of impact parameter. We observe that REC is the dominant charge exchange process for the best channeled ions, i.e. those travelling always far from the silicon target core electrons. For ions with high transverse energy, MEC into highly excited states is counterbalanced by enhanced ionization arising from a succession of close collisions along atomic rows. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Over a given period of time it expresses how much the body stores of fat, carbohydrate and protein will change. For the critically-ill patient, who characteristically exhibits raised energy expenditure and proteolysis of skeletal muscle, energy balance information is valuable because underfeeding or overfeeding may compromise recovery. However, there are formidable difficulties in measuring energy balance in these patients. While energy intake can be accurately recorded in the intensive care setting, the measurement of total energy expenditure is problematic. Widely used approaches, such as direct calorimetry or doubly-labelled water, are not applicable to the critically ill patient. Energy balance was determined over periods of 5-10 d in patients in intensive care by measuring changes in the fat, protein and carbohydrate stores of the body. Changes in total body fat were positively correlated with energy balance over the 5 d study periods in patients with severe sepsis (n 24, r 0·56, P = 0·004) or major trauma (n 24, r 0·70, P &lt; 0·0001). Fat oxidation occurred in patients whose energy intake was insufficient to achieve energy balance. Changes in body protein were independent of energy balance. These results are consistent with those of other researchers who have estimated total energy requirements from measurements of O2 consumption and CO2 production. In critically-ill patients achievement of positive non-protein energy balance or total energy balance does not prevent negative N balance. Nutritional therapy for these patients may in the future focus on glycaemic control with insulin and specialised supplements rather than on energy balance per se.","Critical illness; Energy balance; Nutritional support","carbohydrate; carbon dioxide; fat; glucose; glycogen; oxygen; protein; adult; aged; body fat; calorimetry; carbon dioxide measurement; clinical article; conference paper; controlled study; convalescence; critical illness; diet therapy; energy balance; energy consumption; energy expenditure; female; glucose blood level; human; injury; intensive care; lipid storage; male; malnutrition; measurement; nutritional support; overnutrition; oxygen consumption; protein degradation; sepsis; skeletal muscle; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Composition; Calorimetry, Indirect; Critical Illness; Densitometry, X-Ray; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritional Requirements; Nutritional Support; Radioisotope Dilution Technique; Sepsis; Wounds and Injuries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038266118

The facility went through a major up-grade in the early 1990s with the move from the 600 MeV synchrocyclotron to the 1 GeV PS-Booster proton synchrotron. This was followed by a primary proton beam energy up grade to 1.4 GeV in 1999. Lately, an important step forward was taken with the start of the REX-ISOLDE experiment for charge breeding and post-acceleration of exotic ions. CERN has recently decided on a consolidation project for the facility to assure that the required number of shifts can be delivered in the future. An overview will be given of the on-going consolidation and development programme and its implications on the physics programme, in particular the REX-ISOLDE post-accelerator experiment. An important parameter for a better yield of very exotic elements is the primary proton beam intensity, beam energy and time structure. The possible short-term improvements of, in particular, beam intensity will be discussed in some detail. While the main effort at CERN today goes towards the completion of the LHC, some resources have been found for accelerator R&D. A possible project is a new high intensity proton source at CERN, the superconducting proton linac, which could open the door to the construction of a next generation radioactive beam facility. The possible primary beam characteristics and some design considerations and their implications for such a facility will be discussed.

The specific capacitance of the laser-deposited materials is comparable to reported values of ∼720 F/g. The microultracapacitors demonstrate linear charge and discharge behavior at currents below 1 mA, as expected for an ideal capacitor. By studying the charge storage and power output as a function of discharge current, the power can be successfully modeled assuming only simple ohmic losses. Parallel and series combinations of these microultracapacitor cells provide the expected addition of capacitance. Maximum discharge currents of 50 mA are applied to two cells in parallel without damage to the microultracapacitor cells.

This concept is based on a staggered array of permeable poles placed in a magnetic solenoid that produces a longitudinal field. The concept permits variations in the short magnetic period of the undulator of as much as 100%. The unique capabilities of such undulators will allow them to be tuned by the variation of the period length and of the solenoid field. The device can be operated at either constant flux or constant power, independent of X-ray energy. It is expected that the new concept will have a major impact on the production and applications of X-rays because of the inherent simplicity and flexibility of the design and the absence of radiation damage.

Disorder development, concentrations of ascorbic acid (AA) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and respiration were examined under various O2 (0-21 kPa) and CO2 (0 and 5 kPa) atmospheres during 31 days of storage. ATP production was estimated using the respiration data. Hypoxia increased brown core incidence, decreased AA and ATP concentrations, and lowered ATP production. AA concentrations decreased before brown core became visible. Adding CO2 to the storage atmosphere increased the severity of brown core. CO2 addition also decreased AA levels by about 46% at O2 partial pressures of 2.5 kPa and higher. CO2, however, had variable effects on ATP production. No brown core was found in fruit kept at 0 kPa O2 with or without CO2, nor decreased AA levels. These results support the hypothesis that brown core initiation is a consequence of membrane damage caused by a combination of oxygen free radical action and a lack of maintenance energy. This combination may lead to decompartmentation of intracellular structures and the initiation of brown pigmentation, visible in pears with disorders. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Ions to be trapped are produced by collisions of slow highly charged ions (56 keV Ar8+) with Ar gas or a C60 effusive gas jet. The operation of the trap is triggered by the coincident detection of a charge selected scattered projectile and the ejected electron number in order to select different recoil ion charges. The ion storage efficiency has been studied for one oscillation of the trapped ion as a function of the cone voltage. One of the final aims of these experiments is to measure on which time scale multiply charged clusters produced by impact of highly charged ions are stable. Since stability and lifetime of clusters are known to depend on their internal energy, we plan to vary this parameter by changing the initial projectile charge or/and by selecting different collision processes. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

A calculation of this process is complicated as the electron velocity distribution is often anisotropic and the cooling process takes place in a magnetic field which guides the electrons. In this paper the drag force and the energy loss are calculated in a model of binary collisions between ions and magnetized electrons, in which the Coulomb interaction is treated up to second order as a perturbation to the helical motion of the electrons. Three kinetical regimes can be identified, depending on the relative magnitude of the distance of closest approach, the cyclotron radius and the pitch of the helical motion. The influence of the magnetic field is ambiguous. The energy loss is reduced if the ion moves parallel to the field, while it is enhanced if the ion velocity has a component transversal to the field. This enhancement is not as large as in the dielectric theory and in previous kinematic models. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Methods: Under general anesthesia and artificial ventilation, hearts from 42 adult New Zealand white rabbits were harvested, flushed, and preserved in St. Thomas solution at 4oC for 18 hours. In the study group (n = 15), FDP (5 mmol/liter) was added to the St. Thomas solution, whereas in the control group (n = 17), fructose (5 mmol/liter) was added. Another 10 hearts did not undergo hypothermic storage, but were used as the normal group for high-energy phosphate concentration comparison. Results: After 18 hours of hypothermic preservation, myocardial high-energy phosphate content decreased in both preservation groups. In the study group, left ventricular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content was 33% of that in the normal hearts, but in the control group, ATP decreased to 14% of normal. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) content, energy charge, and ATP-to-ADP ratio showed similar decreases. The high-energy phosphate profile (content in the atria and ventricles and the ratio of ATP to ADP to AMP) was maintained in the study group but not in the control group. High-energy phosphate metabolites such as inosine monophosphate (IMP), inosine, and hypoxanthine increased in both preservation groups, but the increase was more prominent in the control group. Conclusion: Adding FDP to St. Thomas solution attenuated the depletion of high-energy phosphate concentration in the preserved hearts. This difference was especially prominent in the left and right ventricles. The protective effect of FDP during hypothermic heart preservation deserves further study.",,"adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; fructose; fructose 1,6 bisphosphate; hypoxanthine; inosine; inosine phosphate; St Thomas Hospital solution; animal tissue; article; artificial ventilation; concentration response; controlled study; cryopreservation; general anesthesia; heart atrium; heart left ventricle; heart muscle; heart preservation; heart right ventricle; high energy phosphate; measurement; nonhuman; priority journal; rabbit",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037991417

Beam transport issues for large-momentum-spread beams are accommodated by appropriate lattice design choices.

The large transverse and longitudinal admittances which must be designed into the system and the rapidity with which acceleration must take place because of muon decay preclude the use of conventional synchrotron design. The current baseline is a recirculating linac (RLA) in the shape of a racetrack with separate fixed-field arcs for each acceleration turn. However, RLAs have proved costly and are a potential bottleneck, at least with respect to the storage ring.

In this paper, using the moment-equation approach, we present a linear theory of ionization cooling dynamics in 6D phase space in a quadrupole focusing channel. A simple set of differential equations that governs the evolution of both the transverse and longitudinal emittances is derived, and closed-form solutions are given. Two new significant heating processes have been identified. This theory is analogous to the standard linear theory in electron storage rings. Multiple scattering integrals and energy straggling integrals, quantities like the synchrotron radiation integrals, are introduced to specify the cooling process and the equilibrium emittances in a periodic cooling channel. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

This choice allows the simultaneous measurement of both, νμ and νe interactions and the two helicities, in a clean environment and with a precise knowledge of the beam flux.

The system, one of the largest in the world, consists of 75 hydropower plants with an installed capacity of 69,375 MW, producing 92% of the nation's electrical power. The system size and nonlinearity pose a real challenge to the modelers. The basic model is formulated in nonlinear programming (NLP). The NLP model is the most general formulation and provides a foundation for analysis by other methods. The formulated NLP model was first linearized by two different linearization techniques and solved by linear programming (LP). A comparative analysis was made of the results obtained from the linearized and the NLP models. The results show that the simplest linearized model (referred to as the LP model) without iteration is suitable for planning purposes. For example, the LP model could be used in system capacity expansion studies or to explore various design parameters in connection with feasibility studies, where details in storage variation are not as important as the power production. With a good initial policy provided by the LP model, the successive linear programming (SLP) model produced excellent results with fast convergence. The NLP model, the most complex and accurate model in the suite, is particularly suited for setting up guidelines for real-time operations using inflow forecast with frequent updating. The performance of the NLP model was checked against the historical operational records, and the comparison yields indications of superior performance.","Brazil; Hydroelectric powerplants; Optimization models","Installation; Large scale systems; Linear programming; Mathematical models; Planning; Hydropower systems; Hydroelectric power plants; hydroelectric power; modeling; optimization; energy planning; hydroelectric power; modeling; optimization; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037687647

An extrapolation of the resonance energies of the 1s22p1/2nlj′ (n ≥ 20) Rydberg series to the series limits (n → ∞) yields the 2s1/2-2p1/2 transition energies. The experimental precision of below 100 meV for all three ions obtained with this photonfree spectroscopic method is comparable to the best optical measurements available and allows to test quantum electrodynamics of strong central fields on a level of below 7% of the α2 contributions.

The most intense lines observed in spectra can be attributed to direct transition of electrons into the K shell of the projectile ions and to characteristic L→K (Lyα) transitions. Radiative recombination lines into the K shell of bare and H-like uranium can be exploited for measuring the two-electron contribution to the ground state binding energy in helium-like uranium. The goal is to probe for high-Z ions bound-state QED corrections which are of the order of α2. Besides the dominant characteristic L→K transitions, the strongly reduced Bremsstrahlung (due to the low cooler voltage applied to the decelerated ions) allowed us to observe for the very first time RR transitions into the L shell as well as the balmer radiation located at the low-energy part of the spectra. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper a method for separating the effects of sparse LCB in metallocene-catalyzed polyethylenes (mPE) from those of molecular weight and its distribution based on time-molecular weight superposition is proposed. Four metallocene polyethylenes with degrees of long-chain branching [i.e., M of the arm (Ma) is greater than that for the onset of entanglements, Mc] as determined from dilute solution measurements ranging from zero (linear) to 0.79 LCB/104 CH2, along with a conventional Ziegler-Natta polymerized linear low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and a tubular free-radical polymerized LDPE are investigated. In general, it is observed that sparse LCB (for levels &lt; 1.0 LCB/104 CH2) increases the zero shear viscosity, η0 (e.g., by a factor of 7) and decreases, but even to a greater degree, the critical shear rate (γ̇c) for the onset of shear thinning (e.g., by a factor of 100). The breadth of the molecular weight distribution just affects γ̇c but not η0 for the range of data used in this study. Furthermore, the dynamic storage modulus G′ shows similar enhancement at low frequencies as viscosity does, while the primary normal stress difference coefficient, Ψ1.0, exhibits a greater dependence on long-chain branching than that predicted from the zero-shear viscosity enhancement. The results for the mPEs are consistent with recent molecular theories for randomly branched molecules in that it is the spacing between branch points and not the number of branches at a point that is important. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the idea that the branches are located on the longest chains, and hence, have the greatest effects on the longest relaxation modes.",,"Activation energy; Calculations; Free radical polymerization; Gel permeation chromatography; High density polyethylenes; Light scattering; Linear low density polyethylenes; Molecular weight distribution; Resins; Thermal effects; Viscosity; Viscosity measurement; Dynamic storage modulus; Long chain branching; Metallocene-catalyzed polyethylene; Shear rheological property; Shear viscosity; Rheology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037523272

We show here that after growth arrest by semistarvation, rats refed the same amount of a low-fat diet as controls show 1) lower energy expenditure due to diminished thermogenesis that favors accelerated fat deposition or catch-up fat and 2) normal glucose tolerance but higher plasma insulin after a glucose load at a time point when their body fat and plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) have not exceeded those of controls. Isocaloric refeeding on a high-fat diet resulted in even lower energy expenditure and thermogenesis and increased fat deposition and led to even higher plasma insulin and elevated plasma glucose after a glucose load. Stepwise regression analysis showed that plasma insulin and insulin-to-glucose ratio after the glucose load are predicted by variations in efficiency of energy use (i.e., in thermogenesis) rather than by the absolute amount of body fat or plasma FFAs. These studies suggest that suppression of thermogenesis per se may have a primary role in the development of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance during catch-up growth and underscore a role for suppressed thermogenesis directed specifically at catch-up fat in the link between catch-up growth and chronic metabolic diseases.",,"fat; fatty acid; glucose; insulin; animal experiment; animal model; article; body fat; cardiovascular disease; catch up growth; chronic disease; controlled study; disease course; energy expenditure; fatty acid blood level; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance; glucose tolerance test; growth disorder; hyperinsulinemia; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; metabolic disorder; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pathophysiology; priority journal; rat; refeeding; regression analysis; risk factor; starvation; thermogenesis; Adipose Tissue; Aging; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Diet, Fat-Restricted; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Glucose Tolerance Test; Growth; Growth Disorders; Insulin; Leptin; Male; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Regression Analysis; Thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037408182

We find the low gate leakage current to be caused by field ionization (FI) from traps within the gate oxides. Such low gate leakage currents can lead to sufficient charge accumulation to disturb charge in the floating gate. Through detailed simulations and measurements, we have determined the main cause of ""write disturb"" and ""erase disturb"" to be FI gate oxide current at low electric fields and Fowler-Nordheim current at high electric fields.

Cardiovascular risk factors included fasting and post-glucose challenge plasma glucose and insulin, blood pressure, lipid profile, fibrinogen and uric acid. For similar age and BMI, men had a lower amount and percent of total body fat, but had a higher proportion of abdominal/total body fat than women. In men, insulin sensitivity, as determined by glucose infusion rate during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, was inversely correlated with total body fat, abdominal fat, BMI and waist circumference, whereas only total body fat, but not abdominal fat, BW and hip circumference were inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity in women. No cardiovascular risk factors, except area under the curve (AUC), of plasma insulin in women correlated with insulin sensitivity when adjusted for total body fat. After age adjustment, total body fat was better correlated with fasting and AUC of plasma glucose and insulin in men and with systolic blood pressure as well as triglyceride levels in women. Only HDL-C in men was better correlated with abdominal fat. In conclusion, there were sex-differences in body fat distribution and its relationship with insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular risk factors in lean, healthy non-diabetic Thai subjects. Total body fat was a major determinant of insulin sensitivity in both men and women, abdominal fat may play a role in men only.

Pullulan samples differing in molecular weight were characterized by 13C NMR spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography combined with a multiangle laser light scattering and a refractive index detector. For samples with weight average molecular weight (Mw) ranging between 100 and 560×103, the values of limiting viscosity ([η]), critical concentration (c*) and coil overlap parameter (c*[η]) were within the range 0.38-0.70 dl/g, 1.4-3.1 g/dl and 1.0-1.2dl/g, respectively. The thermomechanical properties of five molecular weight grades of pullulan, either alone or with sorbitol (plasticized at a 10% d.b. level) were examined by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). A large drop in storage modulus E′ (101.5-103Pa) and a peak in tanδ in the DMTA traces accompanied the glass-rubber transition (Tg) or the α-relaxation (Tα) of pullulan; the magnitude of the drop in E′ and the tanδ peak height increased with increasing water content. The plasticizing action of water and sorbitol was evident in the DMTA curves, and the Tg vs. moisture content data were fitted to the Gordon-Taylor empirical model. Within the range of molecular weights tested there was no effect of polymer molecular weight on Tg. A β-relaxation detected by DMTA was shifted to lower temperature with increasing moisture content and to higher temperature with addition of sorbitol. Apparent activation energies for α-relaxation (Eαα) and β-relaxation (Eαβ) processes, estimated from multifrequency measurements, were within 171-640 and 118-256kJ/mol, respectively; the values for Eαα and 'fragility' parameter decreased with increasing moisture content. Analysis of viscoelasticity data using the time-temperature superposition principle with the Williams-Landel-Ferry equation was successful over the range Tg to Tg+40°C, provided that the coefficients C1 and C2 are optimized and not allowed to assume their 'universal' values. Large deformation mechanical tests demonstrated large decreases in tensile (Young's) modulus (E) and strength (σmax), and an increase in percentage elongation with increasing water content and/or addition of sorbitol in pullulan films. Relationships between the tensile parameters (E and σmax) and water content showed an increase in stiffness of the films from 3 to 7% moisture, and a strong softening effect at higher water contents. The tensile tests revealed some relationships between mechanical properties under uniaxial load and the molecular characteristics of pullulan, e.g. E, σmax, and elongation values increased with increasing molecular weight. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The most important idea of FRIENDS is to install new facilities called Quality Control Centers (QCCs) between the distribution substation and customers. By controlling QCCs appropriately, various purposes of FRIENDS can be achieved. It is indispensable to design the concrete interior structure of QCC in order to realize FRIENDS. This paper proposes the interior structure and control methods of QCC from the viewpoint of power conditioning functions by energy storage system in QCC. In this paper, it is assumed that SMES is used as the energy storage system in QCC. The proposed interior structure is based on the concept of UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply). In this paper, SMES is installed in the DC side of UPS. Further, this paper proposes control methods of SMES and PWM converters. The proposed control methods are used to satisfy various purposes, such as load fluctuation compensation, load leveling, and cooperation with dispersed-type generator. Finally, the validity of these control methods is confirmed through transient analysis PSCAD/EMTDC.","Dispersed-type energy storage system; Dispersed-type generator; FRIENDS; Load fluctuation compensation; PSCAD/EMTDC; SMES","Control system synthesis; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Electric load distribution; Electric power distribution; Electric substations; Power converters; Pulse width modulation; Quality of service; Transients; Uninterruptible power systems; Voltage control; Dispersed type generator; Intelligent electrical energy delivery system; Load fluctuation compensation; Power conditioning; Quality control center; Power control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037403534

They showed an intense doublet at 3.3T corresponding to g=2.0 as is expected for the 8S state ions. Also, weak satellites were observed on both sides of the central doublet signal symmetrically. This means that microwave energy at 90GHz is sufficiently larger than the zero-field splitting. Taking into account the crystal structure of stillwellite and the earlier PL investigation, a single Eu2+ site was assumed for the HFEPR simulation. As a result, it was found that HFEPR spectrum simulated using g=1.98161, |D|=0.130T and λ=|E/D|=0.06 reasonably agrees well with the experimental one, supporting that the Eu2+ occupies the Sr site.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the energy applied under different PEF processing conditions and its effect on the microbial quality of LWE during refrigerated storage. The LWE was stabilized with citric acid (CA) at 0.15% and 0.5% to prevent color darkening. Inside a pilot plant-size PEF chamber, the peak values of the electric field traces at the high-voltage electrode, middle gap, and low-voltage electrode were 37, 30, and 25 kV/cm, respectively. The pulse width was 1.84 μs, with energy density at 11.9 J/ml per pulse. The total treatment time varied from 54 to 478 μs (corresponding with 30-266 slightly underdamped pulses). The microbiological quality of the LWE was monitored weekly while under refrigerated storage at 4 °C. The CA not only acted as a color stabilizer but also increased the effectiveness of PEF treatment. The maximum shelf-life sustained at 4 °C of LWE with 0.15% CA was 20 days, with PEF treatments up to 489 μs (266 pulses) at an average electric field of 30 kV/cm. The total processing energy delivered to this product was 6331 J/ml. LWE with 0.5% CA had a shelf-life of almost 30 days at 4 °C, using a maximum PEF energy expenditure of 357 J/ml (30 pulses or 55 μs of 30 kV/cm). © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The Fourier analysis of the input current then gives the compensator performances such as var handling capability, magnitude of input and dc currents, etc. The operational limits of the var compensator have also been identified.

By applying nucleation and growth model, we have discussed the absorbing and desorbing mechanism of the metal hydride. Our results and analysis show that it is important for the hydriding or dehydriding reaction to consider the number of nuclei and the transfer of hydrogen atom through the α-β interface data.

The results have shown that the organization of alloys is made up of dispersed branch crystals and continuous base body structure. With increase of the quantity of substitution of chromium for manganese, the branch crystals become coarser. Their phase structures are the compound phases of C14 Laves phase and b.c.c. phase, rich in vanadium. Substitution influences the parameters of lattice of the alloys. The quantity of vanadium in b.c.c. phase is the highest. The maximal capacity of the alloy is 545 mAh/g. The activation of alloys is very easy but the cycle property is rather poor. With increase of the quantity of substitution of chromium for manganese, the property deterioration decreases clearly but the maximal capacity decreases apparently too. Further, the studies of XPS have shown that the restrain effect of chromium substitution on property deterioration of alloys is due to the decrease of oxygenation and surface segregation of titanium, zirconium and vanadium. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Several cool storage buildings have been constructed in Korea during the last decade. However, there are no specific standards or guidelines for energy use reduction in refrigerated structures. The main objective of this study is to determine the impact of various insulation systems on the total cooling load of the cool storage structures with particular consideration given to the product thermal mass to find optimal insulation thicknesses for each envelope component for various climatic locations in Korea. An energy analysis model was developed using the DOE-2.1E program. To determine the optimal configuration for the storage building insulation system, life a cycle cost analysis was conducted. The selection of optimal insulation configuration for each climatic location is based on various criteria including cost and energy minimization. The results presented in this paper provide easy to use design guidelines to select the optimal insulation thickness for crop storage facilities in Korea. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The co-curing of the three-component resin was investigated by dynamic mechanical analysis using rheometry. The cure kinetics of the Diels-Alder step was studied by examining the evolution of the rheological parameters, such as storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″), and complex viscosity (η*), for resins of varying compositions at different temperatures. The curing conformed to an overall second-order phenomenological equation, taking into account a self-acceleration effect. The kinetic parameters were evaluated by multiple-regression analysis. The absence of a definite trend in the cure process with blend composition ratio was attributed to the occurrence of a multitude of competitive reactions whose relative rates depend on the reactant ratio and the concentration of the products formed from the initial phase of reaction. The cure was accelerated by temperature for a given composition, whereas the self-acceleration became less prominent at higher temperature. Gelation was accelerated by temperature. The gel conversion decreased with increase in maleimide concentration and, for a given composition, it was independent of the cure temperature.

In the milling of the Fe - Cu system, four stages, whose features are in accordance with experimental observation, are identified: (i) energy storage, (ii) initiation of reaction and rate increase, (iii) decrease of the reaction rate, and (iv) stationary stage. No energy storage stage is observed and no saturation is achieved in the milling of Fe - N system. Moreover, we propose a modification on the global kinetic law introduced in ref 12 on the basis of the different natures of Fe - Cu and Fe - N systems.

Importantly, these animals are completely resistant to both high-fat diet-induced and genetically predisposed (Leprdb/db) obesity. As predicted, acute treatment of Leprdb/db mice with a PPARδ agonist depletes lipid accumulation. In parallel, PPARδ-deficient mice challenged with high-fat diet show reduced energy uncoupling and are prone to obesity.

It is therefore important to investigate alternative detection instruments offering higher energy resolution and evaluate their applicability to soft X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. In this paper, various results of the characterization and evaluation of a cryogenic superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) detector, which was provided to the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, are given with respect to both detector response functions and XRF. For this investigation, monochromatized undulator radiation of high spectral purity, available to the PTB X-ray radiometry laboratory at the electron storage ring BESSY II, was employed, by which it was possible to record the STJ response functions at various photon energies of interest ranging from 180 to 1600 eV. By scanning the effective detector area and the adjacent substrate and leads, relevant artefacts of the detector response were identified. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A one-dimensional model for snow-covered sea ice and a kinematic-thermodynamic sea ice model for ice formed in leads are coupled and run under atmospheric and oceanic conditions specified from in situ data. Flooding at the snow-ice interface and snow ice formation need to be accounted for to achieve reasonable agreement between modeled and measured temperature distributions. The time-averaged values for the net heat flux are 21 W m-2, some 60% of which originate in refreezing leads, and 9.8 cm for the monthly rate of ice accumulation. Whereas leads contribute a net accumulation of 10.8 cm, the mass balance of consolidated, snow-covered ice results in a net ablation of - 1.0 cm. Sensitivity studies reveal the contribution of processes related to snow cover and ocean heat flux to sea ice formation and heat exchange. Without taking snow ice formation into account, a net ablation of - 14.9 cm occurs under snow-covered ice due to high oceanic heat fluxes. A comparison between a simple two-layer model and the one-dimensional thermodynamic model emphasizes the influence of heat storage in sea ice on the development of heat flux and ice thickness. The heat and mass fluxes obtained on a regional scale, and their sensitivity to the parameterizations, elucidate the implication of vigorous small-scale processes on sea ice development and point out their importance for sea ice models.","Air-sea-ice interaction; ANZFLUX; Flooding; Polynyas; Sea ice; Weddell Sea","ice cover; polynya; sea ice; winter; Weddell Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041589306

During stimulation fibres were either kept under isometric conditions, or were stretched or allowed to shorten (at constant velocity) after isometric force had reached its plateau value. The energy change was evaluated as the sum of heat and work (work = integral of force with respect to length change). Net energy absorption occurred during stretch at velocities greater than about 0.35 L0 s-1 (L0 is fibre length at resting sarcomere length 2.10 μm). Heat produced by 1 mm segments of the fibre was measured simultaneously and separately; energy absorption is not an artefact due to patchy heat production. The maximum energy absorption, 0.092 ± 0.002 P0L0 (mean ± S.E.M., n = 8; where P0 is isometric force at L0), occurred during the fastest stretches (1.64 L0 s-1) and amounted to more than half of the work done on the fibre. Energy absorption occurred in two phases. The amount in the first phase, 0.027 ± 0.003 P0L0 (n = 32), was independent of velocity beyond 0.18 L0 s-1. The quantity absorbed in the second phase increased with velocity and did not reach a limiting value in the range of velocities used. After stretch, energy was produced in excess of the isometric rate, probably from dissipation of the stored energy. About 34 % (0.031 P0L0/0.092 P0L0) of the maximum absorbed energy could be stored elastically (in crossbridges, tendons, thick, thin and titin filaments) and by redistribution of crossbridge states.

This is significantly different from the reaction mechanism of NaAlH4 and LiAlH4, in which the homogeneous doping of the transition metal catalyst is essential for the reversibility and fast kinetics. The reversible dehydrogenation and hydrogenation were clearly observed without a catalyst over a temperature range 250-340°C under &lt;10 bar of hydrogen. Hydrogen storage ability was above 3.5 wt.% (81.4% of the theoretical value of 4.2 wt.%). KAlH4 may be a competitive option with a lightweight but high-temperature metal hydride system such as Mg2NiH4. These findings will also provide renewed guidelines for understanding the reaction mechanism of the catalyzed alanates as reversible hydrogen storage materials. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Properties of water in seed tissues were studied to understand their requirements during storage conditions. Water sorption isotherms showed that at the same relative humidity (RH) the water content is significantly higher in embryo axes than cotyledons. This tendency maintains also after recalculating the water content for zero amount of lipids in tissues. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) indicated water crystallization exotherms in the embryo axes at moisture content (MC) higher than 29% and 16% in the cotyledons. In order to examine the occurrence of glassy state in the cytoplasm of beech embryos as a function of water content, isolated embryo axes were examined using electron spin resonance (ESR) of nitroxide TEMPO probe located inside axes cells. TEMPO molecules undergo fast reorientations with correlation time varied from 2×10-9 s at 180 K to 2×10-11 s at 315 K. Although the TEMPO molecules label mainly the lipid bilayers of cell membranes, they are sensitive to the dynamics and phase transformation of the cytoplasmic cell interior. The label motion is clearly affected by a transition between liquid and glassy state of the cytoplasm. The glass transition temperature (Tg) raises from 253 to 293 K when water content decreases from 18% to 8%. Far from Tg the motion is described by Arrhenius equation with very small activation energy Ea in the liquid state and is relatively small in the glassy state where Ea=1.5 kJ/mol for 28% H2O and Ea=4.7 kJ/mol for 8% H2O or less. The optimal storage conditions of beech seeds are proposed in the range from 255 K for 15% H2O to 280 K for 9% H2O. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

We employ a forest growth model suited for modeling uneven-aged mixed temperate stands and analyze the interaction with biomass energy systems that allow for CO2 removal and long-term sequestration in geological formations. On global scales this technological option to convert the global energy system from a CO2 emitter to a CO2 remover has been overlooked by both the science and policy communities. Removal of the major Greenhouse Gas (GHG) CO2 from the atmosphere is possible using biomass energy to produce both carbon neutral energy carriers (e.g., electricity and hydrogen) and, at the same time, offer a permanent CO2 sink by capturing carbon at the conversion facility and permanently storing it in geological formations. This technological option resolves the issues of permanence and saturation of biological sinks while at the same time this option respects the multiple benefits of sustaining diverse, healthy, and resilient forests. Our results indicate that a typical temperate forest in combination with capturing and long-term storage can permanently remove and on a continuous basis about 2.5 t C yr-1 ha-1 on a sustainable basis respecting the ecological integrity of the ecosystem. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, forests store the most carbon when they remain undisturbed and are allowed to grow to maturity, whereas using wood for bioenergy requires wood removal from forests, which reduces on-site carbon storage. Hence, it is difficult to manage a forest simultaneously for maximum carbon storage and supplying fuelwood. For developing optimal strategies for the use of vegetation sinks, it is necessary to consider the feedbacks via the inherent natural adjustments in the global carbon cycle. Increased atmospheric CO2 currently provides a driving force for carbon uptake by natural carbon reservoirs, such as the world's oceans. When carbon is removed from the atmosphere and stored in biomass, it lowers the concentration gradient between the atmosphere and these other reservoirs. This reduces the subsequent inherent rate of CO2 removal from the atmosphere. This means that transferring a quantity of CO2 from the atmosphere to a biomass pool lowers the atmospheric concentration the most immediately after the initial removal, but subsequently, the atmospheric concentration trends back towards the values without biospheric removal. The optimal timing for the use of vegetation sinks therefore depends on a number of factors: the length of time over which forest growth can be maintained, whether biomass is used for energy generation and on the nature of the most detrimental aspects of climate-change impacts. Climate-change impacts related to the instantaneous effect of temperature are mitigated less by vegetation sinks than impacts that act via the cumulative effect of increased temperature. It also means that short-term carbon storage in temporary sinks is not generally beneficial in mitigating climate change. Crown Copyright © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The reason for the considering two different groups of lithium cells is the presence or absence of a small amount of moisture resulting in the autocatalytic hydrolysis of C-F bonds, with the formation of HF It was proved that the rate of the self-discharge process in lithium cells of the ""A"" group is greater by an order of magnitude than that of those in the ""B"" group, and the intensity of the process is directly connected with the corrosion construction metal (Fe, Ni, Cr) migration from the cathodic current contactor to the anode. The self-discharge rate of the ""B"" group cells selected was studied, both during real-time storage at room temperature and during exposure to various temperatures during different time periods (T0C, t). It was shown that, after 3 years' storage, , the activation energies (Ea) of the cells in this group for the self-discharge process and the micro-chemical processes of metal migration (Fe, Ni, Cr) from current pick-off to anode are close to being similar and equal to 14-16 kcal/mol. The self-discharge process for BR2325 lithium cells at 25-80°C can be described using linear equation Q (T0C, t) = Q0 + W 0t, and the reaction rate can be approximated by the first-order per time and by the zero-order per migrating metal impurities. Based on a study of micro-corrosion process dynamics and on an integrated computer-aided diagnostics of multi-parameter regression analysis, a general approach to the development of accelerated test procedures for these cells was achieved. This approach comprises the self-discharge rate study combined with simultaneous corrosion process analysis.","Lithium cells quality; Microcorrosion phenomena; Multi-parameter regression analysis; Self-discharge; State-of-charge forecast","Cathodes; Corrosion resistance; Electric currents; Electric discharges; Impurities; Moisture; Quality control; Reaction kinetics; Stoichiometry; Thermal effects; Lithium cells quality; Self-discharge dynamics; State-of-charge forecast; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342558528

The composite film was used to immobilize horseradish peroxidase (HRP) on a gold disk electrode. The properties of sol-gel/chitosan and sol-gel/chitosan-HRP films have been carefully characterized by atomic force microscopy and Fourier transform infrared. By using fluorescent label, a protein density on sol-gel/chitosan has been calculated to be 3.14 × 1012 molecules cm-2.

Its current response shows a typical Michaelis-Menten mechanism. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant KMapp is found to be 1.30 μmol l-1.

DESIGN: Ten healthy women aged 31-63y, mass 48-113.5 kg, fat mass 8.5-62.5 kg, were studied for 3 days in a whole-body calorimeter on two occasions. After a control day (D1) during which energy balance was maintained, diet was manipulated to induce fat deposition (FD) or mobilization (FM) of 50 g/day for 2 days (D2 & D3). A difference totalling of 194 ± 18.6 g fat was achieved between manipulations without significant effects on carbohydrate or protein balance. Fasting plasma leptin was measured on D2 and D4. RESULTS: After the control day plasma leptin concentration averaged 19.01 ± 9.8 ng/ml, and was found to be linearly related to body fat mass. After 2 days manipulation of fat balance, leptin concentrations were 21.4 ± 10.3 ng/ml (FD) and 21.2 ± 1 1.3 ng/ml (FM). There was no significant difference between treatments in either control day or postmanipulation leptin concentrations, nor did the treatments induce any differences in glucose or insulin concentration responses. CONCLUSION: Although in states of energy balance leptin concentration is linearly related to fat mass, acute modulation of leptin concentration during energy imbalance is not mediated by fat flux.","Calorimetry; Energy balance; Fat intake; Fat mass; Leptin","leptin; leptin; adult; article; body fat; calorimeter; carbohydrate metabolism; controlled study; diet; diet restriction; energy balance; female; hormone action; hormone blood level; hormone determination; human; lipid storage; lipid transport; normal human; priority journal; protein metabolism; adipose tissue; blood; caloric intake; calorimetry; carbohydrate diet; lipid metabolism; metabolism; methodology; middle aged; obesity; physiology; protein intake; time; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Calorimetry; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Fasting; Female; Humans; Leptin; Lipid Mobilization; Middle Aged; Obesity; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242668427

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of pasteurisation temperature/time combinations and refrigeration on the shelf stability of kunu. Also recorded the changes in the concentrations of some nutrient components of millet during conversion into kunu. Proximate chemical composition, flavanol content, vitamin A and B2 contents and gross energy of millet and kunu were determined. Pasteurised and unpasteurised kunu were stored at refrigerated (4-7°C) and at ambient temperature (32 ± 2°C) for six days. The effects of pasteurisation (temperature/time combinations) and refrigeration on the pH, sensory quality and sedimentation of kunu were determined. Protein, fat, ash and crude fibre contents of millet grain were lowered in kunu. During the conversion of millet grain to kunu vitamin A, vitamin B2, gross energy, and flavanol content of the grain were lowered. Refrigeration and pasteurisation delayed and decreased the decline of pH, increased the shelf-life of the product and reduced the sedimentation of suspended particles.

Unlike previous research, our approach to estimating climate sensitivity of streamflow is nonparametric and does not depend on a hydrologic model. The upper bound for precipitation elasticity of streamflow is shown to be the inverse of the runoff ratio. For over a century, investigators [Pike, 1964; Budyko, 1974; Ol'dekop, 1911; and Schreiber, 1904] have suggested that variations in watershed aridity alone are sufficient to predict spatial variations in long-term watershed runoff.

Energy saving by contractile minimization has very different implications for muscle strain and activation patterns than by elastic recoil. Minimal cross-bridge cycling will be reflected in minimal contractile strains and highly reduced force, work and power output, whereas elastic energy storage requires a period of active lengthening that increases mechanical output. In this study, we used sonomicrometry and electromyography to test the relative contributions of energy reduction and energy recycling strategies in the tailshaker muscles of western diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox). We found that tailshaker muscle contractions produce a mean strain of 3%, which is among the lowest strains ever recorded in vertebrate muscle during movement. The relative shortening velocities (V/Vmax) of 0.2-0.3 were in the optimal range for maximum power generation, indicating that the low power output reported previously for tailshaker muscle is due mainly to contractile minimization rather than to suboptimal V/Vmax. In addition, the brief contractions (8-18 ms) had only limited periods of active lengthening (0.2-0.5 ms and 0.002-0.035%), indicating little potential for elastic energy storage and recoil. These features indicate that high-frequency muscles primarily reduce metabolic energy input rather than recycle mechanical energy output.","Biomechanics; Cross-bridge; Crotalus atrox; Elastic recoil; Muscle contraction; Rattlesnake; Tailshaker muscle","analysis of variance; animal; article; biomechanics; comparative study; electromyography; energy metabolism; muscle contraction; physiology; snake; tail; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Biomechanics; Crotalus; Electromyography; Energy Metabolism; Muscle Contraction; Tail; Animalia; Crotalus; Crotalus atrox; Serpentes; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038712073

The electrochemical tests indicated that higher solidification rates led to a better cycling stability, but lower discharge capacity and high-rate dischargeability. The X-ray diffraction results indicated that the as-cast alloy and the melt-spun alloys were both of the CaCu5-type structure single phase, but the lattice constants of the alloys were varying. The scanning electron microscope and EPMA results indicated that the microstructure of melt-spun alloy formed at the relative lower solidification rate (5 m/s) was of very fine dendritic structure and that for the alloy formed at a relative higher solidification rate (15 m/s) was of cellular structure, and both had a more homogeneous composition than the as-cast alloy, which had a typical dendrite structure with noticeable composition segregation.

The hydrogen charge and discharge stability of the nanocomposite hydride has been tested at 300°C for up to 1000 cycles under hydrogen containing 101 ppm moisture. Between the first and the 500th or 1000th cycle, an increase of hydrogen storage capacity by about 5% is observed in dynamic and PCT measurements. This could be due to structural relaxations. While absorption kinetics remain fast, the results show a significant and systematic slow-down of the desorption rates by about a factor of two during cycling. The X-ray diffraction patterns of nanocomposite performed before and after 1000 cycles reveal that the peak shape for magnesium remains unchanged indicating that the crystal growth is negligible. This microstructural stability during cycling suggests that the decreasing desorption rate of the nanocrystalline magnesium-based composite is not induced by any internal structural modification. On the other hand, the presence of moisture in the hydrogen gas during cycling induces surface effects which most likely cause the decrease of the hydrogen discharge flow rate. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

It is found that for the stoichiometric 'B'-rich compound, single phase with CaCu5-type exists. However, for B-poor compounds, there is principally a CaCu5-type phase with a small amount of V-rich type phase and the amount of V-rich phase reduces with vanadium. With the increase of Vy ≤ 0.1 content, hydrogen storage capacity is enhanced, whereas when y = 0.2-0.3 it is decreased. The discharge capacity and cyclability are increased considerably by addition of vanadium in the range 0.02-0.1 with a maximum value at about 0.02%. The decrease of capacity for high V content was also correlated with the amount of V-rich phase. The V-rich phase is consisted of La0.1Ni2.6Al0.2Co2.0Mn0.6 V1.3. The improvement of kinetics is due to the catalytic effect, grain boundary diffusion effect or more pronounced alloy pulverization upon cycling. This can be explained because the improvement of capacity for alloys with low V content is due to better kinetics. These alloys have been subjected to analysis by EDS, SEM and XRD. In order to determine the hydrogen storage capacity, the pressure composition isotherms (PCT curves) have been used. The metal hydride electrodes were characterized by galvanostatic cycling test. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

M5S 1A7, Canada","We demonstrate the coherent control of spontaneous emission for a three-level atom located within a photonic band gap (PBG) material, with one resonant frequency near the edge of the PBG. Spontaneous emission from the three-level atom can be totally suppressed or strongly enhanced depending on the relative phase between the steady-state control laser coupling the two upper levels and the pump laser pulse used to create an excited state of the atom in the form of a coherent superposition of the two upper levels. Unlike the free-space case, the steady-state inversion of the atomic system is strongly dependent on the externally prescribed initial conditions. This non-zero steady-state population is achieved by virtue of the localization of light in the vicinity of the emitting atom. It is robust to decoherence effects provided that the Rabi frequency of the control laser field exceeds the rate of dephasing interactions. As a result, such a system may be relevant for a single-atom, phase-sensitive optical memory device on the atomic scale. The protected electric dipole within the PBG provides a basis for a qubit to encode information for quantum computations. A detailed literature survey on the nature, fabrication and applications of PBG materials is presented to provide context for this research.","Coherent control; Optical memory; Photon localization; Photonic band gap materials; Spontaneous emission","Energy gap; Laser pulses; Natural frequencies; Optical disk storage; Coherent control; Optical memory device; Photonic band gap; Rabi frequency; Spontaneous emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037723041

Blubber thickness was highly variable, ranging from 43.0 to 168.0 mm (mean 98.4±18.4 mm) while lipid fat content, also highly variable, ranged from 16.19 to 89.34% (mean 49.2±17.9%). Blubber thickness was significantly and positively related to total length, but a blubber thickness index based on the residuals of this relationship was not related to age, sex or reproductive condition. No relationship was found between blubber thickness index and blubber lipid content, indicating that blubber thickness may not provide a comprehensive indication of body fat condition in sperm whales when only measured at a single site. Blubber lipid content was not related to total length, age or sex. Blubber lipid content was stratified vertically throughout the blubber layer, suggesting that the inner blubber layer may be a more active site for lipid deposition and mobilisation, while the outer blubber layer may serve in a structural or thermoregulatory role. The social structure and foraging ecology of this species may serve to minimise the need to rely on stored energy reserves to meet reproductive energy requirements. In addition, the broader role of blubber for structural, buoyancy and insulative functions coupled with high individual variability may cause a lack of obvious relationships between these variables and body size, age, sex and reproductive state in this species. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Published literature that describes the use of the Internet by nurses is scant, but it does reveal that there has been a delay in the acceptance of the Internet as a workplace tool by the medical community and, in particular by nurses. Aims. The purpose of this article is to report on a study of how often and from what location nurses accessed the Internet, as well as the types of information they were seeking. In addition, our goal was to compare nurses' Internet use with that of physicians and the public at large, and to highlight structural and institutional challenges to nurses' use. Methods. Surveys (1996 and 1998) of Alberta Registered Nurses were used to examine their use of technology at work and at home. Additional data sources were used to compare nurses to physicians and to the general public. Results. While nurses' Internet and e-mail use at home increased over the 2-year period and was comparable with other groups, Internet use at work was low compared with other groups despite adequate workplace access. Conclusions. Nurses are more likely to value interpersonal contact, and prefer to use personal experience and communication with colleagues and patients rather than on-line and traditional sources of practice knowledge. In order for an information source to be seen as valuable in the clinical setting, contextually relevant information needs to be accessed quickly and efficiently. Energies should be focused on constructing information systems that address the particular needs of nurses.","Evidence-based practice; Information-seeking; Internet use; Knowledge utilization; Nursing; Physicians; Research utilization","access to information; adult; article; comparative study; e-mail; evidence based medicine; female; human; Internet; male; medical information system; nurse; workplace; attitude to computers; information retrieval; statistics; teaching; utilization review; Attitude to Computers; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; Nurses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037490191

A multiphase model accounting for the conductive transport as well as the convective transport with the moving liquid and gas phases is used along with a more simplified single-phase model where the convective transport is due to the gas alone. The latter model also accounts for subzero wintertime temperatures. The multiphase model captures well both the seasonal variations and the actual test sequence, the main calibration being in the adjustment of medium permeabilities based on the observed pressure responses. The effect of the injection pump on the temperature and humidity of the injection air needs to be known accurately. Taking into account the humidity of the injection air explicitly instead of using humidity-corrected enthalpy values also has an effect. The effect of various humidity and specific enthalpy assumptions is of the order of 1-1.5°C, while ignoring the wintertime subzero temperatures has an effect of 1-2°C. These differences are of the same order of magnitude as the heterogeneity-introduced differences in field data. Using the simplified single-phase model typically appears to cause a difference of 1-2°C, but can yield an even higher deviation of the order of 3-4°C.","Conductive; Convective; Field experiment; Heat storage; Modeling; Multiphase","Atmospheric humidity; Enthalpy; Heat transfer; Mathematical models; Soil mechanics; Transport properties; Thermal energy storage; Porous materials; convection; gas injection; gas-liquid two-phase flow; heat transfer; multiphase flow; unsaturated medium; conductivity; convective system; heat transfer; multiphase flow; unsaturated medium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037399503

We employ a simple model of the tunneling process to investigate this issue and show that a normalization of the dI/dU spectra with the total conductance I/U is insufficient to correct for their distance dependence.",,"Electric conductance; Electric currents; Magnetic storage; Magnetization; Polarization; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Spectroscopic analysis; Thin films; Energy-resolved spin polarization; Surface structure",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037390307

In contrary, it is shown here that the penetration depth of heavy ions with energy below 1 GeV/u is mostly determined by the electronic stopping power. This results in lower activation levels, which is important for estimating the tolerable beam loss limit in high intensity heavy ion accelerators. A method to calculate the total neutron yield of heavy ions bombarding thick targets is proposed, validated by measured data and applied to the tolerable beam loss limit in heavy ion accelerators in the energy range E = 100 MeV/u-1 GeV/u. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

We performed clinical and molecular analyses of a patient with AS, and found a novel mutation (G215D) of KCNJ2. Twelve-lead electrocardiography revealed a long QT interval and frequent premature ventricular contractions, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia was induced by programmed electrical stimulation. Use of a conventional whole-cell patch-clamp system with COS7 cells demonstrated that the G215D mutant was non-functional, and that co-expression of wild type (WT)- and mutant-KCNJ2 shows a dominant negative effect on both inward and outward currents. We performed confocal laser scanning microscopy to assess the cellular trafficking of WT- and mutant-KCNJ2 subunits tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), respectively. Tagging with the YFP did not affect the channel function of WT-KCNJ2 and both proteins showed similar plasma membrane fluorescence patterns. Furthermore, the result of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies at the plasma membrane region suggested that both YFP-tagged WT- and CFP-tagged mutant-KCNJ2 combine to construct a hetero-multimer of the potassium channel. In conclusion, the G215D mutant of KCNJ2 is distributed normally in the plasma membrane, but exhibits a dominant-negative effect and reduces the Kir2.1 current, presumably due to hetero-multimer construction. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Although the etiology of obesity is complex, dietary factors, particularly the consumption of a high-fat (HF) diet, is considered a risk factor for its development. Nonetheless, a causal role of dietary fat has never been definitively documented, in part because of inadequate animal models. We developed a rat model of diet-induced obesity that will be a powerful tool for assessment of this issue. In four experiments, Long-Evans rats ate ad libitum a synthetic semipurified diet containing 20 g (HF) or 4 g [low-fat (LF)] of fat/100 g of diet or a nonpurified diet. Other rats ate ad libitum the HF diet in amounts matched to the energy intake of the LF rats. When compared over 10 wk of free feeding, HF rats weighed 10% more (P < 0.01) than LF rats and had 50% more body fat (P < 0.01), as well as significant hyperleptinemia and insulin resistance. Compared with rats fed the nonpurified diet, the HF rats had even more marked differences in these variables. The rats fed the HF diet to match the rats fed the LF diet had similar body weights but significantly more adipose tissue than LF rats, suggesting that diet composition and/or energy density of the diet affects fat deposition. This dietary regimen has reproducible effects on body size and composition, and these are similar in male and female rats. This model of diet-induced obesity will be a useful tool for studying the mechanisms by which dietary fat influences the regulation of energy balance.","Adiposity; High-fat diet; Insulin; Leptin; Obesity; Rats","insulin; leptin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body fat; caloric intake; controlled study; correlation analysis; diet; disease model; energy balance; food composition; lipid composition; lipid diet; lipid storage; nonhuman; obesity; pathogenesis; rat; reproducibility; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037383261

Methods: Four subjects performed maximal eccentric and concentric knee extensions (60, 120 and 180° s-1). Unilateral counter movement jumps and drop jumps in the sledge apparatus served as natural movements. Vastus lateralis fascicle lengths were determined from ultrasonography. In vivo patellar tendon forces (PTF) were measured with an optic fibre technique. Patellar tendon force was derived to VL force according to the cross-sectional area of the muscle. Force in the direction of fascicle was calculated by dividing the VL force value by cosine of the fascicle angle. Force-velocity curves were constructed using angle specific values from isokinetic knee extensions (classical curve) and using instantaneous values from jumping exercises. Results: In the fascicle level, we did not find an enhanced muscle force in the jumping performances as compared with the classical force-velocity curve. In the muscle-tendon level, the instantaneous force at high muscle-tendon shortening speeds exceeded that extrapolated according to Hill's equation. Conclusion: This difference between fascicle and muscle-tendon behaviour suggests that the neural input in fast stretch-shortening cycle exercises minimizes the length changes in muscle fascicle and enables storage and recoil of energy from elastic components that contributes to the enhanced mechanical output of the MTU during the push-off phase.","Concentric; Eccentric; Fascicle length; Force enhancement; Human; Muscle-tendon length; Tendon force","adult; apparatus; article; body movement; controlled study; echography; energy; exercise; fiber optics; human; jumping; knee; knee function; mathematical analysis; muscle force; muscle isometric contraction; myotatic reflex; nerve conduction; normal human; patella tendon; priority journal; storage; tendon; vastus lateralis muscle; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037383051

Methods and Results - This study was a cross-sectional analysis of 1356 women aged 60 to 85 years. Study variables were physical measures, CFM and PFM measured by DEXA, aortic calcification (AC) graded on lateral radiographs, lipid and glucose metabolites, blood pressure, and information on lifestyle factors and coronary disease. Peripheral fat mass showed independent negative correlation with both atherogenic metabolic risk factors and AC (P<0.001). The most severe insulin resistance-dyslipidemic syndrome and AC (score 5.10±0.76) was found in women with high central fat percentage (CF%, 21.7±0.2%) and low peripheral fat percentage (PF%, 18.3±0.2%, n=48). The least severe AC (score 2.45±0.31) was found in obese women with high CF% (21.6±0.1%) and high PF% (27.3±0.14%, n=112). The insulin resistance-dyslipidemic syndrome was also less severe compared with those with the same CF% but low PF%. The most favorable metabolic profile characterized women with low CF% (11.56 ±0.16%) and high PF% (26.86±0.33%, n=44). In women with a history of myocardial infarct (18.41±0.55%, n=45), CF% was significantly higher compared with women with no manifest coronary disease (16.48±0.12%, n=1210) without differences in PF%. Conclusions - In elderly women, localization of fat mass is apparently more important for atherosclerosis than obesity per se; although CFM is associated with atherogenic tendencies, PFM seems to exhibit an independent dominant antiatherogenic effect.","Atherosclerosis; Epidemiology; Obesity; Risk factors; Women","adult; aged; artery calcification; article; atherogenesis; atherosclerosis; blood pressure; body mass; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; coronary artery disease; correlation analysis; disease severity; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; dyslipidemia; fat body; female; heart infarction; human; insulin resistance; lifestyle; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; major clinical study; obesity; priority journal; risk factor; Adipose Tissue; Aged; Aortic Diseases; Arteriosclerosis; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Calcinosis; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronary Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Densitometry, X-Ray; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Obesity; Risk Factors; Smoking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037382301

A radical polymerized poly(butylmethacrylate) coating cross-linked with allylmethacrylate was used as a model coating. The coating Tg was determined to be 18°C by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Dynamic contact angle measurements (DCA) at different temperatures indicated that the surface chemistry was not significantly affected in the range investigated (5-50°C). However, an increased noise level in the force vs. displacement curves indicated an increased molecular mobility with a fast reorganization of hydrophilic ester groups during the measurement. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) as a function of temperature revealed a large drop in storage modulus (G′) from 20°C to 70°C, as expected. A good correlation between the coating storage modulus and the detachment stress of pseudobarnacles was observed even though energy dissipation during the analysis was observed. The decreased adhesion might be a result of the increased molecular flexibility as determined by DCA and DMA at increased temperature. The increased molecular mobility might increase the tendency for interfacial slip, which ultimately results in decreased adhesion strength.","Adhesion; Fouling-release coatings; Poly(butylmethacrylate); Pseudobarnacle","biofouling; Adhesiveness; Animals; Biofilms; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Materials Testing; Mechanics; Methacrylates; Paint; Temperature; Thoracica; Thoracica",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037381243

Using the known crystal structure of the ferritin protein, we perform electrostatic potential energy calculations to elucidate the functional properties of these channels. The threefold channel is shown to be responsible for the transit of Fe2+ ions. Monovalent ions can also diffuse through the threefold channel but presence of divalent ions in the pore retards this process leading to a selectivity mechanism similar to the one observed in calcium channels. The fourfold channel is found to be impermeant to all cations with the possible exception of protons. Because proton transfer is essential to maintain the electroneutrality of the protein during iron deposition, we suggest that the function of the fourfold channel is to form a ""proton wire"" that facilitates their transfer in and out of ferritin.",,"calcium channel; ferritin; article; calculation; crystal structure; diffusion coefficient; electricity; energy; iron transport; protein analysis; protein folding; proton transport; transport kinetics; Trixis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037380857

Like mammalian adipocytes, insect fat body cells provide the major energy reserve of the animal organism. Both cell types accumulate triacylglycerols (TAG) in intracellular lipid droplets; this finding suggests that the strategy of energy storage as well as the machinery and the control to achieve fat storage might be evolutionarily conserved. Studies addressing the control of lipid-based energy homeostasis of mammals identified proteins of the PAT domain family, such as Perilipin [1], which reside on lipid droplets [2]. Perilipin knockout mice are lean and resistant to diet-induced obesity [3, 4]. Conversely, Perilipin expression in preadipocyte tissue culture increases lipid storage by reducing the rate of TAG hydrolysis [5, 6].

Silicone-based coatings have been used for foul-release at high or moderate ship speeds (&lt; 15 knots). To remove the fouling from slower ships (&lt;15 knots), the macrofoulers in particular, biodegradable polymers may be used to make the coating surface self-renewable. Synthesized by microorganisms for carbon and energy storage under controlled conditions, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are hydrophobic biopolymers that are gradually decomposed into CO2 and water in the environment. Because of their hydrophobic property and lack of hydrolysis in sterile aqueous solution, PHAs do not dissolve in water, but erode at the polymer surface (2-5 μm in depth) catalyzed exclusively by microbial enzymes (depolymerases) that are attached on the solid surface. The thin-layer surface erosion behaves like a self-renewable surface coating, which approaches a constant renewal rate at a relative hydraulic speed as low as 3 knots. A turbulence eddy model is used to describe the effect of energy consumption per mass of liquid on the turbulent shear stress and the surface renewal rate. Furthermore, the polymer biodegradation or surface renewal rate can be controlled within a broad range by blending the material with polymers such as poly (ε-caprolactone) (PCL). The biodegradation of binary blends of PHA/PCL of different compositions was quantitatively monitored by means of weight loss and Raman spectroscopy.","Antifouling; Bio-surface erosion; Biodegradable polymers; Foul-release; Surface renewal","biodegradation; biofouling; coating; vessel; Biofilms; Biopolymers; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases; Hexanoic Acids; Lactones; Materials Testing; Models, Theoretical; Paint; Shear Strength; Ships; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037380053

In addition, a small amount of TiNi-based third phase is also found precipitated within both the C14 Laves phase and the V-based solid solution phase. However, the content of the TiNi-based phase is decreased greatly by an appropriate annealing treatment owing to the compositional homogenization.

The results showed that: Five exothermic peaks appeared in the DTA curves of LPCNi3.55Co0.75Mn0.4Al0.3 alloy in which the intensity of the second and third peak decreased strikingly with the decrease of cooling rate. It was sensitive to the grain sizes. The intensity of the fourth and fifth peak showed less correlation with cooling rate, and they located in the range of theoretical recrystallization temperature. It was possibly introduced by recrystallization. In addition, segregation and internal stress also contributed to exothermic peaks. All heat variation had finished during the first temperature-rising period of DTA test, which implied that there was no irreversible phase transformation in the hydrogen storage alloys during the whole heated-cooled process.

Initial studies illustrated that prolonged intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of leptin enhanced substrate oxidation so that adipose tissue lipid stores were completely ablated, and muscle triglyceride and liver glycogen stores were depleted. After neonatal chemical sympathectomy, changes in weight and food intake were compared in groups of sympathectomized (SYM) and control (CON) adult animals during ICV infusion of leptin. CON animals lost 60 ± 9 g over 10 days vs. 25 ± 3 g in the SYM animals when food intake was matched between the two groups. Greater weight loss despite similar energy intake points to an important role of the sympathetic nervous system in stimulating energy expenditure during ICV leptin infusion by increasing the resting metabolic rate, since no differences in physical activity were observed between CON and SYM groups. In conclusion, activation of the SNS by leptin increases energy expenditure by augmenting the resting metabolic rate.","Intracerebro-ventricular; Lipid oxidation; Sympathetic nervous system","glycogen; leptin; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; adrenergic system; animal model; article; body weight; caloric intake; controlled study; energy expenditure; female; food intake; infusion; lipid storage; male; metabolic rate; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; oxidation; physical activity; priority journal; rat; sympathectomy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037376923

After the water uptake reached equilibrium in specimens, they were desorbed to obtain a constant value and the absorption process was repeated. Mass changes in the second desorption were recorded for the storage temperatures of 37°C and 60°C. Multiple regression analyses were conducted on three independent variables, 4-META concentration, storage temperature and absorption-desorption cycle. A statistically significant relationship was found between the maximum water uptake and 4-META concentration, while there was no relationship between the maximum water uptake and diffusion coefficient obtained using the Fick's law. The negative relationship in the latter did not support the free space theory. The significant and positive relationship between the maximum water uptake and 4-META concentration demonstrates that water molecules diffuse through the formation of a hydrogen bond at polar sites. The maximum water uptake was not influenced by temperature, while the diffusion coefficient increased with the rise in temperature.

Thermochemical storage is very interesting for long-term storage as it can be carried out at room temperature with no energy losses. Dehydration/hydration cycle of Ca(OH)2/CaO has been applied for thermal energy storage in two types of reactors. One of them was a prototype designed by the authors, and in the other type conventional laboratory glassware was used. Parameters such as specific heats, reaction rate and enthalpy, mass losses and heat release were monitored during cycles. Although in the hydration step water is normally added in vapour phase, liquid water, at 0 °C has been used in these experiences. Results indicated that the energy storage system performance showed no significant differences, when we compared several hydration/dehydration cycles. The selected chemical reaction did not exhibit a complete reversibility because complete Ca(OH)2 dehydration, was not achieved. However the system could be used satisfactorily along 20 cycles at least. Heat recovery experiments showed general system behaviour during the hydration step in both types of reactors. The designed prototype was more efficient in this step. Main conclusions suggested carrying out one complete cycle at a higher dehydration temperature to recover total system reversibility. A modification of the prototype design trying to enhance heat transfer from the Ca(OH)2 bed could also be proposed. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Greenhouse air was pushed through the rock-bed by a centrifugal fan with 1100 m3/h air flow rate and controlled by two thermostats when the energy storage or release was required. No crops were grown in the greenhouses and the vents were kept closed unless excessive condensation occurrence inside the greenhouses. The results of this study showed that the rock-bed system created an air temperature difference of about 10 °C at night, between the two greenhouses, the control one having the lower temperature. Furthermore, the rock-bed system kept the inside air temperature higher than that of outside air at night, even in an overcast day following a clear day. Whilst solar energy collection efficiency of the system was 34%, its energy recovery or release efficiency was higher than 80%. A numerical mathematical model considered here represented actual data well. An economic analysis indicated that the rock-bed system is more economical than the LPG or petroleum-based fuel burning heating systems widely used in Turkish greenhouses. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The photovoltaic array power output and its effective contribution to the load as well as to the energy storage have been determined by using the solar radiation usability concept. The excess and deficit of electrical energy produced from the renewable energy sources, with respect to the load, govern the effective energy management of the system and dictate the operation of an electrolyser and a fuel cell generator.

The novel model is drawn based on the simulation results, using eight-year long hour-by-hour measured wind speed data from five different locations throughout the world. An hourly constant load profile is used. The renewable energy simulation program (ARES) of the Cardiff School of Engineering is used. The ARES simulates the battery state of voltage (SoV) and is able to predict the system performance. The monthly performance values obtained from the simulations are plotted against increasing energy to load ratios for varying battery storage capacities to obtain performance curves. The novel method correlates the monthly system performance with the parameters of the Weibull distribution function, thus offering a universal use. The monthly performance curves are mathematically represented using a 2-parameter function. The novel method is validated by comparing the simulated performance values with those estimated from the simplified algorithm. The standard errors calculated in estimation of the system performance using the simplified algorithm are further presented for each battery capacity. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The model determines the energy balance at a canopy surface and the soil surface by coupling bulk stomatal resistance and soil surface vapour pressure to the soil moisture content. Heat storage in the trunks and branches is modelled using the ""force-restore"" method widely used for soil heat flux. We test the parameterisations in the model against field data, and compare values obtained with those from the literature. Literature parameterisations for soil surface vapour pressure and stomatal conductance are assessed. While some existing parameterisations were found to be adequate, others required modification for this environment. In particular, the relationship between canopy conductance and vapour pressure deficit was found to be exponential, rather than the commonly used linear one. Evaporation at the soil surface was well modelled by combining the simple surface vapour pressure representation suggested by Lee and Pielke [J. Appl. Meteorol. 31 (1992) 480], and a catchment scale unsaturated zone soil moisture storage. Energy flux data were collected during two field exercises in a natural eucalypt forest with a canopy height of 25 m during spring and summer, giving data for periods of minimum and maximum water stress. We show that while the inclusion of more locally appropriate parameterisations only slightly improved the overall energy and water balance of the model, the partitioning of moisture flux between soil evaporation and transpiration was substantially improved. The data indicated that heat storage in the deep canopy was a substantial proportion of the energy budget at the beginning and end of the day, with heat stored in the trunks the major component of it. The ""force-restore"" method proved adequate to simulate this, and is relatively simple to implement. Crown Copyright © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

It plays a central role in the production of surfactant in fetal lungs, in the supply of fatty components of milk, and in the conversion and storage of energy in liver and adipose tissue. Remarkably high levels of FAS expression are found in the majority of human epithelial cancers. As the role of FAS in cancer cells remains largely unknown, we have initiated studies to assess the fate of newly synthesized lipids in cancer cells and have estimated the contribution of FAS to the synthesis of specific lipid classes by treating the cells with small interfering RNAs targeting FAS. Here, we show that in cancer cells FAS plays a major role in the synthesis of phospholipids partitioning into detergent-resistant membrane microdomains. These are raft-aggregates implicated in key cellular processes including signal transduction, intracellular trafficking, cell polarization, and cell migration. These findings reveal a novel role for FAS, provide important new insights into the otherwise poorly understood mechanisms underlying the control of lipid composition of membrane microdomains, and point to a link between FAS overexpression and dysregulation of membrane composition and functioning in tumor cells. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Transition temperatures and latent heat of transition of PEG, fatty acids and their binary blends were determined since these properties are of primary importance in the design of phase change energy storage materials. The experimental results showed that it is possible to obtain homogeneous (as indicated by DSC data) polymer/fatty acid blends by mixing in the melt and subsequent solidification. The melting ranges of PEG/fatty acid systems were observed to be from 30 to 72 °C while their heat of transition lies in the range of 168-208 J · g-1. Synergistic action of the components was found for PEG 10 000/stearic acid blend - heat of transition was ca. 15 and 35% higher than for pure stearic acid and PEG, respectively.

Although some previous studies have analyzed the growth rate of this species, knowledge of its reproduction is very limited, and no studies exist on the pattern of energy storage and utilization in relation to its reproductive cycle. Spat obtained in the laboratory from wild adults were cultured at Bahía Magdalena (Baja California Sur, Mexico). Growth and gametogenesis were analyzed over 18 months and biochemical composition of several tissues was analyzed during the last 6 months of culture. Growth rate, in terms of increase in shell height, averaged 0.22 mm/day. The weight of adductor muscle was 20 g after 12 months, and 55 g after 18 months of culture, respectively. Gonad maturity was observed mainly from July to September during the first year (1999) and started again in April in the second year (2000). Lipid and carbohydrate concentrations in female gonad increased with gonad development, but protein concentration remained unchanged. Adductor muscle index and carbohydrate concentration increased in parallel to gonad index during the second year (2000). However, a slight but significant decrease in adductor muscle proteins was observed as gonad developed. A continuous increase in digestive gland index concomitant to gonad development might indicate an increased availability of nutrients. From an aquaculture point of view, these results indicate that Bahía Magdalena is an adequate site for scallop growth and reproduction.

The modules show high performance and good reliability in terms of discharge and recharge capability, long-term endurance, and high energy and power. During a 42-V system simulation test of 6-kW power boosting/regenerative braking, the modules demonstrate very good performance. In high-power applications such as 42-V and hybrid vehicle systems, ultracapacitors have many merits compared with batteries, especially with respect to specific power at high rate, thermal stability, charge-discharge efficiency, and cycle-life. Ultracapacitors are also very safe, reliable and environmentally friendly. The cost of ultracapacitors is still high compared with batteries because of the low production scale, but is decreasing very rapidly. It is estimated that the cost of ultracapacitors will decrease to US$ 300 per 42-V module in the near future. Also, the maintenance cost of the ultracapacitor is nearly zero because of its high cycle-life. Therefore, the combined cost of the capacitor and maintenance will be lower than that of batteries in the near future. Overall, comparing performance, price and other parameters of ultracapacitors with batteries, ultracapacitors are the most likely candidate for energy-storage in 42-V systems. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The increased disorder and additional structural modification of a-SiC:H, induced by the implantation of Ga+, results in a considerable change of the optical properties, best manifested by a significant shift of the optical absorption edge to lower photon energies in the results obtained by optical transmission and reflection measurements and as derived from photo-thermal-deflection spectroscopy results. This shift may be attributed both to additional defect introduction and to accompanying structural modification effects, as confirmed by optical absorption measurements in the infra-red region and by Raman spectroscopy results. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We investigated the influence of medium (2.5-5 × 1015 cm-2, 50 and 150 keV Fe+ ions) as well as high fluences (1016 - 1017 cm-2, 45 keV Cu+ ions) implanted into 100 and 200 nm layers of silicon carbide deposited on the c-Si substrates. The optical constants n and k were evaluated by the ellipsometric method. A considerable increase of the extinction coefficient k was noticed for the low-energy implantation into 100 nm layers for both ion fluences. The transmission spectra of a-Si1-xCx:H deposited on the glass substrate indicated the red shift of the absorption edge depending on the implantation fluence. The above-mentioned increase of the k coefficient can be attributed to the growing density of vacancies and the increase of implant atom concentration in the sub-surface layers. This effect of optical contrast formation is already very strong for the samples with the iron atom concentration of 0.7%, as obtained by the RBS analysis. Together with the sub-micron ion-beam techniques, it can be utilized for high-density data recording. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Spectral studies have been made by EDS and SEM, and the crystal structure was also determined by XRD. In order to calculate the hydrogen storage capacity, the pressure-composition isotherms (PCT curves) were utilized. The metal hydride electrode was also used as a galvanostatic cycling test. As the amount of added V or Zr is increased, the portion of the second phase is also increased gradually, but the crystal structure, CaCu5-type Laves phase, is not changed. But, in the matrix, the main component is Ni, in one of the major phases the main component is La and in another minor phase the main component is V or Zr. It has been confirmed that the addition of V or Zr causes improvement in the discharge capacity (Zr, y≤0.05; V, y≤0.1) and the cyclability (Zr, y≤0.05; V, y≤0.1) up to 200 cycles. However, adding more than y=0.2 has some significant effect on these properties. Generally, V-containing alloys may have many second phases of a round shape appearing in dispersed form in the matrix, while Zr-containing alloys' second phases appear with a plate or needle-like shape. La-rich particles precipitated along boundaries of the second phases which can act as sites of preferred hydrogen absorption, to increase the discharge capacity. In addition, many micro-cracks are formed around the La-rich particles at the surface of the La-rich particle itself. Therefore, such second phases are considered as catalytic sites for hydrogen penetration, surface reaction, initial activation and change transfer properties. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

RHIC provides collisions of heavy ions covering the entire mass range from protons to gold. For the prototypical case of Au-on-Au, one obtains energies up to 100GeV/n per beam and luminosities of ∼2 × 1026 cm-2 s-1, averaged over a 10-h storage time. Operation with polarized protons is also possible. The overall accelerator complex used for gold ions consists of the Tandem Van de Graaff, the Booster, the AGS, and the Collider itself, and the scenario for the beam transfer between machines is described. The two separate collider rings cross at six interaction points, where the lattice design provides low-beta insertions for maximum luminosity. The interaction diamond length of &lt;20cm rms is achieved by bunched beam operation and holding the 56 bunches in a 197 MHz radio-frequency (RF) system after their acceleration in a 28 MHz RF system. The rings are constructed with superconducting magnets, which have a cold bore aperture of 6.9 cm in the arcs. The RHIC specific design challenges posed by intrabeam scattering of heavy ions, passage through transition energy with slow-ramping superconducting magnets, and control of magnetic errors in the low-beta triplet quadrupoles are addressed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Some of these tools are designed to be used with small portable devices (palmtops and also cellular phones) to give users more flexibility in their utilization (e.g. while walking in a town). The limited storage capacity of such devices makes it unrealistic to think that all the useful information can be stored in such devices, apart from the most basic one, like road maps and location of some points of interests. Other more detailed information should be loaded on the fly when needed, e.g., by using a wireless connection to some remote information service. However, this could cause unacceptably high latency to get the information. Another important factor that must be taken into account is the energy consumption caused by the access to the remote information service through a wireless link. Hence, the design of an information service that integrates the capabilities of palmtop-based navigational tools must be carefully designed around the goals of reducing both the perceived latency and the consumed energy. To this purpose, we investigate the use of caching and prefetching techniques. We present analytical and numerical results obtained by defining a probabilistic model of the typical utilization scenario of the considered service and corresponding cache management policies. © 2003 IEEE.",,"navigation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642489079

Sex differences in the timing and magnitude of energy expenditure for reproduction may result in sex-specific seasonal patterns of energy storage and utilization, particularly among capital-breeding species. We studied the seasonal patterns of energy storage in adult grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, a capital-breeding, marine carnivore, to test the prediction that males and females differ in their seasonal pattern of energy storage and expenditure. 2. We measured body mass and composition in 135 (67 males, 68 females) adult grey seals at five key points throughout the annual cycle. Longitudinal changes in body composition were also measured in 73 individuals (35 males, 38 females) to examine individual variability. 3. There were significant sex differences in seasonal patterns of total body energy, with females exhibiting greater energy content (after accounting for body mass) throughout the year. Females gained body energy following both the spring moult and the breeding season, whereas males only gained body energy following an extended period of loss that included both breeding and moulting, a period of some 6 months. 4. Mass loss of females during the breeding season was similar in magnitude and composition to that gained during the 7-month pre-breeding foraging period. In contrast, mass loss of males during the breeding season was more similar to that gained during the last three months of the pre-breeding foraging period. 5. Our results suggest that the balance of costs and benefits of storing body energy for reproduction differs between males and females. Females appear to be risk-averse, committing themselves to, and preparing for, reproduction at a much earlier stage in the annual cycle compared to males. As a result, females accumulate body energy stores earlier and carry a higher level of insurance against environmental uncertainty leading up to the breeding season relative to males.","Body composition; Body mass; Fitness-maximizing strategy; Grey seals; Reproduction; Seasonal; Sex","bioenergetics; body condition; body mass; pinniped; reproduction; seasonal variation; sex-related difference; Grypus; Halichoerus grypus; Mammalia; Phocidae; Pinnipedia; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242668747

In Drosophila, laboratory experiments have revealed that energy storage patterns differ between populations selected for desiccation and starvation. This suggests that flies may use different sources of energy when exposed to these stresses, but the actual substrates used have not been examined. We measured lipid, carbohydrate, and protein content in 16 Drosophila species from arid and mesic habitats. In five species, we measured the rate at which each substrate was metabolized under starvation or desiccation stress. Rates of lipid and protein metabolism were similar during starvation and desiccation, but carbohydrate metabolism was several-fold higher during desiccation. Thus, total energy consumption was lower in starved flies than desiccated ones. Cactophilic Drosophila did not have greater initial amounts of reserves than mesic species, but may have lower metabolic rates that contribute to stress resistance. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We experimentally test the spatial dispersion of a 200-layer periodic structure and a 66-layer nonperiodic structure.

In addition, a fast and physics-based inductor model is exploited to put the results contributed by many different groups in various technologies and achieved over the past eight years into perspective. Inductors are compared not only by their maximum quality factors (Qmax), but also by taking the frequency at Qmax, the inductance value (L), the self-resonance frequency (fSR), and the coil area into account. It is further explained that the spiral coil structure on a lossy silicon substrate can operate in three different modes, depending at first order on the silicon doping concentration. Ranging from high to low substrate resistivity, inductor-mode, resonator-mode, and eddy-current regimes are defined by characteristic changes of Qmax, L, and fSR. The advantages and disadvantages of patterned or blanket resistive ground shields between the inductor coil and substrate and the effect of a substrate contact on the inductor are also addressed in this paper. Exploring optimum inductor designs under various constraints leverages the speed of the model. Finally, in view of the continuously increasing operating frequencies in advancing to new generations of RF systems, the range of feasible inductance values for given quality factors are predicted on the basis of optimum technological features.","Capacitance; Electromagnetic induction; HF radio communication; Impedance matching; Inductive energy storage; Inductors; Integrated circuit fabrication; Losses; Magnetic fields; Magnetic microwave devices; Microwave circuits; Microwave resonators; Passive circuits; Q factor; Resistance; Resonance; Thin-film inductors","Capacitance; Eddy currents; Electric conductivity; Impedance matching (electric); Inductance; Integrated circuit manufacture; Magnetic fields; Microwave circuits; Passive networks; Semiconducting silicon; Semiconductor device models; Semiconductor doping; Electromagnetic induction; Inductive energy storage; Microwave resonators; Spiral inductors; Thin film inductors; Electric inductors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038546678

Especially, nanotubes filled with ferromagnetic materials (Fe, Co, Ni) may have significant potential in data storage. Such structures may help to exceed the best available storage densities (&gt;65 Gb/inch2) and show in the case of Fe-filled nanotubes higher coercivities compared to bulk Fe. In addition, metal-filled carbon nanotubes are promising nanowires with excellent oxidation protection. In this paper we describe the synthesis of Fe-, Ni- and Co-filled carbon nanotubes by using the chemical vapor deposition method. Varying the deposition conditions we have obtained filled nanotubes with relatively uniform core diameters and different thicknesses of the carbon walls. The core diameters vary between 15 and 30 nm and the thickness of the carbon shells between 2 and 60 nm. The length of the tubes amounts up to 30 μm. The filled carbon nanotubes are characterised by scanning and transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The magnetic behaviour of the aligned Fe-filled tubes is investigated using alternating gradient magnetometry measurements and electron holography. The hysteresis loops indicate a magnetic anisotropy. The coercivity depends on the direction of the applied magnetic field. The observed enhanced coercivities are significantly higher than in bulk Fe. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We are finding more evidence that fossil fuel consumption has produced global warming and climate change, and that continued burning of fossil fuels will make things worse. The most compelling write-up of this sentiment comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2001 document, which not only outlines the astonishing depth and variety of evidence to this effect, but also presents simple yet grim predictions about the likeliest changes to sea level, surface temperature and rainfall patterns. At the same time, it seems equally clear that fossil fuel is a vital fixture for our future. The abundance and high energy content of fossil fuels make them unparalleled in terms of cost, convenience and ease of use. Moreover, the rapid growth in energy demand in the United States and abroad makes fossil fuels essential for continued economic growth and human well being. Unfortunately, consumption of these energy sources produces carbon dioxide, the longest lived and most problematic of greenhouse emissions. The way forward will require a reduction of carbon emissions, continued or increased fossil fuel consumption, and economic and population growth for 50 to 100 years. This combination leads us to three options: efficiency improvements, emissions reduction engineering or carbon sequestration. The third option is where geoscientists can have the largest impact. Carbon sequestration is capturing carbon dioxide, either from the atmosphere or emission streams, and storing it in reservoirs, such as plants or soils. Carbon dioxide could be converted to solid chemicals or injected into the deep ocean. All of these approaches come with costs and risks, but the potential pay-off is enormous - a decarbonized energy future that does not involve total overhaul of our carbon-based energy.",,"carbon sequestration; oil well; underground storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038301454

This paper describes a novel controller for a high-temperature SMES (HTS-SMES) that can ensure: 1) fast return of energy to the superconducting coil under constant-current mode and 2) a constant and sinusoidal input supply current irrespective of the varying load demand with and without harmonics. In the new HTS-SMES proposed, two hysteresis controllers are used, one to control the magnitude, phase and the waveform of the ac supply current, and the other is to control a dc chopper to regulate the SMES coil current. The first hysteresis controller ensures that as far as the power utility is concerned, the load appears to the utility system as a constant sinusoidal load with unity power factor irrespective whether the load is distorted or varying in nature. The second hysteresis controller has been designed to regulate the energy in and out of the superconducting coil. Aspecial feature of this controller is its ability to smoothly charge the superconducting coil using constant current charging so that it can be ready for the next discharging operation as soon as possible. Analysis of the circuit operation under hysteresis control is presented in details. Simulation and experimental results are presented demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed power conditioning system.","Chopper; Hysteresis; Inverter; Load leveling; Power conditioning system (PCS); Superconducting magnetic energy systems (SMES)","Electric coils; Electric loads; Harmonic analysis; Magnetic hysteresis; Power converters; Magnetic energy storage (MES); High temperature superconductors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037954620

Two relatively natural, upstream, reference reaches and a downstream treatment reach with a relatively straight channel and less woody debris were studied for 3 months before and 1.2 years after the placement of six boulder clusters in the treatment reach. Mean velocity and its coefficient of variation increased in the treatment reach (140 and 115%, respectively), whereas the reference reaches remained relatively unchanged after the placements. Enhanced particulate organic matter storage (550%) was accompanied by increased total macroinvertebrate abundance (280%) in the treatment reach, converging with those of the reference reaches almost 1 year after the treatment. Detritivorous taxa numerically dominated the macroinvertebrate community, the total densities of which were best predicted by the fine fraction of organic matter biomass at microhabitat scale. However, the effect of boulder clusters on taxonomic richness was negligible.

After confirming that an intravenous dose of sulfate is fully recovered in urinary sulfate, we measured urinary S recovery after an intravenous dose of methionine in 6 piglets fed an adequate protein (AP) diet and 6 piglets fed a low protein (LP) diet with normal energy provision. As measured over 48 h, recoveries of the methionine load as urinary total S was 106% in the AP group but only 69% in the LP group (P < 0.05). On the baseline diets the N/S balance ratio in the AP group was 36, whereas that in the LP group was 30 (P < 0.05); immediately after the methionine load, this ratio remained constant in the AP group but decreased further, to 26 (P < 0.05) in the LP group. These results indicate that protein-deficient piglets accumulate relatively more S than N from their diet, and under these conditions a significant portion of the S derived from a methionine load is retained in nonprotein compounds. Urinary S excretion, a simple nontracer measurement, can provide an accurate measure of SAA catabolism, and the N/S balance ratio is a potentially useful indicator of changes in nonprotein SAA stores of growing piglets.","Glutathione; Methionine; Protein restriction; Sulfate; Taurine","methionine; nitrogen; sulfur; sulfur amino acid; accuracy; amino acid composition; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; conference paper; energy yield; male; measurement; newborn; nonhuman; protein restriction; storage; swine; urinary excretion; Animalia; Sus scrofa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037373154

Some cultivars are less susceptible to puncture injury, which is a desirable characteristic for tomato quality. It is, therefore, important that the puncture injury susceptibility of a new tomato cultivar is known, prior to commercialisation and large-scale production. In this research, a pendulum was designed to evaluate the puncture injury susceptibility of tomato cultivars in an objective way. Logistic regression was used as a statistical tool to model the influence of the impact energy on the incidence of puncture injury. This methodology was applied to two cultivars with different susceptibilities to puncture injury, 'Tradiro' (less susceptible) and 'Blitz' (very susceptible). Their susceptibilities to puncture injury were measured as a function of storage time and colour stage. It was found that: (i) tomatoes at harvest were less susceptible to puncture injury than after storage for several days; and (ii) colour at harvest had no effect on the susceptibility for puncture injury. This research revealed that the pendulum test in combination with logistic regression is a suitable method and a promising measurement tool to determine the puncture injury susceptibility of tomato cultivars. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The mathematical model consists of three parts: a rotating part, a stationary part, and bearings. The rotating part includes a flexible hub, a flexible shaft press-fit into the hub, and TV elastic disks mounted on the hub. The stationary part can include motor bracket (stator), base casting, and a top cover. The bearings under consideration can be ball bearings or fluid-dynamic bearings (FDB). The rotating disks are modeled through the classical plate theory. The rotating part (except the disks) and the stationary part are modeled through finite-element analyses (FEA). With mode shapes and natural frequencies obtained from FEA, the kinetic and potential energies of the rotating and stationary parts are formulated and discretized to compensate for the gyroscopic effects from rotation. Finally, use of the Lagrange equation results in the equations of motion. To verify the mathematical model, frequency response functions are measured experimentally for an FDB spindle carrying two identical disks at motor and drive levels. Experimental measurements agree very well with theoretical predictions not only in resonance frequency but also in resonance amplitude.","Fluid-dynamic bearing spindles; HDD spindle motors; Vibration","Ball bearings; Computer simulation; Finite element method; Frequency response; Kinetic energy; Lagrange multipliers; Machine vibrations; Mathematical models; Motors; Natural frequencies; Potential energy; Stators; Fluid-dynamic bearings; Spindle motors; Hard disk storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037359892

This study was designed to examine cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activities, 2 modulators of reverse cholesterol transport, in Hispanic and Anglo postmenopausal women. The associations between plasma CETP and LCAT activities and body composition were also examined. Of the 199 subjects, 33% were of Hispanic origin and 47% were undergoing hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and anthropometry. Plasma CETP activity was higher in Hispanic compared to Anglo women, although the difference was eliminated when data were adjusted for abdominal fat. Hispanic women had lower plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations, higher total cholesterol:HDL cholesterol ratios and triglyceride concentrations, and greater susceptibility of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles to oxidation. Hispanic women also had a significantly greater relative deposition of body fat on the trunk and intra-abdominally than did Anglo women, even after adjusting for total body fat. There were no significant ethnic differences in LCAT activity. Plasma CETP and LCAT activities were negatively correlated with HDL cholesterol and positively correlated with total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as total and regional body composition variables.

Cultivation of cassava biomass to produce hay is based on a first harvest of the foliage at three monthsafter planting, followed every two months thereafter until one year. Inter-cropping of leguminous fodder as food-feed between rows of cassava, such as Leucaena leucocephala or cowpea (Vigna unculata), enriches soil fertility and provides additional fodder. Cassava haycontained 20 to 25% crude protein in the dry matter with good profile of amino acids. Feeding trials with cattle revealed high levels of DM intake (3.2% of BW) and high DM digestibility (71%). The hay contains tannin-protein complexes which could act as rumen by - pass protein for digestion in the small intestine. As cassava hay contains condensed tannins, it could have subsequent impact onchanging rumen ecology particularly changing rumen microbes population. Therefore, supplementation with cassava hay at 1-2 kg/hd/dto dairy cattle could markedly reduce concentrate requirements, and increase milk yield and composition. Moreover, cassava hay supplementation in dairy cattle could increase milk thiocyanate which could possibly enhance milk quality and milk storage, especially in small holder-dairy farming. Condensed tannins contained in cassava hay have also been shown to potentially reduce gastrointestinal nematodes in ruminants and therefore could act as an anthelmintic agent. Cassava hay is therefore an excellent multi-nutrient source for animals, especially for dairy cattle during the long dry season, and has the potential to increase the productivity and profitability of sustainable livestock production systems in the tropics.","Cassava Hay; Condensed Tannins; Dairy; Feed; Protein; Ruminant; Sustainable System; Tropics","Animalia; Bos taurus; Leucaena leucocephala; Leucocephala; Manihot esculenta; Nematoda; Vigna",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037354370

The system considered is an immature pig fed ad libitum on a single homogeneous food, which is balanced for nutrients and contains no toxins so that the first limiting resource is always energy. It is assumed that an animal has a desired rate of food intake (DFI) which is that needed to meet the energy requirements for protein and lipid deposition and for maintenance. DFI may not be achieved if a bulk constraint to intake exists. Where a bulk constraint operates intake is calculated as constrained food intake (CFI) where CFI = Cwhc/WHCkg/d (where WHC is the water-holding capacity of the food (kg water/kg dry food) and Cwhc is the animal's capacity for WHC (units/kg live weight per d)). Where intake is not constrained it is assumed that genetic potential will be achieved. Potential growth rate is described by the Gompertz growth function. Where intake is constrained, growth will be less than the potential. Constrained growth rate is predicted as (dW/dt)con = (EI - Em)/eg kg/d where W is pig weight (kg), EI is energy intake (MJ/d), Em is the energy required for maintenance (MJ/d) and eg is the energy required for unit gain (MJ/kg). The value of eg depends on weight and the fattening characteristics of the pig. Actual growth is predicted to be the lesser of potential and constrained growth. To deal with adaptation it is assumed that the time taken to reach equilibrium depends on the difference in WHC values between the previous and current food and that the capacity to consume food bulk is related to the WHC of the current food. It is proposed that the capacity for WHC on the first day on a new food will be equal to the current capacity for WHC on the last day of the previous food. Thus Cwhc = (FI × WHC)/W g/kg, where FI is food intake (kg/d). Thereafter Cwhc will gradually increase over time to a maximum of 0.27 g/kg. The rate of change in Cwhc is made to be the same for all pigs and all foods. The increase in capacity over time is assumed to be linear at the rate of 0.01 units/d. The model was tested using published data. Qualitatively the predictions of the model were in close agreement with the relevant observed data in at least some cases. It is concluded that the underlying theoretical assumptions of the model are reasonable. However, the model fails to predict initial intake when changed to foods high in wheat-bran content and fails to predict the intake of a non-limiting food where compensatory increases in intake and gain occur. The model could be adapted to overcome the first failure by taking into account the time course of digestive efficiency following a change in food. To deal with the second would require a sufficient understanding of the time course of compensatory growth.","Adaptation; Fibre; Food intake; Pigs; Water-holding capacity","lipid; protein; adaptation; animal experiment; appetite; article; caloric intake; controlled study; diet supplementation; energy consumption; experimental model; feeding; food composition; food intake; growth rate; hydrophilicity; lipid storage; nonhuman; nutrient availability; prediction; protein metabolism; publishing; qualitative analysis; swine; wheat bran; Adaptation, Physiological; Animal Feed; Animal Nutrition Physiology; Animals; Body Composition; Dietary Fiber; Digestion; Eating; Models, Biological; Swine; Water; Animalia; Sus scrofa; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037354297

This parametric expression is expressed in terms of the closed-loop eigenvalues and a free parameter. Through optimizing this free parameter and the closed-loop eigenvalues, a dynamical compensator is obtained which gives insensitive closed-loop eigenvalues, effectively attenuates the effect of the disturbance, and uses small control effort. To ensure desired closed-loop dynamical performance, the closed-loop eigenvalues are optimized within some desired regions on the left-half complex plane. Measures are also taken to ensure the robust stability of the closed-loop system in the case of large system parameter perturbations. The proposed approach is applied to a flywheel which is supported by four current-controlled active magnetic bearings. Nonlinear simulation and experimental results show the effect of the proposed approach.","Active magnetic bearings; Disturbance attenuation; Dynamical compensators; Eigenstructure assignment; Eigenvalue sensitivities; Energy storage flywheel; Minimum control effort; Robust stability","Closed loop control systems; Computer simulation; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Magnetic bearings; System stability; Eigenstructure assignment; Robustness (control systems)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037353009

The discussion begins with an examination of the requirement of power factor correction in dc/dc converters. Using the concept of zero-order converter circuits, sufficient conditions for a dc/dc converter circuit to provide power factor correction are derived. The duality principle is applied to generate new converter circuits that can achieve power factor correction. The practical application of power factor correction is considered in conjunction with the requirement of tight output voltage regulation. Detailed study of the circuit configuration that can simultaneously provide power factor correction and output regulations is given. Based on a general three-port model, the voltage regulator with power factor correction capability is studied in terms of the power flow between the input port, output port and energy storage port. A detailed consideration of the power flow among the three ports leads to the derivation of all possible minimal configurations that can achieve power factor correction and voltage regulation. The efficiencies of these minimal configurations are studied theoretically, leading to the concept of 'reduced redundant power processing' which provides important clue to efficiency improvement. Another issue addressed in this paper is the synthesis of practical circuits that can provide power factor correction and output regulation. In particular, four practical minimal configurations that achieve reduced redundant power processing are considered. A systematic synthesis procedure is derived for creating converter circuits that achieve power factor correction and output voltage regulation. The control issue is also investigated in depth, pinpointing the basic requirement on the number of control parameters needed and its relationship with the operating mode.","Circuit synthesis; Efficiency; Power factor correction; Power flow; Switching converters","Electric power factor correction; Mathematical models; Power converters; Switching circuits; Voltage control; Converter circuits; Power quality; Switching converters; Circuit theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037345483

However, the standard implementation of their decoding algorithm suffers from a large latency and high power consumption making them improper for mobile interactive systems. To overcome this drawback, we carefully analyzed the Maximum A Posteriori algorithm, the key-building block of the decoder, and stated that memory accesses are the bottleneck. Therefore, we have systematically optimized the data transfer and storage. This paper presents the main results of this optimization, especially those concerning the memory organization and architecture. Both for the input and the metrics values, a memory sub-layer is introduced such that temporal data locality can be maximally exploited. The architecture is defined to optimally allocate memory units and assign arrays, such that the number of accesses is drastically reduced. The combined optimizations reduce the latency by a factor 600 and the energy per bit by a factor 20, breaking definitely an important obstruction to the application of turbo codes in high-speed communication systems.","Low latency; Low power; MAP algorithm; Memory optimization; Turbo codes","Algorithms; Arrays; Data storage equipment; Decoding; Error correction; Optimization; Forward error correction; Maximum a posteriori algorithm; Memory power reduction; Turbo codes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037335340

The analysis shows that the reduction in achievable utility cost-savings is small when relying on real-time pricing (RTP) electricity rates that are made available by the utility only 1h ahead instead of an entire day-ahead. Real-time pricing rate data from two utilities, one in the South and one on the West Coast of the United States, were used in both a day-ahead (24h rate certainty) and an hour-ahead (1h rate certainty) fashion. Using measured data for a hotel and an office building in the United States, predictive optimal control strategies delivered greatly superior utility cost-saving performance compared to conventional partial-storage thermal energy storage strategies, even with inaccurate forecasts. The more accurate the prediction becomes, the greater will be the cost-saving performance of cool storage systems under predictive optimal control, and the smaller will be the impact associated with uncertain RTP rates in the hour-ahead RTP tariff case. Consequently, uncertain electrical utility rates do not imperil the superior cost-saving benefits of cool storage when governed by predictive optimal control. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Among the additives to iron oxide tested, Al, Cr, Zr, Ga and V were the effective elements enhancing both the reduction with H2 (storage of H2) and reoxidation with water (recovery of H2) of the iron oxide (3Fe + 4H2O ⇌ Fe3O4 + 4H2) at low temperatures (&lt; 400°C). The additives moderated the sintering of iron oxide markedly with repeated redox cycles. It is suggested that another important role of additives is to activate H2 and H2O at the surface of iron oxide or to enhance the diffusion of O2- as a result of the formation of compound oxides between the additive and iron oxide. © 2002 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

The composition of a stoichiometric compound (LMNi3.6Al0.4Co0.7Mn0.3)My(LM = La-richmischmetal, M = Ti, Zr; y = 0.0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) with a hexagonal CaCu5 structure was varied by stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric addition of Ti or Zr. The alloy surface was analyzed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy and the crystal structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction. To determine hydrogen storage capacity, the pressure composition isotherms (PCT curves) were utilized. Metal hydride electrode was characterized by galvanostatic cycling test. It was found that the addition of Ti (y = 0.05) or Zr (y = 0.02) improves the activation, discharge capacity and cycle life property. But, the alloy with Ti addition (y ≥ 0.2), containing a Zr addition (y ≥ 0.2), is found to have bad discharge capacity and cycle life. The kinetic properties are additionally increased by the formation of a Ti- or Zr-rich second phase. The improvement in discharge capacity caused by increasing the Ti or Zr content (0.1 ≥ y) in the alloy is attributed to active sites for the electrochemical reaction. Also, they seem to be strongly related with the shapes and amounts of the second phases. © 2002 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

X-ray powder diffraction analysis showed that all alloys mainly consisted of a C14 Laves phase with hexagonal structure and a V-based solid solution phase with BCC structure. The lattice parameters and the unit cell volumes of the two phases decrease when x is increased. The electrochemical performances of the alloy electrodes, including the cycle life, the linear polarization, the anodic polarization, the Tafel polarization and the electrochemical impedance spectra, have been investigated systematically. After considering the global effect of the non-stoichiometry of B-side elements on the performances of the alloy electrodes, the optimum composition was found to lie in x = 5. Consequently, we believe that the non-stoichiometry is an effective way to improve the overall electrochemical properties of the Ti-based Laves phase hydrogen storage alloys used for the negative electrodes of Ni-MH secondary batteries. © 2002 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Distribution within the washcoat was scrutinised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis. The more external region (10-15 μm) of the washcoat are very concentrated in Ca and P. CePO4 was detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Other phases that can be formed between contaminants themselves and with the washcoat components were not detected by XRD.

Eu2+ ions in the as-prepared glass show no PL, but after suitable thermal annealing hexagonal phase and orthorhombic phase barium bromide crystallites are precipitated and PL is observed from Eu2+ ions in these crystallites. Room temperature PSL is observed from the orthorhombic phase, with an efficiency which is up to 9% of the well known crystalline storage phosphor BaFBr:Eu2+. The emission is at 404 nm, and there is a maximum in the stimulation at 580 nm. We associate the PSL with an optically quenchable peak in the glow curve, which has an activation energy of 1.20 eV and attribute this feature to a perturbed F centre. Room temperature PSL from glass-ceramics containing predominantly the hexagonal phase of BaBr2 has a relative efficiency of less than 0.07%. The resultant trap depth determined from the glow curve is 0.60 eV, which suggests that this trap does not arise from a perturbed F centre. We find that the PSL efficiency systematically decreases with decreasing hexagonal BaBr2 nanocrystallite size and there is no detectable PSL from nanocrystallites smaller than 10 nm. However, below 100 K, the PSL efficiency for the hexagonal phase is nearly as high as for the orthorhombic phase and the concomitant electron traps are perturbed F centres. The measured low temperature emission was at 409 nm and an additional stimulation peak was observed at 700 nm.

However, the technology would be more affordable if less energy was used during the process. The paper explores two interrelated ways in which this could be achieved. The first is to decrease typical grain treatment temperatures, but hold those temperatures without the addition of subsequent energy for a time sufficient for disinfestation. The second is to increase the rate of heating to induce physiological heat shock and thereby bring about faster insect mortality. Using a spouted bed, rates of mortality of the heat-tolerant species Rhyzopertha dominica were determined over a range of grain temperatures from 50°C to 60°C at 12% m.c. The grain temperatures were gained at four rates of heating obtained by using different air inlet temperatures from 80°C to 200°C. From the data, a probit model was developed to predict LT values for five arbitrary immature development stages. At LT 99.9 and above, immature stage 2 was generally found to be the most heat-tolerant stage, while stage 5 was generally the most susceptible. When the initial rate of heating was increased by increasing air inlet temperature from 80°C to 100°C, the time required for a given level of mortality was significantly decreased. While subsequent rate increases had limited further impact on increasing rates of mortality, there was an increase in the efficiency of heating. Furthermore, decreasing the target grain temperature and increasing the treatment period accounted for additional cost savings. For example, at the most rapid rate of heating, grain that reached 60°C required 0.73 min of heat soak for 99.9% mortality and cost a theoretical $2.72/t, while grain that reached 55°C required 23.62 min for the same level of mortality and cost $1.87/t. By 50°C, some 22 h were required, but the theoretical running cost was reduced to $1.25/t. Thus, within practical boundaries, increasing the air inlet temperature or rate of heating, and decreasing the grain target temperature, increases the efficiency of the system and reduces operation costs. With the system used here, obtaining grain at 50°C using air at 200°C was 75% efficient and 80% cheaper than obtaining grain at 60°C using air at 80°C, which was only 18% efficient. An assessment of possible impact on grain quality due to the various heat treatments was also carried out, both initially and after 6 months storage. Using several criteria of germination measurement as a quality indicator, no adverse effects were observed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We show that the mechanism of electrochemical alloying is electrochemically-driven solid-state amorphization, a process closely analogous to the diffusive solid-state amorphization of thin films. X-ray diffraction and HREM experiments reveal that the crystallization of equilibrium intermetallic compounds is circumvented during lithiation at room temperature, and that formation of highly lithiated Li-Si glass instead occurs. This glass is shown to be metastable with respect to the equilibrium crystalline phases. Similar behavior is observed in the diffusive reaction of Li and Si bilayer films, suggesting that lithium-metal alloys in general are likely candidates for solid-state amorphization. © 2002 Acta Materialia Inc.

Recent studies have shown that long-distance migratory birds, besides accumulating fat for use as fuel, also show adaptive phenotypic flexibility in several organs during migration. The migratory routes of many songbirds include stretches of sea and desert where fuelling is not possible. Large fuel loads increase flight costs and predation risk, therefore extensive fuelling should occur only immediately prior to crossing inhospitable zones. However, despite their crucial importance for the survival of migratory birds, both strategic refuelling decisions and variation in phenotypic flexibility during migration are not well understood. First-year thrush nightingales (Luscinia luscinia) caught in the early phase of the onset of autumn migration in southeast Sweden and exposed to a magnetic treatment simulating a migratory flight to northern Egypt increased more in fuel load than control birds. By contrast, birds trapped during the late phase of the onset of autumn migration accumulated a high fuel load irrespective of magnetic treatment. Furthermore, early birds increased less in flight-muscle size than birds trapped later in autumn. We suggest that the relative importance of endogenous and environmental factors in individual birds is affected by the time of season and by geographical area. When approaching a barrier, environmental cues may act irrespective of the endogenous time programme.","Bird migration; Endogenous time programme; Flight muscle; Fuel; Magnetic cues","fuel; endogenous cue; environmental cue; migratory species; phenotypic plasticity; songbird; article; association; autumn; bird; controlled study; Egypt; environmental factor; geography; lipid storage; muscle; nonhuman; population migration; priority journal; seasonal variation; Sweden; time; Aves; Luscinia; Luscinia luscinia; Luscinia luscinia; Passeri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037460683

These two transporters show significant sequence homology with the product of the Indy gene identified in Drosophila melanogaster and with the Na+-coupled dicarboxylate transporters NaDC1 and NaDC3 identified in mammals. In a mammalian cell heterologous expression system, the cloned ceNaDC1 and ceNaDC2 mediate Na+-coupled transport of various dicarboxylates. With succinate as the substrate, ceNaDC1 exhibits much lower affinity compared with ceNaDC2. Thus, ceNaDC1 and ceNaDC2 correspond at the functional level to the mammalian NaDC1 and NaDC3, respectively. The nadc1 and nadc2 genes are not expressed at the embryonic stage, but the expression is detectable all through the early larva stage to the adult stage. Tissue-specific expression pattern studies using a reporter gene fusion approach in transgenic C. elegans show that both genes are coexpressed in the intestinal tract, an organ responsible for not only the digestion and absorption of nutrients but also for the storage of energy in this organism. Independent knockdown of the function of these two transporters in C. elegans using the strategy of RNA interference suggests that NaDC1 is not associated with the regulation of average life span in this organism, whereas the knockdown of NaDC2 function leads to a significant increase in the average life span. Disruption of the function of the high affinity Na+-coupled dicarboxylate transporter NaDC2 in C. elegans may lead to decreased availability of dicarboxylates for cellular production of metabolic energy, thus creating a biological state similar to that of caloric restriction, and consequently leading to life span extension.",,"Absorption; Genes; Nutrition; RNA; Sodium; Gene fusion; Biochemistry; dicarboxylate transporter; gene product; protein indy; protein nadc1; protein nadc3; RNA; sodium coupled dicarboxylate transporter derivative; unclassified drug; Caenorhabditis elegans protein; carrier protein; cotransporter; dicarboxylate transporter; membrane protein; nad 2 protein, C elegans; nad-2 protein, C elegans; NaDC1 protein, C elegans; organic anion transporter; primer DNA; recombinant protein; SLC13A2 protein, human; sodium dicarboxylate cotransporter 2; sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter-2; article; binding affinity; Caenorhabditis elegans; caloric restriction; controlled study; digestion; Drosophila melanogaster; embryo development; energy; gene disruption; gene expression; gene function; gene fusion; gene identification; intestine absorption; larva; lifespan; mammal cell; metabolism; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; nutrient; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein structure; protein transport; reporter gene; sequence homology; amino acid sequence; animal; Caenorhabditis elegans; chemistry; cosmid; Escherichia coli; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; life expectancy; methodology; molecular cloning; molecular genetics; physiology; polymerase chain reaction; sequence alignment; Caenorhabditis; Caenorhabditis elegans; Drosophila melanogaster; Mammalia; Melanogaster; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; Carrier Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; Cosmids; Dicarboxylic Acid Transporters; DNA Primers; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Life Expectancy; Membrane Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Dependent; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Symporters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037458617

The number of electrons is decreased by local laser exposure. As a result, the radiation field produced by external beam irradiation is recorded as 'positive' information and the position of the patient-setup laser is recorded as 'negative' on an IP. The advantages of this method are the direct measurement, short time and high resolution. These are required for daily and monthly quality checks.

In addition to reducing the requirement of adding oxidant and catalyst by applying the high pressure and high temperatures characteristic of microwave radiation, this work also adopts a newly developed continuous-flow process instead of the conventional batch production method to reduce the reaction time and prevent the energy waste. Water treatment plants can produce coagulants by themselves to meet their requirements since polyferric sulfate is easily created using this microwave method. The transport and storage expenses associated with providing reliable and fresh coagulants for water treatment can thus be reduced or eliminated. The approach specified herein has already been successfully applied to synthesize PFS products and evaluate products' physical and chemical properties, including ORP values, viscosity, salicylic acid reaction ability, and hydrolysis parameter B*. The results reveal that PFS made using the microwave method has properties similar to those of PFS made by the conventional method. Importantly, the microwave method reduces the reaction time from the 500 min of the conventional method to less than 20 min, significantly reducing the amount of energy consumed and the expense of production.","Hydrolysis parameter B*; Microwave; ORP; Polyferric sulfate; Salicylic acid","Coagulation; Hydrolysis; Microwaves; Reaction kinetics; Synthesis (chemical); Water treatment; Coagulants; Inorganic polymers; coagulating agent; ferric sulfate; salicylic acid; coagulation; microwave radiation; oxidant; sulfate; article; catalysis; continuous flow reactor; energy; high temperature procedures; hydrolysis; microwave radiation; oxidation; reaction analysis; reduction; viscosity; water treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037268601

According to the Band Transport model, photorefraction results from absorption at various impurity levels inside the crystal. Thus an understanding of impurity levels within a photorefractive crystal will facilitate further understanding of photorefraction. Various methods have been employed to determine impurity levels inside photorefractive crystals (particularly BaTiO3, due to its fast response time). To date, most often quoted estimations of impurity levels are located between 0.3 and 0.8 eV for various BaTiO3 samples. These estimations are deduced from experiments at temperatures above room temperature. This paper reports the first two-wave mixing experiments performed at temperatures below room temperature for which a BaTiO3 crystal (doped with 20 ppm cobalt) is in orthorhombic phase and provides an estimation of the location of the shallow energy level in this crystal, which is approximately 0.1 eV above the valence band. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The optimization of the Li-ion technology urgently needs improvement for the active material of the negative electrode, and many recent papers in the field support this tendency. Moreover, the diversity in the chemical nature of the materials studied so far requires a systematization work to be done to envisage the main guidelines for research and future progress areas. This review starts with an analysis of the major advantages and drawbacks of the lithium metal electrode that led to the development of the Li-ion concept. The successful carbon-based materials, including numerous forms of both natural and anthropogenic origins are then mentioned. Attention is paid to the materials prepared from side products of the petroleum industry. Then, the central part of the report concerns alternative possibilities that have emerged from the use of tin, antimony and other elements that reversibly form alloys and compounds with lithium. The systematic study takes into account the chemical nature of the elements directly involved in the reversible reactions with lithium. Thus, tin and other group 14 elements, pnictides, and oxides are summarized in three consecutive sections. In the first section, particular attention will be paid to tin oxides and phosphates and the ""SnSb"" compounds serves as a link with the next section. Among the metal pnictides, compounds such as CoSb3 and CrSb2, are described as precursors of the electroactive material in a dispersing matrix. Also phosphides, such as CoP3 and MnP4, are also discussed, the latter having interesting intercalation reactions with lithium. Finally, the recently revised field of using transition metal oxides that allow a reversible Li2O formation on cycling is discussed. In each section, several materials evaluated in our laboratory are included. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The variability of the annual water balance for Sri Lanka is estimated using observed rainfall and remotely sensed actual evaporation rates at a 1 km grid resolution. The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) has been used to assess the actual evaporation and storage changes in the root zone on a 10-day basis. The water balance was closed with a runoff component and a remainder term. Evaporation and runoff estimates were verified against ground measurements using scintillometry and gauge readings respectively. The annual water balance for each of the 103 river basins of Sri Lanka is presented. The remainder term appeared to be less than 10% of the rainfall, which implies that the water balance is sufficiently understood for policy and decision making. Access to water balance data is necessary as input into water accounting procedures, which simply describe the water status in hydrological systems (e.g. nation wide, river basin, irrigation scheme). The results show that the irrigation sector uses not more than 7% of the net water inflow. The total agricultural water use and the environmental systems usage is 15 and 51%, respectively of the net water inflow. The consumptive use of rain-fed and irrigated agriculture are approximately equal. The evaporation rates in agriculture and mixed vegetation are similar, so that low productivity rangelands can be transformed into rain-fed agriculture without detrimental effects on water availability to downstream users. The unused water flow to the Indian Ocean is 34% of the net inflow, hence there is scope for further water developments in Sri Lanka. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The design makes use of the latent heat of fusion of the PCESM that is placed in the lower pan for effecting continued desalination even after sunset, and beneath which a pad of sawdust functions as insulation. The optimum PCESM was precisely an emulsion of paraffin wax, paraffin oil and water in a specific ratio to which aluminum turnings were added to assist in heat transfer by conduction. Factors such as concentration and flow rate of saline water, type of energy storage material and inlet water temperature were investigated for their effect on the still productivity. Results indicated that the use of an energy storage material led to a larger productivity of distilled water and that the larger the concentration of the saline water the lower the productivity of the still. Also higher flowrate and high inlet saline water temperature improved the still efficiency.

Of course, it also holds both modular and dismountable seawater desalting machines and freshwater handling facilities for storage, transshipment and conveyance/transfer towards the shore. Raw water is processed by one of the three systems: multi-stage flash, reverse osmosis and the last one which will probably make a breakthrough soon. The LNG-carrier is of 127,500 m3 LNG cargo class. The total daily volume of freshwater produced is 120,000 m3. The water is continuously conveyed to the shore through smaller aqua-tanker shuttle service (originally 21000Tdwt crude-oil tankers). The energy needed to run the plant is LNG. The author has also designed a new type of ship, similar to the LNG-carrier, but meant entirely for seawater desalination industry. Before its conveyance to the shore, the water is stored inside the ship's tanks, the inner of which is covered with huge bags of geomembrane plastic liners.

The ball-milled NiS particles are relatively larger than those of the starting materials and have a nanocrystalline structure. The initial discharge capacity of the NiS positive electrode is 580 mAh/g-NiS, at 1.4 V versus Li/Li+. The NiS powders synthesized by MA show proper cycling properties, by retaining 65% of the initial discharge capacity even after 100 cycles at 30°C. Also, NiS has a good rate capability.

We examined the relationships of plasma leptin and adiponectin levels to fat distribution and insulin sensitivity in the HIV lipodystrophy syndrome. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: HIV primary care practices. Patients: HIV-infected men with (n=13) and without (12) lipodystrophy and healthy uninfected controls (12). Main outcome measures: Plasma adiponectin and leptin levels were measured in the fasting state. Body composition was assessed by physical examination, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography. Insulin sensitivity (SI) was measured using the insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Results: Leptin levels were significantly higher in HIV-infected men with lipodystrophy as compared to HIV-infected controls (5.2 vs 3.0 ng/ml, P=0.01). Across the entire study population, leptin levels were positively correlated with measures of general adiposity. In the HIV-infected patients, leptin levels were negatively correlated with SI after adjustment for fat mass (r=-0.38, P=0.07). Adiponectin levels were significantly lower in HIV-infected men with lipodystrophy as compared to both HIV-infected and healthy controls (1.6 vs 3.4 μg/ml, P&lt;0.05 and 1.6 vs 6.7 μg/ml, P&lt;0.001, respectively). Adiponectin levels, after adjustment for fat mass, were correlated with measures of fat distribution. Finally, in the HIV-infected patients, adiponectin levels were significantly and positively correlated with SI after adjustment for fat mass (r=0.75, P≤0.001), and adiponectin level was also an independent determinant of SI. Conclusions: Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels are altered in the HIV lipodystrophy syndrome. Adiponectin deficiency may play a role in the insulin resistance associated with HIV lipodystrophy.",,"adiponectin; leptin; adult; article; body composition; body mass; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; correlation analysis; diet restriction; disease association; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; glucose tolerance test; hormone blood level; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipodystrophy; male; physical examination; priority journal; Adipocytes; Adiponectin; Adult; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Glucose Tolerance Test; HIV Infections; HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy Syndrome; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Leptin; Male; Middle Aged; Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12244302925

The implantable battery system tested consists of six lithium-ion batteries in series, a charge unit, and a charge/discharge control unit. A lithium-ion battery is currently the best energy-storage device because it has more energy density, a better life cycle, and a smaller temperature rise than those of other secondary batteries. The performance of the implantable battery system was evaluated in an in vitro experiment using an electric load that simulated the UPTAH. Also, sufficiently reliable operation of a system for supplying energy to a UPTAH consisting of a transcutaneous energy transmission system (TETS) and an implantable battery system was confirmed in three experiments using goats. The results of the in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the implantable battery system supplied sufficient current to the UPTAH for maintenance of physiological conditions in the goat with maximum rise in temperature to less than 43°C.","Artificial heart; Lithium-ion battery; Total artificial heart; Transcutaneous energy transmission system; Undulation pump total artificial heart","Artificial heart; Heart; Ions; Life cycle; Pumps; Battery systems; Energy; Energy-transmission systems; Implantable battery; In-vitro; Total artificial hearts; Transcutaneous energy transmission; Transcutaneous energy transmission system; Undulation pump total artificial heart; Lithium-ion batteries; lithium ion; animal experiment; artificial heart; blood pump; conference paper; controlled study; electric battery; energy resource; energy transfer; feasibility study; goat; lung edema; male; nonhuman; priority journal; simulation; temperature; Animalia; Capra hircus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345701510

Depending on the deposition conditions and the setup used in tribological experiments, varying and even controversial results are obtained. Additionally, hydrogen, oxygen and the relative humidity have a crucial influence on the tribological behavior. The amorphous nature of a-C:H opens the possibility to introduce different amounts of other elements into the coating and still maintain the amorphous phase of the coating. By this technique film properties such as thermal stability, hardness, tribological properties, electrical conductivity, surface energy and biological reactions of cells in contact with the surface can be tuned within a certain range. Commercial applications of DLC and alloyed DLC are for example: Magnetic storage media, diesel injection pumps, sliding bearings, car valve rockers, gears, tappets of racing motorcycles, laser barcode scanner windows in supermarkets, VCR head drums, textile industry parts. DLC has excellent tribological properties in technical applications, however, the literature shows contradicting results on the wear behavior of DLC-coated hip joints. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Soon after the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991, different research groups succeeded in filling carbon nanotubes with some elements, and, therefore, the question arose of filling carbon nanotubes with hydrogen by possibly using new effects such as nano-capillarity. Subsequently, very promising experiments claiming high hydrogen storage capacities in different carbon nanostructures initiated enormous research activity. Hydrogen storage capacities have been reported that exceed the benchmark for automotive application of 6.5 wt% set by the U.S. Department of Energy. However, the experimental data obtained with different methods for various carbon nanostructures show an extreme scatter. Classical calculations based on physisorption of hydrogen molecules could not explain the high storage capacities measured at ambient temperature, and, assuming chemisorption of hydrogen atoms, hydrogen release requires temperatures too high for technical applications. Up to now, only a few calculations and experiments indicate the possibility of an intermediate binding energy. Recently, serious doubt has arisen in relation to several key experiments, causing considerable controversy. Furthermore, high hydrogen storage capacities measured for carbon nanofibers did not survive cross-checking in different laboratories. Therefore, in light of today's knowledge, it is becoming less likely that at moderate pressures around room temperature carbon nanostructures can store the amount of hydrogen required for automotive applications.","Carbon Fibers; Carbon Nanotubes; Chemisorption; Hydrogen Storage; Physisorption","carbon nanotube; hydrogen; absorption; calculation; car; environmental temperature; nanotechnology; pressure; review; room temperature; storage; temperature sensitivity; adsorption; chemical model; chemical structure; chemistry; computer simulation; conformation; electrochemistry; hydrogen bond; isolation and purification; macromolecule; methodology; nanotechnology; power supply; Adsorption; Computer Simulation; Electric Power Supplies; Electrochemistry; Hydrogen; Hydrogen Bonding; Macromolecular Substances; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes, Carbon",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042385002

Sch., 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854, United States","Background/aims: The influence of mechanical forces on skin has been examined since 1861 when Langer first reported the existence of lines of tension in cadaver skin. Internal tension in the dermis is not only passively transferred to the epidermis but also gives rise to active cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell mechanical interactions that may be an important part of the homeostatic processes that are involved in normal skin metabolism. The purpose of this review is to analyse how internal and external mechanical loads are applied at the macromolecular and cellular levels in the epidermis and dermis. Methods: A review of the literature suggests that internal and external forces applied to dermal cells appear to be involved in mechanochemical transduction processes involving both cell-cell and cell-extra-cellular matrix (ECM) interactions. Internal forces present in dermis are the result of passive tension that is incorporated into the collagen fiber network during development. Active tension generated by fibroblasts involves specific interactions between cell membrane integrins and macromolecules found in the ECM, especially collagen fibrils. Forces appear to be transduced at the cell-ECM interface via re-arrangement of cytoskeletal elements, activation of stretch-induced changes in ion channels, cell contraction at adherens junctions, activation of cell membrane-associated secondary messenger pathways and through growth factor-like activities that influence cellular proliferation and protein synthesis.

The disposal of used chlorinated solvents in the M-Area of SRS to an unlined settling basin and to a nearby tributary, along with spills at the solvent storage tank area, has created a significant subsurface contamination problem. SRS is located in west-central South Carolina, where the geology is dominated by sediments of the Coastal Plain physiographic province. The sediments are relatively flat-lying, irregular, interbedded sand and clay bodies deposited in marine to fluvio-deltaic environments. In 2000, a pilot field-scale steam flood began at a former solvent storage tank area (321 M SST) to demonstrate the proficiency of steam flooding in the geologic environment at SRS and to determine the feasibility of the process for the remediation of the M-Area settling basin. A multiphase flow numerical simulator was used to predict heating patterns of the steam flood at the solvent storage tank area. Although the simulations were not used to design the pilot test, comparisons of data from the actual steam flood with the simulation confirm the model's ability to predict steam front propagation in the heterogeneous media. The overall heating patterns are dominated by convective heat flows at early times, but thermal conduction appears to play a large role at longer times, dampening the effects of heterogeneities.","Modeling; Multiphase flow; Remediation; Steam","pollutant removal; sediment pollution; steam injection; coastal plain; pollutant removal; sediment pollution; steam injection; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037768485

Use a microcalorimetric technique to measure the interactions between water vapor and amorphous pharmaceutical solids and describe the relationship between long-term physical stability and the storage relative humidity (RH) at constant temperature. Methods. A thermal activity monitor was used to characterize interactions of water vapor with spray-dried amorphous sucrose, lactose, raffinose, and sodium indomethacin. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure glass transition temperature, Tg. X-ray powder diffraction was used to confirm that the spray-dried samples were amorphous. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine particle morphology. Specific surface area was determined by BET analysis of nitrogen and krypton adsorption isotherms. Results. The moisture-induced thermal activity traces (MITATs) of the materials in this study exhibit general behavior that helps explain the effect of moisture content on the physical stability of the glassy phase at a given storage temperature. At some RH threshold, RHm, the MITAT exhibits a dramatic increase in the energy of interaction between water vapor and the glass that cannot be explained by a phase or morphology change. Calorimetric data indicate that water vapor-solid interactions are reversible below RHm; above RHm, energetic hysteresis is observed and water-water interactions predominate. In addition, the MITAT was deconvoluted into sorptive and nonsorptive components, making it possible to assign the observed heat flow to unique thermal events. Samples stored at a RH just below Rbm for more than 2 months show no evidence of morphology or phase change. In addition, the MITAT can be deconvoluted into sorptive and nonsorptive components by using a twin-calorimeter arrangement. This analysis provides specificity to the microcalorimetric analysis and helps explain the nature of the physical changes that occur during the hydration glassy phase. Conclusions. The MITAT is a useful tool to determine the onset of moisture-induced physical instability of glassy pharmaceuticals and may find a broad application to determine appropriate storage conditions to ensure long-term physical stability.","BET monolayer; Glass transition temperature; Hydration limit; Microcalorimetry; MITAT; Stability","alpha lactose; carbohydrate derivative; indometacin derivative; raffinose; sodium indomethacin; sucrose; trehalose; unclassified drug; article; chemical interaction; chemical reaction; drug stability; glass transition temperature; humidity; hydration; microcalorimetry; particle size; priority journal; water vapor; Calorimetry; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Steam; Volatilization; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037332149

This study quantifies the potential contribution of elastic recoil to extension torque at joints of the fourth leg of representative arachnids. Extension torques of isolated joints with and without transarticular sclerites were measured as the joint was rotated through angles and at angular velocities comparable with those used by walking animals. The procedure was repeated with the joint subjected to different internal fluid pressures in order to assess the potential role of hydraulically induced extension. The efficiency of elastic energy storage (resilience) in the absence of internal fluid pressure was 70-90% for joints with well-developed transarticular sclerites, and the magnitude of torque was similar to those produced by different joint extension mechanisms in other arthropods. Increased internal fluid pressure acted synergistically with transarticular sclerites in some joints but had little or no effect in others. Joints that lacked both extensor muscles and transarticular sclerites appeared to be specialized for hydraulic extension, and joints operated by antagonistic muscles lacked apparent specializations for either elastic or hydraulic extension. It is well known that elastic energy storage is a significant contributor to propulsion in running vertebrates and certain arthropods, where elastic elements are loaded as the center of mass falls during one phase of the locomotor cycle. However, transarticular sclerites are apparently loaded by contraction of flexor muscles when the leg is not in contact with the substratum. Hence the mechanism of a transarticular sclerite is more similar to the flight and jumping mechanisms of other arthropods than to running vertebrates. The evolutionary significance and potential mechanical advantages of the transarticular elastic mechanism are discussed.","Arachnid; Arthropod; Elastic energy storage; Extensor muscle; Leg joint; Resilience; Transarticular sclerite","animal; arachnid; article; elasticity; limb; locomotion; motor activity; movement (physiology); physiology; pressure; scorpion; skeletal muscle; spider; torque; Animals; Arachnida; Elasticity; Extremities; Locomotion; Motor Activity; Movement; Muscle, Skeletal; Pressure; Scorpions; Spiders; Torque; Animalia; Arachnida; Araneae; Arthropoda; Scorpiones; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037329894

Australia, Iron Metab. and Chelation Program, High Street, Sydney, NSW 2031, Australia","Many effector functions of nitrogen monoxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) are mediated through their high-affinity for iron (Fe). In this review, the roles of NO and CO are examined in terms of their effects on the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in Fe metabolism. Both NO and CO avidly form complexes with a plethora of Fe-containing molecules. The generation of NO and CO is mediated by the nitric oxide synthase and haem oxygenase (HO) families of enzymes respectively. The effects of NO on Fe metabolism have been well characterized, whereas knowledge of the effects of CO remains within its infancy. In terms of the role of NO in Fe metabolism, one of the best characterized interactions includes its effect on the iron regulatory proteins. These molecules are mRNA-binding proteins that control the expression of the transferrin receptor 1 and ferritin, molecules that are involved in Fe uptake and storage respectively. Apart from this, activated macrophages impart their cytotoxic activity by generating NO, which results in marked Fe mobilization from tumour-cell targets. This deprives the cell of the Fe that is required for DNA synthesis and energy production. Considering that HO degrades haem, resulting in the release of CO, Fe(II) and biliverdin, it is suggested that a CO-Fe complex will form. This may account for the rapid Fe mobilization observed from macrophages after haemoglobin catabolism. Intriguingly, overexpression of HO results in cellular Fe mobilization, suggesting that CO has a similar effect to NO on Fe trafficking. Preliminary evidence suggests that, like NO, CO plays important roles in Fe metabolism.","Carbon monoxide; Iron; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen monoxide","Carbon monoxide; DNA; Metabolism; Nitrogen oxides; Proteins; Haemoglobin catabolism; Biochemistry; biliverdin; carbon monoxide; ferritin; ferrous ion; heme oxygenase; iron; iron complex; iron regulatory factor; nitric oxide; nitric oxide synthase; transferrin receptor; binding affinity; cell activity; cell metabolism; cytotoxicity; DNA synthesis; energy yield; human; iron binding capacity; iron kinetics; iron metabolism; iron storage; iron transport; macrophage; molecular mechanics; priority journal; protein binding; review; RNA binding; Animals; Carbon Monoxide; Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing); Heme Oxygenase-1; Humans; Iron; Membrane Proteins; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037328284

In many instances, this can be related to large fractions of grain boundaries and hence large numbers of surface atoms. Defect thermodynamics in the bulk may then be governed by surfaces. As tailoring of fundamental properties becomes possible in the quantum confinement regime, existing materials may find new applications. In this review, recent studies of the properties of nanostructured electroceramics will be presented. The applications relate to electrochemical devices for energy conversion and storage. A breakthrough in metal hydride technology was achieved by preparing nanostructured hydride forming materials. In addition, several forms of carbon are being studied for hydrogen storage.

Bonded samples of silicon or oxidized silicon wafers using oxygen plasma pretreatment in reactive ion etchers with and without inductively coupled plasma were characterized in terms of surface energies obtained at room temperature. Annealing experiments at 1000°C were made to study the origin of thermally generated voids. Atomic force microscopy was used to study how the surface roughness of plasma-treated silicon wafers evolved over time. Furthermore, the influence of water dipping on the roughness of plasma-treated silicon surfaces was investigated. The results showed that plasma treatment of one wafer results in a surface energy of approximately 1 J m-2 at room temperature. The role of water in the increase of surface energy was found to be crucial. From annealing experiments it is concluded that water present at the wafer surfaces before bonding has a pronounced influence on void generation upon annealing. A dramatic change in the topography of silicon surfaces treated in oxygen plasma was observed during storage at room temperature, while water dipping the wafers after plasma treatment appeared to stabilize the surface topography. © 2003 The Electrochemical Society.

The reason for this stagnation is the interaction between tumor cell and photon radiation. Tumor resistance against photon bombardment can be broken down by applying high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation-based treatment. The discovery of californium-252 (252Cf) nuclide, a source of gamma neutron radiation, established a precondition for using neutrons in tumor brachytherapy. The design of a remote afterloading device using 252Cf sources remains an unsolved problem. Material and Methods: The after loading device has been designed as a stationary radiator which is composed of three mutually interconnected units: • the control and drive unit consisting of a control computer and a motor-driven bowden system carrying the 252Cf source; • the source which is housed in a watertight concrete vessel-storage strong room, situated in the ground at a depth of 125 cm beneath the patient's bed; • the afterloading application module installed in the irradiation room. Results: Remote afterloading allows simple, inexpensive and highly efficient radiation protection and work safety for the operating personnel The sources may be moved arbitrarily during treatment with a position accuracy of 0.5-1.0 mm within a distance of 520 cm from the source storage position in the strong room to the application position.

The material model is able to represent the main effects of shape memory alloys: the one-way shape memory effect, the two-way shape memory effect due to external loads, the pseudoelastic and pseudoplastic behaviour as well as the transition range between pseudoelasticity and pseudoplasticity. The material model is based on a free energy function and evolution equations for internal variables. By means of the free energy function, the energy storage during thermomechanical processes is described. Evolution equations for internal variables, e.g. the inelastic strain tensor or the fraction of martensite are formulated to represent the dissipative material behaviour. In order to distinguish between different deformation mechanisms, case distinctions are introduced into the evolution equations. Thermomechanical consistency is ensured in the sense that the constitutive model satisfies the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Finally, some numerical solutions of the constitutive equations for isothermal and non-isothermal strain and stress processes demonstrate that the various phenomena of the material behaviour are well represented. This applies for uniaxial processes and for non-proportional loadings as well. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We utilize the concept of gated-Ground (nMOS transistor inserted between ground line and SRAM cell) to achieve reduction in leakage energy without significantly affecting performance. Experimental results on gated-Ground caches show that data is retained (DRG-Cache) even if the memory is put in the standby mode of operation. Data is restored when the gated-Ground transistor is turned on. Turning off the gated-Ground transistor in turn gives large reduction in leakage power. This technique requires no extra circuitry; the row decoder itself can be used to control the gated-Ground transistor. The technique is applicable to data and instruction caches as well as different levels of cache hierarchy, such as the L1, L2, or L3 caches. We fabricated a test chip in TSMC 0.25-μm technology to show the data retention capability and the cell stability of DRG-Cache. Our simulation results on 100-nm and 70-nm processes (Berkeley Predictive Technology Model) show 16.5% and 27% reduction in consumed energy in L1 cache and 50% and 47% reduction in L2 cache, respectively, with less than 5% impact on execution time and within 4% increase in area overhead.","Gated-Ground; Low leakage cache; Low power; SRAM","Buffer storage; Computer simulation; Gates (transistor); MOSFET devices; Threshold voltage; Transistors; Gated-ground transistors; Integrated circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037321205

The authors examined the effectiveness of isoflurane in preserving mechanical function in hearts subjected to cardioplegic arrest and prolonged hypothermic no-flow storage. The role of isoflurane in altering myocardial glucose metabolism during storage and reperfusion during these conditions and the contribution of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel activation in mediating the functional and metabolic effects of isoflurane preconditioning was determined. Methods: Isolated working rat hearts were subjected to cardioplegic arrest with St. Thomas' II solution, hypothermic no-flow storage for 8 h, and subsequent aerobic reperfusion. The consequences of isoflurane treatment were assessed during the following conditions: (1) isoflurane exposure before and during storage; (2) brief isoflurane exposure during early non-working poststorage reperfusion; and (3) isoflurane preconditioning before storage. The selective mitochondrial and sarcolemmal KATP channel antagonists, 5-hydroxydecanoate and HMR 1098, respectively, were used to assess the role of KATP channel activation on glycogen consumption during storage in isoflurane-preconditioned hearts. Results: Isoflurane enhanced recovery of mechanical function if present before and during storage. Isoflurane preconditioning was also protective. Isoflurane reduced glycogen consumption during storage under the aforementioned circumstances. Storage of isoflurane-preconditioned hearts in the presence of 5-hydroxydecanoate prevented the reduction in glycogen consumption during storage and abolished the beneficial effect of isoflurane preconditioning on recovery of mechanical function. Conclusions: Isoflurane provides additive protection of hearts subject to cardioplegic arrest and prolonged hypothermic no-flow storage and favorably alters energy substrate metabolism by modulating glycolysis during ischemia. The effects of isoflurane preconditioning on glycolysis during hypothermic no-flow storage appears to be associated with activation of mitochondrial KATP channels.",,"5 hydroxydecanoic acid; adenosine triphosphate; clamikalant; isoflurane; potassium channel; glucose; glycogen; inhalation anesthetic agent; aerobic metabolism; anesthesia mechanism; animal tissue; article; cardioplegia; channel gating; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; energy metabolism; glucose metabolism; glycogenolysis; glycolysis; heart arrest; heart function; heart mitochondrion; heart muscle reperfusion; heart preservation; heart protection; hypothermia; isolated heart; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; animal; coronary artery blood flow; cryoanesthesia; drug effect; energy metabolism; heart; heart contraction; heart infarction prevention; heart muscle; in vitro study; laboratory diagnosis; metabolism; Sprague Dawley rat; Adenosine Triphosphate; Anesthetics, Inhalation; Animals; Coronary Circulation; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Glycogen; Heart; Hypothermia, Induced; Ischemic Preconditioning, Myocardial; Isoflurane; Male; Myocardial Contraction; Myocardium; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Specimen Handling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037318184

Institute, 1215 W. Cumberland Ave., Knoxville, TN 37996, United States","Dietary calcium plays a pivotal role in the regulation of energy metabolism. High-calcium diets attenuate adipocyte lipid accretion and weight gain during overconsumption of an energy-dense diet and increase lipolysis and preserve thermogenesis during caloric restriction, thereby markedly accelerating weight loss. Our studies of the agouti gene demonstrate a key role for intracellular Ca2+ in regulating adipocyte lipid metabolism and TG storage. Increased intracellular Ca2+ resulting in stimulation of lipogenic gene expression, and lipogenesis and suppression of lipolysis resulting in adipocyte lipid filling and increased adiposity. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that the increased calcitriol produced in response to low-calcium diets stimulates adipocyte Ca2+ influx and, consequently, promotes adiposity. Accordingly, suppressing calcitriol levels by increasing dietary calcium is an attractive target for obesity intervention. In support of this concept, transgenic mice expressing the agouti gene specifically in adipocytes (a human-like pattern) respond to low-calcium diets with accelerated weight gain and fat accretion, whereas high-calcium diets markedly inhibit lipogenesis, accelerate lipolysis, increase thermogenesis, and suppress fat accretion and weight gain in animals maintained at identical caloric intakes. Further, low-calcium diets impede body fat loss, whereas high-calcium diets markedly accelerate fat loss in transgenic mice subjected to caloric restriction. Dairy sources of calcium exert markedly greater effects in attenuating weight and fat gain and accelerating fat loss. This augmented effect of dairy products is likely due to additional bioactive compounds in dairy that act synergistically with calcium to attenuate adiposity. These concepts are confirmed by both epidemiological and clinical data, which demonstrate that increasing dietary calcium results in significant reductions in adipose tissue mass in obese humans in the absence of caloric restriction and markedly accelerates the weight and body fat loss secondary to caloric restriction, whereas dairy products exert significantly greater effects. These data indicate an important role for dairy products in both the prevention and treatment of obesity.",,"Calcium; Dairy products; Genes; Health care; Metabolism; Tissue; Lipolysis; Nutrition; agouti related protein; calcitriol; calcium ion; adipocyte; adipose tissue; body fat; calcium cell level; calcium transport; caloric intake; conference paper; dairy product; dietary intake; disease predisposition; gene expression; human; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; lipolysis; molecular biology; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; regulatory mechanism; thermogenesis; transgenic mouse; weight gain; weight reduction; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Calcitriol; Calcium, Dietary; Dairy Products; Humans; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Lipid Metabolism; Agouti; Animalia; Mus musculus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037316429

Methods: Experiments were conducted using a modified Lewis-Lewis heterotopic heart transplantation model, with a total ischemic time of 3 hours followed by 1 or 24 hours of blood reperfusion. Heart grafts were arrested using intra-aortic injection of CRMBM solution, either supplemented or not supplemented with 2 mmol/liter L-arginine (n = 12 in each group). We measured systolic indexes and simultaneously performed phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS). We quantified total endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein using the Western blot test of freeze-clamped hearts. Results: Contractility during early reperfusion was significantly better in grafts arrested with CRMBM solution enriched with L-arginine: mean rate pressure product, 11249 ± 1,548 vs 5,637 ± 1,118 mm Hg/min (p = 0.05), and maximal first derivative of the pressure signal (dP/dtmax), 1,721 ± 177 vs 1,214 ± 321 mm Hg/sec (p = 0.013). Conversely, during late reperfusion, contractility did not relate to the nature of the preservation solution. The presence of L-arginine in the CRMBM solution did not alter time-related variations of high-energy phosphate ratios measured using in vivo 31P MRS. The eNOS protein level decreased significantly during early compared with late reperfusion, with no effect caused by L-arginine. Conclusions: During early reperfusion, the limited myocardial stunning observed with CRMBM solution containing L-arginine does not relate to energy metabolism but to better preservation of the NO pathway.",,"arginine; cardioplegic agent; nitric oxide synthase; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cardioplegia; controlled study; cryopreservation; energy metabolism; heart muscle contractility; heart muscle ischemia; heart transplantation; high energy phosphate; male; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rat; stunned heart muscle; systole; Western blotting; Allopurinol; Animals; Arginine; Blotting, Western; Cardioplegic Solutions; Cold; Glutathione; Heart Arrest, Induced; Heart Transplantation; Myocardial Reperfusion; Myocardial Stunning; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Organ Preservation; Raffinose; Rats; Rats, Inbred Lew",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037314333

DAG cooking oils, with a 1,3 configuration, taste and have the texture of commonly used TAG cooking oils. Because they are not hydrolyzed to 2-MAG in the gut, the absorption and metabolism of DAG oil differs from that of TAG. Among the physiological differences are lower postprandial lipemia and an increased proportion of FA being oxidized instead of stored. Preliminary studies suggest that these differences in energy partitioning between DAG and TAG may be usefully exploited to reduce the amount of fat stored from cooking oil and oil components of food items.

Rats were fed a standard diet or an obesity-promoting diet for 3 weeks, with or without treatment with COOH, a nonthiazolidinedione PPAR-γ agonist. Treatment effects were essentially similar in both dietary cohorts. COOH did not affect weight gain, but increased SF (inguinal) fat mass twofold and reduced VF (retroperitoneal) accretion by half. Corresponding depot-specific alterations were observed in mRNA levels of the glucocorticoid-activating enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD-1) and the thermogenic modulator uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). COOH increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) weight and LPL availability by five- to eightfold. In rats refed standard diet after a 24-h fast, COOH reduced the insulin excursion by half. The agonist increased SF LPL activity and mRNA levels, but had no effect on VF LPL. The two- to threefold postprandial increase in plasma triglycerides (TGs) was abrogated in COOH-treated rats, likely in part because of increased LPL in SF and BAT. Thus PPAR-γ agonist treatment had a powerful, site-specific effect on adipose metabolism and lipid deposition, and greatly impacted the postprandial handling of TG-rich lipoproteins. These depot-specific effects may be mediated by differential regulation of key metabolic genes, including LPL, 11β-HSD-1, and UCP-1.",,"11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; lipoprotein lipase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; triacylglycerol; uncoupling protein 1; adipose tissue; adipose tissue cell; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; caloric intake; controlled study; enzyme activity; gene expression; gene expression regulation; hyperlipidemia; hypertriglyceridemia; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein expression; rat; RNA analysis; RNA isolation; triacylglycerol blood level; 11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Adipose Tissue; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Animals; Carrier Proteins; Diet; Dietary Fats; Dietary Sucrose; DNA Primers; Energy Intake; Gene Expression Regulation; Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Ion Channels; Lipids; Lipoprotein Lipase; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mitochondrial Proteins; Organ Size; Postprandial Period; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Thermogenesis; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037312845

The activation energy for hydrogen diffusion in pure enstatite was determined to be -295 (± 55) kJmol-1, and -213 (±47) kJmol-1 for orthopyroxene from Kilbourne Hole. Long-term hydration experiments did not lead to saturation in hydrogen. Instead, after an initial increase in hydrogen concentration, a slow but continuing decrease could be observed in all cases. It is suggested that the investigated samples lose their ability to store hydrogen even when heated in a hydrogen atmosphere. This loss in storage ability can itself be described by a diffusion equation, its diffusion coefficients being more than 1 order of magnitude slower than the diffusion of hydrogen.","Enstatite; Hydrogen diffusion; Infrared spectroscopy","Activation energy; Crystallography; Dehydration; Diffusion; Hydration; Storage abilities; Hydrogen; crystal chemistry; crystal structure; diffusion; enstatite; hydrogen; infrared spectroscopy; orthopyroxene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037308391

The temporal profiles of some spectral lines of the species, recorded by a SP305 spectrometer with a TEKTRONIX TDS3052 500 MHz storage oscilloscope, are investigated under the typical running conditions of the TEMP-II. The average standing time of the secondary plasma is evaluated from the 30 μs temporal profiles when the HIPIB has a energy density of 4 J/cm2 and a duration of 75 ns. The forming time of the secondary plasma is also about 30 μs, which equals to the average delay of the spectral emission pulses relative to the trigger pulse of the HIPIBs.","Diagnostics; High intensity pulsed ion beam; Optical emission spectroscopy; Secondary plasma",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037307883

To test whether in this syndrome insulin resistance is associated with abnormal muscle handling of fatty acids, 12 HIV-1 patients (8 females/4 males, age = 26 ± 2 yr, HIV duration = 8 ± 1 yr, body mass index = 22.0 ± 1.0 kg/m2, on protease inhibitors and nucleoside analog RT inhibitors) and 12 healthy subjects were studied. HIV-1 patients had a total body fat content (assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) similar to that of controls (22 ± 1 vs. 23 ± 2%; P = 0.56), with a topographic fat redistribution characterized by reduced fat content in the legs (18 ± 2 vs. 32 ± 3%; P &lt; 0.01) and increased fat content in the trunk (25 ± 2 vs. 19 ± 2%; P = 0.03). In HIV-positive patients, insulin sensitivity (assessed by QUICKI) was markedly impaired (0.341 ± 0.011 vs. 0.376 ± 0.007; P = 0.012). HIV-positive patients also had increased total plasma cholesterol (216 ± 20 vs. 174 ± 9 mg/dl; P = 0.05) and triglyceride (298 ± 96 vs. 87 ± 11 mg/dl; P = 0.03) concentrations.

Even if the basal metabolic rate (assessed by indirect calorimetry) was comparable to that of normal subjects, postabsorptive lipid oxidation was significantly impaired (0.30 ± 0.07 vs. 0.88 ± 0.09 mg·kg-1·min-1; P ± 0.01). In conclusion, lipodystrophy in HIV-1 patients in antiretroviral treatment is associated with intramuscular fat accumulation, which may mediate the development of the insulin resistance syndrome.","Human immunodeficiency virus","antiretrovirus agent; cholesterol; proteinase inhibitor; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; triacylglycerol; adult; article; basal metabolic rate; body fat; calorimetry; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; dyslipidemia; fatty acid oxidation; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; insulin resistance; lipid storage; lipodystrophy; male; muscle cell; muscle level; obesity; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; regression analysis; soleus muscle; tibialis anterior muscle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037303554

Due to operational difficulties, the reactor was permanently shut down in August 1989. Plans to ship the spent reactor fuel to Idaho were thwarted by the Governor of Idaho. The inability to ship the spent reactor fuel offsite necessitated the construction of an Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) in order to proceed with the decommissioning of the reactor. After loading the ISFSI, decommissioning of the reactor was initiated and successfully completed. At the same time, the site was repowered using natural gas. As part of a settlement with the owner of the reactor, the U.S. Department of Energy agreed to take title to the spent fuel in the ISFSI and obtain an NRC license for the facility. The license for the ISFSI was transferred to the DOE in June 1999. Day-to-day operations of the ISFSI are accomplished by the DOE's Maintenance and Operations contractor, Bechtel Babcock Wilcox Idaho (BBWI). BBWI also operates the Three Mile Island Unit 2 ISFSI in Idaho for the DOE. This paradigm for ISFSI operations has been highly successful and is expandable to additional ISFSIs that may come under the jurisdiction of the DOE.","Decontamination; Nuclear fuel cycle; Nuclear power plant; Operational topic","nuclear fuel; nuclear power plant; nuclear safety; nuclear waste; priority journal; radioactive waste disposal; radioactive waste storage; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037302236

The deviation from two, the g-factor anomaly, can be calculated with high precision in the Standard Model of particle physics. The g-factor anomaly can be measured with high precision by determining the rate at which the spin direction of high-energy muons circulating in a storage ring precesses. The Brookhaven National Laboratory g - 2 experiment (BNL g - 2 collaboration) has measured g - 2 to 1.3 ppm. The result is essentially in agreement with the Standard Model. The result puts interesting constraints on Standard Model extensions. Data under analysis will reduce the uncertainty to the order of 0.5 ppm. The precision timing techniques used in the g - 2 experiment are a central element of a new experiment to measure the lifetime of the positive muon. The goal of this experiment is to determine the lifetime to 1ppm, and the Fermi coupling constant to 0.5 ppm. The high statistics demand of this measurement is satisfied by one of the surface muon beams of the Paul Scherrer Institute. An artificial time structure is imposed on the continuous beam by an electrostatic kicker. The decay positrons are detected in a 180 element quasi-spherical detector. The effective counting rate is of the order of 1 MHz. The experiment is designed to control systematic errors to a level below 1 ppm. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The performance of four control strategies for ice storage systems is evaluated. The four control strategies investigated are chiller-priority and constant-proportion as conventional, instantaneous controls, while storage-priority and optimal control represent sophisticated controls employing load forecasting. Six parameters were investigated with respect to their influence on the ice storage system performance: Storage losses, utility rate structures, rate periods, penalty for icemaking, storage capacity, and the impact of load forecasting. Optimal control was determined to provide maximal operating cost savings. The storage-priority control yields operating costs only slightly higher than those of optimal control. Chiller-priority control realized savings that were typically on the order of 50% of what is theoretically possible (optimal control). Constant-proportion control proved to be a simple control strategy yielding higher savings than chiller-priority, yet lower than storage-priority control.",,"Computer simulation; Cooling; Electric loads; Energy utilization; Heat exchangers; Ice; Mathematical models; Optimal control systems; Thermal energy storage (TES) systems; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037300718

A lithium bromide/water (LiBr/H2O) solution is used both as a refrigerant and as a cold thermal storage material. The refrigerant, liquid water, is extracted from the LiBr/H2O strong solution during the off-peak period. The liquid water and LiBr/H2O weak solution, a byproduct of the refrigerant recovery process, are used during the on-peak period to cool the building. Building waste heat is pumped by the R-123 compressor to a higher temperature during the off-peak period and is used in the generator to recover the thermal storage by reprocessing the stored solution to a higher lithium bromide concentration. The storage volumetric efficiency and system COP are determined and compared to storage systems based on water/ice and liquid water. The storage volumetric efficiency is greater than a water/ice system and far exceeds the value for a liquid water system. The proposed system, which uses an external heat pump as a source of generator heat, is also compared to another LiBr/H2O system that uses a self-contained internal heat pump (the compressor operates independently from the chiller and uses the liberated water refrigerant as its working fluid). The system presented here outperforms both the water/ice system and the internal heat pump LiBr/H2O system but is unable to match the liquid water system COP. However, it has other well-defined advantages over the liquid water system and appears to be a competitive alternative to conventional TES systems.",,"Buildings; Compressors; Heat pump systems; Heat sinks; Lithium compounds; Refrigerants; Waste heat; Thermal storage volumes; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037299747

Preliminary experimental results from a prototype solar thermal metal hydride actuator, using copper-encapsulated porous metal hydride compacts of LaNi5, indicate that this thermal-mechanical system can produce high specific forces (over 100 (N/g)), with response times on the order of seconds. These operational characteristics, along with features such as being bio-mimetic, compact, operationally safe, lubricationless, noiseless, soft actuating, and environmentally benign, result in an actuator that is ideal for many industrial, space, defense, and biomedical applications. In this paper, we report recent work directed toward predicting and characterizing the performance bounds of the actuator, specifically concentrating on elements which might comprise an actuator driven by concentrated solar radiation. A complete solution of the 1-D governing heat and mass transfer equations with an ideally selective reactor surface are used to predict bounds on performance in terms of volume flow rates and realistic actuation times. The advantages and disadvantages of the design are discussed from this perspective.

Both improvements require a new heat transfer fluid that must have a very low vapor pressure at the hot operating temperature and combined with a high thermal stability, higher than 450° C. Further, the piping layout of trough plants dictates that the fluid not be allowed to freeze, which dictates the use of extensive insulation and heat tracing unless the fluid has a freezing point near 0°C.

Changes in peatland plant community composition in response to climate change may alter nutrient availability, energy budgets, trace gas fluxes, and carbon storage. We investigated plant community response to warming and drying in a field mesocosm experiment in northern Minnesota, USA. Large intact soil monoliths removed from a bog and a fen received three infrared warming treatments crossed with three water-table treatments (n = 3) for five years. Foliar cover of each species was estimated annually. In the bog, increases in soil temperature and decreases in water-table elevation increased cover of shrubs by 50% and decreased cover of graminoids by 50%. The response of shrubs to warming was distinctly species-specific, and ranged from increases (for Andromeda glaucophylla) to decreases (for Kalmia polifolia). In the fens, changes in plant cover were driven primarily by changes in water-table elevation, and responses were species- and lifeform-specific: Increases in water-table elevation increased cover of graminoids - in particular Carex lasiocarpa and Carex livida - as well as mosses. In contrast, decreases in water-table elevation increased cover of shrubs, in particular A. glaucophylla and Chamaedaphne calyculata. The differential and sometimes opposite response of species and lifeforms to the treatments suggest that the structure and function of both bog and fen plant communities will change - in different directions or at different magnitudes - in response to warming and/or changes in water-table elevation that may accompany regional or global climate change.","Climate change; Global warming; Peatlands; Plant cover; Soil warming; Species composition; Water-table; Wetlands","climate change; community composition; global warming; peatland; plant community; soil temperature; water table; United States; Andromeda; Andromeda polifolia var. glaucophylla; Bryophyta; Carex; Carex lasiocarpa; Carex livida; Chamaedaphne calyculata; Kalmia; Kalmia polifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037293576

Various ice storage systems, chiller compressors, and building types were analyzed under four different control strategies. Optimal control as the strategy that minimizes the total operating cost (demand and energy charges) served as a benchmark to assess the relative performance of three conventional controls (chiller-priority, constant-proportion, and storage-priority control) and to determine aspects in need of improvement in order to apply these conventional controls better and to enhance the cost saving potential of ice storage systems. Independent of the non-cooling electrical load profile, it was found that good efficiency of the cooling plant in the icemaking mode and rate structures with strong load-shifting incentives are prerequisites for making cool storage successful. Chillers with poor performance at subfreezing evaporator temperatures require significant on- to off-peak differentials in the energy and demand rates to yield substantial savings. The relative performance benefit of optimal control over conventional controls increases when rate-based load-shifting incentives are weak. With cooling-related electrical loads being large compared to non-cooling loads, all conventional controls improve their performance when slowly recharging during off-peak periods to contain off-peak demand. On-peak demand reduction of storage-priority is near-optimal for many cases. Guidelines are presented to improve the load-shifting performance of chiller-priority and constant-proportion control. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Both DC and transient test results are presented. The diodes were designed with a multi-step junction termination extension (MJTE) to improve the blocking voltage. The MJTE design allows full utilization of the superior breakdown properties of SiC. At 600 V, the highest forward current capability of a packaged MPS diode showed a current of 50 A at 2 V and 140 A at 4 V. At 1300 V, the current was 4 A at 2 V and 10 A at 4 V. In addition, the SiC MPS diode reverse voltage showed excellent suppression of the Schottky leakage current at temperatures up to 250 °C. The transient properties were measured with an inductively loaded half-bridge inverter circuit at high current and high temperatures (high-T). Results showed that the replacement of Si freewheeling diodes by SiC diodes results in far less storage charge in the diodes and substantial reduction in diode turn-off energy loss, especially at high-T. Switching measurements at currents up to 230 A compared a SiC MPS and a state-of-the-art Si diode; the MPS showed a 47% energy loss reduction at room temperature and 84% at 200 °C. The IGBT energy loss reduction, when using an MPS diode, was 15% at room temperature and 45% at 150 °C. The use of MPS diodes should result in improved efficiency when used in power electronics applications. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

One promising solution is shifting peak demand from early afternoon to night by utilizing natural cold energy resources such as cool outside air during night or running a refrigerator driven by midnight power. In these cases, using the thermal energy storage (TES) of phase change material (PCM) which has a melting point from 15 to 25 °C is one of the most effective ideas. However, few suitable PCMs for this temperature range are at present commercially available. This study aims to evaluate the potential of Mn(NO3)2 · 6H2O (manganese (II) nitrate hexahydrate) as a new PCM for the TES of cooling systems. First, experiments on the modulation of the melting point of Mn(NO3)2 · 6H2O and reduction of supercooling were made by dissolving small amounts of salts in the material. Consequently, MnCl2 · 4H2O was found to have good performance with regard to both modulation of the melting temperature and the heat of fusion. Next, a thermal response test was carried out by using a small cylindrical vessel. Results showed that the required temperature levels for charging and discharging the heat of this mixture were clarified.

In the case of an accident, an abrupt tank unsealing may release enormous quantity of evaporating gas and energy that has a destructive effect on the tank and its surroundings. In this paper, experiments with explosions of small LPG tanks are described. The data acquisition equipment applied in the tests provided a chance to learn dynamics of the process and determine hazard factors. The tests enabled a determination of temperature and pressure at which tanks containing LPG disrupt. The results enable a reconstruction of consecutive phases of the explosion and identification of hazards resulting from damage of the tanks. An explanation of the tank unsealing process with fluid parameters above critical point is given. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Yet such information is usually anecdotal rather than quantitative, and rarely compares perceptions among different alternatives methods. The concerns of individuals living in Santa Fe, NM, near the Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) were characterized. On an open-ended question, the public's greatest concerns were for contamination (35%), ecological health (16%), and human health (14%). When asked to rate their level of concern from a list of possible concerns, people rated accidents/ spills and storage of additional nuclear material the highest, and changes in property values the lowest. Unexpectedly, ethnicity, education, and income did not explain variations in ratings for most concerns about LANL. There was generally agreement between the concerns expressed on the ratings and on the open-ended question, although on the latter individuals expressed concern for larger issues, rather than specific issues.

Each molecule was derivatized with a benzyl alcohol linker for attachment to the Si surface via the formation of a Si-O bond. A complete protocol was developed for the preparation of stable Si(100) surfaces derivatized with the electroactive molecules. The redox-kinetic measurements were performed on the resulting Fc-BzOH and Por-BzOH monolayers to probe (1) the rate of electron transfer (k0) for oxidation in the presence of applied potentials and (2) the rate of charge dissipation after the applied potential is disconnected (in the form of a charge-retention half-life t1/2). The k0 values for the two types of monolayers were found to be similar to one another as were the t1/2 values. Perhaps more importantly, the electron-transfer rates for both the Fc-BzOH and the Por-BzOH monolayers differ from the charge-dissipation rates by ∼6 orders of magnitude and are strongly dependent on the surface concentration of the electroactive species. For the Por-BzOH monolayers on Si(100), the k0 and t1/2 values and their trends as a function of surface coverage were determined to be similar to those previously measured for the analogous thiol-derivatized molecule assembled on Au(111). In contrast, the Fc-BzOH monolayers on Si(100) were found to exhibit much slower electron-transfer and charge-dissipation rates than those in the corresponding thiol-Au(111) case. Two alternative hypotheses are advanced to explain both the diminution in rates with increased surface coverage and the contrasting behavior with the analogous thiols on Au, one based on space-charge effects at the monolayer-solution interface, and a second relying on changes in distance of the redox centers from the surface as modulated by the orientation of the linking chains. Collectively, the ability to prepare and study stable, electroactive molecular media on Si(100) is likely to be key in the development of hybrid molecular/semiconductor devices.",,"Charge transfer; Chemical bonds; Derivatives; Energy dissipation; Molecular orientation; Oxidation; Redox reactions; Silicon; Monolayers; silicon derivative; article; electricity; electron transport; measurement; molecular interaction; molecular stability; oxidation reduction reaction; reaction analysis; semiconductor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037438877

In addition, the effects of the future reductions in the total amounts of exhaust gas emissions, as a result of stricter emission regulations for transport and off-road equipment, were studied. A model was developed and used for the calculations. Input data were collected from a plant situated some 100 km from Stockholm in Sweden. Biofuels used by the plant include chips from limbs and tops, by-products from sawmills and chips from willow energy plantations. The results show that residues from sawmills are very favourable in terms of the studied environmental parameters. Air emissions from limbs and tops is 5-8 times greater than that from sawmills. The use of a terminal for temporary storage means that additional transport and loading operations are necessary which result in a 30% increase in air emissions. The most important effects of the stricter emission regulations are that emissions of nitrous oxides (NOx) caused by the supply system will decrease by up to 70% within 10 years and that the unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions will decrease by 30-35%. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Research and development are, however, still essential for further improvement of the energy density and cycling life. Recently, vanadium-based solid solution hydrogen storage alloys have been considered as promising candidates for negative electrode materials because of their higher reversible hydrogen storage capacities. However, for the practical use of V-based alloy as a negative electrode, it is necessary to improve both the electrocatalytic activity and cyclic durability in alkaline solution. As a novel method for changing the surface properties of an alloy electrode to obtain a higher electro-catalytic activity, we have employed the ball-milling process with Ni powder without deterioration of the alloy bulk properties. In order to overcome the poor cyclic durability of V-Ti alloy, elemental Cr, which forms a protective oxide layer against corrosion in alkaline solution, was partially substituted for V. Through systematic experimentation, a V0.68Ti0.20Cr0.12 alloy electrode ball-milled with Ni powder was found to have an advanced discharge capacity of 420 mAh/g and a good cycle life (80% after 200 cycles). For further promotion of the surface catalytic activity, instead of normal Ni powder (spherical Ni powder), filamentary Ni with a larger specific surface was used as a new surface modifier. Under optimum ball-milling conditions (7 wt% filamentary Ni for 25 min), V0.68Ti0.20Cr0.12 alloy was effectively coated with Ni particles and showed an increased discharge capacity of 460 mAh/g. © Elsevier Science B.V.

The LiMn0.7M0.3O2 (M=Cr, Zn, Mg, V) forms in the hexagonal structure, while the LiMn0.7M0.3O2 (M=Co, Ti, Mo) shows an orthorhombic structure. The LiMn0.7M0.3O2 compounds have less crystal distortion compared with o(orthorhombic)-LiMnO2. All substituted materials cycled between 4.4 and 2 V in Li cells show higher stability of capacity compared with the standard o-LiMnO2.

Neuronal ATP secretion is quantal and calcium-dependent, but it has been suggested that ATP release from astrocytes may not be vesicular. Here we report that, besides the described basal ATP release facilitated by exposure to calcium-free medium, astrocytes release purine under conditions of elevated calcium. The evoked release was not affected by the gap-junction blockers anandamide and flufenamic acid, thus excluding purine efflux through connexin hemichannels. Sucrose-gradient analysis revealed that a fraction of ATP is stored in secretory granules, where it is accumulated down an electrochemical proton gradient sensitive to the v-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1. ATP release was partially sensitive to tetanus neurotoxin, whereas glutamate release from the same intoxicated astrocytes was almost completely impaired. Finally, the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, which strongly evokes glutamate release, was only slightly effective in promoting purine secretion. These data indicate that astrocytes concentrate ATP in granules and may release it via a regulated secretion pathway. They also suggest that ATP-storing vesicles may be distinct from glutamate-containing vesicles, thus opening up the possibility that their exocytosis is regulated differently.",,"Calcium; Energy storage; Protons; Sugar (sucrose); Astrocytes; Biochemistry; adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor; adenosine triphosphate; anandamide; bafilomycin A1; calcium; flufenamic acid; glutamic acid; metabotropic receptor; neurotoxin; purine; tetanus toxin; adenosine triphosphate; antiinfective agent; glutamic acid; macrolide; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; tetanus toxin; animal cell; article; astrocyte; cell culture; cell function; controlled study; electrochemical analysis; embryo; exocytosis; gap junction; nerve cell; nonhuman; priority journal; purine metabolism; purine synthesis; rat; secretory granule; animal; metabolism; secretion; Animalia; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Astrocytes; Cells, Cultured; Glutamic Acid; Macrolides; Rats; Tetanus Toxin; Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037428452

This fact suggests the use of diamond as storage medium for ultraviolet images.

The weak values of the gamma ray fluxes from sources in space made difficult the geophysical applications of this concept. However, recent investigations have shown that taking into consideration the real variations of the energy spectrum of space gamma rays may increase significantly the impact of the weak stratosphere currents on the parameters of the global atmosphere-ionosphere electric circuit. Earlier, this theoretical model has been used as a possible basis of the direct driven mechanism of development of the large-scale geomagnetic oscillations during solar gamma flares. This paper emphasizes the storage-release aspect of the stratosphere currents occurring in the light of the corresponding electric field generation and discusses the probability of electric breakdown at the sub-ionosphere altitudes.",,"Electric currents; Electric fields; Electrons; Gamma rays; Oscillations; Probability; Solar radiation; Upper atmosphere; Solar flares; Electric discharges",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037422641

Under anaerobic conditions GAO hydrolyse glycogen to gain energy and reducing equivalents to take up VFA and to synthesise polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). In the subsequent aerobic stage, PHA is being oxidised to gain energy for glycogen replenishment (from PHA) and for cell growth. This article describes a complete anaerobic and aerobic model for GAO based on the understanding of their metabolic pathways. The anaerobic model has been developed and reported previously, while the aerobic metabolic model was developed in this study. It is based on the assumption that acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA go through the catabolic and anabolic processes independently. Experimental validation shows that the integrated model can predict the anaerobic and aerobic results very well. It was found in this study that at pH 7 the maximum acetate uptake rate of GAO was slower than that reported for PAO in the anaerobic stage. On the other hand, the net biomass production per C-mol acetate added is about 9% higher for GAO than for PAO. This would indicate that PAO and GAO each have certain competitive advantages during different parts of the anaerobic/aerobic process cycle. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","EBPR; Glycogen accumulating organism (GAO); Growth yield; Metabolic model; Stoichiometry; TOGA","Biomass; Biomedical engineering; Growth kinetics; Metabolism; pH effects; Glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAO); Intracellular storage; Biotechnology; acetyl coenzyme A; glycogen; polyphosphate; propionyl coenzyme A; aerobic metabolism; anaerobic metabolism; article; batch reactor; biomass; biosynthesis; catabolism; cell growth; glycogen accumulating organism; glycogen metabolism; hydrolysis; microorganism; pH; polyphosphate accumulating organism; sludge; validation process; waste water management; Acyl Coenzyme A; Aerobiosis; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Glycogen; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0013218367

PPARα regulates fatty acid oxidation primarily in liver and to a lesser extent in adipose tissue, whereas PPARγ serves as a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage. Of the two PPARγ isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 generated by alternative splicing, PPARγ1 isoform is expressed in liver and other tissues, whereas PPARγ2 isoform is expressed exclusively in adipose tissue where it regulates adipogenesis and lipogenesis. Since the function of PPARγ1 in liver is not clear, we have, in this study, investigated the biological impact of overexpression of PPARγ1 in mouse liver. Adenovirus-PPARγ1 injected into the tail vein induced hepatic steatosis in PPARα-/- mice. Northern blotting and gene expression profiling results showed that adipocyte-specific genes and lipogenesis-related genes are highly induced in PPARα-/- livers with PPARγ1 over-expression. These include adipsin, adiponectin, aP2, caveolin-1, fasting-induced adipose factor, fat-specific gene 27 (FSP27), CD36, Δ9 desaturase, and malic enzyme among others, implying adipogenic transformation of hepatocytes. Of interest is that hepatic steatosis per se, induced either by feeding a diet deficient in choline or developing in fasted PPARα-/- mice, failed to induce the expression of these PPARγ-regulated adipogenesis-related genes in steatotic liver. These results suggest that a high level of PPARγ in mouse liver is sufficient for the induction of adipogenic transformation of hepatocytes with adipose tissue-specific gene expression and lipid accumulation. We conclude that excess PPARγ activity can lead to the development of a novel type of adipogenic hepatic steatosis.",,"Enzymes; Fatty acids; Lipids; Oxidation; Tissue; Adipogenic steatosis; Genes; acyl coenzyme A desaturase; adiponectin; adipsin; caveolin 1; CD36 antigen; malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating); peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 1; unclassified drug; Adenovirus; adipocyte; adipocyte specific gene; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cell transformation; controlled study; fatty liver; gene; gene expression; gene function; lipid storage; lipogenesis; liver; liver cell; mouse; nonhuman; Northern blotting; nutritional deficiency; priority journal; protein expression; steatosis; tail; Adipocytes; Animals; Carrier Proteins; Diet; Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins; Fatty Liver; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Transfer Techniques; Liver; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Molecular Sequence Data; Neoplasm Proteins; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Protein Isoforms; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Starvation; Transcription Factors; Up-Regulation; Adenoviridae; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346003777

The oxides are introduced and controlled via HNO3 treatment followed by thermal treatment at different temperatures within 150-900°C. The impedance spectra showed that the overall resistance mainly came from the fiber contact resistance, which was an increasing function of oxide number, while the overall capacitance was contributed by the interface inside micropores. Oxidation enhanced the specific capacitance of the electrodes, but it was found that a thermal treatment temperature of 450°C gave the highest capacitance. Constant phase element (CPE) analysis of the capacitive behavior showed insignificant deviation from ideality, indicating the low resistance in the carbon micropores as well as the domination of the double layer mechanism in energy storage. Thus, the capacitance increase from oxidation resulted mainly from the double layer mechanism as well. The deviation from ideality was more obvious for lower temperature treated electrodes, indicating that the surface oxides that desorb as CO2 upon heat treatment may enhance formation of aggregates to retard the charge process, while the surface oxides that desorb as CO are responsible for the promotion of the double layer capacitance. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

One of the major technical challenges for automotive application is the system response during rapid variations of operative conditions, which is one of the most significant elements concurring in determining the vehicle drivability (i.e. the power train capability to allow rapid transient phenomena). The power train response under transient conditions depends on the combined action of all the system components performances. This behaviour is still more complicated when hydrogen has to be produced on board and the reformer response has to be taken into account. In this paper the performances of PEMFC based energy production systems for automotive applications is analysed by means of a simulation model able to describe the performance of all the system components from the on board energy storage to the road load. Different fuel storage/production solutions are analysed and their performances are compared (methanol steam reformer, methane auto thermal reformer and ammonia reformer). To increase results significance, comparison are made with respect to the European Urban Cycle (ECE+EUDC) and to this aim a simple model of vehicle dynamics has been also developed. Model predictions have proved to be able to simulate system behaviour and could be used to design system characteristics as well to define its control system.

With the flow data a transient CFD simulation is run, and outputs such as brick temperature distribution, mat temperature distribution and shell temperature distribution are predicted. Orthotropic properties of the substrate, temperature dependent mat properties, natural convection and radiation are accounted for in the numerical model. A transient conjugate heat transfer model is implemented where the momentum and energy equations for both solids and fluids are coupled. From the transient temperature distribution of brick, shell and mat, a thermo-mechanical analysis was performed for the converter during the engine cycle, and the converter durability parameter thermal shock was studied. The results indicate that a full converter assembly approach is necessary since the type of insulation, exhaust-seals and shell material significantly affect this parameter. It is also observed from prediction that the thermal shock is not constant over the length of the catalyst but is seen to decrease along its length till the mid-bed and then predicted to rise proportionally to the exothermic catalytic reactions. To support this study correlations between experimental and computational data are presented and discussed.

However, the combined problems of on-board Hydrogen storage and the lack of Hydrogen infrastructure represent major impediments to their wide scale adoption as replacements for IC engine vehicles. On board fuel processors that generate hydrogen from on-board liquid methanol (and other hydrocarbons) have been proposed as possible alternative sources of Hydrogen needed by the fuel cell. This paper focuses on a methanol fuel processor using steam reformation of methanol to generate the Hydrogen required for the fuel cell stack. Since the steam reformation is an endothermic process the thermal energy required is supplied by a catalytic burner. Though a number of different designs for this type of fuel processor have been investigated, the general class of compact fuel processors characterized by close thermal integration of the burner and the reformer show the greatest promise for fuel cell vehicle applications. Through the use of a model for the fuel processor, comprising of detailed models for the reformer, burner and CO cleanup units, we investigate the performance of the fuel processor from the viewpoints of efficiency and transient performance. In particular, the model can generate results in terms of a) steady state efficiencies b) response to transient step inputs c) Efficiency and dynamics in the context of its use in a fuel cell vehicle under standard driving cycles. Our results illustrate the complex nature of the interaction between the fuel processor, the fuel cell stack and auxiliaries and the vehicle subsystem. In particular, they highlight a) the impact of fuel processor response times, b) the impact of control strategies, c) fuel processor-stack interactions, all, in the context of the ability of the vehicle to meet both the driving cycle and achieve high efficiencies. The results also suggest that steady state fuel processor efficiencies would not be very accurate predictors of fuel processor performance in an overall fuel cell vehicle.

This hybrid vehicle is part of an ongoing collaboration between the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI, Switzerland), the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETHZ), and several industrial partners. It is equipped with a fuel cell system with a nominal power of 48 kW and with supercapacitors that have a storage capacity of 360 Wh. Extensive tests have been performed on a dynamometer and on the road to investigate the operating ability.

The choice of a fuel for FCVs must consider several critical issues, including the availability of a distribution and storage infrastructure, manufacturing cost and capital requirements,energy efficiency, and performance. Gasoline, one of the candidate fuels, is noteworthy not only for its existing infrastructure, but because it has the possibility of usage for both FCVs and conventional internal combustion engines. Gasoline consists of different types of hydrocarbons, including paraffins, naphthens, olefins and aromatics - - with carbon numbers distributed over a wide range. Gasoline also contains a variety of sulfur compounds and selected additives in small amounts., In some cases gasoline also contains oxygenates such as MTBE and ethanol. To develop the optimal fuels and associated catalysts for FCVs it is necessary to understand the effects of these constituents on FCV fuel processing. Reforming performance has been evaluated with a variety of gasoline components, as well as conventional gasoline provided by refineries. Tests of initial reformer catalyst activity and durability at auto-thermal reforming (ATR) conditions have been conducted. Results showed similar reforming performance among most hydrocarbon components except aromatics. The addition of MTBE improved reforming reactivity. Both aromatics and sulfur compounds caused rapid deterioration of reforming activity, while the magnitude of the reactivity loss varied between different aromatic compounds.

In this paper the characteristics of driving cycles are studied to determine those factors which have the strongest influence on fuel economy for hybrids. The data show that the number of stopping events in a route or cycle is a strong influence as is the average vehicle speed.

At the same time the popularity of sport utility vehicles and light trucks has made it more difficult to achieve CAFE objectives. In order to accommodate both public vehicle preference and government mandated CAFE requirements automobile manufacturers are seeking all available means to increase fuel economy through advanced system design, engineered materials, and improved lubricant technology. Axle lubricants can have a significant impact on fuel economy; moreover, axle lubricants can be tailored to deliver maximum operating efficiency over either specific or wide ranges of operating conditions. With the proper lubricant technology, improvements can be realized under both the normal city-highway driving conditions typically associated with passenger cars and under more highly loaded conditions often encountered in light truck operation. Historically, axle lubricants have been assessed for energy efficiency in a variety of full scale vehicle methods including over-the-road fleets, track testing and chassis dynamometers [1, 2, 3, 4]. Although real world in nature, these methods are subject to many variables which are difficult to control and thus obtaining accurate and repeatable efficiency estimates can be problematic. In order to increase the level of confidence in axle efficiency measurements, a full-scale light duty axle test was developed which appears to be an accurate predictor for the Federal Test Procedure 75 (FTP-75) cycle used for new vehicle qualification by the USA Environmental Protection Agency [5]. This method simulates the FTP-75 cycle by performing a series of steady-state speed-load conditions on a laboratory axle stand without axle sump temperature control. The test was developed using specific speed/load conditions from the actual FTP-75 testing.

Hydrogen, as a clean and sustainable fuel, offers a high implementation potential and can be used both in internal combustion engines and in fuel cells. In urban deployment the fuel cell drive has specific advantages and is suitable for use in city buses. Integration of high-power energy storage systems improves fuel consumption and can reduce the costs of the drive system. In May 2000 MAN presented its first fuel cell bus, which was successfully deployed in passenger transport in various cities, The next FC-bus, using hybrid fuel cell propulsion, is planned under the framework of the Bavarian hydrogen project at Munich Airport and will be tested from spring 2004 on. The first deployment of pre-series bus fleets with fuel cells using hydrogen as fuel can be expected from the end of this decade onwards.","City Bus; Efficiency; Electrical Storage Systems; Hybrid Propulsion; Hydrogen; Hydrogen-ICE; PEM-Fuel Cell","Costs; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Exhaust gases; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Hydrogen; Internal combustion engines; Nitrogen oxides; Vehicles; City bus; Electrical storage systems; Hybrid propulsion; Hydrogen-ICE; PEM-fuel cells; Fuel cells",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047698875

The envelopes of the transmitted and reflected fields can adiabatically follow the incident pulse with only a small delay that originates from energy storage.

The loss of intensity can be understood in terms of the dependence of absorption on the intensity of the probe.

At the same time, it is the simplest triatomic ion and for this reason its theoretical description can serve as a prototype for other polyatomic ions. Meanwhile, experimental determinations of the recombination rate have varied widely, which has resulted in some controversy and confusion. Until recently, it seemed unlikely that this problem could be resolved by theoretical studies because the mechanism of [Formula Presented] dissociative recombination remained unclear. A recent study, however [Kokoouline et al., Nature (London) 412, 891 (2001)], provided evidence that the inclusion of the Jahn-Teller coupling can produce a dissociative recombination rate that overlaps the range of experimental observations. Here, we propose a theoretical description of the coupling between nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in a polyatomic molecule, which describes the competition between autoionization and predissociation of the Rydberg states formed after an incident electron is captured. The method treats the vibrational and rotational excitations of the ion, accounts for all symmetry restrictions imposed by the geometry of the molecule, including vibrational, rotational, and electronic and nuclear-spin symmetries. The framework combines the multichannel quantum-defect theory, the adiabatic hyperspherical approach, and the techniques of outgoing-wave Siegert pseudostates. The proposed method can be applied to studies of dissociative recombination of other triatomic ions, including all the degrees of freedom quantum mechanically. Our calculations of the cross section and the recombination rate confirm that the Jahn-Teller effect is responsible for the large rate in [Formula Presented] Theoretical results for dissociative recombination of [Formula Presented] are in agreement with storage-ring experiments. © 2003 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037232278

Therefore, latent heat storage technology has possibility to be used to reduce thermal load change of heat utilization system connected to HTGR (High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor), which can improve reliability of the system including the reactor. This paper treated heat transfer characteristics of heat storage annular pipe as a simulation of heat exchanger pipe. Time dependent wall and gas temperatures and radial position of liquid solid boundary were studied by numerical and approximate analysis with thermal conductivity of phase change material (PCM) as a parameter. The analytical results were applied to estimate the possibility of the latent heat storage technique to reduce thermal load change for two heat utilization systems with 10 MW connected to HTGR. When temperature difference of 100 K from normal operation temperature occurred, a thermal load absorber with volume of about 15 m3 can reduce 100 K within 5 K for three hours, which would be sufficient for operators to recognize the accident and to treat adequately. Therefore, latent heat storage technology has possibihty for the apphcation to thermal load absorber. © 2003, Atomic Energy Society of Japan.

Since memory systems consume a significant amount of energy to store and to forward data, it is then imperative to balance power consumption and performance in memory system design. Contemporary system design focuses on the trade-off between performance and energy consumption in processing and storage units, as well as in their interconnections. Although memory design is as important as processor design in achieving the desired design objectives, the former topic has received less attention than the latter in the literature.

The ACC-CAES has a potential advantage of high efficiency and high capacity factor over other energy storage. However, advantages of it from the viewpoints of power system operation are not fully revealed because of its peculiar operation characteristics compared with the other energy storage. The characteristics include (1) it requires fossil fuel even in the case of operation using stored compressed air and (2) it has an ACC generating mode as one of its generating states to be used as a conventional ACC generating system while detaching the air storage system. Therefore, it is necessary to examine operation patterns of the ACC-CAES and its contribution to economic operation of a power system. In order to achieve the objective, operation simulations of a power system with ACC-CAES generating systems are needed because operation of energy storage systems such as the ACC-CAES must be studied through an operation scheduling of a power system. This paper develops an optimal daily scheduling method of a power system with both ACC-CAES generating systems and pumped hydro storage systems using two-dimensional dynamic programming. Sensitivity analyses are undertaken with the developed method; the results show that ACC-CAES generating systems tend to be operated as a peak or intermediate power source that bears some similarities to thermal plants or storage systems and, from an operation point of view, they have an economic advantage over pumped hydro storage systems. © 2003, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

The architecture consists of a new concept and a historical technology. That is network of many “electric power clusters” with DC interface. The cluster includes dispersed electric power generations, electric appliances, electric storage and “electric power router”. The router is equipment to resourcefully route electrical energy between such neighboring clusters and to manage electrical energy in the cluster. The transactions of electrical energy (inter clusters and/or intra cluster) and electric generations from renewal energy sources (like sun shine, wind, tide and bio gas) are intermittent and have very wide dynamic range, so, the interface must be by DC. When we achieve the energy society with the architecture, we will be able to reduce energy consumption, greenhouse gas and materials. © 2003, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Because of being installed in the power conversion vessel which is primary pressure boundary and exposed to primary coolant contaminated with fission products, unique methods and procedures which are different from those for existing power plants and High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR) are needed for especially the gas turbine and the compressor. The gas turbine-compressor assembly is pulled out from the power conversion vessel by a special trolley after generator vessel section is separated. Then, the gas turbine-compressor assembly is lifted and carried to a maintenance facility by a building overhead crane. During the removal process, preventive measures to reduce the exposure are taken by limiting working time and bagging the assembly to keep fission products from scattering. Before casings are open, the gas turbine-compressor assembly shall be in storage for a certain period to reduce the dose rate. In order to achieve a high plant availability, a spare gas turbine-compressor assembly is installed as an alternative to the assembly cooled in the storage. It was confirmed that, by applying those proposed methods and procedures, it is possible to keep the plant availability more than 90%.

Important applications of this work include the studies of the charged particle dynamics in a storage ring with various insertion devices, superconducting magnets, large aperture magnets with significant fringe fields, and solenoid magnets in the interaction region.

This canister was designed to be loaded with U.S. Department of Energy spent nuclear fuel and then used for interim storage, transportation to the nation's repository, and final disposal at the repository. The design required a high degree of confidence against failure if the canister were subjected to loads (e.g., accidental drop events) resulting in large plastic deformations and high strains. Significant testing of the canister clearly demonstrates that it can safely achieve the intended design goals without failure. The canister skirt and its attachment to the containment boundary are the key engineered elements of the design that allow significant impact damage without failure of the containment. A combination of analytical techniques and physical testing was used to develop and demonstrate the viability of the design. Finite element modeling coupled with scaled drop tests established the design prototype. To validate the design concept, nine full-scale test canisters were fabricated and dropped from various heights and orientations. The nine test canisters experienced varying degrees of damage to their skirts, lifting rings, and containment boundary components. However, all of the tested canisters maintained the containment boundary as evidenced through the results of pressure and selective helium leak testing. Pre- and post-drop finite element analyses were also performed. The analytical results provide accurate predictions of canister responses to the drop tests. The results achieved for the canister can also be applicable to other well-designed containers (canisters, casks, cans, vessels, etc.) subjected to similar loads. Properly designed containers can maintain containment after experiencing dynamically induced high strains, and computer analyses can accurately predict the response of these containers to dynamic loads. © ASM International.","Accidental drop; Containment; Impact; Plastic deformation; Spent fuel; Strain rate","Containers; Drops; Dynamic loads; Failure (mechanical); Fuel storage; Nuclear fuels; Plastic deformation; Spent fuels; Strain rate; Accidental drops; Boundary components; Containment; Degree of confidence; Helium leak testing; Impact; Large plastic deformation; U.S. Department of Energy; Finite element method",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889049794

In this study, the performance of CO2 treatment as a means of preventing CaCO3 scaling in heat exchangers was evaluated.

The rural areas in developing countries have no access to safe and reliable drinking water supplies. Conventional methods for disinfecting drinking water, including boiling and adding chlorine compounds can be time consuming and expensive. Hence a reliable, low cost and sustainable water treatment is much required especially for the domestic purpose in rural areas. The solar disinfection of water (SODIS) is a simple and low cost treatment process based on locally available resources (sunlight and plastic bottles). The feasibility studies on 'SODIS' were carried out at Centre for Environmental Studies, Anna University, Chennai. Total coliform counts before and after disinfection of water samples were determined using the membrane filter technique as detailed in APHA (1995). Aluminium foil reflector and agitation improved disinfection efficiency. Total inactivation of coliforms was achieved within 8 hr, when the turbidity was up to 100 NTU. No regrowth of coliform colonies was observed in SODIS storage water after 24 and 48 hr for all water samples having turbidity less than 50 NTU. This feasibility study has proved that SODIS could be a practical and sustainable technology for rural communities living in tropical countries, like India.","Coliform inactivation; SODIS; Solar disinfection; Solar UV radiation; Water treatment","drinking water; agitation; aluminum foil; article; bacterial count; bacterial growth; bacterial transmission; bacterium colony; biosafety; chlorination; coliform bacterium; cost; developing country; disinfection; feasibility study; heat treatment; infection control; infection prevention; nonhuman; plastic bottle; prophylaxis; reliability; rural area; solar disinfection; solar energy; solar radiation; sunlight; time; tropics; turbidity; virus transmission; water management; water supply; water treatment; Anna; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4744363590

PHAs are considered for various technical applications due to interesting physical and material properties. In order to establish economically feasible biotechnological production systems and to obtain PHAs from cheap carbon sources with a preference from renewable resources, CO2 or residual materials, efforts are undertaken to engineer novel pathways in recombinant prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. This requires transfer of a PHA synthase structural gene, expression of an enzymatically active PHA synthase protein and in particular engineering of pathways that provide this key enzyme of PHA synthesis with suitable substrates at sufficient concentrations. Only if all three aspects are well considered, a functional active PHA biosynthesis pathway will be expressed allowing PHA biosynthesis from central intermediates and therefore biotechnological production from renewable carbon sources or even CO2.

This energy imbalance is an essential issue for the flux measurement. In this study, we evaluated heat storage flux and investigated its effect on energy balance in a larch plantation developing on a flat terrain. Above-ground biomass was the largest component producing the heat storage flux of the forest ecosystem; about 70-80% of the heat storage flux was generated in above-ground biomass for summer and fall. Moreover, the heat storage flux of topsoil over heat plates had a considerable bearing on the evaluation of soil heat flux. Adding these heat storage fluxes improved energy balance by 6-10%; it increased the slope of the ordinary least square between eddy energy fluxes and available energy, which was used as an index of energy balance closure, from 0.83 to 0.88 in summer and from 0.93 to 1.03 in fall. This suggests that we have to measure and consider heat storage flux when we investigate the energy balance of forest ecosystems. © 2003, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

Two application studies are described demonstrating various ways of integration of the flow models with the stress models. The first study describes one-directional coupling, in which the stress evolution depends on the pressure evolution, but not vice versa. This approach, generally suitable to model flow-driven stress changes, was used to study the relationship between reservoir depletion and possible fault reactivation, which causes induced microseismicity in the study area. The second case study describes two-directional coupling between the flow model and the stress model, which is an appropriate way to model load-driven flow in the subsurface. A fully coupled flow-stress analysis was conducted to analyse combined load- and hydraulic-driven groundwater flow for safety assessment of a geological disposal site. Presented cases demonstrate that increasingly complex coupled flow-stress modelling, with conventional modelling tools, has become feasible in engineering practice. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Assuming a simple constant output operation of PEFC, we calculated the composition of hot-water supply from PEFC and backup boiler. When μCGS is equipped with 100L hot-water storage tank, many portions of hot-water output of the PEFC were wasted although the backup boiler must assist to meet the demand concentrated within a short period. Annually, about 88% of the hot-water demand was met by the PEFC and the rest 12% was met by the backup boiler. Even in this case, the primary energy consumption was small as compared to the conventional energy system, because the electricity output from the PEFC could be fully utilized in the household or grid. However, because of a relatively higher price of city gas, the variable energy cost in μCGS was higher than that in the conventional system in the summer season. When the unit cost of PEFC is reduced to about 120,000 yen/kWe by a mass production, the annual cost on μCGS could be small relative to the conventional system. © 2003, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Several kAs pulse current was supplied from 8.28 µF storage capacitor to the 50 µm thickness titanium foil which was sandwiched between the Al2O3 tiles with pressure of 8.3 MPa. The temperature of the foil was rapidly increased owing to ohmic heating with the large current, and then the foil was liquefied and vaporized. The Al2O3 tiles were successfully bonded when the input energy to the titanium foil was higher than the energy required for the foil vaporization. The bonding strength increases with increasing the energy input to the foil. However, the foil explosion cracked the tiles when the input energy exceeds a critical value. Increasing the circuit inductance from 1.13 µH to 64.8 µH, the critical energy of tile cracking increase from 160 J to 507 J, respectively. the maximum bonding strength of 330 kg was obtained when the circuit inductance was 21.8 µH.

But the contribution of these electrical charges to the friction and wear behaviour is usually neglected in the energetical balance. Based on published results and on our own experimental results on the ability of the insulating material on trapping charges, we show in this study that the interaction energy during friction depends markedly on these trapped charges which induce moreover long distance effects. Consequently, on the particular case of microdevices for which the surface area to volume ratio is large and the external pressure is low, such effects can act markedly upon both friction coefficient evolution and wear resistance by storage and release of polarisation energy in the whole tribosystem. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

To estimate carbon stored in roots and above-ground portions of trees, data was collected consisting of whole tree sampling of Amelanchier, Malus, Pyrus, and Syringa cultivars. Roots were excavated using an Air-Spade™. Regression analysis resulted in two equations for predicting total carbon storage based on height and diameter of trees up to 20 cm dbh: Y = 0.05836 (dbh2) for root carbon storage, and Y = 0.0305 (dbh2 × h)0.9499 for above-ground carbon storage, explaining 97% and 96% of the variation, respectively. Average carbon stored in roots of various cultivars ranged from 0.3 to 1.0 kg for smaller trees, those 3.8 to 6.4 cm dbh, to more than 10.4 kg for trees 14.0 cm to 19.7 cm dbh. Average total carbon stored by cultivars ranged from 1.7 to 3.6 kg for trees less than 6.4 cm dbh to 54.5 kg for trees larger than 14.0 cm. The data from these equations apply mainly to trees in nurseries and recently transplanted trees.

A 256-bit phase-change memory array based on chalcogenide materials was reported in 1970. Recent advances in phase change materials, memory device designs, and process technology have resulted in significant advances in phase change device performance, and a new memory device, called Ovonic Unified Memory (OUM), has been developed. This paper will discuss various device and materials characteristics of OUM phase change memory materials of interest in applications for nonvolatile high-density memories. These materials are generally Te chalcogenide based, exploiting the congruent crystallization of the FCC phase and the associated reduction in resistivity that results from crystallization from the quenched amorphous state. Data storage is a thermally initiated, rapid, reversible structural phase change in the film. While rewriteable DVD disks employ laser heat to induce the phase change and modulate reflectivity, OUM technology uses a short electrical current pulse to modulate resistivity. The device geometry and thermal environment dictate the power and energy required for memory state programming. We will review the device structure, characterization data, device performance, and reliability as well as device modeling results. Characteristics of key material and device performance metrics such as crystallization and amorphization programming speed will be presented. Programming algorithms will be discussed for optimizing operating margin for high-density applications. Data retention characteristics will be reviewed along with means for accelerated statistical evaluation. Potential high-density memory array data disturb issues will be identified, and their impact on scalability will be assessed.

Gasification of coal produces a synthesis gas that can be converted to liquid fuel by synthesis over appropriate catalysts. Recycling of unconverted synthesis gas back to the synthesis reactor enables a larger fraction of the coal energy to be converted to liquid fuel. Passing synthesis gas once over the synthesis catalyst, with unconverted synthesis gas used to generate electricity in a gas turbine combined cycle, leads to less liquid fuel production, but provides for a significant second revenue stream from sale of electricity. Recently-developed liquid-phase synthesis reactors are especially attractive for ""once-through"" processing. Both ""recycle"" and ""once-through"" plant configurations are evaluated in this paper. Because synthesis catalysts are poisoned by sulfur, essentially all sulfur must be removed upstream. Upstream removal of CO2 from the synthesis gas is also desirable to maximize synthesis productivity, and it provides an opportunity for partial decarbonization of the process, whereby the removed CO2 can be captured for underground storage. The analysis here suggests that co-capture and co-storage of CO2 and H2S (if this is proven technically feasible) could have important favorable impacts in some cases on liquid fuel production costs. Furthermore, the life-cycle CO2 emissions from production and use of fuels made by ICL would be lower than with production and use of petroleum-derived transportation fuels. If CO2 is not captured at ICL facilities, lifecycle CO2 emissions to the atmosphere would be considerably higher than lifecycle emissions with petroleum-derived fuels. © 2003 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Coal; Coal liquefaction; Combustion; Cost benefit analysis; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gas turbines; Gases; Liquid fuels; Liquids; Methanol fuels; Petroleum transportation; Recycling; Sulfur; Synthesis gas; Synthetic fuels; Underground gas storage; Gas turbine combined cycle; Generate electricity; Indirect coal liquefactions; Life cycle emissions; Liquid-fuel production; Liquid-phase synthesis; Petroleum-derived fuels; Synthetic fuel productions; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24644453356

J. Coal Geol. 51 (2002) 69; Proceedings JCOAL Workshop: Present Status and Perspective of CO2 Sequestration in Coal Seams, Tokyo, Japan, (5 September 2002) 23-38]. Excess sorption isotherms of carbon dioxide recorded at 40, 60 and 80 °C on dry and moisture-equilibrated Carboniferous coals from the Netherlands exhibited distinct minima and even negative values in the 8-12 MPa interval. These anomalies are indicative of a strong volumetric effect. Evaluation of the experimental results in terms of absolute sorption assuming a range of different densities for the adsorbed phase could not eliminate the observed anomalies. In consequence, substantial swelling (up to 20%) of the (powdered) coal samples must be invoked to account for the observed phenomena. This interpretation is supported by the results of field tests in Alberta, Canada [Proceedings JCOAL Workshop: Present Status and Perspective of CO2 Sequestration in Coal Seams, Tokyo, Japan, (5 September 2002) 59-66], which resulted in a significant reduction in coal-seam permeability upon CO2 injection. The latest research focuses on the preferential sorption behaviour of CO2 and CTLt of coals from the Silesian coal basin. Experiments are conducted at pressures up to 250 bar (25 MPa) at a temperature of 45 °C using the volumetric method. These measurements provide fundamental information for enhanced coalbed methane recovery (ECBM) and storage of CO2 in deep unminable coal seams proposed as a potential means of the reduction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions (RECOPOL-project: http://www.nitg.tno.nl/ recopol/). Preferential adsorption experiments on dry and moisture-equilibrated coals of different rank under identical conditions showed that adsorption is a function of coal type, moisture content and pressure. While at pressures above 50 bar, CO2 was always adsorbed preferentially to methane, preferential sorption of methane was observed in some instances at lower pressures. The unexpected phenomenon of preferential CH4 adsorption on natural coals is presently an issue for further investigation. In the context of a round robin project initiated by the US Department of Energy, CO2 excess sorption isotherms have been determined on five US premium coals at 22 °C in the dry state. Diversities of the excess sorption behaviour of these coals under different rank can be observed. Generally, excess sorption isotherms of lignite and subbituminous coals (0.25-0.46% VRr) xhibited a monotonous increase over the entire experimental pressure range (up to ∼ 50 bar), while higher mature coals tended to approach a saturation level corresponding to a Langmuir isotherm. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The key to TDR's success is its ability to accurately measure the permittivity of a material and the fact that there is a good relationship between the permittivity of a material and its water content. A further advantage is the ability to estimate water content and measure bulk soil EC simultaneously using TDR. The aim of this review is to summarize and examine advances that have been made in terms of measuring permittivity and bulk EC. The review examines issues such as the effective frequency of the TDR measurement and waveform analysis in dispersive dielectrics. The growing importance of both waveform simulation and inverse analysis of waveforms is highlighted. Such methods hold great potential for obtaining far more information from TDR waveform analysis. Probe design is considered in some detail and practical guidance is given for probe construction. The importance of TDR measurement sampling volume is considered and the relative energy storage density is modeled for a range of probe designs. Tables are provided that compare some of the different aspects of commercial TDR equipment, and the units are discussed in terms of their performance and their advantages and disadvantages.

It is shown that although direct liquefaction conversion processes might be more energy-efficient, overall system efficiencies for direct and indirect liquefaction are typically comparable if end-use as well as production efficiencies are taken into account. It is shown that some synfuels derived via indirect liquefaction can outperform fuels derived from crude oil with regard to both air-pollutant and greenhouse-gas emissions, but direct liquefaction-derived synfuels cannot. Deployment now of some indirect liquefaction technologies could put coal on a track consistent with later addressing severe climate and other environmental constraints without having to abandon coal for energy, but deploying direct liquefaction technologies cannot. And finally, there are much stronger supporting technological infrastructures for indirect than for direct liquefaction technologies. Prospective costs in China for some indirect liquefaction-derived fuels are developed but not costs for direct liquefaction-based synfuels, because experience with the latter is inadequate for making meaningful cost projections. Especially promising is the outlook for the indirect liquefaction product dimethyl ether, a versatile and clean fuel that could probably be produced in China at costs competitive with crude oil-derived liquid fuels. An important finding is the potential for realizing, in the case of dimethyl ether, significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions relative to crude oil-derived hydrocarbon fuels, even in the absence of an explicit climate change mitigation policy, when this fuel is co-produced with electricity. But this finding depends on the viability of underground storage of H2S and CO2 as an acid gas management strategy for synfuel production. Many ""megascale"" demonstration projects for underground CO2 storage and H2S/CO2 co-storage, along with appropriate monitoring, modeling, and scientific experiments, in alternative geological contexts, are needed to verify this prospect. It is very likely that China has some of the least-costly CO2 sources in the world for possible use in such demonstrations. It would be worthwhile to explore whether there are interesting prospective demonstration sites near one or more of these sources and to see if other countries might work with China in exploiting demonstration opportunities at such sites. © 2003 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal; Costs; Crude oil; Demonstrations; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Ethers; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Liquefaction; Liquid fuels; Synthetic fuels; Underground gas storage; Climate change mitigation; Demonstration project; Environmental constraints; Liquefaction products; Production efficiency; Scientific experiments; Synthetic liquid fuels; Technological infrastructure; Coal liquefaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21744437659

Research Methods and Procedures: Thirteen obese patients (four men/nine women; BMI = 56.3 ± 2.7 kg/m2) and 13 lean subjects (five men/eight women; BMI = 22.4 ± 0.5 kg/m2) underwent euglycemic clamp, oral glucose tolerance test, and indirect calorimetry. The study was carried out before (Study I) and after (∼40% relative to initial body weight; Study II) weight loss induced by Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass with silastic ring surgery. Results: The obese patients were insulin resistant (whole-body glucose use = 19.7 ± 1.5 vs. 51.5 ± 2.4 μmol/min per kilogram fat-free mass, p &lt; 0.0001) and hyperinsulinemic in the fasting state (332 ± 86 vs. 85 ± 5 pM, p &lt; 0.0001) and during the oral glucose tolerance test compared with the lean subjects. Fasting plasma insulin normalized after weight loss, whereas whole-body glucose use increased (35.5 ± 3.7 μmol/min per kilogram fat-free mass, p &lt; 0.05 vs. Study I). The higher insulin clearance of obese did not change during the follow-up period. Insulin-induced glucose oxidation and nonoxidative glucose disposal were lower in the obese compared with the lean group (all p &lt; 0.05). In Study II, the former increased slightly, whereas nonoxidative glucose disposal reached values similar to those of the control group. Fasting lipid oxidation was higher in the obese than in the control group and did not change significantly in Study II. The insulin effect on lipid oxidation was slightly improved (p = 0.01 vs. Study I). Discussion: The rapid weight loss after surgery in obese class III patients normalized insulinemia and improved insulin sensitivity almost entirely due to glucose storage, whereas fasting lipid oxidation remained high.

We hypothesize that this may be related to the partitioning of dietary fat between oxidation and storage. Research Methods and Procedures: Healthy women (age 24 ± 1 years, BMI = 21.2 ± 0.4 kg/m2) were recruited to participate in rest (n = 10) or exercise sessions of light (n = 11), moderate (n = 10), and heavy (n = 7) exercise. All exercises (1250 kJ above rest) were performed on a stationary cycle inside of a whole-body calorimeter. [1-13C]oleate and [d 31]palmitate were given in a liquid meal 30 minutes post-exercise. An additional study was done with identical exercise sessions, but with administration of an oral dose of [1-13C]acetate and [d 3]acetate 30 minutes post-exercise to determine label sequestration. Results: Cumulative oxidation of [1-13C]oleate was significantly greater after light (45 ± 3%), moderate (54 ± 4%), and heavy (51 ± 4%) exercise than that with rest (33 ± 3%) (p = 0.0008). Cumulative oxidation of [d31]palmitate did not differ among trials (12 ± 2%, 14 ± 1%, 17 ± 2%, and 14 ± 2% for rest, light, moderate, and heavy, respectively; p = 0.30). Discussion: Exercise standardized for energy expenditure increases monounsaturated fat oxidation more than saturated fat oxidation and that the increase occurs regardless of intensity. Recommendations for physical activity for the purposes of weight control may be specific for dietary fat composition.

Rats raised in small litters (SL) of only three pups per mother compared to ten or twelve in control litters (CL) gain significantly more weight than normal rats till weaning and are overweight also in later life. These rats are known to express hyperleptinemia, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. The review summarizes the results of action of leptin and insulin as well as of several feeding-relevant neuropeptides on neuronal activity of hypothalamic regulatory centres in overweight SL rats compared to controls. The study was performed on brain slices perfused with solution containing 10 mM glucose. Whereas a normally inhibitory action of leptin and insulin on medial arcuate neurons (ArcM) is reduced in SL rats and partly replaced by activation, the normally activating effect of these hormones on ventromedial (VMH) neurons is altered to predominant inhibition. Inhibition of ArcM neurons may decrease the release of the orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti gene-related protein (AGRP). Thus, the negative feedback by leptin and insulin on food intake is replaced by diminished response and partly positive feedback processes in SL rats. The action of NPY and AGRP as well as of the orexigenic melanin-concentrating hormone on paraventricular (PVH) and VMH neurons is also shaped from activation or bimodal effects to predominant inhibition. Such inhibition of PVH and VMH might lead to reduced energy expenditure in small litter rats. Also the anorexigenic melanocortin alpha-MSH seems to contribute into increased energy storage. These altered responses of hypothalamic neurons in overweight small litter rats might reflect a general mechanism of neurochemical plasticity and ""malprogramming"" of hypothalamic neuropeptidergic systems leading to a permanently altered regulatory function.",,"agouti related protein; agouti-related protein; carrier protein; insulin; leptin; neuropeptide; neuropeptide Y; orexins; protein; signal peptide; animal; article; body weight; energy metabolism; feeding behavior; genetics; hypothalamus; litter size; metabolism; nerve cell; nerve cell inhibition; nerve cell plasticity; obesity; physiology; rat; Wistar rat; Animals; Body Weight; Carrier Proteins; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Hypothalamus; Insulin; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Leptin; Litter Size; Neural Inhibition; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; Neuropeptide Y; Neuropeptides; Obesity; Proteins; Rats; Rats, Wistar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2142657485

This can be achieved in a number of ways. For disorders of intermediary metabolism, treatment involves a thorough understanding of the disorder and the pathogenesis of the deleterious effects The various approaches indicated may involve substrate restriction, replacement of deficient products, removal of toxic metabolites or stimulation of residual enzymes. Newer therapies include enzyme replacement and gene therapy. Often, the cornerstone of treatment is dietary. Substrate restriction includes not only a diet low in the substrate indicated by the disorder, but also strict calorie support in times of illness to avoid catabolism. Useful levels of substrate restriction may require the use of supplements of ""medical foods"", for example amino acid mixtures. Provision of the deficient products is important in disorders affecting energy metabolism. To understand the problems involved in nutritional treatment it is helpful to consider examples of different types of disorders. In Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), treatment with a very strict low-protein diet, supplemented by a branched-chain-free amino acid mixture is successful, but each intercurrent illness is hazardous, regimens for sick days vital, and strict lifelong treatment is needed. Treatment for phenylketonuria is similar in restricting a substrate but there is no tendency for systemic illness if the phenylalanine levels are too high. Disorders of the urea cycle are difficult dietary challenges because while a very low-protein diet is required, no specific amino acid needs to be avoided and there is a fine line between adequate protein intake and chronic catabolism. Fatty acid oxidation disorders affect energy production and can be detected by newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry. For long-chain fatty acid disorders, long chain fats must largely be avoided and medium-chain fats must be substituted while strictly avoiding catabolism. Glycogen storage disorders require strict attention to providing carbohydrate, at all times including throughout the night. Many patients with inborn errors do not need any specific dietary therapy, (eg those with storage or neurodegenerative disorders), although all children benefit from an optimal diet, and sick children need this especially.",,"fatty acid; article; diet supplementation; diet therapy; homeostasis; human; inborn error of metabolism; infant; metabolism; newborn; newborn screening; phenylketonuria; Dietary Supplements; Fatty Acids; Homeostasis; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Metabolism, Inborn Errors; Neonatal Screening; Phenylketonurias",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20844458567

Under liquid-film conditions, hydrogen was evolved from decalin much more efficiently than the suspended ones due to the superheated states of dehydrogenation catalysts. It was confirmed that the catalytic conversions of decalin dehydrogeno-aromatization in the liquid-film states could surpass easily the equilibrium limit, because the conditions of suppressed reactant evaporation and reactive distillation were operative here.

We propose to minimize the principal compliance of the domain equal to the maximum of the stored energy over all admissible loadings. The principal compliance is the maximal compliance under the extreme, worst possible loading. The robust optimal design is formulated as a min-max problem for the energy stored in the structure. The maximum of the energy is chosen over the constrained class of loadings, while the minimum is taken over the design parameters. It is shown that the problem for the extreme loading can be reduced to an elasticity problem with mixed nonlinear boundary conditions; the last problem may have multiple solutions. The optimization with respect to the designed structure takes into account the possible multiplicity of extreme loadings and divides resources (reinforced material) to equally resist all of them. Continuous change of the loading constraint causes bifurcation of the solution of the optimization problem. It is shown that an invariance of the constraints under a symmetry transformation leads to a symmetry of the optimal design. Examples of optimal design are investigated; symmetries and bifurcations of the solutions are revealed.","Bifurcation; Constrained optimization; Minimax; Robustness; Steklov eigenvalues; Structural design","Bifurcation (mathematics); Biological materials; Capacitance; Elasticity; Electric conductivity; Energy storage; Frequencies; Magnetic domains; Optimal systems; Structural design; Constrained optimization; Minimax; Robust optimal design; Steklov eigenvalues; Robustness (control systems)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842791252

Mizel raised the question of whether there exist nonlinearly elastic materials possessing a physically natural stored energy density, i.e., one which is independent of an observer's coordinate frame (objective) and is invariant under the group of orthogonal linear transformations of space (isotropic), as well as physically reasonable boundary value problems for such materials such that the infimum of the total stored energy for those continuous deformations of the material meeting the boundary condition (admissible deformations) which belong to a Sobolev space W 1, p2 for some p2 &gt; 1 is strictly greater than its infimum for those admissible continuous deformations belonging to some Sobolev space W1, p1, p1 &lt; p2, despite the density of W1, p2 in W1, p1. The question was motivated by M. Lavrentiev's demonstration in 1926 of the presence of such a gap for a 1-dimensional variational boundary value problem on a bounded interval whose smooth integrand satisfied the conditions of Tonelli's existence theorem (as well as the development of improved versions in the 1980's). The present article describes a positive response to the question raised in 1985. Namely, we provide examples of nonlinearly elastic materials in 2-dimensions and physically reasonable boundary value problems for these materials in which a positive gap exists between the infimum of the total stored energy over admissible continuous deformations belonging to a Sobolev space W1, p2 and its infimum over admissible continuous deformations belonging to a Sobolev space W 1, p1, with p1 &lt; p2.

However, a sufficient modeling program, capable of modeling the different design options, is not available today. Modern simulation programs should be capable of serving as tools for analysis as well as development. Shortfalls of the existing programs, initially developed for internal combustion engine hybrid vehicles, are: (i)Insufficient modeling of transient characteristics; (ii) Insufficient modeling of the fuel cells system; (iii) Insufficient modeling of advanced hybrid systems; (iv) Employment of a non-causal (backwards locking) structure; (v) Significant shortcomings in the area of controls. In the area of analysis, a modeling tool for fuel cell vehicles needs to address the transient dynamic interaction between the electric drive train and the fuel cell system. Especially for vehicles with slow responding on-board fuel processor, this interaction is very different from the interaction between a battery (as power source) and an electric drive train in an electric vehicle design. Non-transient modeling leads to inaccurate predictions of vehicle performance and fuel consumption. When applied in the area of development, the existing programs do not support the employment of newer techniques, such as rapid prototyping. This is because the program structure merges control algorithms and component models, or different control algorithms (from different components) are lumped together in one single control block and not assigned to individual components as they are in real vehicles. In both cases, the transfer of control algorithms from the model into existing hardware is not possible. This paper is the first part of a three part series and benchmarks the ""state of the art"" of existing programs. The second paper introduces a new simulation program, which tries to overcome existing barriers. Specifically it explicitly recognizes the dynamic interaction between fuel cell system, drive train and optional additional energy storage.","Benchmarking; Forward looking; Fuel Cell; Hybrid; Simulation","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Computer simulation; Energy storage; Fuel consumption; Internal combustion engines; Rapid prototyping; Vehicles; Forward looking; Hybrid; Fuel cells",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842507520

The PAM-dominated culture anaerobically took up acetate approximately 7 times faster than the GAM-dominated culture. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) balances were performed assuming eight different metabolic scenarios that included the Entner-Doudoroff or the Embden-Myerhof glycolytic pathway, acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthase or the acetate kinase-phospho-transacetylase (AK-PTA) system for acetyl-CoA synthesis, and ATP synthesis or no ATP synthesis during fumarate reduction. The ATP available for transport of acetate into the cell (α) was calculated using these balances. The assumed quantity of ATP produced during fumarate reduction had a relatively small effect on α, particularly when PAM was dominant. When GAM was dominant, little or no ATP was available for acetate transport depending on the assumed scenario, and the Embden-Myerhof pathway was more feasible. The value of α increased with increasing PAM dominance for all eight metabolic pathways. The maximum calculated α value of 0.5 mol ATP/C-mol acetate uptake occurred at maximum PAM dominance and when the Embden-Myerhof pathway was active, when ATP was produced during fumarate reduction, and when the AK-PTA system was active. This value of a was higher than previously calculated values with the same metabolic assumptions. An acetate uptake mechanism was suggested that included acetyl-CoA synthetase and direct regeneration of the proton motive force by a proton-translocating pyrophosphatase. Polyphosphate-accumulating metabolism may have a competitive advantage over GAM through a higher anaerobic acetate uptake rate made possible by a greater use of energy for acetate uptake, by use of a different acetate uptake mechanism, or both.","Acetate transport; Activated sludge; Bacterial storage products; Enhanced biological phosphorus removal; Glycogen; Polyphosphate","Biomass; Cells; Chemical reactors; Enzymes; Metabolism; Organic compounds; Synthesis (chemical); Wastewater; Anaerobic-aerobic cycle; Batch reactors; Chemical-oxygen demand (COD); Glycogen-accumulating metabolism (GAM); Phosphorus; acetate kinase; acetic acid; acetyl coenzyme A synthetase; adenosine triphosphate; fumaric acid; glycogen; phosphate acetyltransferase; phosphorus; acetic acid derivative; fumaric acid derivative; oxygen; phosphorus; polyphosphate; activated sludge; biological treatment; Phosphorus; pollutant removal; sequencing batch reactor; Wastewater treatment; activated sludge; anaerobic metabolism; article; batch reactor; biomass production; chemical oxygen demand; enzyme synthesis; priority journal; waste water; active transport; anaerobic growth; bacterium; biological model; biomass; bioreactor; comparative study; metabolism; methodology; sewage; water management; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gadus morhua; Acetate-CoA Ligase; Acetates; Adenosine Triphosphate; Anaerobiosis; Bacteria; Biological Transport, Active; Biomass; Bioreactors; Fumarates; Glycogen; Models, Biological; Oxygen; Phosphorus; Polyphosphates; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842504181

From in situ measurements of the electron flux and energy distribution at the vacuum chamber wall, electron-cloud production mechanisms and details of the beam-cloud interaction can be inferred. A significant longitudinal variation of the electron cloud is also observed, due primarily to geometrical details of the vacuum chamber.

Previous studies of the CSR induced longitudinal instability were carried out for the CSR impedance due to dipole magnets. However, many storage rings include long wigglers where a large fraction of the synchrotron radiation is emitted. This includes high-luminosity factories such as DAPHNE, PEP-II, KEK-B, and CESR-C as well as the damping rings of future linear colliders. In this paper, the instability due to the CSR impedance from a wiggler is studied assuming a large wiggler parameter K. The primary consideration is a low-frequency microwavelike instability, which arises near the pipe cutoff frequency.

It is a phenomenon quite similar to the interaction between electron clouds and proton or positron beams in high-energy accelerators and storage rings. In the DARHT-2 accelerator, the 2-kA, 2-μs beam pulse produces an ion channel through impact ionization of the residual background gas (10-7-10-6 torr). A calculation of the linear growth by Briggs indicates that the instability could be strong enough to affect the radiographic application of DARHT, which requires that transverse oscillations be small compared to the beam radius. We present semianalytical theory and 3D particle-in-cell simulations (using the LSP code) of the linear and nonlinear growth of the instability, including the effects of the temporal change in the ion density and spatially decreasing beam radius. We find that the number of e-foldings experienced by a given beam slice is given approximately by an analytic expression using the local channel density at the beam slice. Hence, in the linear regime, the number of e-foldings increases linearly from head to tail of the beam pulse since it is proportional to the ion density. We also find that growth is strongly suppressed by nonlinear effects at relatively small oscillation amplitudes of the electron beam. This is because the ion oscillation amplitude is several times larger than that of the beam, allowing nonlinear effects to come into play. An analogous effect has recently been noted in electron-proton instabilities in high-energy accelerators and storage rings. For DARHT-2 parameters, we find that a pressure of &lt; 1.5 × 10-7 torr is needed to keep the transverse beam oscillation amplitude less than about 20% of the rms beam radius. © 2003 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18144380671

In this paper, we propose a set-associative cache that can provide the flexibility to configure its associativity according to different program behaviors, which means that the proposed cache scheme can be configured from n-way set-associative cache to direct-mapped cache. Besides, the proposed cache scheme also can disable all tag-subarrays and only enable a desired data-subarray when adjacent memory references are within the same block as the previous access. By this scheme, the power consumption can be saved when an n-way set-associative cache configures the cache with lower associativity (less than n) due to only enabling fewer subarrays of the tag memory and data memory, and when the tag checking is eliminated for the intra-block access due to disabling all subarrays of the tag memory. However, the performance is still maintained to the same as the conventional set-associative cache or the direct-mapped cache.","Average energy dissipation; Configurable-way; Intra-block access; Multiprocessor systems; Previous block register (PBR)","Cache memory; Computer architecture; Computer simulation; Computer software; Decoding; Dynamic random access storage; VLSI circuits; Average energy dissipation; Configurable way; Intra-block access; Previous block register (PBR); Interconnection networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642372315

When needed, the compressed air is expanded through a turbo-expander to generate electricity. The system is designed for the storage of wind energy and utilises above-ground compressed-air storage with 8,278 kPa (1,200-psia) tanks. It is applicable in the operational power region between (1) electrical storage batteries for relatively small peak power and (2) large pressurized underground salt caverns for large peak power. Therefore, it is most economic for between 0.5 and 100 Megawatt electric power systems. The key advantages over these other storage methods are that there is no need to either purchase, maintain and dispose of waste chemicals, or locate large underground caverns. In addition to supplying electrical power, the by-product heat may be utilised as cogeneration. For instance, the multi-stage compressor coolant may heat domestic water and the cooled exhaust air from the turbo-expander may benefit air-conditioning. Accounting 5% benefit from the hot water and 20% from the refrigerated air, the $0.076/kWh cost of delivered electricity decreases to $0.057/kWh. Reducing or eliminating high-pressure tanks and high-voltage power lines by using the volumetrically equivalent of long high-pressure transfer lines, further reduces the unit cost. This is particularly applicable for offshore windfarms.","Compressed air energy storage (CAES) system; Electric power grid interaction; High pressure storage vessel; Hybrid wind turbine system; Storage of wind power","Compressed air; Electricity; High pressure effects; Wind turbines; Exhaust air; Storage tanks; Wind power; electricity generation; high pressure system; storage vessel; Wind power; wind turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542714475

Mechanical testing shows that the tensile modulus of nanocomposites is superior to that of nylon 10 10, and the ultimate strain values of the nanocomposites remain at a level similar to nylon 10 10 if the content of montmorillonite is not more than 6 wt%.",,"Atomic force microscopy; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Intercalation compounds; Ion exchange; Nanostructured materials; Nucleation; Polymerization; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction analysis; Intercalating polymerization; Nylon matrix; Nylon polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542711496

The aim of the present paper is to explore the suitability of two different types of measurements for the identification of parameters in a single-layer forest canopy interception model. The first information source consists of measured throughfall dynamics, whereas the second consists of measured canopy water storage dynamics. The latter measurements were obtained using the attenuation of a microwave signal over a 12.5-m propagation line while scanning vertically through the forest canopy. Results demonstrate that measured throughfall dynamics contain only very limited information for the calibration of a canopy interception model and are particularly inadequate to identify the storage capacity and evaporation rate of the forest canopy. On the contrary, microwave-measured canopy water storage dynamics contain sufficient information to be able to identify the interception model parameters with a high degree of confidence.","Canopy water storage; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; Parameter identification; Rainfall interception; Recursive parameter estimation; Throughfall","Atmospherics; Computer simulation; Control system analysis; Forestry; Parameter estimation; Water conservation; Forest canopy; Rainfall interception model; Rain; calibration; evaporation; forest canopy; interception; Monte Carlo analysis; rainfall",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542547090

Post-fetch decompression, in which decompression is performed after the compressed instructions have been fetched, allows the instruction cache to store compressed code but requires a highly efficient decompression implementation. We propose implementing post-fetch decompression using dynamic instruction stream editing (DISE), a programmable decoder - similar in structure to those in many IA32 processors - that is used to add functionality to an application by injecting custom code snippets into its fetched instruction stream. A DISE implementation of post-fetch decompression naturally supports customized program-specific decompression allowing similar instruction sequences to share dictionary entries, and uses no decompression-specific hardware. Cycle-level simulation of DISE decompression shows that it can reduce static program size by 35% and execution time by 20%. Parameterized decompression, a feature unique to DISE, accounts for 20% of the code size reduction by making more effective use of the dictionary and allowing PC-relative branches to be included in compressed sequences. DISE-based compression can reduce total energy consumption by 10% and the energy-delay product by as much as 20%.","Code compression; Code decompression; DISE","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Computer systems; Decoding; Program processors; Storage allocation (computer); Code compression; Code decopression; Cycle-level simulation; Dynamic instruction stream editing; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442337751

Dual width instruction set embedded processors such as the ARM provide a 16-bit instruction set in addition to the 32-bit instruction set to address these concerns. Using 16-bit instructions one can achieve code size reduction and I-cache energy savings at the cost of performance. We have observed that throughout 16-bit Thumb code there exist Thumb instruction pairs that are equivalent to a single ARM instruction. We have developed an approach which uses combination of compiler and architectural support to exploit the above property for improving performance of 16-bit code. We enhance the Thumb instruction set by incorporating Augmenting eXtensions (AX). The task of the compiler is to identify pairs of Thumb instructions that can be safely combined and executed as single ARM instructions. The compiler replaces such pairs of Thumb instructions by AX+Thumb instruction pairs. The AX instruction is coalesced with the immediately following Thumb instruction to generate a single ARM instruction at decode time. Thus, using AX instructions, the compiler can both generate compact 16-bit code and provide hardware with information needed to produce better performing 32-bit code.","16-bit thumb ISA; 32-bit ARM ISA; AX instructions; Code size; Embedded processor; Instruction coalescing; Performance","Algorithms; C (programming language); Codes (symbols); Data storage equipment; Embedded systems; Program compilers; Code size reduction; Embedded processor; Instruction coalescing; Computer systems programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442313328

Profiling of genes differentially expressed between the fetal liver (FL) and the postnatal liver (PNL) is one of the methods to investigate candidates affecting the difference in biological characteristics between FL and PNL. To identify genes differentially expressed between FL and PNL (childhood and adult liver), we analyzed the gene expression profiles across 9 FL and 14 PNL samples using a high-density oligonucleotide DNA array. Using Mann-Whitney U test followed by k-nearest-neighbors (supervised learning method) and hierarchical clustering (unsupervised learning method) algorithms, we found 33 genes clearly discriminating between the FL group and PNL group. The functional classification of the 33 genes identified was related to several kinds of biological pathways, regulating the cell cycle (PCNA, CDC7L1, CCND3, YWHA1, PKMYT1), DNA replication and repair (RFC4, RECQ2, PCNA, NAP1L1), cell growth (IGF2, IGFBP2, PRSS11), hormonal signals (AR, SRD5A1, NR1I3), and cellular metabolism (E2-EPF, WWP1, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, CYP2A6, CYP2A7, CYP2A13, CYP4F2, CYP3A4, DDT). The results presented herein provide evidence of a differential expression profile of genes regulating the cell cycle, DNA replication and repair, cell growth, regulation of hormonal signals, and cellular metabolism, between FL and PNL in humans.

To test the hypothesis, fertilized turkey eggs were incubated either for the first 2 wk of development (experiment 1) or only the first week of development (experiment 2) at 37.8°C compared with controls incubated at 37.5°C. In both experiments, eggs were stored for either 15 or 3 d prior to setting. Viable embryos were selected randomly from each storage-by-incubation period treatment combination at 25 to 28 d of incubation and were sampled for blood, heart, and skeletal muscle tissues. Tissues were weighed and assayed subsequently for glucose or glycogen content. In experiment 2, the randomly selected embryos from each treatment combination were sampled at 7, 14, 21, and 28 d of incubation. Embryos at 7 and 14 d were assayed on a whole body basis, whereas at 21 and 28 d the bodies were dissected, and heart, liver, and skeletal muscle tissues were weighed and assayed for glycogen and lactate. Blood samples were collected between 25 and 28 d of incubation as in experiment 1 and assayed for glucose, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and thyroid hormone concentrations. In both experiments, accelerated development was noted due to higher temperature and enhanced embryonic carbohydrate metabolism, and elevated thyroid hormone concentrations were observed compared with controls. It was concluded that a possible mechanism for the improved livability of faster growing embryos observed after prolonged egg storage might be due to better utilization of carbohydrate.","Egg storage; Embryo survival; Turkey embryo","Aves; Meleagris gallopavo; creatine kinase; glucose; glycogen; lactate dehydrogenase; lactic acid; liothyronine; thyroxine; animal; animal disease; animal embryo; article; blood; chemistry; embryo development; energy metabolism; glucose blood level; heart; incubator; liver; metabolism; prenatal development; skeletal muscle; temperature; time; turkey (bird); Animals; Blood Glucose; Creatine Kinase; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Glycogen; Heart; Incubators; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lactic Acid; Liver; Muscle, Skeletal; Temperature; Thyroxine; Time Factors; Triiodothyronine; Turkeys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342310833

Neutral-lipid and lean-tissue masses were determined for fish of five consecutive year classes collected through the first year of life. Differences in scaling relationships between body length and neutral-lipid and lean-tissue mass were used to infer patterns of resource allocation. Lipid reserves scaled isometrically with body length in summer but increased at a greater rate than did body length in autumn and winter. Lean-tissue allometries were less variable but followed a similar seasonal cycle. Allometric slopes were homogeneous across years, but significant interannual variation in length-specific lipid content and lean-tissue mass in the later half of the growing season indicated variable allocation patterns. During winter, up to 21% of total energy content and 50% of neutral-lipid stores were depleted. The results indicate that energy allocation patterns result from interactions among season, ontogenetic stage, and body size. The variation in growth, allocation, and severity of the winter energy deficit likely interact to determine first-winter survival.","Allometry; Energy allocation; Hudson River, USA; Juvenile; Lipid reserves; Morone saxatilis; Seasonality; Striped bass","allometry; annual variation; bioenergetics; fish; juvenile; resource allocation; seasonality; Hudson River; North America; United States; Morone; Morone saxatilis; Morone saxatilis; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342309536

Subjects and methods: Two-hundred and fifty-two women were followed from 5-7 months of pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. Energy intake was estimated during pregnancy and at 1, 3 and 6 month(s) postpartum using 24 h dietary recall. Body weight was measured on enrollment, another once or twice during pregnancy, and at 1, 3 and 6 month(s) postpartum. The weekly rates of pregnancy weight gain and postpartum weight changes were determined. Weight and length of the infants were measured at birth and at approximately 1, 3 and 6 month(s). Results: Maternal energy intake at 5-7 months of gestation was 1464 ± 416 kcal/day (mean ± s.d.). Women gained a mean of 200 g/week or a total of 4 kg during the second half of pregnancy. An analysis of maternal weight showed no indication of accrual of fat stores during pregnancy. Dietary energy during lactation exceeded the intake during pregnancy by 248-354 kcal/day. Mothers lost an estimated average of 1 kg of weight during the first 6 months of lactation. The mean (± s.d.) birth weight was 2.55 ± 0.38 kg, and the prevalence of low birth weight (< 2500 g) was 48%. Infants exhibited some catch-up growth only during the first 3 months but overall growth during the first 6 months did not change from their relative status at birth when compared with NCHS reference. Conclusions: These rural Bangladeshi women failed to gain sufficient weight during the last half of pregnancy to maintain body weight during lactation when the energy demand is high. Poor growth of their primarily breastfed infants raises concern about the adequacy of lactation in this community.","Birth weight; Energy intake; Infant growth; Postpartum weight; Pregnancy weight gain; Rural Bangladesh","lipid; adult; article; Bangladesh; body height; body weight; breast feeding; caloric intake; catch up growth; child growth; childbirth; controlled study; correlation analysis; energy consumption; female; gender; gestational age; growth curve; human; infant; lactation; lipid storage; low birth weight; major clinical study; maternal nutrition; nutritional status; pregnancy; prevalence; puerperium; rural area; stress; weight gain; Adult; Anthropometry; Bangladesh; Birth Weight; Eating; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Lactation; Nutritional Requirements; Nutritional Status; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Rural Population; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12244313433

The aim of the present work was to study the effects of c-9,t-11 and t-10,c-12 CLA isomers on body fat accumulation and serum lipids in hamsters fed an atherogenic diet. Hamsters were divided in four groups: one group was fed a chow diet (control) and the other three groups were given semi-purified atherogenic diets with 0.5% linoleic acid (LA), c-9,t-11 or t-10,c-12 CLA. Body weight and food intake were measured daily. After 6 weeks, adipose tissues from different anatomical locations and liver were dissected and weighed. Serum glucose, total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c and triacylglycerol levels, as well as total and free cholesterol, triacylglycerol and phospholipid content in liver were determined by enzymatic methods. No differences in either energy intake or final body weight were found. The addition of t-10,c-12 CLA reduced fat accumulation and led to lower serum cholesterol, as compared with LA group. Nevertheless the level remained higher than in the control animals. The reduction in serum cholesterol was limited to LDL-c. This isomer also reduced triacylglycerol content in liver but did not modify serum triacylglycerol level. In summary, the present study demonstrates that t-10,c-12 CLA is the biologically active agent when anti-obesity and hypocholesterolaemic properties of CLA are considered. In contrast, the isomer c-9,t-11 has no effect on lipid metabolism in hamsters.","Body fat; Cholesterol; Conjugated linoleic acid; Hamster; Triacylglycerols","cholesterol; conjugated linoleic acid; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hypocholesterolemic agent; linoleic acid; lipid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; phospholipid; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal food; animal model; animal tissue; anthropometry; article; atherogenic diet; body fat; body weight; cholesterol blood level; cis trans isomerism; controlled study; drug activity; enzyme assay; fat content; food intake; glucose blood level; hamster; lipid blood level; lipid liver level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; liver weight; male; nonhuman; phospholipid blood level; triacylglycerol blood level; Animalia; Cricetinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1142287561

A PRB is typically composed of granular iron which degrades chlorinated organics into potentially nontoxic dehalogenated organic compounds and inorganic chloride. Geophysical methods may assist assessment of in-situ barrier integrity and evaluation of long-term barrier performance. The highly conductive granular iron makes the PRB an excellent target for conductivity imaging methods. In addition, electrochemical storage of charge at the iron-solution interface generates an impedance that decreases with frequency. The PRB is thus a potential induced polarization (IP) target. Surface and cross-borehole electrical imaging (conductivity and IP) was conducted at a PRB installed at the U.S. Department of Energy's Kansas City plant. Poor signal strength (25% of measure-ments exceeding 8% reciprocal error) and insensitivity at depth, which results from current channeling in the highly conductive iron, limited surface imaging. Cross-hole 2D and 3D electrical measurements were highly effective at defining an accurate, approximately 0.3-m resolution, cross-sectional image of the barrier in-situ. Both the conductivity and IP images reveal the barrier geometry. Crosshole images obtained for seven panels along the barrier suggest variability in iron emplacement along the installation. On five panels the PRB structure is imaged as a conductive feature exceeding 1 S/m. However, on two panels the conductivity in the assumed vicinity of the PRB is less than 1 S/m. The images also suggest variability in the integrity of the contact between the PRB and bedrock. This noninvasive, in-situ evaluation of barrier geometry using conductivity/IP has broad implications for the long-term monitoring of PRB performance as a method of hydrocarbon removal.",,"Boreholes; Dehalogenation; Electric conductivity; Groundwater; Hydrocarbons; Chlorine compounds; Geophysics; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Hydrocarbons; Iron; Water treatment; Chlorinated organics; Permeable reactive barriers (PRB); Contaminated groundwater; Cross sectional image; Electrical measurement; Electrochemical storage; Induced polarization; Permeable reactive barriers; U.S. Department of Energy; Geophysics; Water pollution control; electrical conductivity; electromagnetic survey; groundwater pollution; performance assessment; reactive barrier; waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10844263194

Two different types of receivers, which have conical and dome shapes, are considered for the system, and several modes of heat losses from the receivers are thoroughly studied. Using the Stine and McDonald model convective heat loss from a receiver is estimated. The Net Radiation Method is used to calculate the radiation heat transfer rate by emission from the inside surface of the cavity receiver to the environment. The Monte-Carlo Method is used to predict the radiation heat transfer rate from the reflector to the receiver. Tracing the photons generated, the reflection loss from the receivers can be estimated. The radiative heat flux distribution produced by a multifaceted parabolic concentrator on the focal plane is estimated using the cone optics method. Also, the solar radiation spillage around the aperture is calculated. Based on the results of the analysis, the performances of two different receivers with multifaceted parabolic solar energy collectors are evaluated.","Dish-Type Multifaceted Solar Collector; Heat Loss; Ray Tracing; Receiver","Heat flux; Heat losses; Heat radiation; Heat storage; Mirrors; Monte Carlo methods; Nusselt number; Ray tracing; Thermal conductivity; Dish-type multifaceted solar collector; Grashof number; Solar beam intensity; Solar beam irradiance; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10844244896

The main anthropogenic greenhouse gas is CO2. Technical solutions exist to reduce CO2 emission and stabilise atmospheric CO2 concentration, including energy savingand energy efficiency, switch to lower carbon content fuels like natural gas and to energy sources that operate with zero CO2 emissions such as renewable or nuclear energy, enhance the natural sinks for CO2 (forests, soils, etc.), and last but not least, sequester CO2 from fossil fuels combustion. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the technology and costfor capture and storage of CO2. Some of the factors that will influence application, including environmental impact, costand efficiency, are also discussed. Capturing CO2 and storing it in underground geological reservoirs appears as the best environmentally acceptable option. It can be done with existing technology; however, substantial R&amp;D is needed to improveavailable technology and to lower the cost. Applicable to large CO2 emitting industrial facilities such as power plants, cementfactories, steel industry, etc., which amount to more than 30% of the global anthropogenic CO2 emission, it represents a valuabletool in the battle against global warming. © 2003 Académie des sciences.

To produce the radiological picture a screen film combination is conventionally used. One of the inherent limitations of screen- film combination is the fact that the detection, display and storage processes are one and the same, making it impossible to separately optimize each stage. These limitations can be overcome with digital systems. In this work we evaluate the main characteristics of digital detectors available on the market and we compare the performance of digital and conventional systems. Digital mammography, due to the possibility to process images, offers many potential advantages, among these the possibility to introduce the dual-energy technique which employs the composition of two digital images obtained with two different energies to enhance the inherent contrast of pathologies by removing the uniform background. This technique was previously tested by using synchrotron monochromatic beam and a digital detector, and then the Senographe 2000D fullfield digital system manufactured by GE Medical Systems.

The tests have been conducted at the Blowdown and Condensation Loop in the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute using a prototypic steam sparger. The major test parameters include amount of air mass and air temperature in the discharge line, valve opening time, steam mass flow rate, and water temperature and level in the In-Containment Refueling Water Storage Tank. The hydrodynamic loads induced by the air clearing phenomenon during typical operating conditions seem to be dependent on the valve opening time, steam mass flow rate, submergence of a sparger, and distance between the sparger and the structure. The effect of the amount of air mass in the discharge line and the water temperature to the peak load seems to be negligible for a given range of parameters. The hydrodynamic load induced by the prototypic steam sparger was less than those expected in a BWR and the steam sparger tested in this program can be used satisfactorily for the APR1400. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Air bubble; APR1400; B&C loop; Hydrodynamic load; IRWST; Steam sparger","Bubble formation; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Hydrodynamics; Loads (forces); Loss of coolant accidents; Natural frequencies; Parameter estimation; Pressure effects; Reactor refueling; Storage (materials); Thermal effects; Air bubbles; Flow rate; Hydrodynamic loads; Steam spargers; Water tanks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0348220709

As shown in this paper, aggressively scaled silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS is a promising technology for SoCs for several reasons: Transistor scaling leads to active power reduction in the sub-50-nm-channel-length regime, standard interconnect supports the high-quality passive devices essential to communications circuitry, and high-speed analog circuits on SOI are state of the art in terms of both performance and power dissipation.

The nc-Si dots fabricated at temperatures of ∼ 120°C show relatively strong emissions in the visible range of 1.3-2.0 eV. The PL peak energy systematically shifts to lower energy from 1. 75eV to 1.45eV by increasing the deposition period, which is due to the size distribution of nc-Si dots. On the other hand, the PL efficiency depends on both the deposition period and subsequent oxidation methods such as the storage in air, and pure water and HCl acid rinse treatments. The PL efficiency is markedly improved by the pure water rinse rather than by the storage in air, although a prolonged water rinse deteriorates the PL efficiency. On the other hand, the HCl acid rinse results in marked enhancement of PL efficiency with high stability. The effects of deposition conditions and surface treatment on the PL efficiency, stability and optical properties are demonstrated.","nc-Si dots; Photoluminescence; rf PE-CVD; SiCl4; Surface oxidation","Atomic force microscopy; Attenuation; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Monochromators; Oxidation; Photoluminescence; Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition; Silicon; Surface treatment; Transmission electron microscopy; Ultraviolet radiation; Nanocrystalline silicon dots; Surface oxidation; Nanostructured materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0348156936

Siliques were studied 30 d after flowering, when rapid lipid accumulation is occurring in the seeds. (a) By using microsensors, oxygen concentrations were measured within seeds and in the silique space between seeds. At ambient external oxygen (21% [v/v]) in the light, oxygen fell to 17% (v/v) between and 0.8% (v/v) within seeds. A step-wise reduction of the external oxygen concentration led within 2 h to a further decrease of internal oxygen concentrations, and a step-wise increase of the external oxygen concentration up to 60% (v/v) resulted in an increase in internal oxygen that rose to 30% (v/v) between and 8% (v/v) within seeds. (b) The increase in oxygen levels in the seeds was accompanied by a progressive increase in the levels of ATP, UTP, and the ATP to ADP and UTP to UDP ratios over the entire range from 0% to 60% (v/v) external oxygen. (c) To investigate metabolic fluxes in planta, 14C-sucrose was injected into seeds, which remained otherwise intact within their siliques. The increase in oxygen in the seeds was accompanied by a progressive increase in the rate of lipid (including triacylglycerol), protein and cell wall synthesis, and an increase in glycolytic flux over a range from sub- to superambient oxygen concentrations. In contrast to lipid synthesis, starch synthesis was not significantly increased at superambient oxygen levels. The levels of fermentation products such as lactate and glycerol-3P increased only at very low (0%-4% [v/v]) external oxygen concentrations. (d) When 14C-acetate or 14C-acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) was injected into seeds, label incorporation into triacylglycerol progressively increased over the whole range of external oxygen concentrations from 0% to 60% (v/v). (e) Stimulation of lipid synthesis was accompanied by an increase in sugar levels and a decrease in the levels of hexose-phosphates and acetyl-CoA, indicating sucrose unloading and the use of acetyl-CoA as possible regulatory sites. (f) Increased lipid synthesis was also accompanied by an increase in the maximal activities of invertase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase. (g) The developmental shift from starch to lipid storage between 15 and 45 d after flowering was accompanied by an increase in the seed energy state. (h) The results show that at ambient oxygen levels, the oxygen supply is strongly limiting for energy metabolism and biosynthetic fluxes in growing rape seeds, affecting lipid synthesis more strongly than starch synthesis. The underlying mechanisms and implications for strategies to increase yield and storage product composition in oilseed crops are discussed.",,"Adenosinetriphosphate; Biosynthesis; Glycerol; Lipids; Metabolism; Microsensors; Oxygen; Seed; Starch; Cell wall; Plants (botany); Brassica; Brassica napus; Brassica napus; Sinapis arvensis; Spermatophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347682443

The objective was to assess the feasibility of waste storage in open areas for later energy utilization, and to study the physical, biological and chemical processes that occur during storage, by monitoring a number of parameters. One monitored IND pile showed an increase in temperature from an average of 49±10 to 73±7°C, accompanied by considerable fluctuations in the waste mass interstitial oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations during the first month of storage. Thereafter, steady-state conditions were registered for about 4 months, with an average pile temperature of 77±8°C, interstitial oxygen concentration varying from below the detection limit up to 5% by volume, interstitial carbon dioxide concentrations varying from 0.2 to 18%, and interstitial methane concentrations varying from below detection limit up to 0.5%. After 6 months of storage, spontaneous combustion occurred in the monitored IND pile. This was preceded by strong winds, which ventilated the pile and increased its oxygen content. Spontaneous combustion was also observed in one RDF pile after the same storage time (about 6 months). The leachate produced as a result of the large quantity of water used in an attempt to douse the burning RDF pile showed higher concentrations of chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total oxidized nitrogen, total phosphorus and the heavy metals lead, cadmium and chromium than the median values in the leachate from municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill and from MSW incineration residues (50% fly ash) landfill.

The three different acid invertase isoforms named as A-I, A-II and A-III were identified at late grand growth stage of cane development, whereas only one neutral invertase isoform was detected at maturity stage of cane growth. The final purification achieved for A-I, A-II, A-III and neutral invertase isoform was 37, 45, 7 and 17-fold, respectively. The optimum pH values for A-I, A-II, A-III and neutral isoform were observed to be 5.0, 4.5, 4.5 and 7.0, respectively. Apparent Michaelis constant i.e. Km, of different acidic isoforms at its optimum pH and temperature varied from 50.0 to 83.3 mM. For neutral invertase isoform, Km, value was 44.0mM at its optimum pH and temperature. The highest Vmax/Km value of A-I isoform indicates the maximum kinetic perfection of this isoform and it may be the major vacuolar enzyme involved in sucrose hydrolysis. From the study of effect of temperature on Km, and Vmax values of neutral invertase isoform, the enthalpy change, entropy change and energy of activation were observed to be -21.1 kJ mol-1, -40.5 JK-1 mol-1, and 42.5 kJmol-1, respectively. Among the different metal ions tested, manganese chloride strongly inhibited the activity of all soluble acid invertase isoforms and thus, may be utilized to induce early maturity and controlling sucrose inversion in sugarcane thereby increasing sugar recovery.","Invertase inhibitors; Invertase Isoforms; Kinetics; Sucrose Storage; Sugarcane","Arundinaria; Saccharum hybrid cultivar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347301613

Using a LiNi0.74Co0.2Al0.06O 2 cathode with low basicity, the laminated thin Li-ion batteries provided high energy density, long cycle life, and very low swelling. It was demonstrated that the prototype laminated thin Li-ion battery with a thickness of 3.8 mm achieved the energy densities of 200 Wh/kg and 407 Wh/1. The value of pH (definition is in experimental section) for LiNi0.74Co 0.02Al0.06O2 should be less than 11 for the practical application because of a long cycle life of 500 cycles and very low swelling at an even high temperature of 85°C. Native alkaline impurities in LiNi0.8-yCo0.2AlyO2led to CO 2 gas evolution and cycle degradation. The results of impedance and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements for LiNi0.74Co 0.2Al0.06O2 and LiCoO2 indicated that the surface film formation on LiNi0.74Co0.02Al 0.06O2 cathode is more inactive and thermally stable than that of LiCoO2 cathode. The films formation on LiNi 0.8-yCo0.2AlyO2 cathode suppressed further oxidation of the electrolyte and the gas evolution at high-temperature condition.","Film Formation; Laminated Thin Li-ion Battery; LiNi0.8-yCo0.2AlyO2 Cathode","Cathodes; Degradation; Electrolytes; Ethylene; Film preparation; High temperature effects; Impurities; Lithium alloys; Oxidation; pH effects; Thermodynamic stability; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Film formation; High temperature storage; Laminate film bags; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347128084

Oxygen evolution curves showed a positive relationship between the apparent yield of photosynthetic linear electron transport and the number of active proton-pumping sites in mitochondria. Although no significant alterations of the quantitative relationships between major photosynthetic complexes were found in the mutants, 77 K fluorescence spectra showed a preferential excitation of photosystem I (PSI) compared with wild type, which was indicative of a shift toward state 2. This effect was correlated with high levels of phosphorylation of light-harvesting complex II polypeptides, indicating the preferential association of light-harvesting complex II with PSI. The transition to state 1 occurred in untreated wild-type cells exposed to PSI light or in 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea- treated cells exposed to white light. In mutants of the cytochrome pathway and in double mutants, this transition was only observed in white light in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. This suggests higher rates of non-photochemical plastoquinone reduction through the chlororespiratory pathway, which was confirmed by measurements of the complementary area above the fluorescence induction curve in dark-adapted cells. Photo-acoustic measurements of energy storage by PSI showed a stimulation of PSI-driven cyclic electron flow in the most affected mutants. The present results demonstrate that in C. reinhardtii mutants, permanent defects in the mitochondrial electron transport chain stabilize state 2, which favors cyclic over linear electron transport in the chloroplast.",,"Complexation; Fluorescence; Photoacoustic effect; Photochemical reactions; Photosynthesis; Phosphorylations; Plants (botany); algae; Animalia; Chlamydomonas; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Eukaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347052748

A technique for determining the melting point from a radial distribution function that reflects the arrangement of carbon atoms has already been reported. Based on our previous study, we attempted to predict the latent heat of fusion from the internal energy. A calculation method that reflects the actual melting phenomenon was used and a precise value for the qualitative tendency of the latent heat was obtained.","Latent heat; Melting point; Molecular dynamics; N-alkane","Carbon; Computer simulation; Electric loads; Fusion reactions; Heat storage; Melting; Molecular dynamics; Molecular structure; Parameter estimation; Phase separation; X ray diffraction analysis; Latent heat; Radial distribution function; Paraffins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346959652

The U.S. concept of a radioactive waste repository involves both engineered (man-made) barriers and geologic barriers to minimize the longterm migration of waste from the repository. The minerals at Yucca Mountain are an integral part of the geologic barrier to the migration of radionuclides, and understanding the distribution of reactive and potentially sorptive minerals is crucial to modeling the long-term performance of the repository. We have determined the three-dimensional distribution of minerals at Yucca Mountain by analyzing a number of drill cores using quantitative X-ray diffraction methods. Clinoptilolite and mordenite are locally abundant in the rhyolitic tuffs in both the unsaturated and saturated zones. They formed by the alteration of glassy rhyolitic tuffs, and their occurrence is stratified, often following the distribution of nonwelded, initially vitric tuffs near and below the water table. Because of their large cation-exchange capacities, these minerals have traditionally been considered to be important in retardation of the migration of cationic radionuclides such as 137Cs and 90Sr. However, analysis of radionuclides that may be contained at Yucca Mountain reveals that, for the most part, the radioactive species of concern are not those that would be readily sorbed by natural zeolites. Although clinoptilolite and mordenite are highly selective for Cs and Sr, the half-lives of these radionuclides (∼30 years) are sufficiently short that the man-made containment at any radioactive waste repository is expected to outlive these radionuclides. The most important radionuclides are thus anionic species and long-lived actinides that often form large, complex aqueous species, both of which are not strongly sorbed by cation exchangers such as zeolites. However, zeolites play an important role in a repository at Yucca Mountain for several other reasons. Emplacement of radioactive waste will change the temperature and PH2o conditions in large volumes of rock, and zeolites will be important sources and sinks of water and thermal energy during heating and cooling in the vadose zone. In addition, dehydration/hydration reactions are accompanied by volumetric changes that can affect macroscopic rock properties. Longerterm reactions, e.g., of clinoptilolite to analcime, would give rise to larger volume reductions and production of water and silica. These studies show that the importance of zeolites extends far beyond cation exchange by zeolites to phenomena affecting the entire thermohydrologic system.",,"Actinides; Core drilling; Geological repositories; Groundwater; Landforms; Minerals; Positive ions; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Radioisotopes; Silica; Zeolites; Cation exchange capacities; High level radioactive waste repositories; Long term performance; Nuclear regulatory commission; Nuclear waste repositories; Quantitative x ray diffraction; Radioactive waste repository; Yucca Mountain , Nevada; Radioactive waste storage; mineralogy; radioactive waste; repository; source-sink dynamics; spatial distribution; temperature effect; water content; zeolite; Nevada; North America; United States; Yucca Mountain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346462892

Second, developments in conventional RAM cells and emerging cells, such as DRAM gain cells and leakage-immune SRAM cells, are discussed from the viewpoints of cell area, operating voltage, and leakage currents of MOSFETs. Third, the concepts proposed to date to reduce subthreshold current and the advantages of RAMs with respect to reducing the subthreshold current are summarized, including their applications to RAM circuits to reduce the current in standby and active modes, exemplified by DRAMs. After this, design issues in other peripheral circuits, such as sense amplifiers and low-voltage supporting circuits, are discussed, as are power management to suppress speed variations and reduce the power of power-aware systems, and testing.

Insulin resistance is due to the reduced ability of peripheral target tissues to respond properly to insulin stimulation. In particular, impaired insulin-stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis plays a significant role in insulin resistance. Glucose transport (GLUT4), phosphorylation (hexokinase) and storage (glycogen synthase) are the three potential rate-controlling steps regulating insulin-stimulated muscle glucose metabolism, and all three have been implicated as being the major defects responsible for causing insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes. Using 13C/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we demonstrate that a defect in insulin-stimulated muscle glucose transport activity is the rate-controlling defect. Using a similar 13C/31P MRS approach, we have also demonstrated that fatty acids cause insulin resistance in humans due to a decrease in insulin-stimulated muscle glucose transport activity, which could be attributed to reduced insulin-stimulated IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, a required step in insulin-stimulated glucose transport into muscle. Furthermore, we have recently proposed that this defect in insulin-stimulated muscle glucose transport activity may be due to the activation of a serine kinase cascade involving protein kinase Cθ and IKK-β, which are key downstream mediators of tissue inflammation. Finally, we propose that any perturbation that leads to an increase in intramyocellular lipid (fatty acid metabolites) content such as acquired or inherited defects in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, defects in adipocyte fat metabolism or simply increased fat delivery to muscle/liver due to increased energy intake will lead to insulin resistance through this final common pathway.

Here, a systematic study was carried out to clarify the effects of two key alloying elements, Nb and Al, on the microstructure and the dehydrogenation behaviour of the MgH2. Intensive mechanical alloying was carried out to synthesise (MgH2 + M) powder mixtures (M=Nb, Al). XRD Rietveld analysis revealed the formation of a new bcc phase in the (MgH2+Nb) mixture and a (Al, Mg) solid solution in the (MgH2+Al) mixture. The amount of the newly formed phase in each case increased with milling time, while the level of Nb or Al decreases. SEM analysis of the milled powders showed the existence of nano-particles within 20 hours of milling. Thermogravimetry (TG) results showed that the mechanically alloyed (MgH2+Nb) mixture released about 3.9 mass% H2 and the milled (MgH2 + Al) about 5.4 mass% H2 at 300°C within 10 minutes, compared with only 1.5 mass% of the milled MgH2 powder and 1.0 mass% of the as-received MgH2 under the same conditions.","Hydrogen storage; Magnesium hydride; Mechanical alloying","Ball milling; Crystal microstructure; Dehydrogenation; Hydrides; Mechanical alloying; Nanostructured materials; Powder metals; Reaction kinetics; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction analysis; High energy ball milling; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium hydride; Powder mixtures; Rietveld analysis; Structural stability; Magnesium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346038806

The release of phosphorus occurred in all the treatments, and this process was accelerated in darkness when the redox potential was lowered. Low redox potential in darkness stimulated the accumulation of polyphosphate (PolyP) and the degradation of polyglucose. The synthesis of PolyP delayed the decrease of intracellular orthophosphate. The death of M. aeruginosa was slowered when the redox potential was low in darkness. The accumulation of PolyP under low redox potential in the dark was very important to M. aeruginosa for endurance through the unfavorable growth conditions for maintaining phosphorus concentration, energy storage, and other physiological functions. The ability to accumulate PolyP in the dark and negative redox potential may be of considerable advantage in the low-light, organically rich, and low-redox habitats.","Darkness; Microcystis aeruginosa; Phosphorus; Polyphosphate; Redox potential","Energy storage; Growth kinetics; Metabolism; Phosphates; Phosphorus; Physiology; Synthesis (chemical); Redox potential; Microbiology; metabolism; phosphorus; redox potential; Microcystis; Microcystis aeruginosa; Microcystis aeruginosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345832307

With the progress of defoliation treatments over 12 weeks, the swards degraded with decreasing tiller density, lamina production, and mass of stubble and stolons. Defoliation tolerance in terms of tiller survival was influenced only by defoliation frequency (D1 ≈ D2 &lt; D4), with no significant effect of nitrogen fertilizer rate. There were no differences in survival ability of tillers among age cohorts formed before the defoliation treatments, suggesting that all tillers in bahiagrass were able to share energy and nutrients in connecting stolons under severe defoliation. It was confirmed that stolons play a key role in defoliation tolerance in bahiagrass as the main storage organ supporting aboveground parts, whereas the contribution of roots seems nil.","Defoliation tolerance; Lamina production; Paspalum notatum; Stubble-stolon-root system; Tiller survival","defoliation; fertilizer application; grassland; nitrogen; survival; Lamiinae; Paspalum; Paspalum notatum; Paspalum notatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345377769

In this work, we investigated a pulse charge mode to generate an enhanced pulsed electron beam from a 10-gap pseudospark device. In the pulse charge mode, pulsed high voltage is applied to the device. Using the pulse charge mode, we could obtain enhanced electron beams in wider ranges of voltage and pressure than in the self-discharge or the trigger mode. We achived a maximum efficiency of enhanced electron beams at 3 × 10-1 mbar of Ar gas. Under this best pressure condition, we also observed well-focused electron beams with a diameter of down to 0.1 mm, peak current of up to 130 A, and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 10 ns.

It is again being claimed that hydrogen will be a widely available, clean, safe fuel. This article argues that such expectations are almost certainly illusory. Hydrogen, like electricity, is not an energy resource but an energy carrier. It takes more energy to extract hydrogen from water than burning the hydrogen can ever provide. There are also inevitable losses in storage, transmission, and final mechanical or heating applications. The question then turns on the efficiency-and safety-of the entire chain of conversion, from the energy source (fossil, solar, or other) to the final use. Moreover, energy sources (preferably renewable, for the long term) can be used for the direct creation of electricity, which can be introduced into the existing grid without requiring a vast investment in a new hydrogen distribution system. In addition, a hydrogen-based system would be unacceptably dangerous. This report will present a detailed technical and economic analysis of the problems with the proposed hydrogen economy and the advantages of some alternatives, principally electricity-based. A hypothetical case of what would be required for a hydrogen filling station serving the general public is closely examined. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, they are particularly used in the storage of gaseous combustibles and in the removal of air-pollutants. It is generally admitted that porosity and surface chemistry are the main parameters influencing the adsorptive properties of this type of material. Thus, the interactions between a solute and a solid sorbent are important factors in the understanding of adsorption phenomenon. These interactions are governed by the nature of the chemical sites at the surface of a material and their accessibility. Many methods have been developed to determine porosity data and chemical structure of the material of interest. The present study deals with the different methods which have been developed with the aim of understanding the interactions that occur in the adsorption process of a solute and carbonaceous adsorbents. These tools of surface investigations are based on physicochemical and thermodynamic methods. The present study demonstrates the contribution of the linear solvation energy relationship approach in the understanding of gas-solid interactions.

After delayed CA, fruit were stored for up to 6 months in 3% CO 2 + 1% O2 at 0°C. Fruit stored without delay had a high incidence of flesh and core browning and cavities, whereas delayed CA-fruit had only a very low incidence of flesh browning and no incidence of core browning and cavities. No significant losses of flesh firmness, acidity, skin colour and soluble solids contents between treatments were detected. Fruit subjected to delayed CA had higher ethylene production and respiration activity during the first 2 months of storage and higher ATP concentrations in the fruit tissue. A higher adenylate energy charge was maintained during storage, indicating a higher energy status in delayed CA-fruit. Delayed CA-fruit showed higher contents of total and free fatty acids and polar lipids than fruit stored in CA without delay. The results suggest that by delaying CA storage conditions, 'Conference' pears can become adapted to CA during the early stages of the storage period, making them more resistant to browning disorders. Reasons for this may be found in the energy status of fruit and integrity of membranes which may play an important role in this adaptation process. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This report on obesity is the third in a series of six synthesis reports written for health professionals. Obesity is a condition in which abnormal or excessive fat accumulation in adipose tissue impairs health. Obesity is defined in adults as a body mass index above 30 (kg/m2). Obesity is one of the most visible, but until recently, most neglected public health problems. The current high prevalence (the percentage of the population who are obese) of obesity and the rapid increase in prevalence in the last 20 years has been referred to as an 'epidemic'. 'Globesity' is now a major, worldwide public health problem and is a reflection of profound social, economic and cultural changes. Paradoxically, in many countries, the huge increase in the prevalence of obesity has occurred over the same time period that energy intakes have decreased, thus demonstrating increasingly sedentary lifestyles. The other fundamental cause of the obesity epidemic is the over-consumption of high-fat energy-dense diets. However, not everyone exposed to this 'obesigenic' environment becomes obese. We do not yet know the aetiology of particular eating and lifestyle behaviours nor why the body's regulatory systems might respond more appropriately in some individuals than in others. Some of the factors may be genetic. The aim of this report, which focuses on obesity in adults, is to bring together in a user-friendly format the progress and results of recent and ongoing European Union funded projects. To put this work in context, some background information of particular relevance to health professionals is also provided.","Body mass index; EU research; Fat; FLAIR-FLOW; Obesity","fat; adipose tissue; aging; article; body mass; body weight; caloric intake; cultural factor; dietary intake; economic aspect; European Union; fat intake; food preference; genome analysis; health practitioner; heredity; human; Internet; lifestyle; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; obesity; prevalence; priority journal; public health; social aspect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344583758

Glucocorticoids, which play a major role in energy mobilisation, were measured in consecutive blood samples from free-ranging adults at approximately monthly intervals throughout the year. Glucose and free fatty acids were also measured in some samples. Plasma concentrations of glucocorticoids rose significantly during the first 30 min after capture, accompanied by a rise in free fatty acids, but no corresponding increase in glucose concentrations. We observed a strong pattern in plasma glucocorticoids in samples collected within 15 min of capture (indicative of pre-disturbance concentrations) in different phases of the annual reproductive cycle, with significantly higher levels in both males and females in the breeding season compared to the non-breeding season. These data, and the decline in tail fat stores that occur towards the end of the mating period (around October), suggest that platypus experience high-energy demands during this phase of reproduction. Plasma glucocorticoid concentrations in females sampled during the lactation period (October-February) were relatively low, and similar to those in females sampled in the non-breeding, non-lactation period (March-June). The latter requires further investigation as results may have been influenced by sampling limitations. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

FAS is a multifunctional enzyme that synthesizes palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. GLUT1 is a transmembrane protein normally expressed in perineurium and erythrocytes-FAS and GLUT1 expression have been recently described in many aggressive tumors. We explored the immunohistochemical expression of FAS and GLUT1 in bladder carcinomas to reveal statistical associations with clinico-pathological features and recurrence. Materials and Methods: Thirty-one node-and distant metastasis-negative transitional cell carcinomas from patients with a five-year follow-up were evaluated for FAS and GLUT1 expression. Results: Univariate analysis showed that low-grade, pTa stage and FAS-negative expression were associated with indolent tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that FAS expression (p=0.006) and pT1-2 stage tumors (p=0.001) were independent predictors of recurrence. Conclusion: Endogenous fatty acids are an exploitable storage of energy for aggressive human bladder carcinomas.

Therefore, we have investigated the degradation of Pb(Ti,Zr)O3 (PZT) films by thermally stimulated current (TSC) measurement. The TSC has been utilized for the analysis of defects in bulk semiconductor materials. However, TSC evaluation in ferroelectric films has not been studied sufficiently because of the noise current from films and the fluctuation in the calculated trap activation energy. Therefore, we have developed and optimized a modified TSC measurement method that involves a repetition of heating and cooling cycles. Our modified method has enabled the elimination of the noise current due to pyroelectric and leakage currents and the detection of a clear TSC signal from crystalline defects. The activation energy can also be analyzed through the comparison of TSCs for several specimens subjected to various degradation treatments, such as fatigue and the introduction of lead and oxygen defects. Identical trap levels of (I) 0.75 eV and (II) 0.95 eV were observed for these films, and the latter seems to be related to the degradation since the densities of trap (II) increased in all of the degraded films. It is believed that trap (II) is attributed to Pb defects. Therefore, we propose the following degradation mechanism: polarization reversal induces crystalline defects, and the trap level of a Pb site increases with the presence of the defects. The degradation of ferroelectric properties seems to occur because of the existence of the trap.","Defect; Fatigue; Ferroelectric thin film; Lead zirconium titanate; Pyroelectric current; PZT; Sputtering; Thermally stimulated current; Trap density; TSC","Activation energy; Capacitors; Crystal defects; Crystalline materials; Degradation; Fatigue of materials; Ferroelectric materials; Leakage currents; Polarization; Pyroelectricity; Random access storage; Semiconducting lead compounds; Ferroelectric random access memory; Ferroelectric thin film; Lead zirconate titanate; Pyroelectric current; Thermally stimulated current measurement; Thin film capacitor; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344309164

In developing methods that will have general applicability, one must ascertain first what the general features of life might be that, when present, would provide strong inference of the presence of active life.We propose here that the tendency of life to be associated with energetic gradients, in fact to create its own gradients via the catalytic consumption of nutrients and oxidants, and the production of waste products, is one of the general features of active extant life. As life seeks out and creates such gradients, layered microbial communities, or LMCs, result that are in their own way, prima facie biosignatures. These LMCs are abundant, perhaps ubiquitous in physically stratified environments on our own planet. If energy flows through a given system, and if life has developed efficient catalytic methods to utilize this energy, then LMCs are predicted to be present. Here we discuss the general issues of what can be gleaned from the study of LMCs in terms of energy flow, carbon flow, and carbon storage in earthly ecosystems, as well as the philosophy of using LMCs as biosignatures in the search for life on Earth, and perhaps, in extraterrestrial sites. © 1997 Taylor & Francis.","Geochemical gradients; Layered microbial communities; Life detection; Organic carbon burial efficiency; Sediment diagenesis","carbon; geochemistry; microbial community; origin of life",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344099392

One implication is that the normally robust negative feedback system that controls energy homeostasis must be responding to different inputs than in the past. In this review we discuss the influence of gender on the efficacy of adiposity hormones as they interact with food intake control systems in the brain. Specifically, the levels of insulin and leptin in the blood are correlated with body fat, insulin being related mainly to visceral fat and leptin to subcutaneous fat. Since females carry more fat subcutaneously and males carry more fat viscerally, leptin correlates better with total body fat in females and insulin correlates better in males. High visceral fat and plasma insulin are also risk factors for the complications of obesity, including type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular problems, and certain cancers, and these are more prevalent in males. Consistent with these systemic differences, the brains of females are more sensitive to the catabolic actions of low doses of leptin whereas the brains of males are more sensitive to the catabolic action of low doses of insulin. The implications of this are discussed.","Gender difference; Leptin; Obesity; Subcutaneous fat; Visceral fat","leptin; body fat; conference paper; energy balance; hormonal regulation; human; hypothalamus; lipid storage; nonhuman; obesity; sex difference; subcutaneous fat; tissue distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242694039

The carbon-fiber chips are effective for improving the heat transfer rate in PCMs. However, the thermal resistance near the heat transfer surface is higher than that for the carbon brushes. As a result, the overall heat transfer rate for the fiber chips is lower than that for the carbon brushes. Consequently, the carbon brushes are superior to the fiber chips for the thermal conductivity enhancement under the present experimental conditions. The carbon brushes are moreover applied to the packed beds of particles to overcome their low thermal conductivity in chemical heat pump/storage. The carbon brushes essentially improve the heat transfer characteristics in the packed beds, though the thermal resistance is observed because the particles obstruct contact between the fibers and the heat transfer surfaces. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Freshly ejaculated spermatozoa had a high adenylate energy charge (AEC = 0.8), which decreased to 0.6 under aerobic conditions and to 0.2 under anaerobic conditions. Correspondingly, no ATP resonances but high AMP resonance were visible in 31 P-NMR-spectra of the spermatozoa. When an artificial oxygen buffer (Fluosol) and a purpose-built air supply system were used during 31 P-NMR data acquisition, ATP resonances reappeared whereas the AMP resonance disappeared. Boar spermatozoa kept under aerobic conditions have intracellular compartments that differ markedly in pH, as demonstrated by both 31 P-NMR spectroscopy and confocal microscopy. Using confocal microscopy, the midpiece of the flagellum in which all mitochondria are located was identified as an acidic compartment (pHi-mp 6.7). The intracellular pH of both the head (pHi-h) and the long principal piece of the flagellum (pHi-pp) were 7.2 and, thus, only slightly below the extracellular pH (pHe 7.3). Storage of spermatozoa in a glucose-free medium at 15°C when they are immotile slowly shifted the pHi-mp from 6.7 to 6.9 within 20 h, whereas pHi-h and pHi-pp remained unchanged (pH 7.1-7. 2). When glucose was present in the medium, all visible compartments of the spermatozoa as well as the medium were acidified to pH 6.2 within 20 h.

They are building blocks for nucleic acid synthesis, an energy source, precursors for the synthesis of primary products, such as sucrose, polysaccharides, phospholipids, as well as secondary products. Therefore, biosynthesis and metabolism of nucleotides are of fundamental importance in the growth and development of plants. Nucleotides are synthesized both from amino acids and other small molecules via de novo pathways, and from preformed nucleobases and nucleosides by salvage pathways. In this article the biosynthesis, interconversion and degradation of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides in higher plants are reviewed. This description is followed by an examination of physiological aspects of nucleotide metabolism in various areas of growth and organized development in plants, including embryo maturation and germination, in vitro organogenesis, storage organ development and sprouting, leaf senescence, and cultured plant cells. The effects of environmental factors on nucleotide metabolism are also described.

The role of this deep-rooting vegetation in the hydrological cycle is unknown. We studied the water dynamics of this vegetation with emphasis on the deeper soil by means of a soil water model. The soil hydraulic properties were optimized in an inverse modeling procedure using the soil water model Hydras-1D providing rainfall, actual evapotranspiration (Ea) determined with the Bowen ratio energy balance method (BREB), rooting depth, and distribution, as well as the in situ control measurements of soil water pressure head and soil moisture. In 1997, Ea according to BREB measurements amounted to 1174 mm, in 1998 this was 1475 mm. Modeled drainage at a 10-m depth in the 2 yr was 951 and 1016 mm, respectively. The model indicated that around 27% of the soil water was taken up below the 0.9-m depth in the 2-yr study period. During the severe 1997 dry season, according to the soil water model E a was reduced drastically, as the soil water storage was depleted. According to micrometeorological measurements, however, Ea was not reduced as extremely. This difference might be due to general uncertainties of the soil water model as well as BREB measurements. On the other hand, formation and subsequent evaporation of early morning dew apparently contributed to E a, which was not considered in the soil water model. In general, besides slightly lower interception, the water budget of a young secondary vegetation did not differ from that reported for Amazonian primary forest.",,"Drying; Evapotranspiration; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Rain; Vegetation; Energy balance; Soils; Bowen ratio; evapotranspiration; numerical model; soil moisture; soil water; vegetation; water uptake; Amazon; South America; Hydridae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242507500

CFD calculations of three inlet designs with different inlet flow rates were carried out to illustrate the varying behaviour of the thermal conditions in a solar store. The results showed the impact of the inlet design on the flow patterns in the tank and thus how the energy quality in a hot water tank is reduced with a poor inlet design. The numerical investigations were followed by experiments. A test solar store, similar to the store investigated by numerical modelling was constructed with cylindrical transparent walls so that the flow structures due to the inlet jets could be visualized. With the three inlets, nine draw-off tests with different inlet flow rates were carried out and the temperature stratification in the tank was measured during the draw-offs. The experimental results were used in an analysis using the first and second law of thermodynamics. The results showed how the entropy changes and the exergy changes in the storage during the draw-offs influenced by the Richardson number, the volume draw-off and the initial tank conditions. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The reaction entails a reversible Li-driven displacement process leading to the growth and disappearance of Cu dendrites with a concomitant reversible decomposition and recrystallization of the initial electrode material. We show from structural considerations that the uniqueness of Cu2.33V4O11 is rooted in the peculiar flexibility of the stacked [V4O11]n layers, which is due to the presence of pivot oxygen atoms. Fully reversible displacement reactions could provide a new direction for developing an alternative class of higher energy density Li storage electrodes.",,"Crystallization; Decomposition; Electrochemical electrodes; Electronic density of states; Extrusion; Lithium batteries; Redox reactions; Secondary batteries; Displacement process; Extrusion-insertion electrode; Higher energy density; Rechargeable lithium batteries; Copper",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242495034

It is used to predict the transient boundary conditions, which produce a prescribed interfacial surface motion and heat transfer. The formulation calculates the required boundary temperature to provide a specified velocity of the phase interface during solid-liquid phase transition. A control-volume-based finite element method is employed for the numerical solution of the energy conservation equation. The finite element framework provides a novel alternative to other inverse techniques based on structured grids. The effects of Stefan number and interface velocity on the solidification processes will be investigated. Numerical examples are presented and discussed for one-dimensional and two-dimensional solidification problems. The accuracy and performance of the formulation are assessed by comparisons with analytical solutions. Based on the model's capability of efficiently providing stable and accurate results, it is viewed to be a worthy design tool in practical engineering applications such as thermal energy storage and materials processing, such as casting and extrusion processes. © 2003 by R.

The overall efficiency based on the annual energy balance excluding the photovoltaic efficiency varied from 51% to 64%. The battery bank was able to supply energy to the load for three days in the absence of solar radiation. Around 50-52% of the demands were delivered by the battery. In addition, another 20-25% of the demand was supplied by the fuel cell, which indicates that the energy should be stored in a long-term storage system.

Between 1998 and 2001, 18 Phenix prostheses were implanted in 15 pediatric patients who had been diagnosed and treated for osteosarcoma about the knee. Of the 15 original prostheses, 10 were implanted at the time of primary tumor resection and five were revisions from an endoprosthetic modular knee system. Sixty expansions of the 18 prostheses were done, with all but two done as outpatient procedures. An average 8.5 mm was obtained per lengthening (range, 1-30 mm). The average followup was 21.5 months (range, 12-33 months) and the latest Musculoskeletal Tumor Society functional scores averaged 90%. Eight revisions were required for stem fracture or loosening. There was one amputation because of a postoperative arterial thrombosis. The principle of the Phenix prosthesis involves storage of energy in a spring compressed by a locking system. Lengthening is achieved via exposure to an electromagnetic field that allows controlled release of the spring. This is a unique expandable custom prosthesis that offers many benefits in maintaining limb length equality in growing patients. Although the early experience is promising, additional data are required regarding the long-term structural integrity of the prosthesis. We are optimistic that this technology will prove beneficial, not only for patients with malignant bone tumors but in applications requiring serial limb length equalizations or for spinal deformities.",,"adolescent; artery thrombosis; bone maturation; bone tumor; clinical article; compression therapy; conference paper; endoprosthesis; endoprosthetic modular knee system; energy; female; follow up; human; leg length; limb salvage; male; muscle length; musculoskeletal system; noninvasive expandable prosthesis; outpatient; postoperative period; priority journal; prosthesis; school child; scoring system; spine malformation; structure analysis; surgical technique",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242289321

All soils showed very low permeability to applied water. The mechanical impact of water droplets enhanced soil dispersion and further lowered their infiltration capacity, particularly for high clay plus silt content soils that showed the poorest results. As a consequence, high runoff and sediment losses were also measured, primarily with the first irrigation. More moderate losses were observed thereafter. Soils with higher sand particle size fractions better absorbed the energy impact of droplets and showed higher infiltration rates and lower runoff and sediment losses. Polyacrylamide (PAM) applied to the soils through the irrigation water acted as a binding and settling agent to increase soils aggregate stability and infiltration and reduce runoff and sediment losses. Slope increase, from 2.5 to 5%, decreased overall soils infiltration by 7% and increased runoff and sediment losses by 10 and 27%, respectively. Exposed to the same change in slope, PAM application boosted overall infiltration of treated soils to a 24% difference and increased runoff by only 10%. It had a less positive effect on sediment loss, the 5% slope being responsible for a 52% increase. In agreement with this the tests showed that, compared to the control, exposure of PAM-treated soil on 2.5 and 5% slopes enhanced overall infiltration to 457 and 642% respectively, reduced runoff by 25% on both cases and lessened sediment loss by 39 and 27%. The demonstrated ability of PAM to influence surface soil conditions of specific soils can be used to reduce the environmental risks associated with the intensive use of sprinkler irrigation in Southern Portugal. It offers a safe, practical and non-intrusive management alternative to current costly, labour- and energy-intensive practices of increasing the number of machine turns and building storage basins to control runoff and soil erosion. © 2003 Silsoe Research Institute.

The secondary intention of the 2×2 experiments is to reduce the H/U ratio and increase the waste material/U ratio from previously published experiments. These experiments were designed to supply data for interlaced waste material/fuel/moderator systems on the thermal region. The experiments contained silicon dioxide (SiO2), aluminum (Al), and iron (Fe) mixed with 93.23% enriched uranium and moderated and reflected by polyethylene. This analysis systematically examines uncertainties associated with the critical experiments as they affect the calculated multiplication factor. The systematic analysis is separated into uncertainties due to mass measurements, uncertainties due to fabrication, and uncertainties due to composition. Each type of uncertainty is analyzed individually, and a total combined uncertainty is derived. The SiO2-HEU experiment had a measured keff of 0.993, the Al-HEU experiment had a measured keff of 0.990, and the Fe-HEU experiment had a measured keff of 1.000. The calculated keff values tend to agree well with the experimental values.

The design process is divided into two stages. In the first stage, an output slot-cam is designed in order to generate decoupled fine motions of the output link. The issue is formulated as an optimization problem where the output link dimensions are optimized to minimize the resultant pin forces subject to an adequate transmission angle. In the second stage, the input slot-cam is designed to achieve that kinetic energy of the elastic gasket on the container lid is absorbed at a uniform rate. Finally, a numerical example and computer simulations are given to demonstrate the results of design process.

The ""input-output"" model relates main climatic data and operating conditions of the solar distillation system with distilled water output in daily and night base with linear equations using characteristic coefficients. Evaluation of the method is performed in three steps, the first being experimental determination of the coefficients followed by prediction of output, the second being calculation of coefficient values through analytical relations and the third being the use of the model in a continuous way. The agreement between the predicted and experimental water production and also between experimental and theoretical values of the characteristic parameters reveals the validity and suitability of the developed method. Furthermore, the validity of the method is also proved for the case of the theoretical and experimental variation of the depth of still basin water.

They use the earth as a heat source when operating in heating mode, with a fluid (usually water or a water-antifreeze mixture) as the medium that transfers the heat from the earth to the evaporator of the heat pump, thus utilising geothermal energy. In cooling mode, they use the earth as a heat sink. With Borehole Heat Exchangers (BHE), geothermal heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling at virtually any location, with great flexibility to meet any demands. More than 20 years of R&D focusing on BHE in Europe has resulted in a well-established concept of sustainability for this technology, as well as sound design and installation criteria. Recent developments are the Thermal Response Test, which allows in-situ-determination of ground thermal properties for design purposes, and thermally enhanced grouting materials to reduce borehole thermal resistance. For cooling purposes, but also for the storage of solar or waste heat, the concept of underground thermal energy storage (UTES) could prove successful. Systems can be either open (aquifer storage) or can use BHE (borehole storage). Whereas cold storage is already established on the market, heat storage, and, in particular, high temperature heat storage (> 50 °C) is still in the demonstration phase. Despite the fact that geothermal heat pumps have been in use for over 50 years now (the first were in the USA), market penetration of this technology is still in its infancy, with fossil fuels dominating the space heating market and air-to-air heat pumps that of space cooling. In Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, France and the USA, large numbers of geothermal heat pumps are already operational, and installation guidelines, quality control and contractor certification are now major issues of debate. © 2003 CNR.

Livers from male Brown Norway rats were preserved (UW) for 10h either by cold storage (CS) or by hypothermic oxygenated perfusion extracorporal (HOPE). Transhepatic photometric analysis allowed determination of the redox status of mitochondrial cytochromes during preservation, rewarming and reperfusion. Mitochondrial electron chain carriers were inhibited at different sites with rotenone and cyanide in some experiments. reversed transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed after reperfusion concerning transcription of TNFα, caspase 9, and c-jun kinase (JNK). Increased superoxide anion formation as well as transcription of TNFα, caspase 9, and JNK during reperfusion after cold storage (CS) were related with completely reduced cytochromes before and during reperfusion. In contrast, hypothermic oxygenated livers (HOPE) showed oxygenated cytochromes as well as decreased superoxide anion formation and no detectable transcription of TNFα, caspase 9, and JNK. A similar low level of superoxide anion formation was found when electron chain transfer of cold stored livers was inhibited during reperfusion with rotenone but not with cyanide. After hypothermic oxygenation (HOPE) inhibition of mitochondrial electron chain with rotenone showed no change in formation of superoxide anion formation whereas inhibition with cyanide showed increased superoxide anion formation. Thus mitochondrial cytochrome redox status is suggested to be related: (i) with the release of reactive oxygen substances as well as (ii) with the expressions of TNFα, caspase 9, and JNK during reperfusion and may thus be usable as predictive marker of liver grafts. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

They allow architects to combine completely transparent external facades with an internal skin, which can also be transparent, or partially opaque. Between both skins there is an air channel that is used to collect or evacuate the solar radiation absorbed by the facade. This design may be a solution for reducing thermal overheating, which is common in completely transparent facades in Mediterranean climates. A numerical code was developed to analyze and predict the thermal behaviour of these facades. This code was applied to the analysis of the 'standard' geometry of a double-skin facade. A parametric study was carried out for typical Mediterranean climates to determine the influence of different variables, such as the position of blinds, the introduction of solid-liquid phase-change materials (PCM) and the use of low-ε glazing, etc. In order to characterize the thermal performance of the facades, two coefficients were defined that relate the indoor and enthalpic gains to the solar radiation. If they are designed carefully, ventilated facades will exhibit a significantly better passive behaviour than conventional glazed facades and also allow energy to be collected in the form of hot air to be used to reduce energy consumption in winter. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The system consists of a wind farm, made up of two wind turbines and a flywheel, which operates in isolation from the conventional power grids and which supplies the energy needs of a group of eight reverse osmosis (RO) modules throughout the complete desalination process (from the pumping of sea water to the storage of the product water), as well as the energy requirements of the control subsystems. The analysis of the electrical and hydraulic results obtained from this prototype, installed on the island of Gran Canaria in the Canarian Archipelago, shows the technical feasibility of the system design and the automatic operational strategy programmed for it. Amongst other tasks, the automatic operational strategy controls the number of RO plants that have to be connected or disconnected at any given moment in order to match the variable wind energy supply. The results obtained thus far have not revealed any significant variation in the level of quality or average volume of the product water, nor any physical deterioration to the main components of the system as a result of the start-ups and shut-downs required as a result of the variations in the wind energy supply or oscillations of the electrical parameters of voltage and frequency. In conclusion, the system under analysis can be applied to sea water desalination, both on a small and large scale, in coastal regions with a scarcity of water for domestic and/or agricultural use but with wind energy resources. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Such a system consists of a long-term and a short-term storage system. In a battery, energy is stored for short term whereas the electrolyser, H2-tank and fuel cell combination is used for long-term energy storage to increase the reliability of supply. The same purpose can be achieved by introducing a diesel generator instead of long-term storage. The advantage of such a system is that it needs low investment cost. However, the main disadvantage is that it needs to supply fuel for the operation of the generator. The advantage of hydrogen-based long-term storage over a diesel generator is that it does not need any supply of fuel. In photovoltaic-wind-diesel hybrid systems, the surplus energy during the good season is not stored.In the present study, the possible sites for renewable applications are specified depending on the seasonal renewable energy variation and fuel cost at the site of application. The critical fuel cost is calculated depending on the seasonal solar and wind energy difference. The actual fuel cost at the site of application is compared with critical fuel cost. To find out the actual fuel cost at the location of application, the transportation cost is also included. If the actual fuel cost is higher than the critical fuel cost, the location is cost-effective for hydrogen-based storage. Otherwise, the site is suitable for a diesel-generator backup system. It is found that at present hydrogen storage is not cost-effective compare to a diesel-generator-based system. In the near future when the target cost of the electrolyser and the fuel cell is achieved, the scope of the hydrogen-based storage system will also increase and it will also be cost competitive with diesel-generator system for remote applications. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Standard protocols for performing the IHCMC tests were developed and are described. Use of the standard protocols yielded the desired results - data that were not significantly different among either replicate sets of unsterilized specimens or as a function of which calorimeter test well was used. Heat flow rates measured in air at 20°C, 25°C, 35°C, and 45°C yielded estimates of activation energies of 47, 11, and 41kJ/mol for unsterilized, γ-radiation sterilized, and ethylene oxide gas (EtO) sterilized polymer, respectively. These results support the ideas that (a) initial exothermic degradation takes place much more easily in the radiation-sterilized material, due to direct oxidation of readily available free radicals, and (b) the much slower degradation process in EtO-sterilized UHMWPE is not appreciably different than in unsterilized polymer. Comparison with other activation energy data suggests that the rate-limiting process in EtO- or un-sterilized polymer is oxygen diffusion into the polymer. For shelf storage in air, for periods up to 8 months, the mean exothermic heat flow in air, at 25°C (Qm) [determined from the Q values averaged over the time period between 15 and 20h after test start], from UHMWPE γ-radiation sterilized in air was significantly higher than for unsterilized material (2.91±0.11 vs. 0.73±0.11μW). The higher rate can be attributed to oxidation of radiation-induced free radicals in the polymer near its surface. For the γ-irradiated polymer, the decline in Qm with shelf storage time suggests that, eventually, degradation might become oxygen diffusion limited in this case also. However, in vivo, surface wear of an UHMWPE articular component may continue to expose unoxidized free radicals, keeping the exothermic reaction rate high and, possibly, continuing to produce an oxidized UHMWPE surface prone to wear. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The influence of the surface modification to the polyurethane on the blood response to the polyetherurethane was investigated by measuring changes in the activation of the contact phase activation of the intrinsic coagulation cascade. The data demonstrate that the plasma treatment process caused surface modifications to the PEU that in all cases increased the polar nature of the surfaces.

Subsequently it was found to be a common constituent in eukaryotic cells, its metabolism a basic component of cellular housekeeping. In addition to phosphate, myo-inositol (Ins) and mineral storage and retrieval in plant organs and tissues, other roles for Ins P 6 include service as a major metabolic pool in Ins phosphate and pyrophosphate pathways involved in signaling and regulation; possibly as an effector or ligand in these processes; as a form of energy currency and in ATP regeneration; in RNA export and DNA repair; and as an anti-oxidant. The relatively recent demonstration that pyrophosphate-containing derivatives of Ins P6 can function as phosphate donors in the regeneration of ATP is reminiscent of the proposal, made four decades ago in studies of seed development, that Ins P6 itself may serve in this function. Studies of Ins P6 in non-plant systems rarely include the consideration that this compound might represent a significant fraction of cellular P; cellular phosphate nutrition has been viewed as either not interesting or of little importance. However, there may be few fundamental differences among diverse eukaryotes in both the metabolic pathways involving Ins P6 and the spectrum of possible roles for it and its metabolites.","Cellular nutrition; Inositol; Minerals; Phosphorus; Phytate; Phytic acid; Plant; Seed; Signal transduction","phytic acid; antioxidant activity; article; cell activity; DNA repair; enzyme mechanism; eukaryotic cell; metabolism; nonhuman; plant seed; plant tissue; regulatory mechanism; RNA transport; seed development; signal transduction; transport kinetics; Eukaryota; Spermatophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142026184

This study focused on the identification of dietary components that may predispose HIV-positive patients to the development of fat deposition. Objective: We evaluated differences in past dietary intake between men with HIV who developed fat deposition and those who did not. Design: This nested case-control study consisted of 47 cases and 47 controls from the Nutrition for Healthy Living cohort. Food records from 6 to 24 mo before development of fat deposition in cases were analyzed and compared with food records from controls by using t tests for normally distributed nutrients and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for nutrients with skewed distributions. Results: HIV-positive patients without fat deposition had greater overall energy intakes (kcal/kg; P = 0.03) and greater intakes of total protein (P = 0.01), total dietary fiber (P = 0.01), soluble dietary fiber (P = 0.01), insoluble dietary fiber (P = 0.03), and pectin (P = 0.02) than did HIV-positive patients with fat deposition. Those without fat deposition also tended to currently perform more resistance training (P = 0.05) and to not be current smokers (P = 0.05). Conclusion: Our results indicate that an overall high-quality diet, rich in fiber and adequate in energy and protein, may be beneficial in preventing the development of fat deposition in persons infected with HIV. The results of this study further emphasize that a healthy lifestyle, including exercise and avoidance of unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, may also be similarly beneficial.","Diet; Fat redistribution syndrome; Fiber; HIV; Lipodystrophy; Nutrition","pectin; article; caloric intake; case control study; cohort analysis; controlled study; dietary fiber; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; lipid storage; male; nutrient; protein intake; rank sum test; smoking habit; adult; diet; dietary fiber; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; lipodystrophy; medical record; risk factor; Human immunodeficiency virus; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Diet; Diet Records; Dietary Fiber; HIV Seropositivity; Humans; Lipodystrophy; Male; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142024834

Porous media (with 0.1453 porosity) composed of coarse aluminum chips fill the flow channels to provide for further increase in heat transfer performance and for extra energy storage capability.Measured data were recorded water flow rates that range between 50 and 400 l/h. The results show that the enhancement of heat transfer characteristics associated with the existence of porous media does not improve the calculated collector daily efficiency. The collector daily efficiency reduces during sunlight relative to that for that of clean collectors by approximately 1.0% and 2.0% at flow rates of 300 and 200 l/h, respectively. The daily efficiency at 300, 200 l/h flow rates are 60%, 56%, respectively, for the collector without porous media and 59%, 54%, respectively for the collector packed with porous media.It is noticed that using porous medium significantly decreases the rate of decline in water temperature to approximately half its value for the case without porous medium for flow rate of 300 l/h during the absence of sunlight. Also using porous medium will decrease the temperature rise across the collector during sunlight. The maximal outlet temperature reached was 73 °C for the collector without porous media at 70 l/h flow rate and 60 °C for the collector backed with porous medium at 50 l/h flow rate. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The two basic system components are the solar collectors with reflectors and a cooking unit. When thermal storage is needed, a tank filled with pebbles is added to the system. The working fluid, usually a vegetable oil, circulates in natural, thermo-siphon flow through a copper piping that connects the components. The system presents interesting features such as the possibility of indoor and night cooking, heat flow control in the pots, modularity, and the possibility of further adjustment to incorporate a baking oven. The first prototype of this collector- cooker system was built and installed in the city of Juelich, Germany. Further development and adjustment were performed for the next versions, which were brought to India and Mali. Other systems were installed in Africa (Burkina Faso and South Africa) and in South and Central America.

Storage intact of light water reactor (LWR) spent nuclear fuel, a single recycle in a LWR of the plutonium as mixed-oxide fuel, and the repeated recycle of the transuranics in critical and subcritical fast reactors are compared with the focus on the waste management performance of these systems. Other considerations such as cost and technological challenges were beyond the scope of this study. The overall conclusion of the studies is that repeated recycling of the transuranics from spent nuclear fuel would significantly increase the capacity of high-level waste repositories per unit of nuclear energy produced, significantly increase the nuclear energy production per unit mass of uranium ore mined, significantly reduce the radiotoxicity of the waste streams per unit of nuclear energy produced, and significantly enhance the proliferation resistance of the material stored in high-level waste repositories.","Nuclear fuel cycle; Repository performance; Transmutation","Composition; Fast reactors; Geological repositories; Light water reactors; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Plutonium; Recycling; Toxicity; Waste management; Fuel cycle analysis; Radiotoxicity; Transmutation systems; Waste mass flows; Radioactive waste disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141989632

The tubes are loaded in two different modes: Static compressive axial loading applied via a displacement and the kinematic coupling option of the FE code, which constrains the nodes at each end of the tube to the respective reference nodes Dynamic axial impact loading via a mass element attached to the reference node of the rigid base platen which is energised by an initial velocity while appropriately maintaining its load sustaining resistance. One of the salient features of the deformation mechanism is that in both cases the axial shortening of the tube is accompanied by twisting. The boundary constraints of the reference nodes at both the loaded and supported ends are of significant importance and care has been exercised to specify the appropriate degrees of freedom for movement in both rotation and translation. The contact that occurs between various parts of the tube has been correctly identified and targeted. In the present study attention has been focused on the energy storage capacity of the model under both loading modes and in providing an explanation for the major differences in response that exist between the two cases. The material properties of steel are specified as linear elastic followed by non-linear work hardening in plastic range with moderate and high degree of sensitivity to strain rate effect. The solution reveals several important features, which are discussed in this paper. The proposed device could be used in clusters to limit damage in the event of cable failure in hoist & lift compartments. Although the procedure is applied to axial loading, the method is equally applicable to lateral static and impact loading as cited in the introduction. © 2003 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141977327

The physical model components are similar to those of Budyko (1969) and Sellers (1969). The new carbon components account for atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and the terrestrial and oceanic storage of carbon. Prescribing values for the sum of these carbon components, it is found that inclusion of a closed carbon cycle reduces the range of insolation over which stable partial ice cover solutions may occur. This highly simplified climate model also predicts that the estimated release of carbon from fossil fuel burning over the next hundred years could result in the eventual melting of the ice sheets.","Carbon cycle; Climate; Earth system modelling; Zonal model","carbon cycle; climate modeling; global climate; greenhouse effect; ice cover; insolation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141862282

The gelation kinetics was interpreted with basis on the change of the storage modulus with time, taken as a measure of changes in cross-linking density within the pectin-calcium network. The temperature influence on the rate of gel formation and ageing was evaluated, as well as the temperature sensitivity of the cured gels. The formation and the softening/melting of pectin-calcium networks were also studied under non-isothermal conditions. The structural diversity of the two pectin samples had a great influence on the gelation kinetics and thermal behaviour of these pectin-calcium networks, due to differences in the steric arrangement or environment and/or availability of the chelating groups. An association mechanism is suggested to predominate under conditions of low availability of dissociated carboxylic groups, due to a low pH, higher degree of methylation, or steric constraints introduced by acetylation or neutral side chains, different from the classical 'egg-box' model, and where non-ionic hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions may co-exist and cooperate with coordinative binding of calcium-ions. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In the case of Mn, some AB6-type structures were also considered. Substitution of a small fraction of Ni by Al, Sn, and Mn (x ≅ 0.3) leads to an increase of the hydrogen storage capability (HSC), while for Pd there is a decrease of this property. Generally all alloys presenting larger initial HSC exhibit lower stability. A decrease of the hydrogen equilibrium pressure as a function of Mn content is observed for the AB5 alloys and this is related to an increase of the crystalline unit cell volume. Electrochemical impedance measurements show a significant increase of the hydration/dehydration reaction kinetics due to a raise on the active area as a function of the charge/discharge cycle number. It is also seen that the alloys presenting larger HSC are those showing smaller activation energies for the hydrogen oxidation reaction.","Electrode materials; Energy storage materials; Hydrogen storage materials; Nickel-metal hydride battery","alloy; aluminum; crystallin; hydrogen; lanthanum; manganese; metal; nickel; palladium; tin; cell volume; chemical modification; chemical reaction; chemical reaction kinetics; conference paper; electrochemistry; hydration; measurement; oxidation; pressure",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141832040

Because humans with functional MC4r mutations show early-onset obesity, we determined the onset of excessive fat deposition in 10- to 56-day-old mice, taking into account sex and litter influences. Total body fat content of MC4r-/- on day 35 and MC4r+/- on day 56 significantly exceeds that of MC4r+/+. Plasma leptin levels increase in proportion to fat mass. According to cumulative food intake and energy expenditure measurements from day 21 to 35, onset of excessive fat deposition in MC4r-/- is fueled by hyperphagia and counteracted partially by hypermetabolism. In 35- to 56-day-old mice, arcuate nucleus neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA decreases and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA increases with fat content and plasma leptin levels independently of genotype. Taking into account fat content by ANCOVA reveals, however, increases in both NPY mRNA and POMC mRNA due to melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) deficiency. We conclude that hyperphagia, not hypometabolism, is the primary disturbance initiating excessive fat deposition in MC4R-deficient mice at weaning and that the overall changes in NPY and POMC expression tend to antagonize the onset of excessive fat deposition.","Energy expenditure; Genetic obesity; Neuropeptide Y; Pro-opiomelanocortin","leptin; melanocortin 4 receptor; messenger RNA; neuropeptide Y; proopiomelanocortin; corticotropin receptor; leptin; melanocortin 4 receptor; neuropeptide Y; neuropeptide Y C-terminal flanking peptide; neuropeptide y carboxy terminal flanking peptide; peptide fragment; proopiomelanocortin; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body composition; controlled study; energy expenditure; female; food intake; gene mutation; hormone blood level; human; hypermetabolism; hyperphagia; knockout mouse; lipid storage; male; metabolic disorder; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; obesity; onset age; priority journal; weaning; adipose tissue; animal; biosynthesis; blood; caloric intake; eating; energy metabolism; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; mouse mutant; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; Animalia; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Composition; Eating; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Female; Genotype; Hyperphagia; Leptin; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Neuropeptide Y; Obesity; Peptide Fragments; Pro-Opiomelanocortin; Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4; Receptors, Corticotropin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141703205

However, the technique is mostly used for cooling. Nevertheless, it is also possible to store heat at temperatures above 40-50°C. Storing heat will be useful in case of CHP, solar collectors, and waste heat, where the availability and demand of heat are not synchronous. By storing and re-using heat at this temperature level, this technique contributes to a more efficient and environment-friendly energy use (reducing the CO2 emissions by decreasing the use of fossil fuels). Only a few projects (experiments/demonstration) are known in the world with regard to HTES (high temperature energy storage). To fill this gap and to perform a real scale demonstration project, the TESSAS-project has been launched. The Flemish Institute for Technological Research (Vito, Belgium) started in April 2000 with the TESSAS Project (high temperature thermal energy storage in saturated sand layers with vertical heat exchangers) with the support of the European Commission (5th Framework Program). The project will take four years. The general objective of this demonstration project is to study a thermal energy storage system on a real scale. The system is constructed (at Vito) in a water-saturated sand layer and equipped with vertical heat exchangers. The store will be charged during summertime at a temperature of approximately 90°C by means of a district heating system. During winter, the stored heat will be recovered and used for heating a building of 3.700 m3. This article gives a general overview of the TESSAS-project including the first results, showing that high temperature storage by use of vertical heat exchangers is indeed an option to reduce CO2 emissions in the future. © 2003 Energy Engineering.

Storage was at 0°C in air (control) and various controlled atmosphere (CA) conditions. Fruits kept under CA-storage produced less aroma volatiles than air-stored fruits. This suppression of aroma volatiles was accentuated with increasing storage duration. Greatest impairment was caused by very low oxygen (0.5% O2) combined with high CO 2 (6%) concentrations. Respiration rate was inhibited to a similar degree as the emission of aroma volatiles. There were lower ATP concentrations in fruits kept under CA-storage, thereby decreasing the ATP:ADP ratio and energy charge of tissues. On the other hand, concentrations of NADPH and NADH increased in CA as well as in air stored fruits. However, there were no significant differences between CA-treatments. Moreover, no correlations between NADPH or NADH concentrations and volatile aroma or fatty acid production were found. For that reason pyridine nucleotides are not considered to be of regulatory significance. CA storage caused an overall decrease in the concentrations of free- and esterified fatty acids. These acids are considered the dominant precursors of volatile aroma substances in apples. Suppressed aroma production appeared to be highly correlated with the concentration of free linoleic acid.

Most thermal springs in Rajasthan are tightly associated to the several regional NE-SW strike-slip faults bordering NE-SW ridges formed by Archaean rocks at the contact with Quaternary alluvial and aeolian sedimentary deposits of the Rajasthan desert. Their Ca-HCO3 immature character and isotopic composition reveals: (1) meteoric origin, (2) relatively shallow circulation inside the crystalline Archaean formations, (3) very fast rise along faults, and (4) deep storage temperatures of the same order of magnitude as discharging temperatures (50-90°C). Thermal spring discharges in Gujarat are spread over a larger area than in Rajasthan and are associated both with the NNW-SSE fault systems bordering the Cambay basin and the ENE-WSW strike-slip fault systems in the Saurashtra province, west of the Cambay basin. Chemical and isotopic compositions of springs in both areas suggest a meteoric origin of deep thermal waters. They mix with fresh or fossil seawater entering the thermal paths of the spring systems through both the fault systems bordering the Cambay basin, as well as faults and fractures occurring inside the permeable Deccan Basalt Trap in the Saurashtra province. The associated gas phase, at all sampled sites, shows similar features: (1) it is dominated by the presence of atmospheric components (N2 and Ar), (2) it has high crustal 4He enrichment, (3) it shows crustal 3He/4He signature, (4) it has low CO2 concentration, and (5) the only analysed sample for 13C/12C isotopic ratio in CO2 suggests that CO2 has a strong, isotopically light organic imprint. All these features and chemical geothermometer estimates of spring waters suggest that any active deep hydrothermal system at the base of the Cambay basin (about 2000-3000 m) has low-to-medium enthalpy characteristics, with maximum deep temperature in the storage zone of about 150°C.

The null allele mutations (knockouts, KO) have already provided valuable information about their functions, but have also revealed major complications and difficulties: (1) an early embryonic lethality, (2) temporal effect (developmental stage or adult stage), (3) functional redundancy and (4) spatio-effect (cell-autonomous or non-autonomous). To overcome these limitations, spatio-temporally controlled somatic mutagenesis, Cre-ER T/LoxP system, was established. The nuclear receptors (NRs) play central roles in development, organogenesis, metabolism and energy homeostasis through their ability to transduce hormonal signals into modulation of gene activity. Obesity, excess energy storage in adipose tissue, has a strong link to diabetes. Among NRs, retinoid X receptor α (RXRα)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) heterodimers can mediate adipocyte differentiation and obesity which has been demonstrated with in vitro cell culture systems and RXR- and PPARγ-specific ligand studies. Therefore an adipocyte-specific temporally controlled somatic mutagenesis system was established and analysed. Furthermore, the functional roles of NRs to control liver regeneration were also studied with similar system in hepatocytes.","Conditional somatic mutagenesis; Diabetes; Liver regeneration; Nuclear receptor; Obesity","cell nucleus receptor; cre recombinase; dimer; ligand; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; retinoid X receptor; adipocyte; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; cell differentiation; cell specificity; cell type; conference paper; controlled study; development; diabetes mellitus; embryo mortality; energy balance; experimental model; gene control; gene function; gene inactivation; gene targeting; genome analysis; knockout mouse; linkage analysis; liver regeneration; metabolism; molecular genetics; mouse; nonhuman; null allele; obesity; organogenesis; protein expression; protein function; signal transduction; somatic mutation; technique; tissue specificity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141533155

This is because of the high quality and lightly crosslinked nature of the rubber hydrocarbon obtainable from such rejects. The authors have conducted a study of utilization of reclaimed natural rubber prophylactic in blend with epoxidised natural rubber with 50 mole% epoxidation (ENR-50) and silica. The vulcanization characteristics and dynamic mechanical analysis of the vulcanizates have been carried out. It has been observed that the optimum cure time shows a gradual decrease with natural rubber prophylactics as well as silica, indicating cure activation. The damping behaviour has been found to be strongly dependent on the presence of silica filler in the sample. The dynamic modulus values have been increased with the addition of silica, both below and above the glass transition region. Addition of natural rubber prophylactics as well as silica filler has been found to be increasing the glass transition temperature of epoxidised natural rubber. Increase in frequency also increases the glass transition temperature of epoxidised natural rubber. The analysis of the relative distribution of silica among the components of the mix reveals that a major portion of the silica remains in the prophylatics phase while it can interact with the epoxy groups in epoxidised natural rubber phase. The evaluation and variation of network density in the vulcanizates carried out using storage modulus-temperature plots and solvent sorption method reveals an increasing trend with the addition of natural rubber prophylactics and silica filler. The energy of activation values show a decrease at 40 phr loading of natural rubber prophylactics after an initial increase at 10 phr loading. Addition of silica to expoxidised natural rubber/natural rubber prophylactics mixes have been found to be causing difference variations in energy of activation values depending on the composition of the mix.",,"Addition reactions; Crosslinking; Curing; Damping; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Elastic moduli; Glass transition; Oxidation; Polymer blends; Silica; Temperature; Vulcanization; Cure activation; Epoxidation; Prophylactic in blend; Storage modulus; Rubber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141507830

Twenty-four male Wistar rats were fed a HFD (39.7% calories of fat) for 5 wk. After the 5-wk dietary period, the rats were sacrificed and divided into intra-abdominal-obesity-prone (OP) or obesity-resistant (OR) groups according to the total intra-abdominal fat pads (epididymal, mesenteric, and perirenal) weights. A superficial portion of the Muscle (M.) gastrocnemius tissue obtained from 2 groups before and after feeding the HFD were analyzed to determine their hexokinase (HK), β-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (β-HAD), and citrate synthase (CS) activities. Muscle fiber composition and capillary density were examined in the deep portion of the M. gastrocnemius, soleus, and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) gained after the HFD. While the OP group had more intra-abdominal fat pads and a heavier final body weight than the OR group, there was no significant difference in the energy intake between the two. Due to the HFD, the OP group showed significant increases in β-HAD and CS activities, while the OR group did not. Change of β-HAD activity by HFD in the OP group was significantly greater than that in the OR group. The ratio of fat oxidation, expressed as β-HAD/CS, significantly increased in the OP group, but not in the OR group. No differences were found in either the muscle fiber composition or capillarization. These results suggest that intra-abdominal-obesity-susceptive rats may have a higher adaptation degree in muscle oxidative enzyme activities as characteristic in the early stage of intraabdominal adipose accumulation.","Enzyme activity; High-fat diet; Muscle fiber composition; Obesity","3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; citrate synthase; hexokinase; abdomen; adaptation; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body fat; body weight; caloric intake; capillary density; controlled study; disease predisposition; enzyme activity; extensor digitorum longus muscle; gastrocnemius muscle; histochemistry; lipid diet; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; male; muscle cell; muscle metabolism; nonhuman; obesity; rat; skeletal muscle; soleus muscle; Animalia; Rattus norvegicus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141480042

Previous studies have shown that TEF is enhanced by aerobic endurance exercise of sufficient duration and intensity. The purpose of this study was to determine if a similar effect occurs with a single bout of resistance exercise (weightlifting). Methods: VO2 was measured in 9 healthy volunteers (3 males and 6 females) for 2 hours after ingestion of a 2760 kJ (660 kcal) carbohydrate meal with and without prior completion of a resistance training regimen (2 sets of 10 repetitions of 10 different exercises). Results: The meal caused an immediate and persistent thermic effect in both the control and the exercise trial. Mean oxygen consumption over baseline increased 20% in the control trial and 34% in the exercise trial. TEF calculated from VO2 and RER (total area under the response curve above baseline) was 73% greater in the exercise trial compared with the control trial (159 ± 18 vs. 92 ± 14 KJ/2 hrs, p &lt; .02). Conclusion: These results indicate that TEF in response to a carbohydrate meal is enhanced following a single bout of resistance exercise.","Diet-induced thermogenesis; Weightlifting","carbohydrate; adult; article; basal metabolic rate; calculation; carbohydrate diet; controlled study; exercise; female; food; food composition; human; human experiment; ingestion; male; measurement; normal human; oxygen consumption; thermogenesis; training; weight lifting; Eragrostis tef",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043239317

As other legumes, unirradiated pea contains Mn2+ binded proteins and very small amount natural free radicals. They give rise to an ESR spectrum consisting of an equally spaced sextet and a singlet resonance line, respectively, both appearing at g = 2.0050 ± 0.0007. Irradiation of pea by gamma radiation did not produce any pattern changes in the ESR spectrum of pea except a significant change in the intensity of the singlet resonance line which increased exponentially with absorbed dose in the studied dose range (1.25-15.0 kGy). Cooling the irradiated samples down to room temperature caused a reversible increase in Mn2+ and a reversible decrease in free radical signal intensities. However, heating the sample above room temperature created irreversible decreases in the intensities of both species. At room temperature, the free radical signal decayed very fast, but the signal due to Mn2+ ion did not exhibit any intensity changes over the storage period of 75 days. While, annealing of irradiated samples at high temperatures (308-373 K) produced continuous decrease in the signal intensity of Mn 2+, it caused a decrease at the beginning and then an increase in the free radical signal intensity. Arrhenius plot constructed using rate constants determined from the variations of the signal intensities at high temperatures was used to calculate activation energies related with oxidation of Mn2+ and free radical species responsible from singlet resonance line. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Model-free reinforcement learning control is investigated for the operation of electrically driven cool thermal energy storage systems in commercial buildings. The reinforcement learning controller learns to charge and discharge a thermal storage tank based on the feedback it receives from past control actions. The learning agent interacts with its environment by commanding the thermal energy storage system and extracts cues about the environment solely based on the reinforcement feedback it receives, which in this study is the monetary cost of each control action. No prediction or system model is required. Over time and by exploring the environment, the reinforcement learning controller establishes a statistical summary of plant operation, which is continuously updated as operation continues. The controller learns to account for the time-dependent cost of electricity (both time-of-use and real-time pricing), the availability of thermal storage, part-load performance of the central chilled water plant, and weather conditions. Though reinforcement learning control proved sensitive to the selection of state variables, level of discretization, and learning rate, it effectively learns a difficult task of controlling thermal energy storage and displays good performance. The cost savings compare favorably with conventional cool storage control strategies but do not reach the level of predictive optimal control. © 2003 American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.",,"Computer simulation; Cooling; Learning systems; Office buildings; Optimal control systems; Reinforcement; Statistical methods; Thermal energy storage systems; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042810668

The thermodynamic limits are expressed in terms of classical exergy change and a residual inevitable minimum of dissipated exergy, or some extension including time penalty. We consider processes with heat and mass transfer that occur in a finite time and in equipment of finite dimension. These processes include heat and separation operations and are found in heat and mass exchangers, thermal networks, energy convertors, energy recovery units, storage systems, chemical reactors, and chemical plants. Our analysis is based on the condition that in order to make the results of thermodynamic analyses usable in engineering it is a thermodynamic limit (e.g. a lower bound for consumption or work or heat or an upper bound for work or heat production) which must be ensured for prescribed process requirements. The goal of this paper is not only to review and classify all main methods and results obtained in the field but also to consider common objections caused by misunderstanding of these methods and ]results. In fact, the paper contains a critical comparison of various methods applied in the field of energy generation, such as second law analyses, entropy generation minimization, approaches coming from ecology, and finite-time thermodynamics. A creative part of this paper outlines a general approach to the construction of 'Carnot variables' as suitable controls.

In the nestling period the female often helps the male to feed the young, but the factors affecting whether and when she leaves the brood to hunt have not been investigated in detail. We present a dynamic state variable model that analyses female behaviour and fat storage dynamics over the nestling period. The results show that in the first half of the nestling period the female faces a conflict between the need to brood the young and the need to hunt to provision them with food. This conflict arises because the energy of the young peak early in the nestling period, at a time when they still cannot thermoregulate and therefore need brooding from the female. The most critical period is the second nestling week, when both female and nestling fat reserves will decrease to low levels. Large female fat reserves in the early nestling period provide a solution to this conflict and are essential for successful breeding. Stochasticity in male provisioning is thus not needed to explain why females should be fat when the eggs hatch. Under normal circumstances, the female broods during the first two weeks and leaves the young only if hunting is absolutely necessary. After the second week the energy requirements are relaxed, and whether the female assists the male in hunting or not depends on factors such as male hunting success, environmental stochasticity, and energy requirements of the young. Our model provides a framework for empirical investigations on female behaviour during breeding in raptors, owls, and other birds with marked division of labour.","Dynamic programming; Falco tinnunculus; Fat storage; Parental care; Reproduction","bioenergetics; brood rearing; fat reserve; female behavior; food provisioning; maternal care; raptor; resource allocation; Aves; Falco tinnunculus; Raptores; Strigiformes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042623452

The effectiveness of SMES unit over frequency oscillations improvement against load perturbations in power system is well known. In addition, the proposed control scheme provides the steady state error of frequency and inadvertent interchange of tie-lines to be maintained in steady state values. The power system considered has three areas two of which including steam turbines while the other containing a hydro turbine, and all of them contain SMES units, in addition. In the power system each area with a steam turbine contains the non-linearity due to reheat effect of the steam turbine and all of the areas contain upper and lower constraints for generation rate. Only one neural network (NN) controller, which controls all the inputs of each area in the power system, is considered. In the NN controller, back propagation-through-time algorithm is used as neural network learning rule. The performance of the power system is simulated by using conventional integral controller and NN controller for the cases with or without SMES units in all areas, separately. By comparing the results for both cases, it can be seen that the performance of NN controller is better than conventional controllers.",,"Algorithms; Energy storage; Neural networks; Steam turbines; Automatic generation control; Electric power systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042443361

During frozen storage no retrogradation of amylopectin was detected in the part-baked dough. When analysing the aging of the rebaked samples, it was observed that the time of frozen storage produced a progressive increase of the retrogradation temperature range of the amylopectin, and also great energy was required for amylopectin melting at longer storage period, indicating that structural changes of amylopectin were produced during frozen storage. Regarding the quality of the fresh bread resulted after rebaking, crumb hardness increase with the time of frozen storage, and also the hardening rate during aging was dependent on that time.

(roselle) were carried out in aqueous solutions (55-98°C), either as free or copigmented anthocyanins with chlorogenic acid, and in the dry state as free anthocyanins or co-lyophilized with an amorphous polysaccharide (pullulan) and stored in different relative humidity environments (water activities 0.33, 0.53, 0.75 and 0.84) at 40°C. The rate constants for degradation were obtained from first-order reaction kinetic plots. The degradation kinetics of individual anthocyanin components in solution, as assessed by HPLC, followed an Arrhenius-type response with respect to temperature; activation energies, Ea, varied between 13.3 and 15. 1 kcal/mol. Copigmentation of anthocyanins with chlorogenic acid did not seem to improve their stability in solution. In the dry state, the degradation rate constants increased with the water activity, particularly above 0.53. In the freeze-dried pullulan-anthocyanin mixtures, the polysaccharide matrix delayed colour degradation compared to the free anthocyanin preparations by 1.5-1.8 times. The degradation kinetics of anthocyanins did not show any dependence on the molecular mobility of the system, as it relates to the glass-rubber transition (Tg) detectable by calorimetry. Anthocyanin degradation occurred, even at sub-Tg temperatures of the amorphous matrices, whereas no changes in the rate constants were observed in the vicinity of the glass transition; the plot of (lnk)-1 against (T-Tg) was linear with all data fitting into a common line as predicted by the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) equation.

Unlike conventional vehicles on the road today, hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) are designed with a smaller engine and an on-board energy storage system. The smaller engine allows the vehicle to achieve better fuel economy and fewer emissions. The efficiency benefits of diesel engines over gasoline engines make the diesel engine a strong contender for further improving fuel economy. The integration of diesel-engine technology into a hybrid electric vehicle configuration is one of the most promising ways to comply with fuel-economy and emissions legislation. There are many hybrid electric vehicle and diesel engine simulation software packages available for predicting emissions and fuel economy as well as studying the overall performance. Using simulation software, it is possible to quickly and easily optimise the engine and vehicle prior to investing time and money into testing components and building prototypes. The ability to integrate an advanced engine simulation software output and an HEV simulation for the prediction of engine alterations on overall vehicle performance is a critical tool for the success of meeting vehicle emissions and fuel economy goals. The following literature review combines current information on the HEV technology, engine technology, HEV simulation software, and engine simulation software available today.","Electric vehicles; Emissions; Engine simulation; Fuel economy; Hybrid electric vehicle technology","Automotive industry; Computer simulation; Computer software; Energy storage; Engine simulations; Electric vehicles",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042363513

Areas discussed are the management of electron flow (electrical resistivity) and the absorption of mechanical energy in textile fibers and fabrics. Surface resistance studies on carbon nanotubes and conductive carbon-black-filled films of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and paraffin wax show that the electrical conductivity of these materials depends upon the matrix material type and the amount of charge-carrying particles in the matrix. PMMA films filled with carbon nanotubes are found to be more electrically conductive than matrices filled with conductive carbon black. Mechanical-energy interactions of flocked textile surfaces show that in compression, they exhibit unique, gradual load-deflection behavior. This effect should be useful in applications requiring impact-energy absorption.

Subordinates might also have elevated baseline corticosterone levels because corticosterone is known to facilitate fattening in birds. Recent experiments showed that moderately elevated corticosterone levels resulting from unpredictable food supply are correlated with enhanced cache retrieval efficiency and more accurate performance on a spatial memory task. Given the correlation between corticosterone and memory, a further prediction is that subordinates might be more efficient at cache retrieval and show more accurate performance on spatial memory tasks. We tested these predictions in dominant-subordinate pairs of mountain chickadees (Poecile gambeli). Each pair was housed in the same cage but caching behavior was tested individually in an adjacent aviary to avoid the confounding effects of small spaces in which birds could unnaturally and directly influence each other's behavior. In sharp contrast to our hypothesis, we found that subordinate chickadees cached less food, showed less efficient cache retrieval, and performed significantly worse on the spatial memory task than dominants. Although the behavioral differences could have resulted from social stress of subordination, and dominant birds reached significantly higher levels of corticosterone during their response to acute stress compared to subordinates, there were no significant differences between dominants and subordinates in baseline levels or in the pattern of adrenocortical stress response. We find no evidence, therefore, to support the hypothesis that subordinate mountain chickadees maintain elevated baseline corticosterone levels whereas lower caching rates and inferior cache retrieval efficiency might contribute to reduced survival of subordinates commonly found in food-caching parids. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

For example, the spider manufactures, for its web weaving, a thread that has a higher kilograms-per-square-centimeter tensile strength than is available in any man-made metal or plastic. Green leaves in plants receive water pumped up from the plant's roots and they extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. By using solar radiation in their chemical processing they produce various carbohydrates. Trees in forests produce wood that once powered steam engines. The New England maple trees produce a liquid carbohydrate called ""maple syrup."" Douglas fir trees produce a highly combustible ""pitch"" that enriched the heat output of wood-burning stoves. Many plants produce sugar that bees collect and concentrate in hives. Athletes who need to increase their muscular performance consume this sugar, in the form of honey.",,"Data processing; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Fuel cells; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Energy production; Aerospace engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042161950

Crystalline silicotitanate (CST) sorbent (IONSIV© IE-911, UOP LLC, Des Plaines, IL), which is very effective at removing cesium from high-salt solutions, was one of three technologies that were tested. Small-scale batch and column tests conducted last year using samples of production batches of CST showed potential problems with CST clumping and loss of cesium capacity after extended contact with the simulant solutions. Similar tests using samples of a baseline and improved granular CST and the CST powder used to make both granular samples were performed this year to compare the performance of the improved CST. The column tests showed that the baseline CST generated more precipitates of sodium aluminosilicate than the improved CST. The sodium aluminosilicate formed bridges between the CST granules, causing clumps of CST to form in the column. Clumps were visible in the baseline CST column after 1 month of operation and in the improved CST column after 2 months. The cesium capacity of the CST samples from the column tests with recirculafing simulant decreased slightly as the run time increased. Most of this decrease could be attributed to the weight of cancrinite (a sodium aluminosilicate) on the CST samples. Tests conducted last year using production batch samples of CST showed a more pronounced drop in cesium capacity under comparable conditions. A column test using the improved CST and once-through simulant showed few problems during 5 months of operation. The pressure drop through the column remained low; however, the CST in the column was clumped together when the final samples were taken after 5 months. The final sample taken from the top 1 cm of the column showed a 65% drop in cesium capacity compared with all the other samples from this column. This sample also contained the highest concentration of cancrinite, but the weight of cancrinite would only account for a small fraction of the drop in cesium capacity by simple dilution of the CST. The CST in the batch tests stored at elevated temperatures in average simulant formed clumps, but this occurred at a slower rate than that observed last year during comparable tests using production batch samples of CST. Storage at elevated temperatures caused a gradual decrease in cesium capacity as the storage time increased, with a loss in capacity of up to 20% after 5 to 6 months at 80°C. The results for the baseline and improved CST samples were essentially the same for these batch tests.","Cesium; Chemical stability; Clumping; Crystalline silicotitanate; CST; Thermal stability","Cesium; Crystalline materials; Precipitation (chemical); Pressure drop; Radioactive elements; Thermodynamic stability; Chemical stability; Titanium compounds; aluminum sodium silicate; cesium; silicon derivative; silicotitanate; sodium chloride; unclassified drug; Cesium; Chemical stability; pollutant removal; river; Sorption; thermal property; conference paper; crystal structure; dilution; energy; molecular stability; performance; powder; radioactive waste processing; radioactive waste storage; technology; temperature dependence; thermostability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042026693

L-Alanine was included for comparison and reference. Samples were irradiated with 60Co γ-rays and 60-220kV X-rays. The dosimeter response was assessed using the peak-to-peak amplitude of the first-derivative EPR spectrum. Dose-response curves for the 60Co γ-irradiated samples were constructed, and the dependences of the response on the photon energy, microwave power, and modulation amplitude were studied. Stability of the irradiation products upon storage (signal fading) was also investigated. Lithium formate monohydrate is by far the best candidate of the tested formates, suitable for measuring doses down to approximately 0.1Gy. Lithium formate monohydrate is more sensitive than alanine by a factor of 5.6-6.8 in the tested photon energy range, it exhibits no zero-dose signal and shows a linear dose response in the dose range from 0.2 to 1000Gy. Its EPR signal was found unchanged in shape and intensity 1 week after irradiation to 10Gy. Various less favorable properties rendered the other formates generally unsuitable, although calcium formate exhibits some interesting EPR dosimetric properties. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Also, nut-rich diets improve the serum lipid profile of participants in dietary intervention trials. However, nuts are fatty foods, and in theory their regular consumption may lead to body weight gain. Because obesity is a major public health problem and a risk factor for CAD, clinicians and policy makers ponder several questions. Will hypercholesterolemic patients advised to consume nuts gain weight? Is recommending increased nut consumption to the general population for CAD prevention sound public health advice? Epidemiologie studies indicate an inverse association between frequency of nut consumption and body mass index. In well-controlled nutfeeding trials, no changes in body weight were observed. Some studies on free-living subjects in which no constraints on body weight are imposed show a nonsignificant tendency to lower weight while subjects are on the nut diets. In another line of evidence, preliminary data indicate that subjects on nut-rich diets excrete more fat in stools. Further research is needed to study the effects of nut consumption on energy balance and body weight. In the meantime, the available cumulative data do not indicate that free-living people on self-selected diets including nuts frequently have a higher body mass index or a tendency to gain weight.","Body weight; Dietary recommendations; Nuts; Obesity","feces lipid; lipid; almond; body weight; conference paper; coronary artery disease; energy balance; energy expenditure; food intake; human; hypercholesterolemia; lipid blood level; lipid storage; nonhuman; nut; obesity; peanut; physical activity; adolescent; adult; body mass; body weight; child; diet; drug effect; epidemiology; fat intake; female; male; nut; plant seed; prospective study; review; Arachis hypogaea; Prunus dulcis; Adolescent; Adult; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Child; Diet; Dietary Fats; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Humans; Male; Nuts; Prospective Studies; Seeds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041782993

The field experience drawn in this paper shows the efforts and approaches employed to make the optimum use of the electric energy through enterprise creation. If rural electrification is left to grow without any directional inputs, experience has shown that, beyond obvious use for lighting, radios and basic home-appliances, uses which might bring economic development to an area, are slow to emerge. To be of development benefit to an area, electricity should be employed in enterprises which employ local people, and add value to local resources. However, contrary to the conventional ideology, the empirical observation from this field experience in one of the hill districts of Nepal demonstrates the positive effect of a rural-electrification programme with various innovative approaches, practical tariff policies and varieties of motivational and entrepreneurship development mechanisms. These strategic approaches with supportive institutional mechanisms have proven conducive for fostering the growth of local enterprises, thus creating employment and resource harnessing. Complementary service mechanisms and policy coordination is a necessary precondition for an effective use of power in the rural community rather than the rhetoric policy of rural electrification in isolation. Electrification in isolation, without any promotional or supportive mechanisms, still creates pitfalls. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The treatment is carried out in a confined place, and after treatment the residual gas is vented to the atmosphere. Despite this gas being very toxic, it does not result in harm to human beings because it is vented in open places. However, it is harmful to the atmosphere because its reaction with high-energy photons in the stratosphere reduces the ozone concentration. Therefore, the present investigation is concerned with the study of the feasibility for destruction of the residual fumigant. One of the nonthermal plasma techniques, a packed-bed ferroelectric reactor, was applied for destruction of mixtures of methyl bromide in nitrogen or air. The performance of the process was studied by analyzing the influence and effect of the operating variables on the process efficiency. The results obtained showed the residence time and the applied voltage as the most significant variables. When nitrogen is employed as the carrier gas destruction efficiencies as high as 80% are obtained.","Methyl bromide (CH3Br) destruction; Non-thermal plasma; Packed-bed plasma reactor; Plasma chemical reaction; Pollutants control","Fumigation; Greenhouse effect; Ozone; Photons; Plasmas; Pollution control; Plasma reactors; Soil conditioners",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041519400

Marty clinical reports and genetic studies over the past few years demonstrate decreased circulating levels of this hormone in metabolic dysfunction, such as obesity and insulin resistance, in both humans and animal models. Pharmacologic adiponectin treatments in rodents increase insulin sensitivity, although the primary site and detailed mechanism of action is yet to be determined.

We recently demonstrated that postprandial insulin levels are increased in patients with VPA therapy. This possible modulation of pancreatic insulin secretion by VPA could be due to the structure of VPA as a fatty acid derivative and thus to direct stimulation of pancreatic insulin secretion or competition with free fatty acids (FFA) for albumin binding. In order to investigate the effect of VPA on insulin secretion in pancreatic islet cells we performed in vitro experiments with islets from pancreases of multiorgan donors. After preparation, the incubation with valproate caused a time and dose-dependent increase of insulin concentration in the cell supernatant. This could also be demonstrated with the control drug, lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, but not with mirtazepin and phenytoin. It can be speculated that an increase in pancreatic insulin secretion under chronic VPA treatment enhances appetite and energy storage and is related to the observed weight gain. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The films were compared to currently employed magnetron sputtered CNx overcoats in terms of functionality-determining film properties. X-Ray reflectivity (XRR) was used to determine film thicknesses and has been proved to be accurately applicable to carbon coatings down to ∼ 1 nm thickness. Time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) sputter depth profiling has proved similar carbon penetration depths into the unerlying magnetic media, both for HCA deposition and magnetron sputtering (MS), in spite of considerably higher deposition energies occurring during the HCA process. This fact suggests no negative impact on the macroscopic magnetic properties due to HCA deposition. The minimum thicknesses for full coverage of the media were evaluated by applying X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to the different film types. The results show a coverage limit of ∼ 1.0 nm for HCA coatings in contrast to ∼ 2.0-3.0 nm for CNx coatings indicating a significantly improved corrosion performance for overcoat thicknesses below 3 nm.

Samples of two wheat cultivars from each of six classes were ground and were either unpelleted or pelleted and ground before including (80%) in mash diets with or without enzyme (Avizyme 1302). Two common control diets were fed in the two bioassay series required to evaluate the 48 diets. Each diet was fed to four cages of six male broilers from 4 to 17 d of age. Apparent metabolisable energy (AME) was determined on excreta collected at 16 d of age. There was more than a 25% difference in feed intake among the 48 diets; the largest contribution of the variation was due to wheat cultivar. Feed intake was significantly increased by enzyme addition and decreased by pelleting. Variation in feed intake explained more than 70% of the variation in body weight and had only a minor association with determined AME. The AME of all wheat samples, except the two Durum wheats, was increased by both enzyme supplementation and processing. The increase in AME with processing may represent an anomaly of using different bioassay series to measure unpelleted and pelleted wheat samples or it may represent changes in AME of all wheat samples, except Durum wheats, with storage after harvesting. The relative AME and FCR measurements for the 12 wheat samples were similar whether the wheats were pelleted or not. However, there was no relationship between measurements of feed intake when the different cultivars of unpelleted and pelleted wheat were compared. The marked variation in feed intake and growth rate of broilers fed different cultivars of wheat continues to be a concern as it suggests that other factors may limit intake and prevent the broiler from obtaining the required levels of nutrients from the diet.","Broilers; Enzymes; Feed processing; Feed value; Wheat","Gallus gallus; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038825216

Different from Mg-Ni system, there exist no line compounds of Mg2Co and Mg2Fe. Non-equilibration of these compounds is indispensable to make solid state synthesis. Bulk mechanical alloying was applied to this non-equilibration of Mg2Co with success. Planetary ball milling was also utilized to discuss the process efficiency of bulk mechanical alloying. In particular, the on-line monitored energy density was used to describe the homogeneous refining and solid-state reaction with increasing the number of cycles. Through SEM observation of intermediate phase change, the solid-state reaction commences when the total energy density exceeds the critical limit. SEM/EDX and XRD analyses assured that the synthesized non-equilibrium phase should be Mg2Co. The Goldschmidt-factor analysis was used to determine that the synthesized Mg2Co has mainly fcc-structure. No significant change of XRD profiles was observed even when increasing the holding temperature. This Mg2Co is quasi-stable, non-equilibrium phase even at the elevated temperature. In case of Mg-Fe system, the initial elemental particle mixture was homogeneously refined. Under the similar condition to the solid-state synthesis of Mg2Co, however, Mg2Fe was not synthesized even via bulk mechanical alloying. Through precise analysis, non-equilibrium phase with high iron content was recognized, so that non-equilibration via the bulk mechanical alloying might well be effective to investigate the solid state synthesis of binary compounds even in Mg-Fe system.","Bulk mechanical alloying; Hydrogen absorption; Mg-Co; Mg-Fe; Mg2Co; Non-equilibrium; Solid-state synthesis","Absorption; Ball milling; Cobalt; Crystal structure; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Hydrogen; Iron; Mechanical alloying; Phase transitions; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); X ray diffraction analysis; Bulk mechanical alloying; Hydrogen storage alloy; Non-equilibrium phase; Solid-state synthesis; Magnesium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038819477

Experiments were carried out on 10 different wheats at the time of harvest and 10 mo post-harvest. At harvest wheat, at a 65% level in the steam-pelleted diets, influenced (P &lt; 0.01) feed intake and daily gain over a 21-d trial. Thus, feed intake and daily gain of pigs offered the lowest and highest quality wheats varied by 47 and 48%, respectively. There was, however, no effect on feed conversion ratio (FCR), even though dry matter (DM) digestibility and digestible energy (DE) values of different wheats differed significantly (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively). The non-starch carbohydrate (NSC) level of the wheats was measured as the sum of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and free sugars. The NSC level of the wheats negatively affected feed intake (r2 = -0.556: P &lt; 0.01) and daily gain (r2 = -0.574: P &lt; 0.01). After 10 mo of storage, the feed intake and daily gain of the pigs fed the same wheats were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher, but not all the wheats responded to storage. A xylanase product was added to three of the 10 mo-old wheats, which were pre-characterized as low, medium and high intake wheats. The enzyme increased (P &lt; 0.01) daily gain and feed intake of the pigs fed the low-quality wheat by 50.6 and 42.8%, respectively. It may be concluded that the nutritive value of wheat for weaner pigs varies widely and appears to be related to the level of NSC and the cell wall structure of the grain.","Non-starch carbohydrate; Non-starch polysaccharides; Pigs; Wheat; Xylanase","Sus scrofa; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038808834

The modeling and simulation assumes a quasi-steady process for all the components in the ISAHP except the storage tank. The simulation results for instantaneous performance agreed very well with experiment. The simulation technique was used to analyze the daily performance of an ISAHP for 1 year. It is shown that the daily total COP (COPo) is around 1.7 to 2.5 year around for the ISAHP, depending on seasons and weather conditions. COPo is higher than 2.0 for most of the time in a year and the daily operating time varies from 4 to 8 h. The online adjustment requirement of the expansion valve was also investigated using the present simulation technique. The analysis shows that the expansion device does not need to be controlled online.

Relative responses of primiparous and multiparous cows to supplemental fat or isocaloric addition of concentrates under hot weather conditions have not been determined. Nine multiparous and nine primiparous Holstein cows (154 and 167 d in milk, respectively) were used in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square design with 28-d periods. Diets were 1) control (35% alfalfa silage, 25% corn silage, and 40% concentrate, dry matter [DM] basis); 2) control plus 3% fat (HF); and 3) high concentrate ([HC] 15% alfalfa silage, 25% corn silage, and 60% concentrate). Diets were isonitrogenous; diets HF and HC were isocaloric (1.60 Mcal of net energy for lactation [NEL] per kilogram DM) and higher energy than the control (1.52 Mcal/kg). No parity x diet interactions approached significance. DM intake (DMI) was greater when cows were fed HC than when they were fed HF (21.0, 20.1, and 21.3 kg/d for control, HF, and HC, respectively); intake of NEL tended to be increased only for HC. Milk yield was increased by higher-energy diets, but milk fat content was decreased. Milk total protein content was decreased by HF and increased by HC. Yield of solids-corrected milk (SCM) was not different among diets. Efficiency of milk production, expressed either as total milk solids yield per kilogram of DMI or as kilograms of SCM per megacalorie of NEL intake, was greater for HF than for HC. Plasma glucose was higher after feeding for cows fed HC; plasma nonesterified fatty acids were greater for HF. Respiration rate and rectal temperature were greater for HC than for HF. Regardless of parity, increased energy density from either fat or concentrate increased milk yield in midlactation cows, but diets caused energy to be partitioned differently among milk components and body storage. Supplemental rumen-active fat had modest advantages over additional starch-based concentrate during summer heat conditions.","Dietary fat; Heat stress; Primiparous cow","Medicago sativa; Zea mays; fatty acid; lipid; milk protein; alfalfa; animal; article; blood; caloric intake; cattle; chemistry; dietary fiber; digestion; eating; fat intake; female; glucose blood level; heat; lactation; maize; metabolism; milk; parity; physiology; ruminant stomach; season; silage; Animals; Blood Glucose; Cattle; Dietary Fats; Dietary Fiber; Digestion; Eating; Energy Intake; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Heat; Lactation; Lipids; Medicago sativa; Milk; Milk Proteins; Parity; Rumen; Seasons; Silage; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038749380

Increases in distillation temperature from 125 to 250°C increased distillate yield from 0.3 to 42.7% (wt/wt). The distillate was enriched in short- and medium-chain fatty acids and low molecular weight acylglycerols, while the retentate was enriched in long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids as well as high molecular weight acylglyerols. As distillation temperature increased, dropping points of the distillate increased. Relative to native milk fat, the solid fat content (SFC) vs. temperature melting profile of the distillate was depressed and that of the retentate was augmented, which correlated with the saturated long-chain fatty acid content in the fractions. Retentate crystallization parameters obtained by fitting the Avrami model to SFC - time data, did not change as a function of distillation temperature, but varied as a function of the degree of undercooling. Changes in microstructure observed by polarized light microscopy also appeared to be solely a function of the degree of undercooling, with no observable differences between retentates obtained at the different distillation temperatures. In addition, no changes in the retentate's free energy of nucleation (ΔGc) as a function of distillation temperature were found.

Patients develop extreme insulin resistance and its complications, such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia and fatty liver. Mutations in the BSCL2 (which encodes seipin, a protein of unknown function) and AGPAT2 (which encodes 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2) genes have been reported in patients with CGL. AGPAT2 is a key enzyme involved in triglyceride and phospholipid biosynthesis and, thus, the discovery of AGPAT2 mutations has heightened interest in the biochemical pathways of triglyceride synthesis and their implications in human physiology and in the pathophysiology of obesity, lipodystrophies and other adipose tissue disorders. All enzymes involved in triglyceride synthesis, including AGPAT, have several known isoforms encoded by different genes. Assuming different substrate specificities of these enzymes, the human body might have many forms of triglycerides and phospholipids.

Little is known about fat distribution in adolescents with AN, especially with weight recovery. Objective: We sought to determine whether regional fat distribution in adolescents with AN is comparable with that in healthy adolescents and whether weight recovery results in increased trunk fat and truncal adiposity. Design: In 21 adolescent girls with AN and 21 control subjects matched for age and pubertal stage, we measured body-composition variables with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo. Weight recovery was defined as a ≥ 10% increase in body mass index. Results: At baseline, the girls with AN had a lower percentage of trunk fat than did the control subjects, whereas the percentage of extremity fat was not significantly different between the groups. Weight recovery in 13 subjects with AN resulted in an increased percentage of trunk fat and an increased ratio of trunk fat to extremity fat; however, this ratio did not exceed that of control subjects. Conclusions: In adolescents with AN, trunk fat rather than extremity fat is reduced. Weight recovery is associated with increased trunk fat and an increased ratio of trunk fat to extremity fat. In contrast with previous findings in adults, this most likely represents normalization of fat distribution rather than development of truncal adiposity.","Adolescents; Anorexia nervosa; Body composition; Eating disorders; Extremity fat; Fat mass; Lean body mass; Trunk fat","adolescence; adolescent; anorexia nervosa; article; body composition; body fat; body mass; body weight; clinical article; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; human; limb; lipid composition; lipid storage; obesity; puberty; statistical significance; trunk; abdomen; adipose tissue; case control study; pathology; pathophysiology; thorax; weight gain; Abdomen; Adipose Tissue; Adolescent; Anorexia Nervosa; Body Composition; Case-Control Studies; Extremities; Female; Humans; Thorax; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038578166

Based on the results of myocardial biopsies it has been reported that brain death-related catecholamine induced damage of the heart causes depletion of high-energy phosphates which could explain contractile dysfunction. Our group has shown in a series of 31P MRS experiments in cats that neither the onset of brain death, nor the hemodynamic deterioration which follows, nor its treatment with high dosages of dopamine affect the heart energetically as expressed by PCr/ATP ratios. However, after cardioplegic arrest and explantation, an initial and prolonged lower ATP content and an anomalous higher PCr/ATP ratio in the brain death group was found when compared with controls during long-term unperfused cold storage of the hearts. During subsequent reperfusion of the hearts, ATP and PCr levels in the brain death group were lower than in controls but equal partial recovery of PCr/ATP ratios was observed in both groups. It was concluded that PCr/ATP ratios need to be interpreted with great caution. Secondly, brain death-related hemodynamic instability is not related to significant changes of myocardial energy metabolism. Thirdly, brain death does affect the myocardial energy metabolism but the impact became apparent only during hypothermic storage and subsequent reperfusion of the donor heart.",,"Biomedical equipment; Biopsy; Brain; Cardiology; Transplantation (surgical); Myocardial energy metabolism; Metabolism; adenosine triphosphate; creatine phosphate; dopamine; phosphorus 31; animal model; brain death; cat; conference paper; controlled study; energy metabolism; heart muscle contractility; heart muscle metabolism; heart rate; heart transplantation; hemodynamic parameters; male; mean arterial pressure; metabolic parameters; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; organ donor; organ transplantation; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038558264

Abilities of carbon dioxide fixation and oxygen release measured in dark-stored leaves, which were subsequently light-adapted prior to analysis, were still retained even after 14 d. However, changes in carbon dioxide fixation of leaves during the course of storage and senescence did not provide a realistic pattern of photosynthetic performance since this was influenced by the stomatal aperture of both light-stored and dark-stored leaves. Meanwhile, the photochemical quenching and energy-quenching values of the leaves seemed to be maintained under both light and dark conditions but decreased greatly soon after the onset of leaf yellowing. On the other hand, the maximal variable fluorescence of leaves decreased in both light and dark but was kept higher in the light than in the dark before the onset of yellowing. This could indicate that a part of the photosystems in the chloroplasts may have already been denatured even before leaf yellowing of the dark-stored leaves becomes visually apparent and that functional or structural disorder in the leaf tissues may have occurred during dark storage. This could further imply that the photosynthetic structure of spinach leaves during postharvest storage is ably supported by low intensity light until the onset of leaf yellowing.",,"Spinacia oleracea; Spinacia oleracea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038513878

Such habitats contrast with more resource rich environments (e.g., marshes and swamps) inhabited by other turtle species for which parental investment and egg and hatchling components have been studied. We measured components of eggs, embryos, and hatchlings and determined levels of pre-ovulatory parental investment in Apalone mutica from Arkansas. Eggs averaged 7.34 g wet mass and 28.8% non-polar lipids (NPL) by dry mass. Triacylglycerol, an energy storage lipid, was the major lipid class component of eggs, averaging 82% of total egg lipids. Levels of structural (mostly polar) lipid classes were generally similar to those found in eggs of other turtle species, although proportions of phophatidylethanolamine were higher and increased with egg size. Incubation time averaged 55 ± SE 3.4 d. At 18 and 36 d of development, embryo dry mass represented 11% and 34%, respectively, of embryo dry mass at hatching. Thus, approximately two-thirds of the total increase in embryo dry mass occurred during the final one-third (18 d) of development. Hatchlings averaged 6.60 g wet mass and 25.9% NPL by dry mass. The index of parental investment in care (hatchling NPL/egg NPL) averaged 75.4%, the highest such index reported among turtles. High levels of pre-ovulatory, parental investment in trophic care of neonates appear to be a factor important to hatchling survival during early life stages such as dispersal from the nest, movement to aquatic habitats, and the period prior to which hatchlings attain a positive energy balance in relatively low resource environments.","Apalone mutica; Egg lipids; Embryo growth; Hatchling; Parental investment","egg; embryo; lipid; parental investment; turtle; Arkansas; United States; Amphibia; Apalone; Apalone mutica; Apalone mutica; Mya arenaria; Reptilia; Testudines; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038444181

Chipping and bulk fracture are major contributors in clinical failures of composite restorations. Fracture toughness (KIc) quantifies susceptibility for fracture, but experimental determination is complicated. It would be beneficial for the dental community if a relatively simple experiment, such as microhardness (HK), could be used to screen composites for fracture resistance. This study explores a possible correlation between KIc and HK. Methods. Composite cylinders (4mm diameter and ∼7mm long) were cured for five combinations of light intensity (I, mW/cm2) and curing time (T, s) to achieve a range of different total light energy densities (I×T=100×10, 100×20, 300×20, 300×40, and 700×60mWs/cm2). A chevron-notch was cut in the median plane of the cylinders for the fracture toughness test, which was executed in a displacement control mode at 6μm/s cross-head speed (sample size 4). Knoop hardness was determined at the median plane of the cylinders (sample size 6). The tests were performed 15min and 24h after curing. Results. Both the KIc and HK increased with increased light energy density and storage time. Linear regression analysis indicated a strong correlation between HK and KIc tested at the same time period (R2=0.97 and 0.90 for 15min and 24h, respectively). The correlation became weaker between the different storage times (R2=0.71), indicating a change in fracture toughness and/or microhardness mechanisms. Conclusion. Fracture toughness of a composite cannot be simply extrapolated from microhardness. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As it is more expensive to produce active power than reactive power, it is important to consider methods which can be adopted to minimise the use of the energy store. An application study of a STATCOM with energy storage giving special emphasis to control strategies which minimise the use of the stored energy is reported. Calculation techniques to determine the current rating of the IGBTs, diodes and connecting transformer as well as the losses associated with the switches when the compensator is operated under space-vector modulation are demonstrated. Application studies of the compensator with energy storage for load compensation, steady-state voltage control, mitigation of voltage sags and elimination of power oscillations are described. The analytical studies of each of these applications are supplemented by simulation results carried out in PSCAD/EMTDC and by experimental results obtained from a laboratory prototype.",,"Calculations; Computer simulation; Diodes; Electric energy storage; Electric power utilization; Electric switches; Electric transformers; Insulated gate bipolar transistors; Reactive power; Computer simulation; Electric currents; Electric energy storage; Electric loads; Electric switches; Electric transformers; Electric utilities; Insulated gate bipolar transistors; Mathematical models; Reactive power; Semiconductor diodes; Voltage control; Power oscillation; Software Package PSCAD/EMTDC; Space vector modulation; Static compensator; Static VAr compensator; Steady-state voltage control; Voltage control; Electric power systems; Active power; Power compensation; Power oscillations; Power system disturbances; Space vector modulation; Voltage sags",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038359390

A variable speed wind turbine has many advantages, mainly it can increase the power yield from the wind, alleviate the load peak in the electrical-mechanical drive train, and posses a long life time, also, it can offer the possibility to store the briefly timely wind-conditioned power fluctuations in the wind rotor, in which the rotary masses are used as storages of kinetic energy, consequently, the variable speed wind turbines are utilized in the wind power industry widely. In this work, on the basis of a planetary transmission a new kind of drive train for the variable speed wind turbines is proposed. The new drive train consists of wind rotor, three-shafted planetary gear set, generator and servo motor. The wind rotor is coupled with the planet carrier of the planetary transmission, the generator is connected with the ring gear through an adjustment gear pair, and the servo motor is fixed to the sun gear. By controlling the electromagnetic torque or speed of the servo motor, the variable speed operation of the wind rotor and the constant speed operation of the generator are realized, therefore, the generator can be coupled with the grid directly. At the nominal operation point, about 80% of the rotor power flow through the generator directly and 20% through the servo motor and a small power electronics system into the grid. As a result, the disadvantages in the traditional wind turbines, e.g. high price of power electronics system, much power loss, strong reaction from the grid and large crash load in the drive train will be avoided. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

HIF and its substitution have been measured mainly in animals fed single large meals with high protein content, but many species such as some dabbling ducks (Anatini) feed more continuously in intermittent small meals with low protein content. We measured HIF in seven mallard ducks (Arias platyrhynchos) eating mixed grain (corn, wheat, milo) ad libitum while floating on water at 23°C (thermoneutral) and 8°C. HIF was calculated as the difference in oxygen consumption between fed and fasted birds, correcting for costs of behavior, heat storage (change in body temperature), and heating food. Substitution occurred if HIF was lower at 8°C than at 23°C. Food intake of mallards averaged 83% of that required for maintenance (zero energy balance) at 23°C, and 68% of maintenance at 8°C. Mean HIF (±1 SE) was 1.59±0.61 1 O2 at 23°C and 1.48±0.68 1 O2 at 8°C. These values were 4.9% and 3.9% of metabolizable energy intake, consistent with values expected for grain. HIF did not differ between temperatures (ANCOVA, birds as blocks, intake as covariate, P=0.51), indicating no measurable substitution at these intake levels in intermittent meals. For these large birds that feed on low-protein foods in intermittent small meals, the ecological importance of HIF substitution appears negligible during periods when food intake is below that required for energy balance.","Digestion; Heat increment of feeding; Intake level; Metabolism; Thermoregulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038208082

In this mini-review, we describe recent progress that has been made with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in understanding formation of TAG and its cell biological role. Formation of TAG involves the synthesis of phosphatidic acid (PA) and diacylglycerol (DAG), two key intermediates of lipid metabolism. De novo formation of PA in yeast as in other types of cells can occur either through the glycerol-3-phosphate- or dihydroxyacetone phosphate-pathways - each named after its respective precursor. PA, formed in two steps of acylation, is converted to DAG by phosphatidate phosphatase. Acylation of DAG to yield TAG is catalyzed mainly by the two yeast proteins Dga1p and Lro1p, which utilize acyl-CoA or phosphatidylcholine, respectively, as acyl donors. In addition, minor alternative routes of DAG acylation appear to exist. Endoplasmic reticulum and lipid particles (LP), the TAG storage compartment in yeast, are the major sites of TAG synthesis. The interplay of these organelles, formation of LP, and enzymatic properties of enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of PA, DAG, and TAG in yeast are discussed in this communication.",,"acyl coenzyme A; diacylglycerol; fungal protein; lipid; phosphatidate phosphatase; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidylcholine; triacylglycerol; fatty acid; yeast; acylation; catalysis; cell organelle; endoplasmic reticulum; enzyme specificity; hydrolysis; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; nonhuman; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; short survey; yeast cell; Eukaryota; Saccaromyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038182336

Accordingly contamination problems have been a concern of information storage industry because it may cause a serious damage to solid immersion lens (SIL) of optical flying head. Sub-micro contaminants in air bearing of the NFR slider may affect the flyability and stability of the optical slider. In addition, the cleaning of small particles becomes more difficult as the contaminant particle size decreases because the adhesion force increases very much as the particle size decreases. Recently developed high-frequency ultrasonic (megasonic) cleaning technique have made it possible to remove sub-micron particles less than 100 nm without surface erosion and many remarkable results have been reported. In this paper, the megasonic technique is applied and tested for the cleaning of the flying head of NFR drive. 1 MHz ultrasound with maximum 100 W was used to remove polystyrene latex (PSL) particles and alumina particles deposited on the surface of the slider. Effective cleaning performance was observed without any damages on the slider surface using optical microscope and AFM at different ultrasonic energy levels and cleaning times.","Contamination; Near-field recording (NFR); Solid immersion lens (SIL); Sub-micron particles; Ultrasonic cleaning","Alumina; Atomic force microscopy; Contamination; Latexes; Microscopes; Optical data storage; Optical instrument lenses; Optical recording; Particle size analysis; Polystyrenes; Removal; Near field recording; Optical flying head; Optical sliders; Solid immersion lens; Submicron particles; Ultrasonic cleaning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038137966

H3A 1A1, Canada","Triacylglycerol storage in adipose tissue is mediated by a host of transporters, enzymes and binding proteins. Additionally, several hormones (both autocrine and endocrine) are known to interact with cell surface receptors and modulate triacylglycerol synthesis (such as acylation stimulating protein, ASP). The many proteins involved contribute to the robustness of the system and, in most cases, deletion of a single gene is not deleterious and adipose tissue is preserved. On the other hand, this does not mean that gene disruption is not without effect, and in fact often results in a leaner, and presumably ""healthier"" mouse. These insights provide valuable indications for potential drug tools to delay and/or reverse obesity. In this review we examine the potential of ASP as a candidate target. ASP deficiency in mice decreases adipose tissue mass, increases insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure even in obese ob/ob mice, suggesting that partial interference of ASP action could be advantageous. ASP interacts with a specific cell surface receptor present in adipose tissue and certain structural components, such as the tightly folded core region, are implicated in activity. We propose that interference of the ASP-receptor interaction using an antagonist offers future prospect for an anti-obesity target.","Adipose tissue; C3adesArg; Energy expenditure; Insulin sensitivity; Knockout mice","acylation stimulating protein; antiobesity agent; apolipoprotein C1; apolipoprotein C2; apolipoprotein C3; CD36 antigen; cell surface receptor; diacylglycerol acyltransferase; fatty acid binding protein; fatty acid synthase; glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase; insulin; lipoprotein lipase; long chain fatty acid coenzyme A ligase; phosphatidate phosphatase; protein inhibitor; uncoupling protein; very low density lipoprotein receptor; adipose tissue; energy expenditure; human; insulin sensitivity; lipogenesis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein deficiency; protein function; protein interaction; protein targeting; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038127269

Surg., University Clinic, Pamplona, Spain","Obesity, the most common nutritional disorder in industrial countries, is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Nevertheless, the molecular basis linking obesity with cardiovascular disturbances have not yet been fully clarified. Recent advances in the biology of adipose tissue indicate that it is not simply an energy storage organ, but also a secretory organ, producing a variety of bioactive substances, including leptin and adiponectin, that may influence the function as well as the structural integrity of the cardiovascular system. Leptin, besides being a satiety signal for the central nervous system and to be related to insulin and glucose metabolism, may also play an important role in regulating vascular tone because of the widespread distribution of functional receptors in the vascular cells. On the other hand, the more recently discovered protein, adiponectin, seems to play a protective role in experimental models of vascular injury, in probable relation to its ability to suppress the attachment of monocytes to endothelial cells, which is an early event in the atherosclerotic process. There is already considerable evidence linking altered production of some adipocyte hormones with the cardiovascular complications of obesity. Therefore, the knowledge of alterations in the endocrine function of adipose tissue may help to further understand the high cardiovascular risk associated with obesity.","Adipocytes; Adiponectin; Cardiovascular diseases; Leptin; Obesity","adiponectin; glucose; insulin; leptin; leptin receptor; adipocyte; adipose tissue; animal model; atherosclerosis; blood vessel injury; blood vessel tone; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular function; cardiovascular risk; cell adhesion; central nervous system; disease association; endocrine function; endocrine gland; endothelium cell; experimental model; gene mutation; glucose metabolism; hormone synthesis; human; industrialization; inhibition kinetics; insulin metabolism; molecular mechanics; monocyte; morbidity; mortality; nonhuman; nutritional disorder; obesity; pathogenesis; protein analysis; protein function; protein localization; protein synthesis; rat; risk assessment; satiety; short survey; signal transduction; Animalia",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038116319

The SAS2H calculation module has been used to simulate different irradiation histories of all spent fuel assemblies and to process the resulting libraries for input to ORIGEN-S code depletion-decay calculations. Using this procedure the characteristics of the spent fuel assemblies for six cooling times have been calculated. Obtained results are presented and discussed in the paper. The CSAS6 module with KENO-VI criticality code based on the 44-group energy cross-sections library has been used to solve criticality aspects.

The prevailing hypothesis about the mechanisms of the extraordinary and unexpected good oxygen barrier properties of the laminate is blocking of the paper pores. This work shows that the oxygen transmission rate through such laminates is strongly influenced by an uneven transcrystalline layer in the polyethylene coating in contact with the paper surface. The polyethylene coating is a dynamic entity in where chain mobility of the polyethylene and the optimal properties of the paper surface improve the oxygen barrier during storage where conditions for transcrystallisation are present. Paper made of intensively refined fibres not dried prior to papermaking gives more optimal surfaces than papers made of previously dried fibres. The ""wet"" pulp seems to give a more favourable surface for transcrystalline structural formation and an improved contact between the materials, giving a better oxygen barrier as a consequence. 1H NMR T2-relaxation measurements show higher mobility of the water bound in these papers/fibres.

Reliance on each varies, but both are characterized by energy stored in excess of current demands for future use. Fasted Siberian hamsters decrease their lipid stores and, upon refeeding, food hoarding rather than food intake increases. Here, we tested the effect of foraging-effort level on fasting-induced increases in food hoarding and whether decreases in total body fat or individual fat pad masses were associated with the hoarding increases. This was accomplished by housing female Siberian hamsters in a foraging/hoarding system where they earned food pellets upon completion of a programmed number of wheel revolutions (10, 75 or 200 per 75-mg pellet), or had no foraging requirement (free food and an active or blocked running wheel). After baseline, half the hamsters in each group were food deprived for 32 h and then refed (control hamsters were killed after the fast without refeeding). Fasted-refed hamsters increased foraging and food hoarding, especially at the lowest foraging effort, but not food intake, with few exceptions. These responses became progressively smaller as foraging effort increased. Fasting induced similar losses in carcass lipid across foraging efforts, but the lipid loss was not uniform across the fat pads and was not clearly related to hoard size. Collectively, the fasting-induced, increased food hoarding may be triggered by an overall change in energy metabolism rather than by a general or fat-pad-specific decrease in lipid stores. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

In this current preliminary study, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to investigate the biochemical effects of differing concentrations of pyruvate (3 and 15mM) on liver metabolism during the cold hypoxic preservation period itself, in order to gain insight into possible mechanisms. Hepatic lactate, alanine, and succinate levels were increased in livers preserved with 15mM pyruvate added to the University of Wisconsin (UW) solution and were generally elevated (but to a lesser degree) in livers flushed with 3mM pyruvate, compared to those cold stored in UW alone. Further, from enzymatic assays of adenine nucleotides, 15mM levels of pyruvate were found to maintain higher ATP levels during short periods (up to 4h) of cold hypoxic storage than in UW stored livers, whilst energy charge ratios (after 4 and 24h) were also higher (P<0.01 in each case). This may arise from enhanced glycolysis secondary to an improved redox status in the pyruvate-treated livers, as evident by the increase in the levels of lactate. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

This facility is designed to supply 500000, 4-mm-outer diameter targets per day - coated via interfacial polycondensation, dried with supercritical CO2, sputter coated with Au and/or Pd, and filled with deuterium-tritium layered at cryogenic temperatures and injected into the fusion chamber. Such targets would be used in a direct-drive IFE power plant. The work uses manufacturing processes being developed in the laboratory, chemical engineering scaleup principles, and established cost-estimating methods. The plant conceptual design includes a process flow diagram, mass and energy balances, equipment sizing and sketches, storage tanks, and facility views. The cost estimate includes both capital and operating costs. Initial results for a TFF dedicated to one 1000MW(electric) plant indicate that the costs per target are well within the commercially viable range. Larger TFF plants [3000 MW(electric)] are projected to lead to significantly reduced costs per injected target. Additional cost reductions are possible by producing dried, sputter-coated empty shells at a central facility that services multiple power plants.

A copper vapour laser (CVL) can be used to label the cobalt-chromium components of dentures and metal restorations easily, and legibly, and miniaturised for the incorporation of more personal particulars necessary for the identification of the deceased person. The CVL beam is focussed by its optics and delivered to the material surface by the two-axis scanner mounted with mirrors. A personal computer controls the movement of the scanner and the firing of the CVL. The high peak power of the pulsed CVL is focussed to very high energy density producing plasma ablation of the alloy surface. Very fine markings of a few microns width can be produced enabling the storage of detailed information of the deceased person on a metal surface for the purpose of rapid identification.","Copper-vapour laser; Forensic odontology; ID-markings; Metal dentures and restorations","alloy; chromium; cobalt; copper; metal; analytical parameters; article; cadaver identification; denture; energy; forensic identification; information processing; information retrieval; laser; microcomputer; optics; priority journal; surface property; vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037947512

The control system shows faster energy ramping and more stable beam characteristics than the previous energy ramping control system that consists of an operator interface workstation, subsystem control computer and machine interface units. The previous system controls current settings of the magnet power supplies in multiple steps with different energy increment rate during the energy ramping. In order to improve synchronization of the magnet power supply systems and beam stabilities during the energy ramping, we developed the energy ramping controller hardware that is controlled using a network of optical fibers. Thus, the new ramping system is able to control more synchronously the magnet power supplies with a constant energy increment rate during the energy ramping. With this reliable synchronization, it is also possible to perform the energy de-ramping step from 2.5 GeV to 2.0 GeV on operation.

We investigated the use of antioxidants with a standard skim milk extender and several gas environments during storage of stallion spermatozoa to reduce the harmful effects of oxygen while maintaining sperm metabolism. The antioxidant treatments were: ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione, tempol, quercetin, or no antioxidant. The gas environments were: perfluorochemical (PFC) charged with nitrogen, oxygen, 95% oxygen:5% carbon dioxide, or vacuum, or no PFC. Each of the five antioxidant treatments was combined with each of the five gas environment treatments for a total of 25 treatments. Sperm viability was assessed by motility rating, membrane integrity, and internal ATP concentration at 48, 96, and 144 h of storage. Antioxidant effectiveness was assessed using xanthine-xanthine oxidase challenge. Any treatment with PFC charged with oxygen resulted in lower sperm motility and a lower percentage of membrane-intact cells than any other treatment. Sperm subjected to any PFC treatment had higher internal ATP concentrations compared with sperm stored in the standard extender. Sperm stored in any quercetin treatment had higher motility, higher percentage of membrane-intact cells, and higher ATP content than sperm stored in any other antioxidant medium or standard extender. In addition, quercetin and tempol were successful in preventing lipid peroxidation while glutathione and ascorbic acid functioned as pro-oxidants in the challenge. We conclude that the viability of stallion sperm can be maintained during storage with the use of PFC charged with vacuum or nitrogen to exclude oxygen, and with the antioxidant, quercetin, in the extender to prevent peroxidative damage and improve the efficiency of energy use in the sperm.",,"adenosine triphosphate; antioxidant; ascorbic acid; carbon dioxide; glutathione; nitrogen; oxidoreductase; oxygen; perfluoro compound; preservative; quercetin; tempol; xanthine; animal cell; article; cell damage; cell membrane; cell viability; controlled study; cryopreservation; energy; gas; lipid peroxidation; male; metabolism; milk; nonhuman; priority journal; sperm; sperm preservation; spermatozoon motility; stallion; storage; vacuum; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037931513

Success of these activities depends upon the ability of mussels to survive emersion and to re-burrow in the substratum. We evaluated the acute sublethal effects of emersion on three species of unionid mussels [pocketbook, Lampsilis cardium (Rafinesque, 1820); pimpleback, Quadrula pustulosa pustulosa (I. Lea, 1831); spike, Elliptio dilatata (Rafinesque, 1820)] by measuring three biochemicals (carbohydrate, lipid, protein) indicative of biochemical function and energy storage. Mussels were acclimated in water at 25°C and exposed to five air temperatures (15, 20, 25, 35 and 45°C) for 15, 30 and 60 min. After emersion, mussels were returned to water at 25°C and observed for 14 days. Samples of mantle tissue were taken after the 14-day postexposure period and analysed for carbohydrate, lipid and protein. Three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not reveal consistent trends in carbohydrate, lipid or protein concentrations due to sex of mussels, duration of emersion, air temperature or their interaction terms that indicated biological compensation to stress. Overall mean carbohydrate concentrations were greatest (range 447-615 mg/g dry wt) among the species, followed by protein (179-289 mg/g dry wt) and lipids (26.7-38.1 mg/g dry wt). These results have positive implications for conducting conservation activities, because emersion over the range of temperatures (15-35°C) and durations (15-60 min) examined did not appear acutely harmful to mussels.",,"biochemical composition; conservation management; emersion; mollusc; sublethal effect; Bivalvia; Bivalvia; Cardium; Elliptio; Elliptio dilatata; Elliptio dilatata; Lampsilis; Lampsilis cardium; Lampsilis cardium; Lampsilis ovata; Mollusca; Quadrula; Quadrula pustulosa; Quadrula pustulosa; Quadrula pustulosa pustulosa; Unionidae; Unionidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037910461

Energy Technology Laboratory, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, United States","A major contributor to increased atmospheric CO 2 levels is fossil fuel combustion. Roughly one third of the carbon emissions in the United States comes from power plants. Since electric generation is expected to grow and fossil fuels will continue to be the dominant fuel source, there is growing recognition that the energy industry can be part of the solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by capturing and permanently sequestering CO 2 . Consequently, an important component of the United States Department of Energy's (DOE) research and development program is dedicated to reducing CO 2 emissions from power plants by developing technologies for capturing CO 2 and for subsequent utilization and/or sequestration. Injection of CO 2 into geologic formations is being practiced today by the petroleum industry for enhanced oil recovery, but it is not yet possible to predict with confidence storage volumes, formation integrity and permanence over long time periods. Many important issues dealing with geologic storage, monitoring and verification of fluids (including CO 2 ) in underground oil and gas reservoirs, coal beds and saline formations must be addressed. Field demonstrations are needed to confirm practical considerations, such as economics, safety, stability, permanence and public acceptance. This paper presents an overview of DOE's research program in the area of CO 2 sequestration and storage in geologic formations and specifically addresses the status of new knowledge, improved tools and enhanced technology for cost optimization, monitoring, modeling and capacity estimation. This paper also highlights those fundamental and applied studies, including field tests, sponsored by DOE that are measuring the degree to which CO 2 can be injected and remain safely and permanently sequestered in geologic formations while concurrently assuring no adverse long term ecological impacts.

This research investigated the impact and dynamic response of three different high-density polymeric structural foams; designated A, B and C for proprietary reasons. Foam-C had the lowest density out of the three; density of foam-B was approximately twice the density of foam-C, while the density of foam-A was about three times the density of foam-C. The cylindrical foam samples were initially impacted at different velocities in a DYNATUP Model 8250 instrumented impact test machine and their energy absorption was characterized from the resulting load-deflection data. Each of the three foams was then modeled as filler inside a circular steel tube of 0.8 mm thickness. Non-linear finite element analysis was performed under displacement controlled quasi-static compressive monotonic loading using PATRAN as pre-processor and ABAQUS Standard commercial software. The area under the load-deflection curve was calculated to obtain the absorbed energy and the crush loads for the three foam fillers were compared. Results indicate that foam-A having the highest density was more effective as filler inside the circular steel tube, with the intermediate density foam-B performing equally well under uni-axial compressive loading. Foam-C, which had the lowest density, was found to be ineffective as filler in this application due to large differences in stiffness between this foam and the enclosed steel tube. A TA Instruments Model 983 DMA (dynamic mechanical analyzer) was used for obtaining the storage and loss modulus along with the damping and glass transition properties of the different density structural foams. Frequency multiplexing was also used in conjunction with the time-temperature superposition principle for characterizing the long-term behavior of these viscoelastic foams. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The salt is a eutectic mixture of hydrate nitrates of ammonium and magnesium, with low melting temperature, already tested for latent heat storage in domestic applications. In the discharge mode, cold water enters the tank and flows on the encapsulated melted PCM, which is cooled and solidified. In the initial condition the PCM is at its melting temperature. Suddenly its external surface is cooled to a constant temperature T0; the duration of the solidification represents the time in which the latent heat is released to water. The discharge process of the phase change material (PCM) is analyzed analytically and its effectiveness is assessed, for constant surface temperature conditions, in three different geometrical configurations, i.e. considering the PCM encapsulated in slab, cylindrical or spherical polyethylene containers. The focus is on a model of the moving boundary within the phase-change material during the discharging mode, and the duration of the phenomenon. Results shown include transient position of the moving surface, temperature distribution, amount of solid PCM, energy released, and duration of complete solidification. The influence of the geometry and the Jacob number on the ending time of solidification is investigated. Among different geometrical configurations of the PCM, it is found that the shortest time for complete solidification is matched for small spherical capsules, with high Jacob numbers and thermal conductivity. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The PCM is prepared in modules, with the modules equispaced across the absorber plate. The underside of the absorber plate, together with the vertical sides of the PCM module container, serve as air heating vanes. Air flow through the system is by natural convection. Energy balance equations are developed for each major component of the heater and linked with heat and mass balance equations for the heated air flowing through the system. The airflow rate is determined by balancing the buoyancy head resulting from thermally induced density differences and the friction head due to various flow resistances. The predicted performance of the system is compared with experimental data under daytime no-load conditions over the ambient temperature range of 19-41 °C and daily global irradiation of 4.9-19.9 MJ m-2. Predicted temperatures at specific locations on the absorber plate, heat exchanger plate, glazing, and heated air agree closely with experimental data to within 10, 6, 8, and 10 °C, respectively. Maximum predicted cumulative useful and overall efficiencies of the system are within the ranges 2.5-13 and 7.5-18%, respectively. Correlations of the predicted efficiencies are presented. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Incremental improvement of their heat release characteristics could pave the way for commercial applications as phase change materials (PCM). These chemicals could provide a biomaterial alternative to a technology dominated by paraffin and salt products. Mixture heats of fusion and melting points were evaluated for single acid derivatives of stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids to develop a fundamental understanding of the solid-liquid transition and to better understand how to convert natural compositions to useful PCM products. Many mixtures of monoacid derivatives of a single fatty acid formed single sharp solid-liquid phase transitions useful for PCM applications. These mixtures also qualitatively exhibited freezing point depression therein allowing the mixture composition to be used as a means to control the temperature of the phase transition. In mixtures of monoacid derivatives from different fatty acids, melting occurred over wider temperature ranges with eventual separation of the solid-liquid transition to at least two different events. This work demonstrates that it is possible to fully convert natural fatty acid mixtures into high performance phase change materials. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this work, nanocrystalline La(Ni,M)5 (M=Mn, Al, and Co) alloys have been synthesized by mechanical alloying (MA) followed by annealing. The discharge capacity of electrodes prepared by application of MA and annealed LaNi5 alloy powder is low. It was found that the partial substitution of Ni by Al or Mn in La(Ni,M)5 alloy leads to an increase in discharge capacity. On the other hand, cobalt substituting nickel in LaNi4-xMn0.75Al0.25Cox greatly improves the cycle life of this material. For x=0.25 the discharge capacities up to ∼260mAhg-1 were measured at current density of charging and discharging of i=40mAg-1. The studies show that electrochemical properties of Ni-MHx batteries are a function of chemical composition and microstructure of the electrode materials used. XPS studies showed that the shape of the valence band measured for the arc-melted (polycrystalline) LaNi5 is practically the same as that reported earlier for the single crystalline sample. The substitution of Ni by Al in LaNi5 leads to significant modifications of the electronic structure of the polycrystalline sample. Furthermore, the XPS valence band of the MA nanocrystalline LaNi4Al1 alloy is considerably broader compared to that measured for the polycrystalline sample. The strong modifications of the electronic structure and the significant surface segregation of lanthanum atoms in the MA nanocrystalline LaNi5-type alloys could significantly influence its hydrogenation properties. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Yet, most computer-aided design (CAD) approaches follow the strategy employed in traditional practice: an initial model, created with empirical or approximate rules, is tested (analyzed) and modified (optimized) until it meets specifications. The key concept in this CAD approach is thus the efficient combination of numerical analysis with an optimization strategy. In this paper we explore a new approach to electromagnetic design of waveguide filters and aim at creating an alternative design methodology. The main idea consists in exploiting the intrinsic optimization capability of electromagnetic fields to minimize energy storage and losses, not by means of a variational formulation, but by exploiting the topology of three-dimensional standing wave pattern created in space.

A newly developed stochastic model of precipitation and constructed GIS databases are applied to estimation of potential water resources in the Hakata bay watershed in Japan. Based on these results, water supply alternatives in the watershed are selected at several return periods on less annual precipitation in the order of minimizing cost, LCE, and damages. The water supply alternatives selected are cascade reuse in house, groundwater, two kinds of recycled water, and desalinated water. The storage water volume in the reservoirs at initial time, annual precipitation, and annual precipitation patterns are considered as three factors on water shortage from the water supply side. The unit values of cost, LCE, and damages are obtained to estimate damages of water shortage and to consider measures for water supply by applying the above three factors. Finally, based on statistical distribution of damages on water shortage, a new planning method to avoid water shortage is developed and how to decide a design precipitation level is proposed in terms of the return period of damages instead of that of precipitation.","Cost; GIS; Hakata Bay; LCE; Precipitation; Stochastic model; Water shortage damages","Database systems; Desalination; Geographic information systems; Groundwater; Life cycle; Precipitation (meteorology); Reservoirs (water); Statistical methods; Stochastic programming; Urban planning; Water recycling; Watersheds; Life cycle energy (LCE); Water supply systems; ground water; GIS; numerical model; resource management; urban area; water planning; water supply; city planning; conference paper; economic aspect; geography; precipitation; stochastic model; waste water recycling; water deficit; water quality; water supply; watershed; Hakata Bay; Japan; Kyushu",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037587395

However the high cost of fullerenes prevents their use for hydrogen storage. The only industrial method of fullerene production is arc discharge with graphite electrodes, but its optimum efficiency is far too low. Transformation of a chaotic carbon vapor into fullerenes is not well understood. It is known that carbon in the arc discharge region can only exist in the form of atoms or atomic ions. On the other hand, the location of the region, where the fullerenes arise, is also determined. No experimental research on the intermediate products, as applied to the arc discharge conditions, has been undertaken.

It is a global problem that will need to be solved on a global level. The link between anthropogenic emissions of CO2 with increased atmospheric CO2 levels and, in turn, with increased global temperatures has been well established and accepted by the world. International organizations such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have been formed to address this issue. Three options are being explored to stabilize atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and global temperatures without severely and negatively impacting standard of living: (1) increasing energy efficiency, (2) switching to less carbon-intensive sources of energy, and (3) carbon sequestration. To be successful, all three options must be used in concert. The third option is the subject of this review. Specifically, this review will cover the capture and geologic sequestration of CO2 generated from large point sources, namely fossil-fuel-fired power gasification plants. Sequestration of CO2 in geological formations is necessary to meet the President’s Global Climate Change Initiative target of an 18% reduction in GHG intensity by 2012. Further, the best strategy to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of CO2 results from a multifaceted approach where sequestration of CO2 into geological formations is combined with increased efficiency in electric power generation and utilization, increased conservation, increased use of lower carbonintensity fuels, and increased use of nuclear energy and renewables. This review covers the separation and capture of CO2 from both flue gas and fuel gas using wet scrubbing technologies, dry regenerable sorbents, membranes, cryogenics, pressure and temperature swing adsorption, and other advanced concepts. Existing commercial CO2 capture facilities at electric power-generating stations based on the use of monoethanolamine are described, as is the Rectisol process used by Dakota Gasification to separate and capture CO2 from a coal gasifier. Two technologies for storage of the captured CO2 are reviewed—sequestration in deep unmineable coalbeds with concomitant recovery of CH4 and sequestration in deep saline aquifers. Key issues for both of these techniques include estimating the potential storage capacity, the storage integrity, and the physical and chemical processes that are initiated by injecting CO2 underground. Recent studies using computer modeling as well as laboratory and field experimentation are presented here. In addition, several projects have been initiated in which CO2 is injected into a deep coal seam or saline aquifer. The current status of several such projects is discussed. Included is a commercial-scale project in which a million tons of CO2 are injected annually into an aquifer under the North Sea in Norway. The review makes the case that this can all be accomplished safely with off-the-shelf technologies. However, substantial research and development must be performed to reduce the cost, decrease the risks, and increase the safety of sequestration technologies. This review also includes discussion of possible problems related to deep injection of CO2. There are safety concerns that need to be addressed because of the possibilities of leakage to the surface and induced seismic activity. These issues are presented along with a case study of a similar incident in the past. It is clear that monitoring and verification of storage will be a crucial part of all geological sequestration practices so that such problems may be avoided. Available techniques include direct measurement of CO2 and CH4 surface soil fluxes, the use of chemical tracers, and underground 4-D seismic monitoring. Ten new hypotheses were formulated to describe what happens when CO2 is pumped into a coal seam. These hypotheses provide significant insight into the fundamental chemical, physical, and thermodynamic phenomena that occur during coal seam sequestration of CO2. © 2003 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Electric power generation; Energy efficiency; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Separation; Anthropogenic emissions; Global warming; adsorption; aquifer; climate change; electric power plant; environmental factor; geology; greenhouse effect; monitoring; nuclear energy; organic matter production; phase separation; power supply; priority journal; review; thermodynamics; climate; environmental monitoring; water supply; carbon dioxide; coal; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Geology; Greenhouse Effect; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037532892

When the storage facility fills to capacity, it is necessary to haul material off-site for disposal, construct a new storage facility, or find a use for some of the material. Because certain criteria must be met to successfully beneficiate the ash, mapping the ash reserve provides data that shows where the most promising recovery sites will be.The University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research (CAER) in conjunction with Western Kentucky Energy (WKE) and the US Department of Energy are constructing an ash beneficiation plant to recover high quality fuel and lightweight aggregate from the ash ponds at WKE's Coleman Station in Hawesville, KY. To determine the locations of the most productive areas, an extensive sampling and mapping project is underway. An amphibious ATV-mounted hydraulic drill has been employed to take core samples throughout the pond. These samples are then evaluated for particle size distribution, carbon content, chemical and leaching properties. With this information as well as each drill-hole's GPS coordinates and aerial photographs of the plant site, digital maps have been produced showing trends of deposition of material in the pond.

This recognition is elevating interest and activity toward the development and application of alternative/renewable sources of energy, such as solar energy to displace some of the use of fossil fuels. In this context, Saudi Arabia being enriched with fairly high degree of solar radiation, is a suitable candidate for deployment of solar photo-voltaic (PV) panels for power generation in crisis. Literature shows that residential buildings in Saudi Arabia consume about 47% of the total electric energy generated/consumed. In the present study, hourly mean solar radiation data for the period 1986-1993 recorded at the solar radiation and meteorological monitoring station, Dhahran (26° 32' N, 50°13' E), Saudi Arabia, have been analyzed to examine/investigate the potential of utilizing hybrid (PV + diesel) power systems to meet the load requirements of a typical residential building (with annual electrical energy demand of 35 200 kWh). The monthly average daily values of solar global irradiation for Dhahran range from 3.61 kwh/m2 to 7.96 kwh/m2. The hybrid systems considered in the present analysis consist of different combinations of PV panels/modules (different array sizes) supplemented with battery storage unit and diesel back-up. The study shows that with 225 m2 PV together with 12 h of battery storage, the diesel back-up system has to provide 9% of the load demand. However, in absence of battery bank, about 58% of the load needs to be provided by the diesel system. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The document also provides methods to estimate upper-bound values of the through thickness residual stress distribution for a range of common weld joint configurations. The present paper presents approaches to modify the R6 Option 1 failure assessment diagram (FAD) for loss of crack tip constraint pertaining to primary and non-uniform residual stress. The modified FAD was formulated for probabilistic fracture mechanics analyses of semi-elliptical surface cracks located at transverse deck welds of floating production, storage and off-loading vessels designed to operate in the North Sea. The objective was to study the influence on the failure probability of modifying the FAD for constraint and allowing for non-uniform residual stress. Another objective was to study the influence of constraint correction on the combined fatigue and fracture failure probability for the vessels subjected to wave loading. The results demonstrate clearly the importance of correcting for crack tip constraint pertaining to both primary and secondary stress and to allow for non-uniform residual stress for shallow surface flaws of known crack heights. However, in combination with fatigue crack growth the effects become less prominent as the failure probability is governed by the uncertainty in the parameters of the crack growth relationship and the long-term stress distribution. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Conventional energy will not be enough to meet the continuously increasing need for energy in the future. In this case, renewable energy sources will become important. Solar energy is a very important energy source because of its advantages. Instead of a compressor system, which uses electricity, an absorption cooling system, using renewable energy and kinds of waste heat energy, may be used for cooling. In this study, a solar-powered, single stage, absorption cooling system, using a water-lithium bromide solution, is simulated. A modular computer program has been developed for the absorption system to simulate various cycle configurations and solar energy parameters for Antalya, Turkey. So, the effects of hot water inlet temperatures on the coefficient of performance (COP) and the surface area of the absorption cooling components are studied. In addition, reference temperatures which are the minimum allowable hot water inlet temperatures are determined and their effect on the fraction of the total load met by non-purchased energy (FNP) and the coefficient of performance are researched. Also, the effects of the collector type and storage tank mass are investigated in detail. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Thermodynamic and experimental studies on the cold storage capacity and the cold discharging process, in which the adsorber is either air cooled or adiabatic, have been presented. An adsorption cold storage system with zeolite-water working pair has been developed, and some operating results are summarized. This system is used for providing air conditioning for the driver's cab of an internal combustion locomotive. Unlike a normal adsorption air conditioner, the system starts running with the adsorption process, during which the cold energy stored is discharged, and ends running with the generation process. The adsorbent temperature decreases during the cold storing period between two runs. The refrigeration power output for the whole running cycle is about 4.1 kW. It appears that such a system is quite energetically efficient and is comparatively suitable for providing discontinuous refrigeration capacity when powered by low grade thermal energy, such as industrial exhausted heat or solar energy. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The two main operating modes are described. Solar air heaters provide thermal energy for driving a vapor compression heat pump. The TES unit ensures a more efficient usage of the collected solar energy. The TES operation is modeled by using two non-linear coupled partial differential equations for the temperature of the storage medium and heat transfer fluid, respectively. Preliminary results show that smaller TES units provide a higher heat flux to the heat pump vaporiser. This makes the small TES unit discharge more rapidly during time periods with higher thermal loads. The larger TES units provide heat during longer time periods, even if the heat flux they supply is generally smaller. The maximum heat flux is extracted from the TES unit during the morning. Both the heat pump COP and exergy efficiency decrease when the TES unit length increases. Also, the monthly thermal energy stored by the TES unit and the monthly energy necessary to drive the heat pump compressor are increased by increasing the TES unit length. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The selected fatty acids were stearic, palmitic, myristic and lauric acid with melting temperatures between 40-63°C and industrial-grade with 90-95 % purity. Latent heat storage capacity and phase transition temperature of the PCMs were determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) technique as a function of after repeated thermal cycles such as 40, 410, 700 and 910. The present work also comprises the investigation of corrosion resistance of some construction materials to the fatty acids over a long period. The containment materials tested were stainless steel (SS 304 L), carbon steel (steel C20), aluminium (Al) and copper (Cu). Gravimetric analysis as mass loss (mg/cm2), corrosion rate (mg/day) and a microscopic or matellographic investigation were performed for corrosion tests after 910 thermal cycles. DSC measurements showed that all fatty acids investigated as PCMs have a good thermal stability as a function of latent heat and phase transition temperature range for an actual middle-term thermal energy storage utility. However, in long-term solar thermal applications, the palmitic acid and myristic acid may be considered more suitable PCMs than the others. From the gravimetric and metallographic results, it can be concluded that stainless steel (SS 304L) with chromium oxide (Cr2O3) surface layer and Al with aluminium oxide (Al2O3) surface layer are essentially compatible with the investigated fatty acids. Carbon steel (Steel C20) and Cupper (Cu) are only preferantially compatible with PCMs. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The consequences of this diet for ischemic heart disease (IHD) remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the association of adipose tissue n-6 fatty acids, which are derived entirely from the diet, with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). DESIGN: A total of 180 cases and 492 IHD-free controls aged 25-64 were included in a population-based case-control study of Jerusalem residents hospitalized with a first AMI. Diet was assessed by the use of a food-frequency questionnaire and adipose tissue fatty acids by gas chromatography of biopsy samples taken from subcutaneous gluteal tissue. The data were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Dietary PUFAs (: 10.1% of energy) correlated (r = 0.43, P < 0.001) with adipose tissue linoleic acid, which constituted 25.6% of storage fatty acids. High intakes of linoleic acid were not associated with excess risk of AMI (age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio for the third versus the first tertile: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.48; NS). In contrast, arachidonic acid, the long chain n-6 derivative of linoleic acid, was positively associated with AMI (age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.33, 3.36; P = 0.004). With multivariate adjustment, there was no evidence for an adverse association of linoleic acid with AMI, whereas the risk associated with arachidonic acid persisted, albeit attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: A very high linoleic acid intake does not appear to confer increased risk of nonfatal AMI. Nonetheless, the increased risk associated with arachidonic acid, a finding that requires confirmation, tempers an inference that diets rich in n-6 fatty acids are safe vis-à-vis coronary health.",,"arachidonic acid; edible oil; linoleic acid; omega 6 fatty acid; unsaturated fatty acid; adipose tissue; adult; article; case control study; chemistry; female; heart infarction; heart muscle ischemia; human; jew; male; metabolism; middle aged; statistical model; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Arachidonic Acid; Case-Control Studies; Dietary Fats, Unsaturated; Fatty Acids, Omega-6; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Female; Humans; Jews; Linoleic Acid; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Ischemia; MLCS; MLOWN",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037395724

Effective performance of such a repository would rely on a number of natural and engineered barriers to isolate radioactive waste from the accessible environment. Groundwater beneath Yucca Mountain is the primary medium through which most radionuclides might move away from the potential repository. The saturated zone (SZ) system is expected to act as a natural barrier to this possible movement of radionuclides both by delaying their transport and by reducing their concentration before they reach the accessible environment. Information obtained from Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project activities is used to estimate groundwater flow rates through the site-scale SZ flow and transport model area and to constrain general conceptual models of groundwater flow in the site-scale area. The site-scale conceptual model is a synthesis of what is known about flow and transport processes at the scale required for total system performance assessment of the site. This knowledge builds on and is consistent with knowledge that has accumulated at the regional scale but is more detailed because more data are available at the site-scale level. The mathematical basis of the site-scale model and the associated numerical approaches are designed to assist in quantifying the uncertainty in the permeability of rocks in the geologic framework model and to represent accurately the flow and transport processes included in the site-scale conceptual model. Confidence in the results of the mathematical model was obtained by comparing calculated to observed hydraulic heads, estimated to measured permeabilities, and lateral flow rates calculated by the site-scale model to those calculated by the regional-scale flow model. In addition, it was confirmed that the flow paths leaving the region of the potential repository are consistent with those inferred from gradients of measured head and those independently inferred from water-chemistry data. The general approach of the site-scale SZ flow and transport model analysis is to calculate unit breakthrough curves for radionuclides at the interface between the SZ and the biosphere using the three-dimensional site-scale SZ flow and transport model. Uncertainties are explicitly incorporated into the site-scale SZ flow and transport abstractions through key parameters and conceptual models. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Inflorescences, especially heliconia, should be harvested in the morning while still turgid, and at the most suitable stage of development which varies with the species, its proposed use, and market requirements. Treatments that extend postharvest vase life, either or both enhance water uptake or prevent water loss and provide an exogenous energy source. Use of the most suitable temperature for shipping and storage prolongs vase life. Heliconia should be shipped and stored at &gt;10°C (50.0°F), red ginger &gt;12°C (53.6°F), and bird-of-paradise at &gt;8°C (46.4°F). Sucrose (10% w/v), citric acid [150 mg·L-1 (ppm)] and 8-hydroxyquinoline citrate (250 mg·L-1) are major chemicals used in pulsing and holding solution for bird-of-paradise. Holding solutions for red ginger are similar except 2% (w/v) sucrose is recommended. The response of heliconia inflorescences to different pulsing and holding solutions has been shown to be negligible. A 200-mg·L-1 benzyladenine spray extends the vase life of red ginger and heliconia. Hot water treatment of red ginger at 49°C (120.2°F) and 50°C (122.0°F) for 12 to 15 min extends postharvest vase life, kills most of the pests that infest red ginger, and reduces the geotropic response. The major postharvest problems are saprophytic mold on bird-of-paradise, negative geotropic response of red ginger, and insect infestation of all three flowers. There is no reported method to control the postharvest nectar and slime production on bird-of-paradise that provides a substrate for saprophytic mold growth. Dipping inflorescences in benomyl or thiobendazole (TBZ) at 200 mg·L-1 does help control postharvest mold growth in bird-of-paradise and heliconia. Compared to most temperate flowers, there is a need for greater understanding of morphological and physiological factors that limit the vase life of heliconia, red ginger and bird-of-paradise flowers.","Abscission; Chemical treatments; Postharvest handling; Senescence; Vase life; Water loss","Alpinia purpurata; Alpinia purpurata; Aves; Caesalpinia gilliesii; Heliconia; Heliconia; Insecta; Strelitzia reginae; Strelitzia reginae; Zingiber officinale",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037376112

Calculations have shown that the energy injected in the course of the magnetic storms into the inner magnetosphere and ionosphere of both hemispheres amounts to ∼ 0.9-2.2% of the solar wind kinetic energy on the magnetospheric cross section. The total energy injected into the magnetosphere from a distance of 60RE in the tail down to the ionosphere is ∼ 4.0-7.5% of the solar wind kinetic energy during the main phase of the two magnetic storms. The injected energy into the tail ETL is 1.03-1.18 of the total energy input into the inner magnetosphere and ionosphere of both hemispheres at the main phase of the two storms. The decay parameter for the energy stored in the magnetospheric tail is ∼ 5 h. The total energy dissipated in the ionosphere of both hemispheres, in the inner magnetosphere and in the tail during the two storms, is 1.85 × 1017 and 3.24 × 1017 J, respectively. The total energy input into the magnetosphere is calculated to be 1.77 × 1017 and 3.16 × 1017 J. The discrepancies of 0.08× 1017 and 0.10 × 1017 J amount to 4.3% and 3.1% of the total energy input and characterize the accuracy of the magnetospheric energy budget calculation. In the magnetotail the balance between the injected and dissipated energy of ∼1.09 × 1017 J for one storm and ∼1.7 × 1017 J for the other is preserved as well. We conclude that one-half of the energy which is injected into the magnetosphere from the solar wind during the storms enters the magnetotail and dissipates there. The coupling parameter εPA is widely considered to be a measure of the energy dissipation in the inner magnetosphere. The dissipation energy in the inner magnetosphere UT = UJ + UA+ UDR is defined as the sum of the contributions of the Joule dissipation UJ, the energy of auroral particle precipitation UA, and the energy injection into the ring current UDR. In this paper, we find that εPA in the two storms investigated is substantially different from UT. The energy injected into the ring current region at the main phase of the storm amounts to ∼1016 J. It is nearly 3 or 4 times smaller than the energy input into the magnetosphere via the field-aligned currents or the energy dissipated in the ionosphere by Joule dissipation. The energy injected into the magnetosphere is transferred mainly into processes different from the ring current generation. During the development of intensive auroral electrojets, the energy dissipation in the magnetotail and the increase in the energy of the tail current system occur simultaneously. The energy dissipation in the inner magnetosphere and ionosphere US occurs not only at the expense of energy previously stored in the magnetotail, but rather at the expense of energy that is injected into the near-Earth tail. This energy transfer from the solar wind into the magnetotail and the energy dissipation in the ionosphere increased simultaneously. Thus, during disturbances in the magnetosphere, simultaneously loading-unloading and directly driven processes occur. Loading- and unloading processes manifest themselves both in the storage of the solar wind energy in the magnetotail and the ring current, and subsequent dissipation. The directly driven processes become manifest in the direct dissipation of the energy which enters into the ionosphere through large-scale field-aligned current systems. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Increasingly, however, the regulatory emphasis has been on the use of auctions to allocate contractual rights that, in volume terms, can differ significantly from the capacity that may, in practice, be physically available in a given period. This development is illustrated by comparison of auctions of (a) gas storage capacity rights at the Hornsea facility and (b) gas entry capacity rights at UK terminals. The motivations for the current policy emphasis are: better demand discovery, non-discriminatory capacity allocation, short-term and long-term incentivisation of capacity providers, and partial substitution of market trading for regulatory decisions in determining economic outcomes. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Auctions; Capacity; Contractual rights; Electricity; Gas; Incentives; Networks","electricity industry; energy market; gas supply; investment; market system; utility sector; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037373099

Many approaches have been applied to compensate harmonic currents generated in the power system. Among various approaches, in this paper, two approaches are compared and evaluated. They are flywheel compensators based on wounded rotor induction motor and squirrel cage induction motor. Both systems have a common structure.

Body temperature was measured radiotelemetrically. Faecal excretion, as an index of rate of digestion, was measured using load cells. At 22°C, faecal excretion peaked just after lights-on in morning-pulse condition, but not in evening-pulse condition. In the cold (+5°C), the peak was absent. We conclude that at thermoneutrality, pigeons are able to postpone a major part of digestion until late in the dark phase when their body temperature is increasing to the diurnal level. Thus, the extra heat from digestion-related thermogenesis that otherwise would be dissipated into the environment can be used for rewarming. In the cold, such a delay is not necessarily advantageous as the extra heat can always be used to substitute for thermoregulatory thermogenesis. The occurrence of concentrated period of digestion only in the morning-pulse condition was correlated to a lower food intake and lower body temperature as compared with the evening-pulse condition. Restricted feeding may thus be needed to induce adaptive timing of digestion as a mechanism of energy sparing. In addition to storage of food, timing of digestion may be a significant factor in the evolution of the crop in birds. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone that impacts on energy homeostasis, may be up-regulated by repeated cycles of fasting and refeeding. In this study, we investigated the adaptive response of leptin to repeated cycles of 1-day fasting and 1-day refeeding for 42 days in rats. The repeated fasting and refeeding (RFR) rats gained less body weight than the controls. Daily food intake of the RFR rats was decreased after Day 16 and remained suppressed. Circulating leptin levels of the RFR rats were significantly elevated at Day 35 compared with the controls and at Day 44 compared with the controls and pair-fed (PF) rats. Leptin mRNA levels of these rats were also significantly increased in retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (RT-WAT) compared with the controls and PF rats. Moreover, hypothalamic proopiomelanocortic (POMC) gene expression was augmented in the RFR rats compared with the controls and PF rats. However, there was no statistical difference in percent visceral fat mass among the experimental groups. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA levels of RFR rats were significantly increased in RT-WAT compared with the controls and PF rats. These data indicated that leptin was up-regulated in response to chronic repeated fasting and refeeding cycles without a concomitant increase in adiposity, and the augmented leptin levels were associated with an increase in POMC gene expression, reduced food intake, and diminished body weight gain. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Currently, the Japanese government seeks to use MOX fuel to serve Japan's economic growth, energy self-sufficiency, and national security needs. The Japanese government suggests that reprocessed plutonium must be used as MOX fuel to prevent others from using the plutonium to create weapons.

Leptin, a protein hormone encoded by an obesity gene, has been suggested to be the signal mediator for this flux of energy. In a controlled laboratory experiment on caged great tits (Parus major) we evaluated the effect of leptin on food intake and behaviour. Experimental birds were given an intramuscular injection of 10μg leptin dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), while the control birds were injected with PBS only at 09:00h after a night's fasting. Within the first 20min after injections we observed a significant difference in food intake between groups: control birds initially fed at higher rates compared to leptin treated birds. The cumulative food intake suggested that the effect of leptin disappeared after approximately 40-50min post-injections. Similar results have previously been found in domesticated chickens. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that leptin depresses food intake in wild birds. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

For this purpose a laboratory oven used for hot storage testing was modified to allow flushing with the pre-mixed oxygen/nitrogen mixture of the desired composition. It was found that for all sample volumes investigated the self-ignition temperatures were higher the lower was the oxygen volume fraction. In addition, the type of reaction changed obviously, since the apparent activation energy significantly decreased at oxygen volume fractions below 6%. However, it was still possible to observe exothermic effects at oxygen volume fractions as low as 1.3%. A numerical model was established to simulate the process of self-ignition including the coupled heat and mass transfer within the dust accumulation using a finite element solver. The model consists of six balance equations for the heat transfer and the transport of five chemical species. It shows that the model reflects self-ignition in dust accumulations with satisfying accuracy, as long as the input data generated by preceding experiments are reliable. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The effective dose rate distributions can be obtained as far as 300 m from the center of the shielding house. The coupling technique is created with the Surface Source Write (SSW) card and the Surface Source Read/Coordinate Transformation (SSR/CRT) card in the MCNP 4C continuous energy Monte Carlo code as the ""SSW-SSR/CRT calculation system."" In the present Monte Carlo coupling calculation, the total effective dose rates 100, 200, and 300 m from the center of the shielding house are estimated to be 1.69, 0.285, and 0.0826 ( μSv/yr per four casks), respectively. Accordingly, if the distance between the center of the shielding house and the site boundary of the storage facility is kept at &gt;300 m, approximately 2400 casks are able to be accommodated in the modular shielding houses, under the Japanese severe criterion of 50 μSv/yr at the site boundary. The shielding house alone satisfies not only the technical conditions but also the economic requirements. It became evident that secondary gamma rays account for &gt;60% of the effective total dose rate at all the calculated points around the shielding house, most of which are produced from the water in the steel-water-steel shielding system of the shielding house. The remainder of the dose rate comes mostly from neutrons; the fission product and 60Co activation gamma rays account for small percentages. Accordingly, reducing the secondary gamma rays is critical to improving not only the shielding ability but also the radiation safety of the shielding house.","Dose; Monte Carlo; Shielding","Gamma rays; Monte Carlo methods; Safety devices; Spent fuels; Transportable storage casks; Radiation shielding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037298539

It allows the customer's electricity use for cooling to be shifted to off peak period, benefiting both the consumer and the utility. Reduction in peak demand and electricity cost depend on electricity tariff rates, operating strategy, cool storage capacity and climatic conditions. In this paper, a methodology is presented to determine the optimal chilled water storage (CWS) capacity and corresponding operating strategy for the air conditioning loads for different electricity tariffs. This model minimizes the total operating cost of the air conditioning plant by a trade-off between the cost involved for providing the storage and accessories and savings achieved under the specified electricity tariff. A case study for a typical office complex shows that a reduction of 38% in peak demand is possible by adopting the optimal CWS strategy under time of use (TOU) tariff. The corresponding saving in the operating cost for the consumer is 5.9%. The results show that under flat tariffs, the prevalent high consumer discount rates make cool storage unviable.

The main source of CO2 emissions is fossil fuel combustion; power generation is the single largest contributor. Coal is widely used for power generation, but it releases approximately twice as much CO2 compared with the use of natural gas for each unit of electricity sent out. Emission reduction could be achieved by increasing the efficiency with which coal is burnt, or by switching to another fuel. These measures can achieve significant reductions in emissions, but, for deep reductions, more substantial changes would be required in the power plant. The technology for capture and storage of CO2 has been recognized in recent years as providing a means of cutting emissions from fossil fuel combustion by at least 80 per cent. Capture and storage is based on technology already in use for other purposes, so there is limited need for development, and the risk of application will be less than is typical for novel energy technologies. Hence, this seems to be a technology that could be deployed relatively rapidly to reduce emissions from fossil fuel fired plant. In this paper, the technology for capture and storage of CO2 will be reviewed, especially the costs and potential capacity for reducing emissions. Some barriers to implementation are identified, and work necessary to overcome them is discussed.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; CO2 capture; CO2 emission abatement; CO2 storage; CO2 transmission; Cost of electricity generation; Greenhouse gas; Power generation","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Combustion; Industrial emissions; Coal-fired power plants; Power plants; carbon emission; coal-fired power plant; electricity generation; emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037288712

Studies aimed at quantifying the extent of those changes under different storage conditions are valuable for minimizing the deleterious effect on product quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality change in stored potatoes and quantify the associated kinetic parameters (rate constants) and activation energy to help model the changes in potato quality as function of storage temperature and time. Potatoes were stored at five temperatures (4°C, 8°C, 12°C, 16°C and 20°C) and, at different storage times (at least 5 rime intervals) samples were removed and evaluated for different quality parameters (physical: texture and color; chemical: ascorbic acid (AA), reducing sugars (RS), starch (S), total sugars (TS), total soluble solids, pH and titrable acidity (TA) and physiological: respiration rate). The results revealed that potatoes became softer and darker by passage of time, and higher temperature resulted in more rapid changes in the different quality parameters. Chemical changes during the storage were decreased AA, pH and S, and increased TA, RS and TS. Only small changes were observed with peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase activity. Respiration rate increased with temperature and duration of storage. In general, most changes were well described by some form of first-order rate. Temperature sensitivity of rate constants was adequately described by the Arrhenius model. © 2002 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

High energy photons are absorbed in mask, resist and substrate. About 95% of this energy is deposited as thermal heat [Schweizer (1997)]. This may lead to a temperature rise in the system and result in thermal distortions during the patterning process. A sample layout is used to determine the distortions during irradiation. Typical radiation parameters of the ELSA storage ring at Bonn University (2.7 GeV, 35 mA) and material properties are applied to simulate the heat effects. Mask membranes made of titanium or beryllium are modeled to irradiate PMMA layers of 200 and 2500 μm thickness. Copper is used as substrate material. Mask support and the bottom of the substrate are cooled to 21°C as the system is scanned through the synchrotron beam. In the case of 200 μm PMMA and titanium mask membranes, mask temperatures increase to 40.1°C, whereas only 22.3°C are reached if beryllium masks are simulated. Maximum distortions are 0.74 μm for Ti-masks and 0.03 μm for Be-masks. With increasing resist thickness, the incident synchrotron radiation power as well as the temperature rise are reduced.

A number of techniques, most of them concerned with visualization, have been developed to aid in the classification of the images. However, it has been shown that interpretation of LV images by strictly visual techniques is subject to errors and inconsistencies. For this reason, assistance in diagnosis can be improved only through the development of automatic or semiautomatic methods to analyze and to quantify LV parameters, We propose an automatic method to estimate the myocardial kinetic energy directly from gated SPECT sequences based on the optical flow method refined with a multiresolution technique. Specifically, the method quantifies the LV motion by a series of 3-D velocity vector fields computed for each voxel on the sequence of images. The 3-D velocity vector field obtained is used to estimate the kinetic energy, which may be an indication of the cardiac condition. The proposed procedure was applied to a group of volunteers and the cardiac condition of each subject studied by taking the relation between the maximum and minimum values of kinetic energy observed during the cardiac cycle. © 2003 SPIE and IS&T.",,"Gaussian functions; Multiresolution techniques; Cardiology; Computerized tomography; Digital image storage; Iterative methods; Kinetic energy; Linear systems; Visualization; Image analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037280814

Because the envelope has a bandwidth that is small compared to the cutoff frequency of the barrier it does not propagate; it merely stands and waves. The envelope of the reflected and transmitted fields can adiabatically follow the envelope of the input pulse with only a small delay proportional to the energy stored in the barrier. The Hartman effect, in which the delay becomes independent of barrier length, is explained on the basis of saturation of stored energy with increasing length. Because the delay is not a propagation delay, it should not be linked to a velocity of propagation.

Six rumen-cannulated and multicatheterized lambs (32.2 kg), fed frozen rye grass at 690 kJ metabolizable energy intake/d per kg body weight0.75, were infused intraruminally with a salt solution (control) or with propionate solutions at 0.55 mol/d (P1) or 0.98 mol/d (P2) according to a replicated Latin square design. In the rumen fluid, supplementation decreased the acetate:propionate molar ratio from 2.36:1 to 1.37:1, without modifying the ruminal concentrations of acetate and NH4. As a result, the portal appearance of propionate increased by 51 and 72 % with P1 and P2, respectively, and that of L-lactate doubled. Across the liver, net extraction of propionate increased by 47 and 67 % with P1 and P2, respectively. However, the net hepatic production of glucose remained unchanged, probably as the result of a substantial rise in insulin secretion and its hepatic extraction. Overall, the net splanchnic release of acetate, glucose and butyrate was not modified while that of L-lactate increased. Despite this, the net uptake of acetate, glucose, L-lactate and non-esterified fatty acids by the hindlimb increased. Propionate probably enhanced the storage of energy-yielding nutrients in the hindlimb, despite their unchanged release by the splanchnic tissues and the unmodified insulinaemia.

The account concerns the major developments from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, to multi-cellular organisms, to animals with nervous systems and a brain, and finally to human beings and their uses of chemical elements in space outside themselves. It will be stated that the changes were in an inevitable progression, and were not just due to blind chance, so that ""random searching"" by a coded system to give species had a fixed overall route. The chemical sequence is from a reducing to an ever-increasingly oxidizing environment, while organisms retained reduced chemicals. The process was furthered recently by human beings who have also increased the range of reduced products trapped on Earth in novel forms. All the developments are brought about from the nature of the chemicals which organisms accumulate using the environment and its changes. The relationship to the manner in which particular species (gene sequences) were coincidentally changed, the molecular view of evolution, is left for additional examination. There is a further issue in that the changes of the chemistry of the environment developed largely at equilibrium due to the relatively fast reactions there of the available inorganic chemicals. Inside cells, some of these same chemicals also came to equilibrium within compounds. All such equilibria reduced the variance (degrees of freedom) of the total environmental/biological system and its possible development. However, the more sophisticated organic chemistry, almost totally inside cells until humans evolved, is kinetically controlled and limited by the demands of cellular reduction necessary to produce essential chemicals and by the availability of certain elements and energy. Hence the variability of reductive cellular organic chemistry and its limitations in cells have to be considered separately. While as a whole they drive the oxidation of the environment, they also allow speciation within the major changes of organisms. Human beings have introduced recently new, virtually irreversible, inorganic and organic chemistry in the environment, much of it new modes of irreversible storage of reduced chemicals, and this is, we state, the last possible step of chemical evolution. We must attempt to evaluate its effect on organisms generally. It must be clear that all the changes and the original life forms are dependent upon energy as well as material capture and flow. We shall have to consider in which forms energy was available over the period of evolution, how it was usefully transformed, and the ways in which its sources changed. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Fast automated control actions are required to tackle this problem. With recent developments in power electronics and computer, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) and battery energy storage systems (BESS) have emerged as fast-acting control devices for power system applications. This article proposes insertion of small SMES/BESS devices in a wind diesel power system. The effective location of the storage devices is chosen and suitable control schemes are proposed, which force SMES/BESS to operate in all four quadrants of P-Q plane (charging, discharging, leading vars, and lagging vars), in order to reduce the fluctuations in system frequency and voltages. A complete model of the hybrid wind-diesel-energy storage system is developed for simulation purposes. A comparative study of the system performance with the proposed schemes is then carried out.","Energy storage; Four-quadrant operation; Mathematical modelling; Weak power systems","Computer simulation; Electric control equipment; Electric energy storage; Electric frequency control; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Mathematical models; Power electronics; Superconducting magnets; Voltage control; Wind power; Battery energy storage systems (BSES); Diesel electric power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037265587

Taking advantage of the propagation modes in transmission lines and making use of the fact that the time of appearance of a voltage pulse traveling on a channel is directly proportional to the electrical length of the channel, it is possible to synchronize power pulses in such manner to generate pulsed power. An multiple transmission line topology (MTLT) containing m transmission line segments is used. The difference in the electrical length from one line to the other should be T/m, where T denotes the period of the cycle. The resulting, output peak power is m times higher than the input peak power, due to a rise in voltage, in current, or a combination of both. The current/voltage magnification would be defined by the choice of a suitable connection mode at the end points of the topology. The main advantages of the transmission line based topology are: a) the switching elements the system consists of need to withstand a much lower power than the power experienced by the load; b) the system can operate either at extremely high frequencies or with very short rise and decay times of rectangular pulses. This novel approach to energy compression is supported by simulation examples and experimentally validated.","MTLT; Power converters; Topology; Voltage magnification","Electric currents; Electric network topology; Electric potential; Power converters; Thyristors; Pulse formatting networks; Pulsed power generation; Voltage magnification; Electric lines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037261624

Neoplasms emerge from a glycogenotic/amphophilic/basophilic preneoplastic cell lineage. A higher female tumor incidence suggests a relevant influence of sex hormones. DHEA enhances hepatocarcinogenesis induced byN-nitrosomorpholine (NNM), which is characterized by the glycogenotic/basophilic cell lineage. The tumor promoting effect is related to an additional amphophilic/basophilic preneoplastic lesion sequence and to faster proliferation of the basophilic preneoplastic lesions. Nevertheless, hepatocellular carcinomas provided under DHEA treatment seem to have a less malignant phenotype compared to tumors induced by NNM only. Further, DHEA treatment reduces growth and generation of glycogen storage foci (GSF) in initial NNM-treated rats. Thus, DHEA treatment results in both, a growth stimulation of the late basophilic lesion type with an additional amphophilic lesion sequence, and in a growth inhibition of early preneoplastic lesions, addressing especially GSF. DHEA also inhibits the growth of physiologically proliferating liver tissue. This might be explained by a DHEA related cellular metabolism, which results in significant energy consumption. Additionally, a DHEA-induced alteration of cytokine levels might contribute to this growth inhibition as well. © 2003, Sage Publications.

The Cr(III) amine complex [Cr(N(CH2CH2NH2)3 (H2O)(OH)]2+ [abbreviated as Cr(TREN)] is a kinetically inert inhibitor of iron incorporation and mineralization in ferritin. Unlike other inhibitors, Cr(TREN) can only exchange its two aqua/hydroxy ligands. Competition studies between Cr(TREN) and Tb(III) binding have been performed in horse spleen ferritin (HoSF) to probe uptake of Fe(II). From these studies, we propose that Cr(TREN) inhibits Fe(II) uptake by obstructing the routes of metal uptake and by disrupting the early recognition events at the protein surface that precede metal ion uptake. Using an improved luminescence approach to quantify Tb(III) binding to the protein, we demonstrate that Tb(III) cannot interfere with Cr(TREN) binding to ferritin, but that Cr(TREN) dramatically inhibits Tb(III) binding. We show that bound Tb(III) serves as a reliable reporter for Cr(TREN) binding, as the latter efficiently quenches the Tb(III) luminescence via inter-ion energy transfer. Two types of Cr(TREN) binding sites were successfully distinguished from these competition experiments. A common Tb(III)/Cr(TREN) site was identified with stoichiometry of ∼0.6 equivalents of metal cation per ferritin subunit. We propose that the sites along the three-fold channels and the ferroxidase sites are common binding sites for Tb(III) and Cr(TREN). The remaining Cr(TREN) (2.4 equivalents of metal ions/subunit) does not compete with Tb(III) but rather blocks Tb(III) access into the cavity and decreases the protein's affinity for Tb(III).

To investigate the role of dietary carbohydrate and fat in the development of these conditions, we fed 6-week old male heterozygous (fa/+) lean rats carbohydrate-free diets containing primarily saturated fat either ad libitum or pair-fed. These diets were compared to standard chow and to a high saturated fat mixed diet containing 10% energy from sucrose for 4 weeks. The carbohydrate-free diet resulted in significantly lower circulating glucose levels compared to all other groups (p = 0.006). Weight gain was negligible in the carbohydrate free groups compared to standard diet and 10% sucrose diet (p = 0.03). This was reflected in energy efficiency which was markedly reduced (90%) in the carbohydrate-free groups compared to the other groups (p = 0.04). Corresponding changes were noted in fat pad mass. The subscapular and epididymal fat pads were increased 42% and 44%, respectively, in animals consuming the 10% sucrose diet compared to all other groups (p < 0.01). Comparable changes in fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA were observed in response to the carbohydrate-free diet, which resulted in a 53% decrease in adipocyte FAS mRNA (p < 0.001). Addition of 10% sucrose to the diet completely reversed this effect resulting in a 69% increase in adipocyte FAS mRNA compared to the carbohydrate-free groups (p = 0.01). Similarly, hepatic FAS mRNA was elevated by 51% and 66% in the 10% sucrose and standard diet groups respectively, compared to the carbohydrate-free groups.

Thus, designers must be concerned with both estimating and optimizing the energy consumption of circuits, architectures, and software. Most of the research in energy optimization and/or estimation has focused on single components of the system and has not looked across the interacting spectrum of the hardware and software. The novelty of our energy estimation framework, SimplePower, is that it evaluates the energy considering the system as a whole rather than just as a sum of parts, and that it concurrently supports both compiler and architectural experimentation. We present the design and use of the SimplePower framework that includes a transition-sensitive, cycle-accurate datapath energy model that interfaces with analytical and transition-sensitive energy models for the memory, clock and bus subsystems, respectively. Such an architectural-level energy estimation framework is invaluable in making good energy-conscious decisions early in the design cycle. We analyzed the energy consumption of 10 codes from the multidimensional array domain, a domain that is important for embedded video and signal processing systems. Our study shows that the pipeline registers and the register file are the datapath energy hotspots consuming 58-70 percent of overall datapath energy and that the clocking of the on-chip memory structures is the major source of the on-chip clock networks energy consumption. Further, we find that the off-chip main memory is the overall energy bottleneck of the entire system. However, we found that the application of high-level compiler optimizations reduces the main memory energy significantly, causing the contribution of the data cache, on-chip clock network, instruction cache, and datapath to become more important. We found that the improved locality of the optimized codes is useful in not only reducing the accesses to the main memory but also in exploiting the more energy-efficient cache architectures much better than unoptimized codes. Optimized codes saved 21 percent more energy using the most recently used way-prediction cache scheme as compared to executing unoptimized codes from the multidimensional array domain. We also observed that emerging technologies such as embedded DRAM coupled with a combination of energy-efficient circuit, architectural and compiler optimizations can potentially shift the energy hotspot. Thus, we have demonstrated that early estimates from the powerful SimplePower energy estimation framework can help one to identify the system energy hot spots and enable architects and compiler designers to focus their efforts on these areas.","Energy estimation; Energy models; Optimizations; Simulation","Codes (symbols); Dynamic random access storage; Embedded systems; Optimization; Video signal processing; Energy models; Microprocessor chips",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037249179

This simplifies the analysis and study of the power-handling capability of these types of filters considerably, as the stored energy in the prototype filters is easily computed. The analysis of the field distribution in the cavities of an example third-degree Chebyshev direct-coupled-cavity filter shows that the explicit expression for the peak electric-field strength derived in this paper agrees closely with results obtained from a TE10 circuit model of the filter, from a full-wave electromagnetic solver and from measurements.","Direct-coupled-cavity filters; Electric-field strength; Power-handling capability; Stored energy","Chebyshev approximation; Electric breakdown; Electric energy storage; Electric fields; Low pass filters; Coupled resonator filter; Direct coupled cavity waveguide filters; Peak internal fields; Microwave filters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037247559

However, the standing stock of phytoplankton in the photic zone showed strong seasonal fluctuations with primary peaks always occurring in April (4.26 and 5.09 μg L-1 chlorophyll a in 1997 and 1998, respectively). In addition, sediment chlorophyll a started to increase (from a low of ~6 ng mg-1 dry weight of sediment) as the sinking of a smaller, secondary bloom, reached the bottom in the first 2 months of 1997 and 1998, although higher concentrations were reached by mid-April and May 1997 (21.32 ng mg-1 sediment) and remained relatively high until February 1998. An increase of digestive cell height and protein content occurred as soon as sinking organic material from the spring bloom reached the benthic zone, suggesting storage of metabolic energy during spring and summer. Sharp increases in digestive enzyme activity occurred primarily in early spring of each year, coinciding with the timing of the primary spring bloom fallout, suggesting activation of the formerly depressed digestive system after a prolonged period of low food availability (i.e., late summer to autumn). Results suggest that Y. hyperborea strongly depends on the input of fresh algal material despite the high availability of organic matter in the sediment.",,"algal bloom; deposit feeder; digestion; sedimentation; Canada; Conception Bay; Newfoundland; algae; Bacillariophyta; Bivalvia; Bivalvia; Invertebrata; Nuculanidae; Nuculanidae; Yoldia hyperborea; Yoldia hyperborea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037247319

In the first part of the paper, we study the evolution of axisymmetric flux tubes (flux rings), which are initially in neutrally buoyant mechanical equilibrium. Radiative heating leads to a slow upward drift of the flux ring with a velocity depending on the degree of subadiabaticity of the stratification. Maintaining the flux tubes within the overshoot region for time intervals comparable with the solar cycle period requires a strongly subadiabatic stratification with δ = ∇-∇ad &lt; - 10-4, which is not predicted by most current overshoot models (e.g., Skaley &amp; Stix 1991; van Ballegooijen 1982; Schmitt et al. 1984). The drag force exerted by equatorward flow due to meridional circulation permits states of mechanical and thermal equilibrium in the overshoot region, but these apply only to very thin magnetic flux tubes containing less than 1% of the flux of a large sunspot. In the second part, we consider the influence of radiative heating (and cooling) on magnetic flux stored in the form of a magnetic layer. In contrast to the case of isolated flux tubes, the suppression of the convective energy transport within the magnetic layer affects the overall stratification of the overshoot region. In the case of a quenching of the convective heat conductivity by a factor of the order 100, the overshoot layer receives a net cooling leading to a stronger subadiabaticity, so that values of δ &lt; -10-4 are reached. The stabilization of the stratification relaxes the conditions for flux storage. Stronger quenching of the heat conductivity leads to larger temperature perturbations (of both signs) and to the destabilization of the upper part of the overshoot layer, with the likely consequence of rapid magnetic flux loss.","MHD; Sun: interior; Sun: Magnetic fields","Drag; Magnetic flux; Magnetohydrodynamics; Mathematical models; Quenching; Solar heating; Sun; Thermal conductivity; Thermodynamic properties; Transport properties; Axisymmetric flux tubes; Radiative heating; Solar hydromagnetic dynamo models; Solar overshoot region; Solar system",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037247310

The asymptotic field is obtained applying the saddle-point technique to the radiation integrals after expressing the current excited along the array axis by means of a Fourier spectral representation. The resulting electromagnetic field is expressed in terms of propagating and evanescent truncated Floquet Waves (FWs). The leading asymptotic term of the FWs exhibits an optical behavior and is responsible for the slow decay of the array near-field, which can be described as cylindrical in character. The transition toward the spherical wave propagation regime is due to the interference of the cylindrical field with the relevant scattered field from the array truncations, while the reactive energy storage is due to the evanescent FWs, as well as to the progressive inductive and progressive electrostatic FWs excited close the antenna axis. Using the asymptotic field representation, prediction formulas for the spatial locations where the array near-field exhibits peak deviation from the cylindrical decay, and where the transition from cylindrical to spherical wave propagation regime takes place, have been derived. The proposed analytical technique can be adopted to analyze the spatial field distributions and the radiation mechanisms of periodic and nonperiodic linear arrays.","Collinear array antennas; Field transition regions; Near-field; Uniform asymptotic approximation","Approximation theory; Electric fields; Electromagnetic fields; Electromagnetic wave propagation; Fourier transforms; Green's function; Magnetic fields; Method of moments; Radiation integrals; Antenna arrays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037241326

The two primary land-based activities that would help to minimize atmospheric carbon dioxide are carbon storage in the terrestrial biosphere and the efficient substitution of biomass fuels and bio-based products for fossil fuels and energy-intensive products. These two activities have very different land requirements and different implications for the preservation of biodiversity and the maintenance of other ecosystem services. Carbon sequestration in living forests can be pursued on lands with low productivity, i.e. on lands that are least suitable for agriculture or intensive forestry, and are compatible with the preservation of biodiversity over large areas. In contrast, intensive harvest-and-use systems for biomass fuels and products generally need more productive land to be economically viable. Intensive harvest-and-use systems may compete with agriculture or they may shift intensive land uses onto the less productive lands that currently harbor most of the Earth's biodiversity. Win-win solutions for carbon dioxide control and biodiversity are possible, but careful evaluation and planning are needed to avoid practices that reduce biodiversity with little net decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Planning is more complex on a politically subdivided Earth where issues of local interest, national sovereignty, and equity come into play.

Some 90% of plant biomass, transported as sugars and amino nitrogen (N) compounds in a bulk flow of solution, is propelled though the phloem by osmotically generated hydrostatic pressure differences between source (net nutrient export) and sink (net nutrient import) ends of phloem paths. Source loading and sink unloading of sugars, amino N compounds and potassium largely account for phloem sap osmotic concentrations and hence pressure differences. A symplasmic component is characteristic of most loading and unloading pathways which, in some circumstances, may be interrupted by an apoplasmic step. Raffinose series sugars appear to be loaded symplasmically. However, sucrose, and probably certain amino acids, are loaded into minor veins from source leaf apoplasms by proton symporters localized to plasma membranes of their sieve element/companion cell (se/cc) complexes. Sucrose transporters, with complementary kinetic properties, are conceived to function as membrane transporter complexes that respond to alterations in source/sink balance. In contrast, symplasmic unloading is common for many sink types. Intervention of an apoplasmic step, distal from importing phloem, is reserved for special situations. Effluxers that release sucrose and amino acids to the surrounding apoplasm in phloem loading and unloading are yet to be cloned. The physiological behaviour of effluxers is consistent with facilitated membrane transport that can be energy coupled. Roles of sucrose and amino acid transporters in phloem unloading remain to be discovered along with mechanisms regulating symplasmic transport. The latter is hypothesized to exert significant control over phloem unloading and, in some circumstances, phloem loading.","Amino nitrogen; Apoplasmic; Loading; Phloem; Sink; Source; Sugar; Symplasmic; Unloading","amino acid; phloem; Embryophyta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037237598

It is designed for delivering to an electrothermal load an energy of 400 kJ in a shot under the assumption that this energy suffices for an effective ignition of advanced consolidated propellants accounting for temperature compensation. The ISPS is battery-based. The battery has a peak power of 5 MW and is able to charge a cylindrical coil to 700 kJ. Fringe fields of the coil with and without ferromagnetic screens in static and transient conditions are analyzed using numerical simulation. A conclusion is drawn that a screen of reasonable weight cannot reduce the stray field below a susceptibility level of electronic devices that should be shielded individually. A hybrid repetitive opening switch (OS) rated 50 kA, 4 kV, 70 μs breaking time is described. A commercial vacuum circuit breaker serves as the first stage. At a desired moment, it is opened, and the current is transferred to the second stage, which is an integrated gate-commutated thyristor (IGCT) that finally breaks the current. The IGCT turnoff is assisted by an inverse current injection into the second stage. The main benefit of this technique is a dramatic reduction (by a factor of ten) in the quantity of semiconductor devices in the second stage. The OS design, assisted by PSpice simulations coupled with field analysis of nonlinear magnetic components is described. Test results1 are presented. Overall, this work supports an earlier conclusion that an 0.5-MJ ISPS, capable of delivering the first round of an eight-shot burst in 0.3 s, will occupy 0.6 m3 net volume and weight 1000 kg.","Electrothermal gun; Fringe field; Inductive storage; Opening switch","Computer simulation; Electric coils; Energy storage; Ignition; Solid propellants; Thyristors; Electrothermal chemical gun; Fringe field; Inductive storage power supply; Opening switch; Rail guns",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037235539

Experimental and/or numerical results for the railgun, electrothermal-chemical (ETC) guns, and pulse-forming networks (PFNs) are reported. The ISL railguns are supplied by fast-discharge capacitors and use projectiles provided with metallic brush armatures. Velocities up to about 2000 m/s are reached without any arcing. The 10-MJ distributed energy storage railgun facility PEGASUS has proved to have an overall efficiency over 30%. Velocities of 2300 m/s have been achieved with this facility, the projectile masses ranging from 350 to 650 g. The energy storage of the facility consists of 200 PFN units of 50 kJ equipped with semiconductor switches. The objective of the ETC program is to ignite a high-loading-density solid propellant (SP) with small electrical energy and power. Some recent ISL studies have determined the minimum energy and power levels needed to ignite the powder of a 20-mm, a 60-mm, and a 120-mm gun by means of a plasma. Tests with a 20-mm gun allowed the ignition of an SP with a loading density of 1.3 g/cm3. The studies of high-power semiconductor switches have led to the development and construction of a thyristor with a blocking voltage of 11 kV and a crowbar diode with a blocking voltage of 12 kV. A fast semiconductor switch developed by ISL and Asea Brown Bovery Semiconductor Company with a highly interdigitated gate has an excellent turn-on capability with current rates dI/dt &gt; 15 kA/μs. First studies on solid-state opening switches demonstrated the possibility of switching off a current of about 20 kA. A steerable electromagnetic launcher based on pancake coils is studied as an active armor system. The launcher is fed by capacitor modules characterized by peak currents of 120 kA and current rates of about 2.5 kA/μs. Experimental tests have demonstrated that the trajectory can be selected in the range of ±45° with an angle error less than ±0.5°.

Meanwhile, the classic products have been improved, especially those based on the metallized all-polypropylene film. The properties of this film show a uniform range in terms of breakdown, with few thickness-dependent variations. For extended lifetime and high current values, the dielectric stress is far from the breakdown level of the polypropylene film. The evolution of the metallization-segmentation is described through the results obtained on three types of design. Conversely, for short capacitor lifetime and moderate currents, the stress can be situated in the breakdown area of the polypropylene film. Therefore, the working conditions must be precisely defined, especially in terms of charging time and hold time. In both cases, the inrush energy in the defect must be limited and controlled in order to avoid any secondary effect. The resistivities of the metallization play a significantly role in controlling the high energy density products. The behavior of the galvanic contacts between the reinforced edges of the metallization and the metal spray is strong enough to allow the use of resistivities of several tens of ohms per square unit. A comparison between resistivities shows that they can be used as a limitation tool in the self-healing process without undue influence on the current crossing properties. The results obtained on large energy units, ranging from 50 to 100 kJ, indicate the capacitors are completely safe, with an energy density of more than 2000 J/L for the short lifetime products. Some improvements regarding the purity of the resin and the surface treatment could increase the breakdown level in a range of 30%, The corresponding energy density could be increased to 3000 J/L.","Discharge capacitor; Energy storage capacitor; High energy density; Polypropylene; Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)","Capacitors; Charging (batteries); Current density; Dielectric properties; Electric breakdown; Electric charge; Electric variables measurement; Electronic equipment testing; Metallizing; Polypropylenes; Polyvinylidene chlorides; Dielectric stress; Discharge capacitors; Galvanic contacts; Short capacitor lifetime; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037235467

UT-CEM recently conducted a burst spin test of a composite flywheel inside this composite containment device at Test Devices Incorporated (TDI), Hudson, MA. The most important aspect of this design is that the free-floating containment structure dissipates the major loads (radial, torque, and axial) encountered during the burst event, greatly reducing the loads that pass through the stator structure to its attachments. The design results in significant system-level weight savings for the entire rotating machine when compared to a system with an all-metallic containment.

Solar water heaters, box type cookers and home lighting systems using solar PV have become widely available at reasonable costs appropriate to them. Original lacunae of top down planning without participatory decision making of users, subsidy driven programs, lack of monitoring and preventive maintenance and non-application of the solar energy with a view to resource augmentation and equity, are now in the process of being eliminated. Emergence of considerations of pollution free clean development, global climate change and stress on creation of livelihoods vis-a-vis satisfaction of basic needs and requirements of quality in open marketing system rather than hands on indigenisation are the current stream in full force. The real solution will be somewhere in the middle for developing countries, where efficiency per unit cost of devices and systems and least capital cost of creating sustainable livelihoods will define the site specific recipes most effective to each situation. This has yet to happen. A technological shift has been from dreams of complete energy autonomy to hybridization and partial autonomy because, given the requirements of entrenched life styles in rich countries and aspirations of less developed countries, the former was economically not viable. Passive systems of building for climate tempering and solar PV integrated with buildings are taking shape now and will be the mainstream of immediate future. Also, briefly covered are the path breaking scientific advances of photochemical and microbial production of hydrogen, its storage and use in fuel cells which are in their initial stages, but are promising avenues. Since most of these technologies are proprietary, even at the risk of reinventing the wheel. India has to strike its own path. Direct solar, biomass based power generation and wind electric generation are immediate options; solar PV integrated with buildings along with hydrogen based fuel cells (hydrogen being generated from (wastes/sea water by solar energy) are the solution for the next decade.

The efficient use of these high-energy storage devices depends, in turn, on high-strength carbon composite bands for attaining sufficient speed, and thus energy levels, without disintegrating. While advances in material science allowed significant improvements in the performance of the latest generation of compulsators, a growing concern is their vulnerability to ballistic impact. A comprehensive experimental study using a scaled but realistic version of an operational compulsator is presented. A set of two test rotors consisting of several layers, including a simulated coil section and an outer carbon confining shell, was tested. The rotors were spun to approximately 18 000 r/min in a high-speed test facility, and shaped charges were fired at the outer shell at normal incidence. The results of a set of experiments are presented, showing damage ranging from benign to complete failure, depending on the impact energy level. The experiments indicate that significant energies do not necessarily result in complete failure. Observed rotor behavior is compared with predictions. An evaluation of observed failure modes indicates that good engineering can optimize the construction of composite confining bands in compulsators to resist a certain level of high-energy impact without complete failure.","Carbon fiber; Coil band; Compulsator; Confining band; Impact damage; Shaped charge; Spin test","Carbon fibers; Electric charge; Electric coils; Electric energy storage; Electronic equipment testing; Failure analysis; Impact testing; Rotors; Shaped charges; Electromagnetic pulsed power launch systems; High speed compulsators; Operational compulsators; Electromagnetic launchers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037232905

For laboratory systems, capacitor banks have traditionally been used to provide this energy, but field applications require a system with significantly higher energy storage density. Rotating machines that store the energy in the form of rotational kinetic energy and can quickly convert that energy to high current electrical energy have been designed and built. These low-impedance, multiphase, multipole synchronous generators are referred to as pulsed alternators. The ac output of the pulsed alternator is rectified to provide dc to power the railgun. The design of the rectifier set and control circuitry is very dependent on the alternator characteristics; to facilitate the design and evaluation of the overall pulsed power system, a modeling tool which accurately represents the performance of the pulsed alternator while allowing easy changes to the external circuitry and control is needed. The direct-quadrature, or Park's, transformation is commonly used to model synchronous generators for simulation, but such models are better suited for modeling disturbances around a steady-state operation point in a power system. A pulsed alternator may deliver half of its stored rotational energy in just a few mechanical cycles. This results in very high discharge torques and large armature reactions that are difficult for many commercial simulators and synchronous generator models to handle properly. In addition, the transient nature of the discharge can require that electromagnetic interaction with nonwinding structures in the generator be modeled to accurately predict the performance of the system. This paper describes a manner in which these pulsed alternators can be accurately modeled. The simulation platform SABER was chosen because of the robust modeling engine, the ease of integrating mechanical components, and the large library of existing models for a wide range of electrical components. The validity of the model is established by comparing it to experimental data gathered from the subscale alternator built by the Center for Electromechanics at The University of Texas under the Focused Technology Program.","Compulsator; Electromagnetic launch; Modeling; Pulsed alternator; Simulation","Capacitors; Computer simulation; Computer software; Electric discharges; Synchronous generators; Compulsator; Pulsed alternator; Rail guns",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037232904

In addition, plasma ignition can provide a better control of the ballistic process, improving repeatability and enabling compensation for the propellant temperature effect. Due to the typically large volume and weight of electrical energy storage devices and pulsed power systems, which increase with the required energy, it is important to reduce the amount of plasma energy needed for ignition. In this paper, we present and analyze experiments performed in a gun simulator as well as a series of 105-mm gun firings. The aim is to improve the understanding of the plasma-propellant interaction at low plasma energies, in order to reduce the energy needed for a proper propellant ignition and smooth ballistic process.","Ignition delay; Plasma; Sensors","Ballistics; Electron guns; High temperature effects; Ignition; Plasma density; Plasma interactions; Plasma jets; Process control; Sensors; Solid propellants; Electrical energy storage devices; Electrothermal guns; Plasma energies; Plasma ignition; Plasma-propellant interaction; Propellant temperature effect; Plasma guns",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037232869

The devices investigated in this study, unipolar power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and bipolar thyristors, represent a wide range of power semiconductor switches. At first MOSFETs are investigated in parallel and series configurations, showing a negligible current imbalance and a symmetrical voltage sharing during switch-off. Furthermore, the maximum peak charge current of a single power MOSFET has been evaluated experimentally and theoretically. Overcoming the problem of a thyristor being exclusively a closing switch, we use a technique, called ICCOS, which is based on the well-known parallel capacitor-current commutation principle. Using this technique we have developed a power switch capable of commutating a peak charge current of 18 kA. The switching performance of such a thyristor configuration is compared to an array composed of numerous MOSFETs.","Inverse current commutation; Magnetic energy storage; Power MOSFET; SCR; Thyristor","Bipolar semiconductor devices; Electric current measurement; Electric energy storage; Magnetic devices; MOSFET devices; Power electronics; Semiconductor switches; Voltage measurement; Bipolar thyristors; Fast switching thyristors; High power transistors; Inductive storage circuits; Inverse current commutation; Magnetic energy storage; Peak charge current; Thyristors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037230439

To accomplish fast monitoring, the (sinusoidal) ac output voltage is converted to a dc quantity that represents the instantaneous amplitude. This transformation, also called ""vector rotation,"" can be used for very fast observation of the momentary amplitudes of all electrical machine quantities, such that averaging of the ac value (to determine ""momentary average"" rms amplitude) is not necessary.

In order to unveil their physiology and ecological niche, this study isolated bacterial strains (exemplified by strain YK-1) affiliated with the cluster 1 bacteria from an oil storage cavity at Kuji in Iwate, Japan. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that its closest relative was Thiomicrospira denitrificans (90% identity). Growth experiments under anaerobic conditions showed that strain YK-1 was a sulfur-oxidizing obligate chemolithotroph utilizing sulfide, elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, and hydrogen as electron donors and nitrate as an electron acceptor. Oxygen also supported its growth only under microaerobic conditions. Strain YK-1 could not grow on nitrite, and nitrite was the final product of nitrate reduction. Neither sugars, organic acids (including acetate), nor hydrocarbons could serve as carbon and energy sources. A typical stoichiometry of its energy metabolism followed an equation: S2- + 4NO3- → SO42- + 4NO2- (ΔG0 = -534 kJ mol-1). In a difference from other anaerobic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, this bacterium was sensitive to NaCl; growth in medium containing more than 1% NaCl was negligible. When YK-1 was grown anaerobically in a sulfur-depleted inorganic medium overlaid with crude oil, sulfate was produced, corresponding to its growth. On the contrary, YK-1 could not utilize crude oil as a carbon source. These results suggest that the cluster 1 bacteria yielded energy for growth in oil storage cavities by oxidizing petroleum sulfur compounds.

However, there has not been any attempt to use these underground openings for deep frozen food storage and related heat transfer details. The main purpose of this work was to investigate underground food storage openings in the Cappadocia Region and their potential use for frozen food storage. Details of heat transfer around openings for various geometrics in three-dimensional have been modelled by using a finite element software package called MARC. For the sake of comparison, heat transfer details around a similar opening excavated in granite were also determined. A comparison of underground caverns excavated in tuff and granite with a surface deep freeze storage tank was also made by both taking construction and operational costs into account.

The mechanical hypothesis is one of the potential factors, because an increase in external mechanical work with fatigue was previously reported for a constant velocity run. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a change in mechanical work could occur during the development of the V̇O2 slow component under the effect of fatigue. Methods: Twelve regional-level competitive runners performed a square-wave transition, corresponding to 95% of the speed associated with peak V̇O2 obtained during an incremental test. The V̇O2 response was fit with a classical model including two exponential functions. A specific treadmill with three-dimensional force transducers was used to measure the ground reaction force. Kinetic work (Wkin), potential work (Wpot), external work (Wext), and an index of internal work (Wint) per unit of distance were quantified continuously. Results: During the slow component of V̇O2, a significant increase in Wpot (P &lt; 0.01), no change in Wext, and a significant decrease in Wkin and Wint index (P &lt; 0.05. P &lt; 0.001, respectively) were observed. Conclusion: The present study showed that the slow component of V̇O2 did not result partly from a change in mechanical work under the effect of fatigue. Nevertheless, the decrease in stride frequency (P &lt; 0.001) and contact time (P &lt; 0.001) suggested an alternative mechanical explanation. The slow component during running may be due to the cost of generating force or to alterations in the storage and recoil of elastic energy, and not to the external mechanical work.","Biomechanics; Ground reaction force; Locomotion; Oxygen uptake; V̇O2 kinetics","adult; article; athlete; biomechanics; energy; fatigue; human; kinetics; locomotion; normal human; oxygen consumption; running; transducer; treadmill; Adult; Biomechanics; Exercise Test; Humans; Kinetics; Muscle Fatigue; Oxygen Consumption; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Running",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037225653

This typically occurs via a dense, highly nonideal plasma. The ability to simulate an ETC gun system is dependent upon a prediction of the output from the plasma generator. Improvements to a plasma generator computer model have been made as a result of understanding their operation, which has led to significant improvements in the ability to simulate plasma generator operation. However, there is still some way to go before a truly predictive capability can be achieved. This paper is concerned with some improvements to the computer simulation codes and the experimental work that lies behind these improvements. Of particular interest is the mode of the wire explosion process, where the experimental wire ablation rate is far lower than expected from simulations due to anomalous current transfer around the condensed portions of the wire. A new hypothesis is explored that attempts to explain this anomaly. This hypothesis relies upon an electrically insulating metallic vapor transition zone resulting from thermal gradients at the interface between the condensed and plasma phases of the exploding wire. Application of these ideas explains the wire fragmentation process and has also been applied to other areas of capillary plasma generator operation. Further, this hypothesis, if borne out, may have implications for other fields of research such as lightning strikes, electromagnetic gun plasma armatures, and electric armor disruption of shaped charge jets.","Capillary plasma generator; Electrothermal-chemical (ETC) launcher; Exploding wires; Wire fragmentation","Combustion; Computer simulation; Energy storage; Exploding wires; Interfaces (materials); Mathematical models; Plasmas; Rail guns; Thermal gradients; Electrothermal chemical launcher; Pplasma generators; Wire fragmentation; Plasma devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037225194

Our studies of the agouti gene in obesity and insulin resistance demonstrate a key role for intracellular Ca2+ in regulating adipocyte lipid metabolism and triglyceride storage, with increased intracellular Ca2+, resulting in stimulation of lipogenic gene expression and lipogenesis, and suppression of lipolysis, resulting in adipocyte lipid filling and increased adiposity. Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that the increased calcitriol produced in response to low calcium diets stimulates Ca2+ influx in human adipocytes and thereby promotes adiposity. Accordingly, suppressing calcitriol levels by increasing dietary calcium is an attractive target for the prevention and management of obesity. In support of this concept, transgenic mice expressing the agouti gene specifically in adipocytes (a humanlike pattern) respond to low calcium diets with accelerated weight gain and fat accretion, whereas high calcium diets markedly inhibit lipogenesis, accelerate lipolysis, increase thermogenesis and suppress fat accretion and weight gain in animals maintained at identical caloric intakes. Further, low calcium diets impede body fat loss, whereas high calcium diets markedly accelerate fat loss in transgenic mice subjected to caloric restriction. Notably, dairy sources of calcium exert markedly greater effects in attenuating weight and fat gain and accelerating fat loss. This augmented effect of dairy vs. supplemental calcium is likely attributable to additional bioactive compounds in dairy that act synergistically with calcium to attenuate adiposity; among these are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory peptides, which limit angiotensin II production and thereby limit angiotensin II stimulation of adipocyte lipogenesis. These concepts are confirmed by both epidemiological and clinical data, which similarly demonstrate that dairy products exert a substantially greater effect on both fat loss and fat distribution compared to an equivalent amount of supplemental calcium.","Adipocyte; Calcium; Dairy; Obesity; Vitamin D","agouti protein; angiotensin; calcitriol; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; body fat; calcium cell level; calcium intake; calcium transport; caloric intake; caloric restriction; conference paper; dairy product; energy metabolism; gene expression; human; human cell; insulin resistance; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; metabolic regulation; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; thermogenesis; transgenic mouse; weight gain; weight reduction; Agouti; Animalia; Mus musculus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037224635

For a time, progress was measured in terms of maximum speed, which is a straightforward metric when the next design is evolved from the preceding model. There are times, however, when we need to depart from the evolutionary process and create a breakthrough design. The question to be asked is whether there is any way to define system-level analysis and optimization techniques to facilitate the vehicle design process with a more global measure of effectiveness. This paper presents such a methodology for the design of the complete integrated system of systems. Work that has been done in energy-based methods is briefly reviewed, since energy is an implicit consideration in many aerospace disciplines. In addition, methods such as exergy and thermoeconomics have been applied in the design of ground power stations and they are currently being studied for application to aircraft subsystems. The objective of this paper is to expand exergy methods to the design of a complete flight vehicle by defining mission requirements as an exergy/work problem cascading down to each component in the same framework. This paper also serves to introduce a special section of this journal devoted to the application of exergy methods to all levels of flight vehicle design. Overall, the proposed technique provides a method to facilitate system-level optimization at all levels of the design process.",,"Control systems; Design; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Exergy; Flow control; Requirements engineering; Structural optimization; Systems analysis; Thermoeconomics; Aircraft",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037224024

Because cognition declines with age, and our previous study showed that radiation disrupted Morris water maze spatial learning and memory performance, the present study used an 8-arm radial maze (RAM) to further test the cognitive behavioral consequences of radiation exposure. Control rats or rats exposed to whole-body irradiation with 1.0 Gy of 1 GeV/n high-energy 56 Fe particles (delivered at the alternating gradient synchrotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory) were tested nine months following exposure. Radiation adversely affected RAM performance, and the changes seen parallel those of aging. Irradiated animals entered baited arms during the first 4 choices significantly less than did controls, produced their first error sooner, and also tended to make more errors as measured by re-entries into non-baited arms. These results show that irradiation with high-energy particles produces age-like decrements in cognitive behavior that may impair the ability of astronauts to perform critical tasks during long-term space travel beyond the magnetosphere.

With a proper understanding and application of modern TES technology, TES offers even greater value to large cooling customers in the restructuring energy markets of today and tomorrow. The various TES technology options are briefly reviewed and their inherent pros and cons are discussed. Numerous examples are presented of TES installations and technology types currently serving large cooling applications. The areas of these applications include private industry, universities and colleges, hospital and medical facilities, other government facilities, and district cooling. TES is also realizing increasing application in the area of power generation, where it is used by utilities and on-site power generators for combustion turbine inlet cooling. Several case histories are reviewed to illustrate and quantify the demand management impact and economic benefits of TES. Emphasis is placed on the potential of certain TES technologies in large applications to not only manage demand and reduce operating cost, but also to reduce capital cost compared to conventional (non-storage) cooling technology. The present and future restructuring energy marketplace is discussed, as it relates to serving cooling loads. The desirable attributes of cooling technologies in general, and of TES specifically, are explored, in order to identify how to maximize value through flexible demand management. © 2003 Energy Engineering.

The recombinant somatolactin (rbSL) was purified by size exclusion chromatography, and 95% of the protein remained in the oxidized form with negligible aggregation over prolonged cold storage. The identity of the recombinant protein was demonstrated by Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against gilthead sea bream somatolactin. The same antibody was utilized in a radioimmunoassay procedure, using rbSL as standard and radioiodinated tracer. Curve displacements of pituitary and plasma samples paralleled the rbSL standard, and the midrange of the assay (8 ng/ml) was low enough to measure in a consistent manner the circulating SL concentration. To assess biological activity a single dose of rbSL (0.1 μg/g of body mass) was administered to juvenile gilthead sea bream by intraperitioneal injection. In comparison with saline-treated fish, rbSL did not modify the circulating amount of insulin-like growth factor I, whereas a 50% increase was found with the same dose of recombinant trout growth hormone (rtGH). Hormone treatment did not modify nitrogen-ammonia excretion, but both rbSL and rtGH increased carbon dioxide output and oxygen uptake, which in turn decreased the respiratory quotient (CO2 output per O2 uptake). This pattern of gas exchange suggests the enhancement of lipid catabolism, which is consistent with the observation that both hormones were able to inhibit the hepatic activity of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase. These new insights provide direct evidence for the involvement of fish somatolactin in energy homeostasis, which may serve to maintain the lipolytic tonus in different physiologic states.","European sea bass; Growth hormone; Insulin-like growth factor I; Lipolysis; Respiratory quotient; Somatolactin","biotechnology; hormone; Animals; Bass; Biological Assay; Cloning, Molecular; Fish Proteins; Glycoproteins; Growth Hormone; Pituitary Hormones; Radioimmunoassay; Recombinant Proteins; Archosargus rhomboidalis; Dicentrarchus; Dicentrarchus labrax; Hyperoglyphe porosa; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Salmonidae; Serranidae; Staphylococcus phage 3A; vectors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037220307

An inventory of the automation systems revealed limited use of its capabilities. An analysis of the energy data revealed incomplete and inaccurate data. An audit of premise meters and rates revealed widespread inaccuracies and rate change possibilities. It was discovered that metered water was used to irrigate athletic fields at high schools. Perhaps the most revealing finding was the use of ice storage capabilities at a local elementary school. With these findings in hand, strategies were proposed to reduce and conserve energy costs. Start-stop optimization and duty cycle capabilities were programmed on all automated systems, and a scheduling calendar was implemented. Consulting auditors determined some rate changes that were beneficial. Walter P. Johnston gave advice and consulting services that were helpful. Data storage and bill payment was outsourced to ensure accurate records and timely payments to utilities. Wells were dug for irrigation at two athletic fields. The ice storage system was reprogrammed to make full use of its capabilities. Approval was given to include ice storage capability at all new construction and renovation sites. With these strategies and implementation of procedures, Johnston County Schools has documented savings of $339,739 for the last four years (see Table 2 for a breakdown of yearly and cumulative savings). © 2003 Energy Engineering.

The acquisition, utilization, and storage of energy reserves (and other resources) are critical to lifetime reproductive success. There are also responses to predictable changes, e.g., seasonal, and unpredictable challenges, i.e., storms and natural disasters. Social organization in many populations provides advantages through cooperation in providing basic necessities and beneficial social support. But there are disadvantages owing to conflict in social hierarchies and competition for resources. Here we discuss the concept of allostasis, maintaining stability through change, as a fundamental process through which organisms actively adjust to both predictable and unpredictable events. Allostatic load refers to the cumulative cost to the body of allostasis, with allostatic overload being a state in which serious pathophysiology can occur. Using the balance between energy input and expenditure as the basis for applying the concept of allostasis, we propose two types of allostatic overload. Type 1 allostatic overload occurs when energy demand exceeds supply, resulting in activation of the emergency life history stage. This serves to direct the animal away from normal life history stages into a survival mode that decreases allostatic load and regains positive energy balance. The normal life cycle can be resumed when the perturbation passes. Type 2 allostatic overload begins when there is sufficient or even excess energy consumption accompanied by social conflict and other types of social dysfunction. The latter is the case in human society and certain situations affecting animals in captivity. In all cases, secretion of glucocorticosteroids and activity of other mediators of allostasis such as the autonomic nervous system, CNS neurotransmitters, and inflammatory cytokines wax and wane with allostatic load. If allostatic load is chronically high, then pathologies develop. Type 2 allostatic overload does not trigger an escape response, and can only be counteracted through learning and changes in the social structure. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

SERCA2a may be modulated through its accessory phosphoprotein phospholamban or by direct phosphorylation through Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II). As an inhibitory component phospholamban, in its dephosphorylated form, inhibits the Ca2+-dependent SERCA2a function, while protein kinase A dependent phosphorylation of the phospho-residues serine-16 or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of threonine-17 relieves this inhibition. Recent evidence suggests that direct phosphorylation at residue serine-38 in SERCA2a activates enzyme function and enhances Ca2+-reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). These effects that are mediated through phosphorylation result in an overall increased SR Ca2+-load and enhanced contractility. In human heart failure patients, as well as animal models with induced heart failure, these modulations are altered and may result in an attenuated SR Ca2+-storage and modulated contractility. It is also believed that abnormalities in Ca2+-cycling are responsible for blunting the frequency potentiation of contractile force in the failing human heart. Advanced gene expression and modulatory approaches have focused on enhancing SERCA2a function via overexpressing SERCA2a under physiological and pathophysiological conditions to restore cardiac function, cardiac energetics and survival rate. © 2002 European Society of Cardiology.

The pressure-composition isotherms for the alloy show a high hydrogen storage capacity and a steep slope with a slight plateau instead of the horizontal plateau corresponding to the two-phase equilibrium. This feature is attributed to the presence of small amounts of secondary phases due to microsegregation of alloying elements during solidification. The plateau tendency is enhanced upon homogenization annealing of the alloy. The activation of the Zr0.9Ti0.1Mn0.66V0.46Ni1.1 alloy electrode in alkaline solution at 30°C was evaluated by using the cyclic voltammetry technique. For comparison, the Zr0.9Ti0.1CrNi alloy was also studied. The discharge capacities are about 330mAh/g for both as-melted alloys, but the activation is faster for Zr0.9Ti0.1Mn0.66V0.46Ni1.1 than for Zr0.9Ti0.1CrNi, indicating that the substitution of Cr by Mn and V enhances the rate of activation due to the formation of metal surface oxides that can be reduced more easily, which increases the reaction surface area.

Filter papers were used to collect the short-lived radon progeny and thus to measure the Potential Alpha Energy Concentration (PAEC) in-situ in the year 1984 at different times and conditions according to the experimental design. The radon progeny collected on the filter papers were studied as a function of aerosol particle concentration ranging from 102-105 particles cm-3 in three different experiments. The highest aerosol particle concentration was generated by indoor cigarette smoking. Those filters were stored after the experiment, and were used after 16 years to study the activity of the radon long-lived alpha emitter progeny, 210Po (T1/2=138 days). This isotope is separated from the short-lived progeny by 210Pb beta emitter with 22.3 years half-life. After 16 years' storage of these filters, each filter paper was sandwiched and wrapped between two CR-39 nuclear track detectors, to put the detectors in contact with the surfaces of different filters, for 337 days. Correlation between the PAEC measured using filter papers in the year 1984 and the activity of long-lived alpha emitter 210Po on the same filter papers measured in the year 2000 were studied. The results of the 210Po activity showed a very good correlation of 0.92 with the PAEC 16 years ago. The results also depict that the PAEC and 210Po activity in indoor air increased with the increase of aerosol particle concentration, which shows the attachment of short-lived radon progeny with the aerosol particles. The experiment proves that indoor cigarette smoking is a major source of aerosol particles carrying radon progeny and, thus, indoor cigarette smoking is an additional source of internal radiation hazard to the occupants whether smoker or non-smoker. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","210Po; Additional internal radon progeny exposure; Aerosol particles; Autoradiography; CR-39 nuclear track detector; Filter papers; Indoor cigarette smoking","Aerosols; Air filters; Air pollution; Correlation methods; Positive ions; Radon; Radon gas; Polonium; polonium; radium; radon; polonium; radon daughter; radon; aerosol; article; cigarette smoking; correlation analysis; device; environmental radioactivity; filter; lifespan; measurement; paper; progeny; radiation hazard; environmental monitoring; filtration; half life time; indoor air pollution; methodology; Aerosols; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Monitoring; Filtration; Half-Life; Polonium; Radon Daughters; Tobacco Smoke Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037215863

Future stabilization of the atmospheric CO2 content requires a drastic decrease of CO2 emissions worldwide. Energy savings and carbon sequestration, including CO2 capture/storage and enhancement of natural carbon sinks, can be highly beneficial, although it is suggested that both economic and climatic feedbacks could nullify part of the gains achieved. Fossil fuels (coupled with CO2 capture), and lower-carbon hydrogenated fuels such as natural gas are still expected to play an important role in the future. Nevertheless, stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentration in a growing world economy, now dependent on fossil fuels for 85% of its energy, will also require a vast increase in the supply of carbon-free power. Among these energy sources, hydropower and nuclear energy (operated under western safety and environmental standards) are the most readily available sources capable of supplying vast amount of energy at a competitive price. Wind power is also to be encouraged, as it is expected to approach the competitiveness threshold soon. The French example, where fossil fuel CO2 emissions were cut by 27% in a matter of a few years (1979-1986) despite increasing energy consumption, suggests that implementing CO2 stabilization is technically feasible at a competitive price. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Two different polymer structures have been studied: co-substituent phenoxy/oligo-ethyleneoxy polyphosphazenes with the general structure [NP(OC6H5)(OCH2CH2)xOCH3) 2]n and single-substituent phosphazenes with aryloxy groups that bear oligoethyleneoxy units in the para position of the aromatic rings, having the formula {NP[OC6H4(OCH2CH2)xOCH 3]2}n. Polymers of both types contain the same 50:50 molar ratio of aryloxy/oligoethyleneoxy groups, but their properties vary significantly. In general, the gum-like co-substituent polymers have lower glass transition temperatures and higher ionic conductivities.

The adsorption pair is activated carbon + methanol. The adsorber is also the solar collector (2 m2, single glazed), the condenser is air-cooled (natural convection) and the evaporator contains 40 l of water that can freeze into ice. This amount of ice acts as a cold storage for the cold cabinet (available volume of 440 l). Elements such as valves and a graduated bottle are installed, but only for experimental purposes. Apart from these valves, and also ventilation dampers which are open at night time and closed at daytime, the machine does not contain any moving parts and does not consume any mechanical energy. Within the requirement of vacuum technology, the machine is relatively easy to manufacture, so that construction in Burkina-Faso is feasible. Experimental performance is presented in terms of gross solar COP. During the test period, irradiance were quite good (between 19 and 25 MJ m-2), but the ambient temperature was relatively warm (averagely 27.4 °C at sunrise and 37.4 °C at mid-afternoon).

Santilli, Foundations of hadronic chemistry with applications to new clean energies and fuels. Boston-Dordrecht-London: Kluwer Academic Publisher, 2001 for a general review), which consist of individual atoms, radicals and ordinary molecules bonded together into stable clusters under a new internal attractive force originating from the toroidal polarization of the orbitals of atomic electrons under strong external magnetic fields. We then introduce, apparently for the first time, the hypothesis of new chemical species of hydrogen, oxygen and other gases with magnecular structure called MagneHydrogen™, MagneOxygen™, etc. or MagneH™, MagneO™, etc. for short (international patents pending). We then present the experimental evidence according to which the latter gases possess specific weight and energy content greater than the corresponding values of the same gases with conventional molecular structure. We show that the use of MagneH and MagneO in fuel cells implies: (1) an increase of fuel cells voltage, power and efficiency; (2) a decrease of storage volumes; and (3) a significant decrease in operating costs. The equipment for the industrial production of MagneH and MagneO is identified. We also study a particular form of MagneH with specific weight of about 7 times that of the hydrogen which is particularly suited for use as fuel in internal combustion engines, and show that such a new species implies: (i) the elimination of liquefaction of conventional hydrogen as currently used by BMW, GM, and other car manufacturers; (ii) performance essentially equivalent to that of the same engine when operating on gasoline; and (iii) the achievement of cost competitiveness of MagneH with respect to fossil fuels, of course, when produced in sufficiently large volumes. We also indicate that the liquefaction of MagneH and MagneO is predicted to cost significantly less than ordinary gases (in view of a mutual attraction among magnetically polarized magnecules which does not exist in conventional gases), and that their use as fuel for rocket propulsion is expected to imply a significant increase of the payload, or a corresponding decrease of boosters weight. All the above advances are dependent on the features of the selected equipment for the production of MagneH and MagneO (including electric power, pressure, etc.), as well as the duration of the processing. The paper ends with the indication of other applications of the new chemical species, the solicitation of independent experimental verifications, and the identification of new intriguing open problems. © 2002 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Both materials can provide hydrogen at a rate required for a 1 kW unit using water vapour as the reactant. The hydrogen production reaction was found to be first order with respect to water vapour pressure over the temperature range 0-60°C. Control of the H2 generation rate can be achieved by limiting the water vapour access to the hydride or by limiting the saturated water vapour pressure by electrolyte concentration. Some additional degree of control of the production rate is possible by using specific hydride morphologies. Modelling of the hydrogen generation was carried out using a diffusion limited rate determining step and by estimating boundary layer thicknesses and effective diffusivities. The exothermic behaviour of the hydrolysis reaction can cause significant temperature excursions within the hydride bed. © 2002 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

The different passive techniques were used over the roof for cooling the environment inside test structures viz. painting of roof with white cement, thermal insulation over the roof, nocturnal cooling i.e. shallow pond with 100 mm water column with 40 mm thick movable thermal insulation over the roof, evaporative cooling i.e. roof is provided with gunny bags soaked with water with the help of a storage tank and dripper for controlling flow of water without any pump, broken white glazed tile pieces stuck over the roof, air void insulation i.e. inverted earthen pots having 100 mm diameter and 125 mm height were provided over the roof, and roof covered with Sania, a local insulating material used over the huts in the arid regions and the controlled unit without any treatment. The evaporative cooling has been found best for conventional roof, but it requires about 50 1/m2 water per day, therefore, pieces of white glazed tiles stuck over the roof can be used to reduce heat load from the roof and hence cooling of the environment inside buildings. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As an operational strategy, thermal energy storage (TES) is considered as an effective means for shifting electric loads from on-peak to off-peak hours. For manufacturing storage tanks and design of systems, prediction of the time required for water solidification and accumulation of ice by numerical simulation and experimental methods is necessary. The objective of this study is to develop a numerical simulation model and determine the amount of time needed for solidification of water around a circular cross-section TES coil. To meet the objective, transient heat and mass transfer analysis of the water solidification phenomenon around a circular pipe with boundary and initial conditions similar to those found in ice TES systems is required. An extensive literature survey is made, and utilizing a finite difference algorithm suggested by Du-Fort Frankle, the cylindrical coordinate system based numerical model is developed and the time duration for solidification of 10 mm of ice around a 20 mm diameter pipe is found to be 2609.4 s. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this model, the conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy and the transport equation governing ice crystal growth were solved numerically using finite differences based on the control volume method. The thermophysical properties of the mixture, such as density, specific heat, thermal conductivity and kinematic viscosity were allowed to vary in the flow field as a function of ice crystal concentration. The latent heat released by the ice crystals is considered as a source term in the energy equation. The results of the numerical simulations were analyzed based on the combined effects of the Reynolds (flow rate) and Stefan numbers on the ice crystal concentrations and the associated heat transfer parameters. The local Nusselt number at the solid surface and the overall heat transfer coefficient were primarily dependent on ice crystal concentration and, hence, the Stefan number. The overall heat transfer coefficient using ice slurry as a heat transfer fluid was compared to the case of a single phase chilled water system, illustrating the superiority of the ice slurry as a heat transfer and storage medium. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The aim of this study was to determine the hardness, strength (compressive and diametral tensile) and wear resistance of a 'fast-set' highly viscous GIC (Fuji IX GP Fast). Its regular set counterpart (Fuji IX GP) was used for comparison. The glass powders of the two cements were also characterized. Hardness testing [Vickers' hardness number (VHN)] was performed with a digital hardness tester (load = 50 g; dwell time = 30 s) and compressive/diametral tensile strength testing (MPa) was conducted based upon British Standards specification for GICs (BS6039, 1981). Wear testing was conducted using a reciprocal compression-sliding wear instrumentation at 20 MPa contact stress against SS304 counter-bodies with distilled water as lubricant. All specimens were immersed in distilled water at 37°C and tested 24 h after start of mixing. Further mechanical tests (hardness and strength) were conducted with specimens stored for 1 week in distilled water at 37°C. The glass powders were characterized using laser particle sizing, standard electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispressure X-ray (EDX) analysis. Results were analysed using multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) and independent samples t-test at significance level 0.05. No significant difference in hardness, compressive and diametral tensile strength was observed between Fuji IX GP and Fuji IX GP Fast at 1 day. There was also no significant difference in wear at all cyclic intervals. Although the difference in strength was not significant between the two cements at 1 week, Fuji IX GP Fast was significantly harder than Fuji IX GP. Particle size of both cements ranged from 0.3 to 200 μm. The mean particle sizes were, however, different and were 13.43 and 7.13 μm for Fuji IX GP and Fuji IX GP Fast, respectively. Fuji IX GP Fast offers no other advantage over Fuji IX GP with the exception of improved hardness. Clinical relevance Besides being harder, the fast-set highly viscous GIC restorative offers no other physico-mechanical advantage over its regular set counterpart.","Fast-set; Glass-ionomer; Hardness; Particle size; Strength; Wear","glass ionomer; lubricating agent; water; article; compressive strength; dental surgery; electron microscopy; hardness; instrumentation; laser; particle size; standard; statistical analysis; storage; temperature; tensile strength; X ray analysis; dental surgery; human; materials testing; methodology; Dental Restoration Wear; Glass Ionomer Cements; Hardness; Humans; Materials Testing; Microscopy, Electron; Tensile Strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037208792

This study deals with the preparation and characterization of encapsulated paraffin-wax. Encapsulated paraffin particles were prepared by complex coacervation as well as spray-drying methods. The influence of different parameters on the characteristics and performance of a microencapsulated PCM in terms of encapsulation efficiency, and energy storage and release capacity has been investigated. The distribution of particle size and the morphology of microencapsulated PCM were analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In the coacervation method, the optimum homogenizing time is 10 min and the amount of cross-linking agent is 6-8 ml. Results obtained from a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) show that microcapsules prepared either by coacervation or the spray-drying method have a thermal energy storage/release capacity of about 145-240 J/g.

The system has two main operating modes, which depend on the level of the incident solar global irradiance. The mathematical model consists of systems of eight or five ordinary differential equations, as a function of the operating mode. Using a water storage tank improves the stability of PV pumping system operation. The mechanical power stored in the water tank is rather constant during the year. The fraction of collected solar energy that is stored in the water's gravitational energy is higher during the winter months, during the cloudy days and around sunrise and sunset. It is smaller during the summer months, during the clear sky days and in the middle of the day.

Mortar immersed in ammonium sulphate is covered with gypsum needle-like crystals and undergoes rapid cracking when removed from the solution and washed. In the case of mortars immersed in ammonium nitrate solutions, there is rapid decalcification, accompanied by strength loss, due to the solubilization of calcium.

Ca1-xSrxTiO3 forms a cubic solid solution at high temperatures. At lower temperatures it undergoes successive displacive transitions to tetragonal and orthorhombic phases on cooling and increasing CaTiO3 content. The low-frequency mechanical response of the tetragonal phase is dominated by thermally activated displacements of transformation twin domain walls, causing almost a twofold decrease in storage modulus relative to the twinfree cubic phase on cooling through the phase transition (superelastic softening). Below 140°C the mobility of domain walls decreases and the storage modulus returns to a value close to that of the cubic phase. For x &gt; 0.85, the cubic to tetragonal transition temperature is below 140°C and domain walls are immobile immediately on formation, greatly reducing the magnitude of mechanical softening. The frequency dependence of the storage modulus is accurately described by a modified Burgers model of anelastic relaxation. Activation energies of 103 and 96 kJ/mol were obtained for samples with x = 0.7 and 0.74, respectively, suggesting that domain walls are strongly pinned by vacancies at the O positions. Superelastic softening is not observed below Tc for the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition in samples with x = 0.5, 0.55, and 0.6. This is explained by the small value of the spontaneous strain in orthorhombic samples with intermediate compositions, which are distorted from cubic symmetry by less than 1‰. With such small strain contrast between differently oriented twin domains, the effective force on the domain walls due to the external stress is less than the critical unpinning force, preventing displacement of the walls and suppressing superelastic softening.",,"Activation energy; Elastic moduli; Perovskite; Strontium compounds; Cubic solid solutions; Displacive transitions; Dynamical mechanical analysis; Frequency dependence; Low-frequency mechanical properties; Mechanical softening; Modified burgers models; Superelastic softening; Domain walls; elasticity; mechanical property; perovskite; phase transition; seismic attenuation; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0013267125
