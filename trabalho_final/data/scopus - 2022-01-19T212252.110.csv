However, the low utilization of sulfur and the severe “shuttle effect” hinder the commercialization of Li–S batteries. Herein, we design an ultra-thin and lightweight two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum nitride nanosheets layer to modify Celgard (denoted as MoNx/Celgard) separator to promote the electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries. Benefiting from the 2D polar molybdenum nitride nanosheets, the obtained molybdenum nitride layer can effectively suppress the shuttle effect via the synergistic effect of structural confinement and chemical absorption. Meanwhile, molybdenum nitride nanosheets layer possesses metallic and catalytic characteristics, which are beneficial for high sulfur utilization. Therefore, the Li–S batteries using MoNx/Celgard separator with multifunction exhibit high capacity and outstanding cycling performance. It delivers a high discharge capacity of 1298 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and sustain a capacity of 566 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 0.5C, corresponding with the capacity fading rate of only 0.063% per cycle. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Lithium-sulfur batteries; Molybdenum nitride; Multifunction; Separator; Two-dimensional nanosheets","Lithium batteries; Molybdenum compounds; Nanosheets; Nitrides; Separators; Capacity fading rates; Cycling performance; Discharge capacities; Electrochemical performance; Molybdenum nitride; Multifunction; Two Dimensional (2 D); Two dimensional nanosheets; Lithium sulfur batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055736873

But it suffers from poor cycling performance due to the large volume expansion during the charge/discharge process. Nano-scale modification is an effective strategy to solve this problem. Herein, the electronic structure modulation, chemical stability, Li adsorption and diffusion properties as well as structural deformation of two-dimensional (2D) monolayer antimonene have been systematically investigated using first-principles calculations based on vdW corrected density functional theory. The calculated results reveal the adsorption energies of Li on antimonene are relatively strong (1.70–1.91 eV), and it exhibits a semiconductor to metal electronic phase transition with significant electrons transfer from Li metal to antimonene upon Li adsorbed. Meanwhile, Li atom shows fast diffusion on antimonene with the energy barrier of 0.20 eV, much lower than that in bulk antimony (1.73 eV). More importantly, antimonene shows relatively small structure deformation upon adsorption of high Li concentrations. The present results suggest that 2D antimonene can be a promising flexible anode material for LIBs with large specific capacity, excellent rate capability and long cycling performance.

Herein, a novel Na+-based dual-carbon battery (Na+-DCB) is developed based on a nonflammable trimethyl phosphate (TMP) electrolyte with sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonate)imide salt (NaTFSI). As the molar ratio of NaTFSI/TMP increases to 1:2, the graphite cathode shows a high reversible capacity of 52.9 mAh g−1, excellent rate capability (21.0 mAh g−1 at 2000 mA g−1) and superstability cycling performance (≈100% capacity retention after 750 cycles). In addition, a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film is formed on the surface of hard carbon anode by the preferential reductive decomposition of TFSI−, which suppresses decomposition of TMP. In this case, the Na+-DCB is capable to provide an operation voltage of 4.0 V and excellent electrochemical performance.

The full-liquid feature significantly reduces the interface resistance between electrode and electrolyte, endowing LMB with attractive kinetics and transport properties. Achieving a high energy density still remains a big challenge. Herein, we report a low-melting-point antimony-bismuth-tin positive electrode for LMB with high energy density and excellent rate performance for the first time. The electromotive force of Li||Sb-Bi-Sn system is determined by Li||Sb and Li||Bi chemistries. The Sn component plays a bifunctional role in the chemistry, decreasing the melting point of Sb-Bi-Sn alloy and providing rapid lithium diffusion paths for the electrode reaction. The ternary feature of the positive electrode ensures a low Sn concentration for the eutectic requirement of the positive electrode working at moderate temperature (500 °C). The stepwise reaction characteristics of Sb and Bi provides a dynamic microstructure change of intermediate compounds during the charge/discharge process, allowing the electrolyte to penetrate and make contact with the positive electrode to enable a fast electrode reaction. A synergetic combination of these advantages enables the reported Sb-Bi-Sn electrode to demonstrate a high energy density of about 260 Wh kg -1 and excellent rate capability with almost no capacity degradation at different current densities from 200 to 1200 mA cm -2 . All these excellent properties demonstrate that the Sb-Bi-Sn alloy is an ideal positive electrode of LMB for large-scale applications. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Bismuth alloys; Degradation; Electrolytes; Liquid metals; Melting point; Reaction intermediates; Secondary batteries; Tin alloys; Capacity degradation; Dynamic microstructure changes; Energy storage applications; High energy densities; Interface resistance; Intermediate compound; Large-scale applications; Moderate temperature; Electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059513837

However, the prevailing synthesis of porous carbon from organic precursors suffers from complicated procedure and the emission of pollutants and greenhouse gas. Herein, an environmentally benign and facile strategy is reported to rapidly synthesize hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) from greenhouse gas (CO2) at low temperatures. CO2 reacts with sodium hydride (NaH) to produce foam-like HPC, hydrogen, and sodium carbonate at 320 °C in 15 s. No other byproducts or pollutants are produced in the synthesis process. As-synthesized foam-like HPC shows high macro-meso-microporosity, which may facilitate more lithium-ion storage in foam-like HPC. When applied as anode materials for lithium-ions batteries, the foam-like HPC shows a reversible capacity of ∼630 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 after 200 cycles and maintains stable reversible capacity of ∼470 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1 even up to 500 cycles. This green and efficient strategy offers us an alternative route to synthesize HPCs for energy storage from greenhouse gas. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","electrochemical performance; foam-like HPC; green synthesis; greenhouse gas; lithium storage","Anodes; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Foams; Greenhouse gases; Hydrides; Lithium; Lithium-ion batteries; Low temperature effects; Organic carbon; Pollution; Sodium Carbonate; Storage (materials); Temperature; Electrochemical performance; Environmentally benign; Green synthesis; Hierarchical porous carbons; Lithium ion storages; Lithium storages; Low temperature synthesis; Reversible capacity; Sodium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064741248

Up to date, PCMs are elaborated with raw and expensive materials. Therefore, the main appeal of the PCM is its support material, recycled diatomite, a palm oil industrial waste. PCMs were elaborated with three support materials (raw, recycled, and recycled-calcined diatomite) to compare its influence on PCM thermal and chemical behavior. Different mixtures of organic components (esters of palm oil and commercial stearic acid in different proportions) were incorporated into the three support materials. A characterization process by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to select the organic mixture with the highest value of latent heat of fusion and the closest phase change temperature range to the thermal comfort in each support material. To establish the thermal and chemical stability of the PCMs, DSC, thermogravimetry (TGA), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis were carried out at 0, 120, 240 and 360 thermal cycles. One of the major outcomes from these joint efforts is the good and long thermal and chemical performance of the PCMs composed by 100% of commercial stearic acid methyl esters and recycled-calcined diatomite. This PCM is capable to have a similar energy storage capacity to the PCM supported in raw diatomite. The results show the effectiveness of the use of recycled-calcined diatomite as support material to obtain potential and sustainable PCMs for energy saving. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Diatomite; Fatty acid esters; Phase change materials; Sustainable PCMs; Thermal energy storage","Calcination; Chemical analysis; Chemical stability; Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy conservation; Esters; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Heat storage; Mixtures; Palm oil; Recycling; Stearic acid; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Thermogravimetric analysis; Diatomite; Different proportions; Energy storage capacity; Fatty acid esters; Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy; Phase change temperature; Thermal and chemical stabilities; Thermal performance enhancements; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055344243

However, low ionic conductivity restricts the polymer electrolyte usage in commercialized lithium ion batteries. Among the candidates of polymer electrolytes, poly (ethylene carbonate) is promising due to its ability of high lithium salt dissociation. Nonetheless, these polymer electrolytes with high concentration salt always accompanies with an obvious deterioration of mechanical properties. Herein, via controlling the ratio of poly (ethylene carbonate) and poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene), a biphasic solid polymer electrolyte possessing high concentration lithium salt phase and good mechanical strength is prepared. Specifically, considering the role of polymer groups in lithium ion transport, it is speculated that dual-path of Li+ transport forms in the polymer electrolyte, which improves the conductivity remarkably. The prepared electrolyte realizes sufficient ionic conductivity (1.08 × 10−4 S/cm) at 30 °C, with a wide electrochemical window about 4.5 V (vs. Li+/Li), meanwhile exhibits the capacity of `suppression to lithium dendrite growth. Notably, with the polymer electrolyte, Li/LiFePO4 cell exhibits superior rate capacity and excellent cycling stability.

However, if the heat generated during compression is not utilized, the process efficiency will be low, and consequently, additional heat is required to avoid frost formation during the expansion process. The generated heat during compression can be stored in the form of sensible heat in the wall of the high-pressure tank at an elevated temperature. However, this method is undesirable due to (1) less air can be compressed at higher temperatures and (2) heavy insulation would be required to prevent heat loss to the environment over extended time. A solution to this problem is to use Phase Change Material (PCM) which has a melting temperature close to ambient, and hence the heat could be stored as latent heat of melting. PCMs have low thermal conductivity and hence requires to have large contact area with the compressed air so as to be able to release its latent heat rapidly during rapid expansion. This could be achieved through the use of microencapsulated PCM, which provides very large surface area. In this work, a high-pressure tank (2 L, 200 bar) was used for air storage while the commercial microcapsules; Micronal® DS 5038X was used as the latent heat storage material. Both theoretical simulation and experimental measurements made on the system show that the use of PCM microcapsules reduces the maximum increase in air temperature from approximately 45 °C to 27 °C (150 g, Micronal® DS 5038X) during charging. While during discharging, the maximum decrease in temperature was reduced from 48 °C to 28 °C, which prevented air temperature from dropping to below 0 °C. © 2018","Compression; Expansion and compressed air energy storage; Microcapsules; PCM","Atmospheric temperature; Compaction; Compressed air; Heat storage; High pressure engineering; Latent heat; Melting; Microstructure; Phase change materials; Pressure vessels; Pulse code modulation; Storage (materials); Tanks (containers); Thermal conductivity; Waste heat; Compressed air energy storages (CAES); Elevated temperature; Heat recovery systems; Latent heat of melting; Low thermal conductivity; Mechanical energies; Microcapsules; Theoretical simulation; Compressed air energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054920982

Increasing specific heat capacity of molten salts can enhance their thermal storage capacity. In this paper, the effect of nanoparticles on specific heat capacity of NaNO3-KNO3 is studied. Modified salts were synthesized by using sol-gel combustion method based on the combustion of sol or gel of Mg(NO3)2 and citric acid or urea in NaNO3-KNO3. Chemical and phase composition of modified salts were detected based on the results of X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Microstructure of nanoparticles and molten salt was characterized via field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM). The results show that nanoparticles are successfully prepared. MgO nanoparticles possess dendritic structure with a length of tens to hundreds of nanometers and a width of 2–5 nm in the citric acid system, and MgO nanoparticles show spherical structure with the diameter about 5 nm in the urea system. According to the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) results, the specific heat capacity of modified salts increases to varying degrees, while the latent heat changes little. In citric acid system, the solid specific heat capacity increases by 93.1%, while the liquid specific heat capacity increases by 83.9%.

In such systems, two metal hydride beds are connected and operating in an alternative way as energy storage or hydrogen storage. However, the selection of metal hydrides is essential for a smooth operation of these CSP systems in terms of energy storage efficiency and density. In this study, thermal energy storage systems using metal hydrides are modeled and analyzed in detail using first law of thermodynamics. For these purpose, four conventional metal hydrides are selected namely LaNi5, Mg, Mg2Ni and Mg2FeH6. The comparison of performance is made in terms of volumetric energy storage and energy storage efficiency. The effects of operating conditions (temperature, hydrogen pressure and heat transfer fluid mass flow rates) and reactor design on the aforementioned performance metrics are studied and discussed in detail. The preliminary results showed that Mg-based hydrides store energy ranging from 1.3 to 2.4 GJ m−3 while the energy storage can be as low as 30% due to their slow intrinsic kinetics. On the other hand, coupling Mg-based hydrides with LaNi5 allow us to recover heat at a useful temperature above 330 K with low energy density ca.500 MJ m−3 provided suitable operating conditions are selected. The results of this study will be helpful to screen out all potentially viable hydrides materials for heat storage applications. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Energy storage density; Energy storage efficiency; Heat management; Metal hydride; Thermal energy storage","Binary alloys; Heat storage; Heat transfer performance; Hydrides; Iron alloys; Lanthanum alloys; Magnesium alloys; Magnesium compounds; Metals; Solar energy; Thermal energy; Comparison of performance; Concentrated solar power; Energy storage density; Energy storage efficiencies; First law of thermodynamics; Heat management; Metal hydrides; Thermal energy storage systems; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056503924

To use the solar heating during winter thermal energy storage is required.

This review summarizes and briefly discusses recent organic carbonyl compounds for sodium-organic batteries from the viewpoint of function-oriented design, including function evolution from small-molecule compounds to polymers, then composites, and finally flexible electrodes. In particular, as a timely overview, carbonyl-based organic flexible electrodes for sodium-organic batteries are also highlighted for the first time. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Simple methods for controllable fabrication of 2D graphitic carbon hybrids in a scalable manner remains challenging. Now, a microwave-assisted strategy for mass production of 2D carbon hybrids based on self-boosting catalytic carbonization of a metal–agarose framework is demonstrated. Hybrids including hollow Fe3C nanoparticles, Ni/Co nanoparticles, and hollow FeOx nanoparticles uniformly embedded in 2D graphitic carbon nanosheets (GCNs) are obtained, demonstrating the generality of the approach.

As the alloy-type Se has a severe pulverization issue, one critical challenge to develop advanced Na-Se and K-Se batteries is to explore a highly efficient and stable Se-based cathode. Herein, a flexible free-standing Se/carbon composite film is prepared by encapsulation of Se into a carbon nanotube (CNT) interwoven N,O dual-doped porous carbon nanosheet (Se@NOPC-CNT). The 3D interconnected CNT uniformly wrapped on the N,O dual-doped porous carbon skeletons improves the flexibility and offers an interconnected conductive pathway for rapid ionic/electronic transport. In addition, the N,O dual-doping significantly enhances the chemical affinity and adhesion between NaxSe/KxSe (0 &lt; x ≤ 2) and porous carbon, which is confirmed by density functional theory calculation. When used as the cathode in Na-Se batteries, the Se@NOPC-CNT delivers a remarkable reversible capacity of 400 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 2000 cycles with a 0.008% capacity decay per cycle. For K-Se batteries, it also exhibits an excellent cycling stability (335 mA h g−1 after 700 cycles at 0.8 A g−1).

However, practical application of a Li-S battery is restricted severely by easy dissolution of lithium polysulfides and high flammability of sulfur. Herein, we developed, for the first time, a multifunctional composite directly prepared by a facile, green, low-cost, and large-scale ball-milling method with fly ash and sulfur. Due to the unique microstructure and sulfur-related components as chemical anchors, composites possessed good electron/ion transport, favorable resistance to volume change of sulfur, and strong chemical affinity to polysulfides, which greatly facilitate redox kinetics, maintain structural integrity of the cathode, and suppress polysulfide shuttling in electrolyte, hence significantly boosting electrochemical performance of the Li-S battery with high initial discharge capacity, superior cycling stability, and satisfying rate capability. Typically, Li-S batteries based on a composite with a sulfur loading of 86.9% present initial discharge capacities of 969.8, 894.3, and 769.7 mAh g -1 as well as capacity decay rates of 0.068% (400 cycles), 0.1% and 0.042% per cycle (200 cycles) at 0.2, 0.5, and 1 C, respectively. Moreover, the average specific self-extinguishing time of the composite-based cathode was clearly reduced to less than half of that of the pristine sulfur-based cathode, indicating significantly promoting the safety of the battery. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","ball-milling; high-performance; lithium-sulfur batteries; micro/nanostructure; multifunctional composites; safety","Accident prevention; Ball milling; Cathodes; Chemical stability; Decay (organic); Electric discharges; Electrolytes; Electron affinity; Fly ash; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Milling (machining); Polysulfides; Sulfur compounds; Electrochemical performance; Energy storage systems; high-performance; Initial discharge capacities; Micro/nanostructures; Multifunctional composites; Portable electronic devices; Self extinguishing time; Lithium sulfur batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057567579

However, the infinite volume change and the uncontrollable dendrite growth of MAs during cycles are obstructing the development of commercialization. Numerous strategies have been explored to surmount the barriers, including composite anode preparation, separator modification, artificial solid electrolyte interphase, and solid-state electrolyte fabrication. With atomic thickness, two-dimensional (2D) materials possess ultrahigh specific surface area, abundant surface chemistry, and high mechanical strength along with facile processibility. These properties render 2D materials useful in all components of lithium/sodium metal batteries, improving their cycle stability and safety performance of the whole system. Herein, current progress of 2D materials for MAs is summarized. Their limitations are also discussed. New perspectives and future directions for this area are also provided.

However, the synthesis of MnO2 with excellent electrochemical performance is limited to the traditional hydrothermal method, which is difficult to scale up for mass production. Herein, a ball-milling approach is developed to rapidly obtain Mn3O4 nanoparticles in large quantity. As the cathode material of aqueous zinc ion battery, Mn3O4 gradually transforms to ϵ-MnO2 in 1 M ZnSO4 + 1 M MnSO4 aqueous electrolyte with increasing cycles. Benefiting from the unexpected phase transition from Mn3O4 to ϵ-MnO2, the cathode delivers a specific capacity of 221 mAh g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 and a good long-term cyclic stability over 500 cycles with 92% capacity retention at a high rate of 500 mA g-1. The excellent battery performance combined with the cost-effective preparation procedure, the good safety of aqueous mild electrolyte, and the easy cell assembly are believed to promote the practical use of the Zn/MnO2 battery in large-scale energy storage.

First-principles calculations were used to investigate the adsorption and storage of lithium and sodium on monolayer g-C2N. The capacities of lithium and sodium ion batteries for monolayer g-C2N are 596 (LiC2N) and 276 (NaC4N2) mAh/g, respectively. The average Li binding energy reaches 2.39 eV relative to isolated Li atoms, which suggests that the lithium capacity achieved on g-C2N might not be sustained during cycling. By varying the ratio of C to N atoms, it is found that the average Li binding energy is reduced to only 1.69 eV for C:N ~ 5:1, indicating a significant improvement in cycling performance while maintaining the reversible capacity. The mobility barrier energies to Li ion diffusion between two layers in bulk structures with AA and AB stacking sequences are 0.25 and 1.23 eV, respectively, indicating that high Li ion conductivity could be achieved in bulk g-C2N with AA stacking.

It is addressing several structural problems of traditional solar greenhouses, mainly energy capture and balance features. At northern latitudes, solar irradiance in wintertime is limited, which, along with extreme low outside temperatures, raises many energy sustainability issues. Capturing incident energy primarily depends on south-facing shape and cover transmittance characteristics, and this paper sets out an analysis framework for heat gain, leaving out other heat balance conservation factors (insolation). A circular shape has been selected for the SEG and is compared to Liaoshen-type Solar Greenhouse (LSG) that uses an elliptical south shape, used in traditional Chinese solar greenhouses. The SEG replaces passive north wall heat storage of LSG with active heat storage in water, thus creating an advantage in stored energy management. The shape factors and aperture efficiencies of the two designs were analysed and experimentally assessed during typical clear-sky days in four seasons. This provides a theoretical basis for structural and environmental optimisation. The design of SEG moved the ridge forward and increased the lighting roof angle, resulting in better solar radiation capture for winter sun altitudes. The newly-introduced SEG design exhibits better winter energy capture and less summer cooling load and features, by construction, and better performance in many other aspects, including potential automatic intelligent management actions. In addition to the SEG's energy capture analysis, along with briefing on light and temperature superiority, the design may also compensate for its higher constructional cost by superior automation capacity that calls for a combined holistic intelligent solution and offers many operational sustainability advantages. © 2018 IAgrE","Aperture efficiency; Energy capture; Solar greenhouse; Solar radiation","Energy conservation; Heat storage; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar radiation; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Aperture efficiency; Chinese solar greenhouse; Energy capture; Energy sustainability; Intelligent management; Intelligent solutions; Operational sustainability; Solar greenhouse; Greenhouses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055692322

It's found that the porous carbon fibers become more loose after the plasma treatments, and the surface compositions are changed. Results show that the material after plasma treatments could deliver capacities higher than 200 mAh/g when the current density is 1000 mA/g. EIS results show that the charge transfer resistances of the treated material keep more stable after electrochemical cycles. And these improvements may be results of the plasma treatments.

The STES used in this study was an annular cavity storage unit filled with heat storage material. Two latent heat storage materials (benzoic acid and stearic acid), and one sensible heat storage material (palm olein) were selected for this study. Transient thermal analysis was carried out on the STES models using ANSYS 16.0. The performances of the STES systems were evaluated by installing them in solar cookers to heat water. The heating power, sensible heat efficiency (SHE), the amount of energy and exergy stored were estimated. The temperature distribution, total heat flux and directional heat flux of the STES systems were observed to be affected by the type of heat storage materials used. The heating power, the energy stored and exergy stored reduced, while the SHE increased with an increase in the amount of water heated. In the absence of solar radiation, the STES systems sustained the temperature of 1 and 1.5 kg of water above 60 and 50 °C respectively for 200 min; this shows the suitability of the annular cavity storage unit for low-temperature applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","ANSYS; Energy and exergy stored; Heat flux; Sensible heating efficiency; Solar cooker","Benzoic acid; Energy efficiency; Exergy; Heat storage; Low temperature effects; Palm oil; Solar energy; Solar equipment; Solar heating; Storage (materials); Temperature; Thermal energy; Thermoanalysis; ANSYS; Energy and exergy; Low-temperature applications; Sensible heat storages; Sensible heating; Solar cookers; Solar thermal energy; Transient thermal analysis; Heat flux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055250240

In fact, sensitive and latent thermal storage remains very important, because the use of the produced solar thermal energy is not usually instantaneous. Hence, the necessity to properly size and design hot water storage tanks to achieve an increased thermal performance during an applied charging/discharging cycles. This review was written in three parts. The first part provided a sharp insight of the recent studies that have been carried out on the storage tanks connected to solar water heaters (SWHs). Horizontal thermal storage tanks of SWH integrating Evacuated Tube Collectors (ETCs) with heat pipe were also considered in this review. In addition, the experimental approach often used to assess thermal stratified hot water storage tanks was synthesized. Moreover, innovation studies aimed at increasing the thermal efficiency of the storage tanks were presented, either by integrating PCMs or by submerging components such as porous or tilted flat plates inside the tank. The second part of this review presents the equations setting to be established to ensure the physical modeling of thermal stratification within storage tanks. Indeed, two approaches have been detailed: the three-dimensional CFD approach and the two-dimensional formulation based on the introduction of the vorticity stream function equation. Finally yet importantly, the third part of this review highlighted a set of thermal performance indicators usually used by the scientific community to evaluate the thermal yield of hot water storage tanks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CFD; Numerical modeling; Stratified storage tanks; Synthesis study; Thermal efficiency; Thermal performance indicators","Benchmarking; Computational fluid dynamics; Heat pipes; Heat storage; Numerical models; Solar energy; Solar heating; Water; Evacuated tube collectors; Experimental and numerical studies; Experimental approaches; Hot water storage tanks; Storage tank; Thermal efficiency; Thermal Performance; Vorticity-stream function; Water tanks; computational fluid dynamics; energy efficiency; innovation; numerical model; performance assessment; pipe; solar power; storage tank; thermal power; three-dimensional modeling; two-dimensional modeling; water storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054812117

Compared to traditional sensible and latent energy storage, thermochemical energy storage (TCES) offers a greater possibility for stable and efficient energy generation owing to high energy storage densities, long-term storage without heat loss, etc. The aim of this review was to provide a comprehensive insight into the current state of the art of research on several typical TCES systems at high operation temperatures (673–1273 K). These systems include hydride, metal oxide and organic systems. Each system is discussed in regard to two aspects: cycle life and heat storage performance. A concrete analysis of the current research and development provided in this review exposes that the main challenges of the aforementioned TCES systems rely on robust cycling stability of materials, reliable energy charging and discharging reactors, and a high-efficiency system for widespread commercialization.

The new method combined the Sobol’ method and the Simulated Annealing algorithm for global sensitivity analysis and global optimization, respectively. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the high-dimension global optimization problem was transformed into several low-dimension global optimization problems by parameter decoupling. In order to obtain the global minimum levelized cost of electricity of the solar power tower plant, these low-dimension models were successively optimized by utilizing the Simulated Annealing algorithm. A reference case study of the solar power tower plant with 2650 heliostats was conducted. The heliostat field, receiver, thermal storage system and power block were designed as a function of 12 parameters. It was demonstrated that the parameters related to the heliostat field and receiver were almost independent. The minimum levelized cost of electricity of 22.22 ȼ/kWhe was obtained. Furthermore, a comparison with the global algorithm and local algorithm showed that the novel method could reduce the number of optimization steps by approximately 75% compared with that of the global algorithm.

However, the combined effects of key design parameters for sizing the solar tower power plants, including design direct normal irradiance, solar multiple and thermal storage hours, on the thermo-economic system performance under different solar resources are still unclear. In this study, a thermo-economic model for a 50 MW solar tower power plant based on steam Rankine cycle with molten salt storage has been developed to explore the optimal combinations of these parameters at four sites in China. The coupled relationship between these parameters and their effects on the annual electricity generation, solar-to-electricity efficiency and levelized cost of energy have been identified. The results show that the optimal design direct normal irradiance for minimal levelized cost of energy depends on both the annual irradiation level and the distribution of solar irradiance, which differs from the recommended values obtained from the traditional methods. It is found that the irradiation received by heliostats at the optimal design condition accounts for a specific percentage (i.e., 72–75%) of the annual irradiation for the cases in this study. The sensitive analysis by varying the main financial parameters indicates that the optimal design direct normal irradiance and the corresponding percentage slightly vary with the heliostat cost. The results can provide a theoretical reference for determining the optimal size of the heliostat field and thermal energy storage for solar tower power systems under different solar resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Design direct normal irradiance; Solar multiple; Solar tower power plants; Thermal energy storage; Thermo-economic analysis","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Heat storage; Irradiation; Optimal systems; Steam power plants; Thermal energy; Towers; Direct normal irradiances; Electricity efficiencies; Electricity generation; Key design parameters; Levelized cost of energies; Solar multiples; Solar tower power plants; Thermo-economic model; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054270107

To simulate the polymorphism of Na2FeSiO4, a total of 14 structural models are constructed from the structure types ABC2X4 of Na- and Li-based silicates. Free energies are calculated within the quasi-harmonic approximation to evaluate the relative stabilities of 13 dynamically stable structures under temperature and pressure conditions.

The networks connecting them achieve the goal in efficient heat delivery and reasonable cost, especially for the users with large heat demands.

Therefore, a promising alternative, called mobilized thermal energy storage (M-TES), was proposed to deliver the heat flexibly without the restriction of networks.

A numerical model was constructed for this purpose then the model was validated for dry cycle conditions with an existing turbine SULZER S3 performance data. An inlet fogging was used to full saturate the inlet air and overspray was used for decreasing the compressor inlet temperature at various ambient temperatures. The results showed that the inlet fogging and overspray reduce the compressor work up to 12%. The results also showed that the thermal efficiency was improved with using the inlet fogging and by increasing the overspray rate. The highest thermal efficiency of 44% was achieved when overspray 3% with recuperation was applied.

In a traditional EAHE, the cooling/heating effect is achieved through the charging/discharging process of soil sensible heat. However, this process is detrimental to fully develop its potential. Considering that the phase change-based thermal energy storage technology has outstanding advantages in this regard, a new system named phase change material (PCM)-filled EAHE is proposed to overcome this deficiency. To study the cooling performance of this new system, a three-dimensional numerical model based on the effective heat capacity method has been built in ANSYS FLUENT and validated using an indoor test rig, which was filled with some laboratory-prepared shape-stabilized PCM. Then comparative studies between the PCM-filled EAHEs and the traditional one are conducted under Chongqing (China) summer condition. The results indicate that, at the daily maximum outdoor temperature, the outlet temperature of the PCM-filled EAHE, which employs the laboratory-prepared shape-stabilized PCM, is approximately 0.83 °C lower than that of the traditional EAHE. Therefore, this PCM-filled EAHE can achieve an improvement of 20.24% in cooling capacity compared to the traditional one. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cooling performance; EAHE; Energy conservation; Numerical simulation; Phase change material","Air conditioning; Computer simulation; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Passive solar buildings; Phase change materials; Specific heat; Charging/discharging; Cooling performance; EAHE; Earth-air heat exchangers; Earthair heat exchanger (EAHE); Heating , Ventilating , and Air-Conditioning; Shape-stabilized PCM; Three-dimensional numerical modeling; Cooling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053787603

Moreover, by increasing the content of P in TMPs, their lithium storage performance can be further improved. However, the decreased electrical conductivity caused by continuous increment of the P doping into metal and the large volume change during the lithiation/delithiation process limit the electrical energy storage applications of such materials. The combination of the advantages of graphene and a hollow structure is regarded as an approach to solve these issues. In this work, CoP nanocages wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (CoP@RGO) were fabricated via a template-based method followed by a low-temperature phosphating process. Such a unique structure can not only accommodate the volume change during the lithiation/delithiation process but also improve the electric conductivity of the CoP nanocages.

The performance of these systems depends on the thermal charging and discharging of the phase change materials. One of the important heat transfer parameters concerning these systems is the phase change process. Such a process depends on the flow rate of the heat transfer fluid and the environmental conditions. In the present study, a comparative study was carried out for two finned U-tube direct flow collectors. For the first collector paraffin wax was used as a phase change material. While for the second collector the control collector was left empty. Different flow rates were applied to study their effects on both the phase change process and the system performance. It was found that low flow rates allow a complete phase change and achieve the energy storage benefit of the phase change material. When the phase change process was complete, the system delivered its best efficiency. Under high flow rates, the system did not achieve the expected thermal energy storage benefits because the phase change material remained in the solid state. However, the solid phase provided a good insulator for the useful heat and enhanced the system's efficiency. At a flow rate that caused a partial phase change, the system's efficiency deteriorated, but the storage benefit of the phase change material was achieved. A novel correlation is proposed to estimate the hot water supply period according to a required discharge temperature. This correlation is valid for the direct flow finned and U-tube evacuated tube solar collectors integrated with paraffin wax as a phase change material. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Evacuated tube collector; Phase change material; Phase change process; Solar heating; U-tube","Flow rate; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Paraffins; Solar collectors; Solar heating; Storage (materials); Tubes (components); Water supply; Comparative studies; Discharge temperature; Environmental conditions; Evacuated tube collectors; Evacuated tube solar collector; Experimental investigations; Phase change process; Transfer parameters; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053503853

This new kind of composite material is composed of a core-shell structured Na2SO4@SiO2 phase change material (PCM) with high melting temperature and Al2O3-SiO2 aerogel with high thermal resistance and low thermal conductivity. The effects of PCM amounts and heat treatment temperatures on the physicochemical properties of Na2SO4@SiO2@Al2O3-SiO2 PDCA are investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that when the mass percentage of Na2SO4@SiO2 PCM powders increases to 36.7%, the peaks corresponding to Na2SO4 can be well observed. The boehmite phase within Na2SO4@SiO2@Al2O3-SiO2 PDAC can be transformed to γ-Al2O3 via structural adjustment after heat treatment at 600 °C. The pore size distribution doesn't shift after 600 °C heat treatment, and the most probable pore diameter is at around 30 nm. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) shows that the Na2SO4@SiO2 PCM powders with diameters at around 500 nm can be effectively trapped and are homogeneously distributed within the aerogel matrix even after further heat treatment at 1000 °C, therefore, liquid leakage can be inhibited during melting process. The peak latent heat of Na2SO4@SiO2@Al2O3-SiO2 PDCA can be as high as 153.84 J/g with the PCM mass percentage at 36.7%. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area increases from 419.3 m2/g to 630.6 m2/g due to structural adjustment, and then decreases to 277.7 m2/g caused by volume shrinkage. Thermal simulation results show that the total melting time can be 254.8 s, and development of the temperature distribution keeps well with that of the liquid fraction. The velocity distribution of the liquid PCM keeps at 0 due to the constraint of aerogel matrix.

With the depletion of fossil energy, effective utilization of solar energy is getting increasingly urgent. Thermal energy storage is an inevitable choice for effective utilization of renewable energy sources. As one of the most promising renewable energy sources, solar energy is inexhaustible. But it has some shortcomings such as instability and intermittency, affected by time, climate, and geographical location. Thermal energy storage technology, which can effectively reduce the cost of concentrated solar power generation, plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between energy supply and demand. In addition, thermal energy storage subsystem can improve performance and reliability of the whole energy system. According to different principles, thermal storage technology is generally classified as sensible heat storage, latent heat storage, and thermochemical energy storage. Most solar thermal power generation systems, currently demonstrated and operated in the world, adopt the method of sensible thermal energy storage. In contrast, thermochemical energy storage is a relatively new concept, which is still in the stage of basic test and verification. Thermochemical energy storage technology stores and releases energy through endothermic and exothermic reversible reactions. A closed system with separated reactants and products, in theory, can store energy indefinitely. The main thermochemical energy storage systems include redox system, metal hydride system, carbonate decomposition system, ammonia decomposition system, methane reforming system, and inorganic hydroxide system. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","concentrated solar power; latent heat storage; reversible reaction system; sensible heat storage; thermochemical energy storage","Ammonia; Economics; Hydrides; Latent heat; Natural resources; Redox reactions; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Thermal energy; Carbonate decomposition; Concentrated solar power; Renewable energy source; Reversible reaction; Sensible heat storages; Solar thermal power generation; Thermal storage technology; Thermochemical energy storage; Heat storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052836500

The low thermal conductivity of PCM results in slow heat transfer and low heat storage and release rate, which is a major drawback for their practical applications. This review focuses on the enhancement of thermal conductivity by the introduction of highly thermally conductive metallic and carbon-based nanoparticles, metallic foams, expanded graphite and encapsulation of PCM. Carbon-based nanoparticles including carbon fiber, carbon nanotubes, and graphene show better performance than metal-based nanoparticles due to lower density and better dispersion. The thermal conductivity of the composite phase change material (CPCM) depends on the shape, size, aspect ratio and concentration of nanoparticles. The thermal conductivity of CPCM increases by increasing concentration and aspect ratio of the additive. Metallic foam and expanded graphite possess high thermal conductivity and good thermo-physical properties and also prevent leakage of PCM during phase change. The porosity of foam has a huge impact on thermal conductivity than pore size. Encapsulated PCM has well-enhanced thermal conductivity and long-lifetime due to the high thermal conductive shell which also protects the PCM from direct contact with the environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Composite PCM; Latent heat; Nanomaterials; Phase change material; Thermal conductivity enhancement; Thermal properties","Aspect ratio; Carbon fibers; Cooling systems; Graphite; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Latent heat; Metal foams; Metal nanoparticles; Metals; Nanostructured materials; Phase change materials; Pore size; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Thermodynamic properties; Yarn; Composite pcm; Composite phase change materials; Energy storage systems; Enhanced thermal conductivity; High thermal conductivity; Low thermal conductivity; Thermal conductivity enhancement; Thermo-physical property; Thermal conductivity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052296711

Among the carbon nanomaterials, graphene and carbon nanotube are more excellent as the electrocatalysts for oxygen electrode reactions, especially heteroatoms doped graphene and carbon nanotube.

Herein, enlightened by the extra capacity on transition metal oxides (TMO) anodes derived from the transition metal (TM) catalytic effect on reversible solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) films, a ternary composite consisting of TM, TMO, and carbon matrix, namely TM/TMO/carbon, is proposed as a novel and high-efficiency anode prototype. In this electrode design, TMO not only serve as active material but also pulverizes the TM nanoparticles via the conversion reaction during cycling. Pulverized TM nanoparticles can activate and/or promote the reversible transformation of SEI films more efficiently. And carbon matrix ensures the electronic conductivity and integrity of the overall electrode during multiple electrochemical reactions. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, NiCo-NiCo2O4@carbon nanotubes (NC-NCO@CNTs) is synthesized by a bottom-up strategy via in-situ growth on a simplified chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. As designed, the NC-NCO@CNTs keeps gaining extra capacity upon cycling, delivering an unceasingly increased capacity up to 1324 mAh g−1 (500 mA g−1), splendid rate performance (945 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1, 696 mAh g−1 at 2000 mA g−1), and ultralong lifespan (2200 cycles).

However, its application is hindered by poor cyclability and rate performance, caused by a large volume variation and low conductivity. Herein, iron sulfide porous nanowires confined in an N-doped carbon matrix (FeS@N-C nanowires) are fabricated through a simple amine-assisted solvothermal reaction and subsequent calcination strategy. The as-obtained FeS@N-C nanowires, as an LIB anode, exhibit ultrahigh reversible capacity, superior rate capability, and long-term cycling performance. In particular, a high specific capacity of 1,061 mAh·g−1 can be achieved at 1 A·g−1 after 500 cycles. Most impressively, it exhibits a high specific capacity of 433 mAh·g−1 even at 5 A·g−1. The superior electrochemical performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of the porous nanowire structure and the conductive N-doped carbon matrix.

In this paper, from first-principles calculations, we predict that Li storage becomes possible when the Ca 2 N monolayer is rolling up into nanotubes. The curvature effect of the Ca 2 N nanotube decreases the Li adsorption energy to a level below 0 eV, corresponding to positive charge/discharge potential. As a result, Li storage in Ca 2 N nanotubes becomes feasible and a theoretical capacity of about 426.9 mAh/g is predicted for the Ca 2 N-(14, 0) nanotube.

However, a major challenge of DAAFCs confronting us is relatively low power density. Herein, to deal with this challenge, we treat carbon black (BP 2000) with nitric acid at an optimal concentration (4 M), which is further employed as anodic electrocatalyst for AA oxidation with improved hydrophilicity. Consequently, hydrophilic AA molecules can more readily access the surface of the carbon electrocatalyst and donate electrons. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic effect of acid-treated carbon for AA oxidation reaction is quantitatively evaluated by the determination of activation energy, which has not been assessed prior to this study. In a similar way, nitric acid treatment is also applied to gas diffusion layer (GDL) at the anode side. In addition, Nafion content in anodic electrocatalyst layer, single cell operating temperature, and hot pressing conditions for the fabrication of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) as well as membrane thickness are also optimized.

It has been demonstrated through several research contributions that the electrochemical performance of carbon nanomaterials significantly depends upon their versatile electronic structures and microstructures. These can be precisely tailored by rational defect engineering, heteroatom doping, heterostructure coupling, and pore fabrication, which largely affect the intrinsic nature of active sites and facilitate the ion/electron transfer.

The results showed that CaCO3 shell was formed in vaterite and calcite crystalline phase when emulsifier was sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate and styrene-maleic anhydride (SMA), respectively. When sodium dodecyl sulfate was used as an emulsifier, both vaterite and calcite CaCO3 were formed. The forming mechanism of emulsifier type on CaCO3 crystalline phase was studied. Furthermore, phase-change enthalpy and leakage rate of MEPCMs were related with the type of emulsifier and the pH value of the emulsion. With optimum condition of SMA as emulsifier and pH value of 7, paraffin@CaCO3 MEPCMs had an encapsulation ratio at 56.6% and leakage rate at 2.88%, illustrating its considerable heat storage capability and leakage-prevention property. The 50 heating-cooling cycles test indicated that the MEPCMs owned excellent thermal reliability. The thermal conductivity of MEPCMs was significantly improved due to the existence of CaCO3 shell. In addition to excellent thermal storage ability, the paraffin@CaCO3 MEPCMs also owned good mechanical property and light-to-heat energy conversion efficiency. The characteristics of MEPCMs indicated its potential application in solar energy resource.

Although these hollow nanostructures of compounds can be generated through the processes involving the well-established Kirkendall effect or ion exchange method, a similar process for the synthesis of the pure-substance one (e.g., Si) remains elusive. Inspired by the above two methods, we introduce a continuous ultrathin carbon layer on the silica nano/microstructures (Stöber spheres, diatom frustules, sphere in sphere) as the stable reaction interface. With the layer as the diffusion mediator of the reactants, silica structures are successfully reduced into their porous silicon hollow counterparts with metal Al powder in AlCl3-NaCl molten salt. The structures are composed of silicon nanocrystallites with sizes of 15-25 nm. The formation mechanism can be explained as an etching-reduction/nucleation-growth process. When used as the anode material, the silicon hollow structure from diatom frustules delivers specific capacities of 2179, 1988, 1798, 1505, 1240, and 974 mA h g-1 at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 A g-1, respectively. After being prelithiated, it retains 80% of the initial capacity after 1100 cycles at 8 A g-1. This work provides a general way to synthesize versatile silicon hollow structures for high-performance lithium ion batteries due to the existence of ample silica reactants and can be extended to the synthesis of hollow structures of other materials. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","anode; carbon interface; hollow structures; molten salt; silicon","Aluminum chloride; Controlled drug delivery; Fused salts; Ion exchange; Lithium-ion batteries; Molten materials; Nanostructures; Porous silicon; Silica; Silicon; Sodium chloride; Spheres; Targeted drug delivery; Carbon interface; Energy storage and conversions; High-performance lithium-ion batteries; Hollow nanostructures; Hollow structure; Ion-exchange methods; Molten salt; Silicon nanocrystallites; Anodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056423211

The exploration of anode materials with efficient electron transportation is essential for improving the performance of SIBs. Inspired by the signal transfer mode of a neuron, we designed a composite by stringing MoS2 nanoflower (soma) with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (axons). High-resolution TEM observation reveals a lattice matching growth mechanism of MoS2 nanosheets on the interface of MWCNTs and the lattice expansion of the (002) plane of MoS2. The lattice matching among the MoS2 nanosheet and MWCNT could facilitate electron transfer and structure maintenance upon cycling. The expanded distance of the (002) plane of MoS2 would also promote the sodium-ion intercalation/deintercalation kinetics of the composite. Benefiting from the structural features, when used as an anode material for SIBs, the composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, including high specific capacity, excellent cycle stability, and superior rate capabilities. A stable capacity of 527.7 mAh g-1 can be achieved after 110 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. The neuron-inspired design proposed is a promising and efficient strategy for the development of electrode materials for SIBs with high mass transport kinetics and structural stability. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","anode material; electrochemical performance; hierarchical structure; MoS2/multiwall carbon nanotube; sodium-ion batteries","Anodes; Layered semiconductors; Lithium-ion batteries; Materials handling; Metal ions; Molybdenum compounds; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanosheets; Neurons; Stability; Yarn; Anode material; Electrochemical performance; Electron transportation; Hierarchical structures; High specific capacity; High-resolution TEM; Renewable energy storages; Structural stabilities; Sodium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055266615

NSPILs contain a mixture of proton donors and acceptors and are ideal for this purpose due to their high proton conductivity, high electrochemical stability, low cost, and ease of synthesis. However, the electrolyte proton activity must be controlled carefully in these devices since it greatly influences the kinetics and energetics of the electrode redox reactions and, hence, also impacts battery device performance. In this study, specific NSPILs were designed and evaluated as electrolytes for the all-organic proton battery. The NSPILs were based on either 1,2,4-triazole or 1-methyl-1,2,4-triazole partially protonated with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (TFSI) to produce a range of NSPILs with different degrees of protonation. Both types of NSPIL investigated here exhibited a maximum conductivity of 1.2 S/cm (at 120 and 70 °C, respectively), and the eutectic composition of 1-methyl-1,2,4-triazolium TFSI also had high conductivity at 25 °C (24.9 mS/cm), superior to, e.g., imidazolium TFSI NSPILs. Pulsed field gradient NMR in conjunction with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the conductivity originated mainly from vehicle diffusion and proton hopping. Quinone functionalized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) electrodes exhibited reversible, fast, and stable redox conversion in these electrolytes, and a model is suggested to determine proton activities of NSPILs based on the quinone formal potential. An all-organic proton battery cell was assembled to demonstrate the usefulness of these electrolytes in devices. Fast and complete redox conversion with a cell potential of 0.45 V was demonstrated, even up to scan rates corresponding to 140 C. Compared to the pyridine based electrolytes used for the all-organic proton battery up until now, the present electrolytes display several advantages including lower melting point, lower toxicity, and compatibility with plastic materials. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.","electrolyte; organic batteries; protic ionic liquid; proton activity; proton conductivity","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrodes; Ionic liquids; Proton conductivity; Protonation; Quinone; Redox reactions; Secondary batteries; Electrochemical stabilities; Eutectic composition; Non-stoichiometric; Plastic materials; Poly(3 ,4 ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT); Protic ionic liquids; Proton activity; Pulsed field gradient NMR; Electrolytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064845606

In continuation of the efforts being devoted for effective consumption of iridium, on employing two step facile hydrothermal synthesis, we present a highly effective approach for its best utilization. Anchoring of tiny IrO2 nanoparticles on the surface of well-aligned one-dimensional substrate (Co3O4), at an expense of atomically just 6-7% of iridium in relative to cobalt, showed superb durability in an acidic environment. A durable 20-fold enhanced mass specific activity was observed for the best mixed composite relative to that of IrO2. Moreover, compared to iridium dioxide's Tafel slope of 68.2 mV dec-1 and onset potential of 1.48 V, a quite steeper Tafel slope of 51.2 mV dec-1 and an improvement of 30 mV in onset potential were observed. This outstanding performance is believed to be the synergistic effect of metal cations on account of their electronic modulations as revealed from XPS analysis and due to the experimentally verified importance of one-dimensional nano-rod-shaped assembling of substrate particles. The adopted approach in the current study provides the most effective route for cutting down extensive iridium utilization via synergistic coupling with a nonprecious transition metal, which is vital for the current electrochemical conversion technologies. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.","efficient noble metal utilization; electrocatalytic anode material; iridium dioxide (IrO2); oxygen evolution reaction (OER); water splitting","Anodes; Cobalt compounds; Cobalt deposits; Hydrothermal synthesis; Metal cutting; Nanorods; Precious metals; Substrates; Acidic environment; Anode material; Effective approaches; Electrochemical conversion; Iridium dioxide; Oxygen evolution reaction; Substrate particles; Water splitting; Iridium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064832302

Inspired by the rapid development of biomass-derived hard carbons and heteroatom-doped carbon materials in various areas, a high-temperature sulfurizing method is exploited for the fabrication of sulfur-doped carbon microtubes (S-CMTs). Owing to high sulfur doping (10.2 wt %) and well-developed microporous structure, the as-prepared S-CMTs show a large charge capacity of 532 mAh g-1 at a current rate of 200 mA g-1, outstanding rate capability (234 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1), and exceptional cycling stability (281 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1), values that are superior to those of biomass-derived carbons reported previously.

The thermophysical properties, microstructure and spectroscopic characterization of the CPEP and the thermal and mechanical properties of the TESC were studied. MIP and SEM results show that paraffin mixture PCM is adsorbed uniformly into the pores of expanded perlite treated by hydrochloric acid. The thermal-cycling test results indicate the good thermal stability of CPEP by the cladding of three-layer calcium silicate. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results reveal that the CPEP has phase change temperature and latent heat of 24.58 °C and 88.57 J/g, respectively, and the lower phase change temperature of CPEP compared to paraffin mixture is supported by FT-IR. Moreover, the CPEP was incorporated in cement mortar at 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%, by weight of sand. It is found that the compressive strength of TESC decreases with increasing CPEP content.

The SnO2/PbO nanowires have diameters of 100-300 nm and lengths up to 100 μm and consist mainly of tetragonal rutile SnO2 and PbO. Higher temperatures between 300 and 500 °C resulted in the formation of Pb2O3 and Pb3O4 with monoclinic and orthorhombic crystal structures, but the SnO2/PbO and SnO2/Pb2O3 nanowires had low conductivities of 10-1 S/cm. In contrast, highly conductive SnO2/PbO2 nanowires were obtained by electrodeposition of PbO2 in 0.3 M HNO3 and 1 M Pb(NO3)2 (aq). PbO2 forms a straddling-type heterojunction with SnO2, and the one-dimensional (1D) electron gas distribution is confined in the PbO2 shell for sufficiently thick shells, as shown by the self-consistent solution of the Poisson-Schrödinger equations in the effective mass approximation. The SnO2/PbO2 nanowires exhibit an open-circuit potential of 1.8 V versus C-fiber networks in 5 M H2SO4 (aq) and show symmetric cyclic voltammetry curves, suggesting a suppression of the redox reactions related to SnO2 and a high specific capacity of 206 mAh/g.

Herein an intriguing self-healing liquid dendrite-free Na–K alloy, fabricated by a facile room-temperature alloying process, aiming for application in potassium-ion batteries is reported. Through extensive investigation, its self-healing characteristics are rooted upon a thin solid K2O layer (KOL) coated on the liquid Na–K alloy. The KOL not only acts as a protective layer to prevent the Na–K alloy from making contact with the electrolyte, but also greatly improves the wetting capability and adhesion between the liquid alloy and the carbon matrix (e.g., carbon fiber cloth (CFC)) to form a stable interface. Consequently, the as-prepared CFC/KOL@Na–K alloy anode exhibits prominent electrochemical performance with smaller hysteresis (less than 0.3 V beyond 140 cycles at 0.4 mA cm−2), better capacity retention, and higher Coulombic efficiency than the CFC/bare Na–K alloy counterpart. When coupled with a potassium Prussian blue (PPB) cathode, the full cell manifests higher capability retention and improved cycling stability.

Hierarchical nanoporous γ-Al2O3 is synthesized through a hydrothermal method, followed by sufficient encapsulation of a typical organic liquid electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in EC:DMC). Thus obtained quasi solid electrolyte (QSE) displays combined advantages of the rigid inorganic framework (from solid γ-Al2O3) and high ionic conductivity (from liquid organic electrolyte). Specifically, the QSE affords a conductivity of 1.1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature and behaves a fine lithium ion transference number of 0.62. Inheriting the merits of solid framework, it also exhibits remarkable thermal/mechanical stabilities and a broad electrochemical window up to 5.0 V (vs. Li+/Li). The assembled LiFePO4 (LFP)/QSE/Li cell delivers a high specific capacity of 136.8 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles, with capacity retention of 96.5% at room temperature, which is mainly attributed to the high ionic conductivity and remarkably suppressed Li dendrite growth by the QSE.

Increasing the solid-solution domain by decreasing the particle size offers a promising strategy for enhancing the potassium storage capabilities of insertion anode materials. Extended solid-solution composition range in nanostructured particles is mainly due to the existence of a coherency strain that suppresses phase separation upon intercalation. Here, the intercalation stress effect in size-dependent solid-solution behavior is explored by insertion of K+ into K2Ti6O13 nanowires with different diameters. K2Ti6O13 nanowires with small average diameter of ≈5.5 nm deliver a large initial reversible depotassiated capacity of ≈120 mAh g−1 (deinsertion of ≈2.5 K+) at 0.2 C. The remarkably high reversible depotassiated capacity is mainly ascribed to the decrease of the incoherent interface upon potassiation. The direct observation of enrichment of intragranular particles in potassiated K2Ti6O13 nanowires with average diameter of ≈38 nm provides evidence of strain-accommodating misfits or dislocations in solid-solution intercalation compounds.

The development of innovative electrode materials with excellent electrochemical performances is supposed to be the only way to satisfy the diversified and extended application of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). As anode electrode materials, the active materials of classical intercalation reaction (i.e. graphite) and alloying have been investigated for many years. However, the relative low theoretical capacities and capacity fading limit their application in the next-generation LIBs. Recently, the conversion materials, especially metal hydrides, have been demonstrated to be attractive anode materials for LIBs due to their small polarization, high theoretical capacity and suitable working potential. In this review, we provide a critical overview of various metal hydrides ranging from binary hydrides (MgH2, TiH2, AlH3, etc.) to ternary hydrides (B-, Al- and Mg-based ternary hydrides) that are used as anode materials for LIBs, with the employment of organic liquid electrolyte or solid-state electrolyte. The reaction mechanisms, modification methods and electrochemical performances of these various metal hydrides were discussed in detail. We also discussed the remaining challenges and proposed some suggestions to the emerging research of metal hydrides. We hope that this review can stimulate more extensive and insightful studies for the fabrication and design of new metal hydrides with excellent physical and electrochemical performances. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anode materials; Electrochemical performances; Lithium-ion battery; Metal hydrides; Modification","Aluminum compounds; Anodes; Electrochemical electrodes; Hydrides; Ions; Magnesium compounds; Metal working; Metals; Solid electrolytes; Anode electrode materials; Anode material; Electrochemical performance; Energy storage and conversions; Metal hydrides; Modification; Organic liquid electrolytes; Solid-state electrolyte; Lithium-ion batteries",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050953949

However, the high capacities generate large volume changes, which pulverize the anode material, resulting in poor cycling stability. This restricts its practical applications for SIBs. Here, the dopamine-derived N-doped carbon encapsulating hollow Sn4P3 microspheres (hollow Sn4P3@C) composites are prepared by an in-situ self-polymerization of dopamine on the surface of hollow SnO2 microspheres followed by a carbonization process and a low temperature phosphorization using NaH2PO2 as P source. The results of the structural and morphological characterization can be demonstrated that as-prepared hollow Sn4P3@C composites are constructed by hollow Sn4P3 microspheres with the ultrathin N-doped carbon coating. The as-prepared samples are tested as the anode materials for SIBs. Compared with bared hollow Sn4P3 microspheres, hollow Sn4P3@C composites exhibit better electrochemical sodium storage performance. As a result, hollow Sn4P3@C composites deliver the first discharge and charge specific capacities of 840 and 587 mAh g−1 with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 70% at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. Moreover, hollow Sn4P3@C composites display superior rate capabilities of 555, 438, 339, 239, 157 and 92 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, 0.5 A g−1, 1 A g−1, 2 A g−1, 5 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Meanwhile, hollow Sn4P3@C composites show a high discharge capacity of 372 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after long 200 cycles. A detailed electrochemical kinetic analysis indicates that energy storage for Na+ in Sn4P3 is due to a pseudocapacitive mechanism.

ERC using renewable energies and abandon nuclear/hydroelectric energies can convert CO2 to low-carbon fuels for energy storage and reducing CO2 emission as well as promoting waste (gas) recycling/utilization. One of the challenges is to find high electrochemically active, stable, product-selective and cost-effective catalysts for speeding up the electrode kinetics of ERC. Based on these specific requirements for catalysts, quite few of them are practically promising. In this mini-review paper, we try to give an overview of some important researches and the recent progress in ERC catalysts, focusing on the electrochemical characteristics of Cu-, Sn- and Zn-based catalysts for the efficient ERC. The catalysts reviewed in this paper include single pure metal, metal oxide, metal alloys and metal complexes. In recent years, more and more catalysts with novel nanostructures have been reported, such as those with shell-core structure, which exhibit desirable electrocatalytic performance. Moreover, carbon materials, such as carbon nanotube (CNT) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), have also been explored as desirable catalyst supports in lab-scale studies. In the most recent years, more attention is moved on the fine crystal structures of catalysts, which are found to be quite critical for achieving desirable product selectivity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 electroreduction; Cu-; Electrodes; Sn-; Zn-based catalysts","Carbon dioxide; Carbon nanotubes; Copper; Copper compounds; Cost effectiveness; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Fuel storage; Graphene; Metal complexes; Metals; Temperature; Tin; Tin compounds; Yarn; Zinc compounds; Electro reduction; Electrocatalytic performance; Electrochemical characteristics; Electrochemical reductions; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Reducing co2 emissions; Shell-core structures; Zn-based catalysts; Catalyst selectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044327932

Unfortunately, the unstable interface between lithium and nonaqueous electrolyte induces dendritic Li and low Coulombic efficiency during repeated Li plating/stripping, which is one of the huge obstacles toward practical lithium-metal batteries. Here, a composite mixed ionic/electronic conductor interphase (MCI) is formed on the surface of Li by in situ chemical reactions of a copper-fluoride-based solution and Li metal at room temperature. The as-obtained MCI film acts like the armor of a soldier to protect the Li-metal anode by its prioritized lithium storage, high ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus. The armored MCI can effectively suppress Li-dendrite growth and work effectively in LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2/Li cells. The armored MCI presents fresh insights into the formation and regulation of the stable electrode–electrolyte interface and an effective strategy to protect Li-metal anodes in working Li-metal batteries. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Volumetric absorption solar collectors (VASC) can overcome this problem through directly absorbing solar energy by nanofliud with excellent optical absorption property. Nano-encapsulated phase change material (NPCM) is a kind of novel composite PCMs widely adopted in thermal energy storage system. The NPCM slurry (NPCS) has great potential to be used in VASC since it can be used as both the heat transfer fluid and energy storage medium. In the present study, a numerical model based on the Eulerian-Eulerian approach is built to investigate the heat transfer characteristics of NPCS in a parallel plate channel for volumetric absorption of solar energy. Influences of different parameters such as the extinction coefficient, flow velocity, radiative intensity on the performance of collector are studied through the numerical simulation. The results indicate that the NPCS shows better performance in the VASC compared with the conventional nanofluids without phase change.

Then, flame-retardant nanoencapsulated n-octadecane (NanoC18) with PNDA-modified melamine-formaldehyde (MF) as shell was fabricated via in situ polymerization. n-Octadecane was successfully encapsulated in the PNDA-modified MF polymer shell and the diameter of NanoC18 ranged within 80-140 nm, as evidenced by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The thermal property and flame retardancy of NanoC18 were researched by thermogravimetric (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), cone calorimetry measurement, and limiting oxygen index (LOI) test. DSC analysis indicated that NanoC18 exhibited a relatively high phase change enthalpy within the range of 110.8-141.3 J/g. The results of the combustion test indicated that the introduction of the phosphorus-nitrogen containing PNDA into NanoC18 considerably increased the LOI and residual weight of EP/NanoC18 composites, as well as suppressed the release of heat and smoke. Moreover, the thermal properties, thermal stability, and durability of NanoC18 were barely changed upon PNDA introduction into NanoC18. This nanoencapsulated n-octadecane with an excellent phase change properties and flame-retardant properties exhibits considerable potential for energy saving construction, thermoregulated textile and other thermal energy storage applications. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","Flame-retardant; Melamine-formaldehyde resin; n-Octadecane; Nanoencapsulation; Thermal energy storage","Amines; Calorimeters; Combustion; Dehydration; Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy conservation; Fabrication; Flame retardants; Formaldehyde; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Heat storage; Hybrid materials; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Smoke; Thermal energy; Thermodynamic properties; Dehydration reactions; Fabrication and characterizations; Flame retardant properties; In-situ polymerization; Limiting Oxygen Index; N-octadecane; Nano-encapsulation; Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM); Melamine formaldehyde resins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056268309

Although great efforts have been devoted, nearly all evolved carbons are intrinsically amorphous and dense, which is adverse to ions diffusions, electrons transfer, and actives utilization for battery usage. Herein, by selecting common hair waste as the example material, we propose a smart catalytic engineering protocol to make graphitic, porous, and multiheteroatom co-doped carbon microtube anodes for sustained Li-ion batteries. The Ni-based nanofilm matrix evenly immobilized on all hair surface plays a key role in the rapid graphitization of hair and the formation of deep pores. Such evolved carbons with unique functionalized properties can well make up for the shortcomings of hair-carbonized products, exhibiting far superior anodic behaviors on reversible capacity/actives utilization efficiency, cyclic stability/endurance (no capacity fading in 1000 cycles), and rate capabilities. The full cell testing furthermore justifies their great potential usage in Li-ion batteries.

Overall water splitting and zinc air systems are promising energy conversion and storage means, but need high-performance, low-cost, and highly stable bifunctional electrocatalysts to hydrogen evolution/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) and OER/oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), respectively. Herein we develop a facile method to fabricate CoMn double hydroxide (DH) hollow spheres as high-performance trifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting and zinc-air battery. The outmost surfaces of the CoMn DH hollow spheres are composed of ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 2.5 nm. Owing to the hollow and ultrathin features, CoMn DH hollow spheres exhibit excellent activities and robust stabilities toward HER, OER, and ORR. The overall water electrolyzer assembled with the CoMn DH hollow spheres can drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of merely 420 mV in 1.0 M KOH, among the best reported metal oxides and hydroxides. Remarkably, each all-solid-state Zn air battery with the optimized CoMn DH hollow spheres air-cathode exhibited good cycling stability. Furthermore, two all-solid-state Zn air batteries in series can power 55 red LED and the two-electrode electrolyzer catalyzed by the optimized CoMn DH hollow spheres with excellent operation stabilities. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","Double hydroxides; Trifunctional catalysts; Water splitting; Zn air battery","Binary alloys; Cobalt alloys; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electrolytic cells; Energy conversion; Hydrogen storage; Manganese alloys; Nanosheets; Potassium hydroxide; Secondary batteries; Solid state lasers; Spheres; Bifunctional electrocatalysts; Double hydroxides; Energy conversion and storages; Energy storage and conversions; Hierarchical hollow spheres; Operation stability; Ultrathin nanosheets; Water splitting; Zinc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055128189

Based on a one-dimensional model, both the thermal conduction and phase change within the PCM plate in the direction normal to the flow direction of heat transfer fluid (HTF) are taken into consideration in the this study. The proposed model is validated against the reported results and the numerical results calculated by a commercial CFD software. Then, the proposed model is used to simulate the cyclic charging and discharging processes of the FPTES with PCM. In addition, the influence of the cut-off values, HTF mass flow rate, and flat plate length and thickness on the charging efficiency and capacity ratio are investigated. The results show that the charging and discharging processes reach a repeatable state after several cycles, and the repeatable cycle is very different from the first cycle. The capacity ratio and the charging/discharging time increase with the cut-off values. An optimum charging cut-off value exists to achieve the highest charging efficiency. Extending the flat plate length helps to increase the capacity ratio and charging efficiency. Besides, the decreases in HTF mass flow rate and plate thickness can increase the charging efficiency and capacity ratio.

Moreover, even at an extremely high current density of 2400 mA g−1, it delivers a capacity of 134 mAh g−1 and remains at 76 mAh g−1 after 1500 cycles, which surpasses most reported layered transition metal oxide cathode materials.

The optimization approach was developed based on a genetic algorithm approach coupled with numerical simulation and was aimed at maximizing the equivalent hot water output during the discharging process. Validated two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations were used to support the genetic algorithm optimization process and to accurately investigate the thermal performance of the optimal circuitry arrangement. The results showed that adding more connections near the outlet side of the phase change material heat exchanger could lengthen the flow path in the high temperature zone, which was beneficial for a high mass flow rate condition of 1.68 kg min−1 with a 5% increment. Under medium and low mass flow rates of 1.2 kg min−1 and 0.5 kg min−1, a 3% increment and a 6% decrement, respectively, were observed. It was found that different mass flow rates require their own optimal circuitry arrangements, and the arranged rules were not necessarily the same. Therefore, circuitry arrangement optimization should be performed according to the operating flow rate or designed range to maximize the optimization effect.

Shape-stabilized composite PCMs could efficiently solve their leakage problem during the solid-liquid phase change process, which have been widely used and extensively reviewed in literature. However, those reviews mainly focused on microencapsulated PCMs and the broad properties and applications of composite PCMs but paid little attention to the nanoporous shape-stabilized composite PCMs. The nanoporous shape-stabilized composite PCMs do solve the leakage problem and show excellent chemical stability and thermal cycling stability, but most of their enthalpy values were much lower than that of the pure PCMs component. So in this review we have highlighted recent progress in the research of nanoporous shape-stabilized PCMs, such as the design concept of porous support, fabrication and characterization techniques, and especially the nanoconfinement effects of the porous support on the thermal properties of the PCMs confined in the nanopores. Finally, we have provided a brief outlook of the future challenges and potential prospects of nanoporous shape-stabilized composite PCMs. This review paper will help to explore and develop better nanoporous shape-stabilized composite PCMs for practical applications and offer basic understanding of nanoconfinement effects on thermal properties. © 2018","Crystallization behaviors; Nanoconfinement effects; Shape-stabilized composite PCMs; Thermal properties","Chemical stability; Crystallization; Economics; Heat storage; Phase change materials; Thermodynamic properties; Crystallization behavior; Fabrication and characterizations; Future challenges; Mismatch problems; Nanoconfinement effects; Shape-stabilized; Solid liquid phase change; Thermal cycling stabilities; Problem solving",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053827955

However, the poor cycle life and low sulfur utilization originating from the shuttling process involving lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) significantly hinder the practical application of Li-S battery. Various approaches have been introduced to retard the shuttle of LiPSs. Herein, a polar cobalt disulfide embedded in porous nitrogen doped carbon frameworks (CoS2-N-C) is synthesized from a single metal-organic framework ZIF-67.

More importantly, the electrochemical reaction kinetics is greatly improved. As a result, the Li-S battery based on the S/CoS2-N-C electrode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1288 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and a superior long cycle life for 500 cycles with a degradation rate as low as 0.064% per cycle at 1 C rate.

In this paper, a flexible and compressible bioanode with the features of integration of electricity generation and energy storage in MFCs was reported. With sponge skeleton as the substrate, this bioanode has been coated with carbon nanotubes and graphene, and then aniline has been polymerized on it. Compared with a carbon nanotube-sponge electrode, the charge transfer impedance of the polyaniline composite bioanode decreases from 26.6 to 4.67 ohm, and the maximum power density increases from 259.7 to 571.5 mW m−2; meanwhile, with the charge–discharge time of 60–60 min, the stored charge increases by 4.7 times, and the steady current density increases by 6.2 times. These results can be ascribed to a synergistic effect of some factors including the great specific surface area and distinct macroporous architecture of the sponge substrate, the effect of two carbon nanomaterials on decreasing the bioanode resistance, the energy storage characteristic of polyaniline, and the good biocompatibility of coating materials.

However, due to the dendritic sodium formation as well as high chemical reactivity with electrolyte, it still has safety issues and poor cyclability, which have severely impeded the practicability of sodium metal technology. Therefore, it is important for the advanced sodium metal batteries to construct the stable dendrite-free sodium metal anode. In recent years, considerable efforts have been directed towards solving these problems, including sodium-electrode framework design, organic electrolyte modification, sodium-metal interface protection. Furthermore, solid-state electrolytes have an advantage over the liquid electrolytes and are considered to constitute safe solid sodium metal batteries so as to prohibit problematic sodium dendrites.

However, the solar energy utilization efficiency of traditional microcapsulated PCMs is still not very high up to date. In this work, new core@shell structured paraffin@SiO2/Ti4O7 composite microcapsules were developed to harvest environmental full-spectrum sunlight by smart and rational design using a sol-gel method. The SiO2 shell not only prevented the leakage of paraffine, but also improves its thermal conductivity. The black 300 nm Ti4O7 particles, which were successfully embedded into the SiO2 shell, can achieve the efficient absorption of sunlight and simultaneously high conversion from light to thermal. The resultant paraffin@SiO2/Ti4O7 microcapsules retained most enthalpy of paraffin, increased its stability, and exhibited an excellent thermal energy storage performance. The thermal conductivity of paraffin@SiO2/Ti4O7 microcapsules was significantly enhanced by 334.87% (1.322 W m−1 K−1) compared with 0.304 W m−1 K−1 of one for paraffin. When the mass fraction of Ti4O7 nanoparticles is 3 wt% of paraffin, these paraffin@SiO2/Ti4O7 microcapsules exhibited remarkable 85.36% of photo-thermal storage efficiency compared with 24.14% of one for paraffin. Due to their huge superiority of high efficient use of abundant solar energy in natural resources, these new photo-driven PCMs are very promising materials for solar-to-thermal conversion and energy storage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Microencapsulated phase change materials; Photo-thermal conversion; Thermal energy storage; Ti4O7 nanoparticles","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Microencapsulation; Microstructure; Nanoparticles; Paraffins; Silica; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; High conversions; High efficient; Microcapsules; Microencapsulated phase change material; Photo-thermal; Photo-thermal conversions; Rational design; Thermal conversion; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053462644

However, attainment of a long cycle life and fast Na+ storage kinetics are still needed to enable their practical application. Co0.85Se nanosheets prepared using a simple hydrothermal method exhibit a hierarchical porous structure, which is conducive to fast electrolyte transport and rapid adsorption of Na+ ions. Herein, to improve the electronic conductivity of Co0.85Se, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is introduced to construct a three-dimensional network and achieve fast electronic transport. This defect-controlled Co0.85Se@rGO anode exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 460 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Outstanding durability and remarkable rate stability are also achieved via the synergistic effects of vacancy transport and the heterostructure between Co0.85Se and rGO. Furthermore, the Na+ insertion/extraction mechanism is systematically investigated using ex situ X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and a series of electrochemical analyses. These analyses enable detailed characterization of the ionic diffusion kinetics and corresponding components and structural changes. Finally, a first-principles approach is employed to determine the diffusion energy barrier of Na+ ions in perfect CoSe and defective Co0.85Se. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Anodes; Conductive network; Defect-controlling; Selenides; Sodium-ion batteries","Anodes; Cobalt compounds; Defects; Electrolytes; Graphene; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Kinetics; Metal ions; Nanosheets; Selenium compounds; Sodium compounds; Conductive networks; Diffusion energy barriers; Fast electronic transport; First-principles approaches; Hierarchical porous structures; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Selenides; Three-dimensional networks; Sodium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053201876

Developing a negative electrode material with high specific capacity and excellent cyclic stability is one of the most pressing problems for sodium-ion batteries. Herein, nitrogen and phosphorous dual-doped graphene aerogel (NPGA) is fabricated via a low temperature phosphidation of NH2-rich graphene aerogel precursor. Expanded interlayer spacing of 0.39 nm and high content of pyridinic-N are obtained in this architecture. These features lead to high sodium storage performance of NPGA, however, in a wide potential range. A large reversible capacity of 330 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1, and good rate capability of 218 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 189 mAh g−1 at 3 A g−1 can be achieved in the potential range from 0.005 to 3.0 V (vs. Na/Na+). Moreover, it delivers ultra-stable capacities of 195 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles and 132 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 2000 cycles. It should be underlined that in practice only half of this capacity values could be utilized in Na-ion accumulators, i.e., the capacity supplied from 0.005 to 1.5 V (vs. Na/Na+). The attractive electrochemical performance should be ascribed to the remarkable capacitive contribution. This strategy would be readily applied to construct high-performance carbonaceous anodes for sodium-ion batteries and/or electrochemical capacitors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Aerogels; Anodes; Electrochemical electrodes; Graphene; Lithium-ion batteries; Metal ions; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Temperature; Capacitive response; Electrochemical capacitor; Electrochemical performance; Energy storage applications; High specific capacity; Interlayer spacings; Negative electrode material; Storage performance; Sodium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053081232

In this study, a bi-level optimization methodology is proposed to optimize a combined desalination and standalone CCHP system, which is assumed as installed on a remote South China Sea island. The traversing method and branch-and-bound method are used for solving the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization problem at the design and operation stages, respectively. The results indicate that the economic and environmental objectives determine the system configuration with the minimum and maximum capacity of each component. As the system configuration changes, the system energy efficiency exhibits a consistent change tendency with the carbon dioxide emission generally. It is also observed that the capacity of the electrical storage system (ESS) is no larger than that of the thermal storage system (TSS) because of the relative high cost-performance ratio of the ESS.

The structures of these ionic compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and FT-IR. The thermal stability was determined by TGA; the melting temperature, heat of fusion and heat capacity were investigated by DSC for the synthetic ionic compounds.

An enabling Battery Management System holds the key for efficient and reliable system operation, in which State-of-Charge (SOC) estimation and State-of-Health (SOH) monitoring are of particular importance. In this paper, an SOC and SOH co-estimation scheme is proposed based on the fractional-order calculus. First, a fractional-order equivalent circuit model is established and parameterized using a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm/Particle Swarm Optimization method. This model is capable of predicting the voltage response with a root-mean-squared error less than 10 mV under various driving-cycle-based tests. Comparative studies show that it improves the modeling accuracy appreciably from its second-and third-order counterparts. Then, a dual fractional-order extended Kalman filter is put forward to realize simultaneous SOC and SOH estimation. Extensive experimental results show that the maximum steady-state errors of SOC and SOH estimation can be achieved within 1%, in the presence of initial deviation, noise, and disturbance. The resilience of the co-estimation scheme against battery aging is also verified through experimentation. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Batteries; estimator design; fractional-order calculus; state of charge; state of health","Calculations; Charging (batteries); Circuit simulation; Equivalent circuits; Estimation; Genetic algorithms; Health; Kalman filters; Lithium-ion batteries; Mathematical models; Mean square error; Smart power grids; Solar cells; Adaptation models; Fractional-order calculus; Integrated circuit modeling; State of charge; State of health; Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051648425

First, the stability of Si-CLs deposited on various N-doped graphene (N-G) sheets has been investigated, and their electronic properties have been explored using first-principles theory. Second, single and multiple lithium (Li) atoms adsorption on Si-CLs anchored in N-G have been carried out to test the Li storage performances of the hybrids. Our results confirm that the N-doped pyridinic graphene hybrid is the most suitable materials for Li adsorption among those three different structural graphene sheets. Due to the symmetric vacancy presence, the binding strength of Si-CLs on N-doped defective graphene (N-DG) is much more powerful than that of graphitic one. Furthermore, the Li uptaking ability of Si/graphene (Si-G) is studied by calculating the binding energy of Li atoms.

However, irreversible spinel phases formed at the MnO2 electrode limits its cyclability. A viable solution to overcome this inactive phase is to use an aqueous ZnSO4-based electrolyte, where pH is mildly acidic leading to a different reaction mechanism. Most importantly, the addition of MnSO4 achieves excellent cyclability. How accessible Mn2+ ions in the electrolyte enhances the reversibility is presented. With added Mn2+, the capacity retention is significantly improved over 100 cycles. Zn2+ insertion plays an important role on the reversibility and a hydrated layered Zn-buserite structure formed during charge is reported. Furthermore, Zn4SO4(OH)6 · 5H2O precipitates during discharge but is not involved in the electrochemical reaction. This precipitate both buffers the pH and partly insulates the surface. Described in operando study show how the phase transformations and the failure mechanisms depend on the presence of Mn2+-ions in the electrolyte.

A concept of inverting the cavity at different stages during the melting process is proposed as a possible method for thermal behaviors enhancement in the latent heat thermal energy storage with PCM. The enthalpy-porosity model is employed to account for the corresponding phase change process and flow evolution at the PCM solid-liquid interface, and the numerical model is validated by the existing data in the literature. It is confirmed that inverting the cavity is an effective method to improve the PCM thermal behaviors, and the maximum ∼24.3% increase of the liquid fraction during the PCM melting process for the best case of inverting at 40% standard unit hour. On the other hand, the cavity inverted is also a simple technique to enhance the solid-liquid phase-change melting heat transfer as compared to the available techniques reviewed. Furthermore, the concluded way is also suggested to incline the PCM cavity by a few degrees if a full inversion is not available in some situations.

However, uneven deposition, large volume change, and dendrite growth during Na plating/stripping process severely restrict its feasibility for energy storage devices. Here we propose a copper nanowire-reinforced three-dimensional (3D) Cu foam current collector (CuNW-Cu) to achieve highly reversible Na storage. The in-situ growth of Cu nanowires can provide abundant active nucleation sites and reduce the local electric current by increasing surface area of the current collector, leading to homogeneous Na deposition. The Na metal anode can run for more than 1400 h (350 cycles) on CuNW-Cu with a low thickness variation of 2% and a stable voltage hysteresis of 25 mV. Moreover, controllable Na loading ranging from 2 to 12 mA h cm−2 can be plated into CuNW-Cu with a long steady life-span over 1000 h and a high Coulombic efficiency over 97.5% owing to the synergistic effect between copper nanowires and interconnected 3D porous Cu foam, which delivers an excellent compatibility for cathodes with different areal loadings.

Accurately forecasting battery state of health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) plays an important role in ensuring reliable system operation and minimizing maintenance costs. This paper is, thus, concerned with online short-term SOH estimation and long-term RUL prediction using Brownian motion (BM) based degradation model and particle filtering (PF). The proposed model tackles the capacity degradation as the traveling distance of a Brownian particle in a given time interval. Then, the PF is used to estimate the drift parameter of the BM. This framework leads an accurate short-term SOH estimation result and gives a clear explanation for long-term RUL prediction because the first hitting time of BM follows the inverse Gaussian distribution. The predictive capability and effectiveness of the method are demonstrated by degradation datasets from different types of lithium-ion batteries.

Recently, a large amount of research papers have reported about the application of transition metal sulfides in lithium ion batteries. However, the practical application of transition metal sulfides is still impeded by their fast capacity fading and poor rate performance. More well-focused researches should be operated towards the commercialization of transition metal sulfides in lithium ion batteries. In this review, recent development of using transition metal sulfides such as copper sulfides, molybdenum sulfides, cobalt sulfides, and iron sulfides as electrode materials for lithium ion batteries is presented. In addition, the electrochemical reaction mechanisms and synthetic strategy of transition metal sulfides are briefly summarized. The critical issues, challenges, and perspectives providing a further understanding of the associated electrochemical processes are also discussed. © 2018 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Anode; Lithium ion battery; Transition metal sulfides","Anodes; Cobalt compounds; Copper compounds; Electric discharges; Ions; Iron compounds; Molybdenum compounds; Sulfur compounds; Transition metals; Electrochemical process; Electrochemical reactions; Electrode material; Energy storage systems; Molybdenum sulfide; Synthetic strategies; Theoretical capacity; Transition metal sulfides; Lithium-ion batteries",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043278134

This paper provides a better solution by replacing the internal combustion engine of a PHEV with a small-size photovoltaic (PV) module located on the roof of the PHEV, and a micro wind turbine located in front of the PHEV, behind the condenser of the air conditioning system. Thus, this study proposes a novel battery/PV/wind hybrid power source to be utilized in PHEVs. The power source equipped with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology is composed of a 19.2-kWh Lithium (Li)-ion battery used as the main energy storage device, and a PV module and a wind energy conversion system. A prototype of the battery/PV/wind hybrid power source has been constructed and utilized in a PHEV. Experimental verifications are presented that demonstrate utilizing the PV module and micro wind turbine adds 19.6 km to the cruising range of a PHEV with the weight of 1880 kg during two sunny days, and provides higher power efficiency (91.2%) and speed (121 km/h).

In this work, a highly porous carbon/tin sulfide aerogel with a ""skeleton/skin"" morphology (SSC@SnS2) has been developed and further used as a binder-free anode for SIBs. This SSC@SnS2 electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 612 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, a good rate capability, and a long-term cycling stability up to 1000 times with an average Coulombic efficiency of ∼99.9%. Meanwhile, this SSC@SnS2 aerogel also achieves a stable cycling performance even at a high current density up to 5.0 A g-1. The fast-yet-stable sodium ion storage performance of the prepared SSC@SnS2 aerogel can be ascribed to the reasons that (i) the carbon nanofiber/graphene skeleton provides unimpeded pathways for the rapid transfer of electrons; (ii) thin SnS2 skin with nonaggregated morphology can provide a great number of active sites for sodium ion storage; (iii) the porous structure of the SSC@SnS2 aerogel ensures a rapid penetration of electrolyte and can further accommodate the volume expansion of active SnS2 nanoflakes; and (iv) the intermediate product of Na15Sn4 alloy contributes greatly to the sodium ion storage performance of the SSC@SnS2 aerogel.

High specific capacity and suitable working potential anode materials are one of the keys to search for future developments. Here, a novel and stable sodium titanate/carbon-black phosphorus (NTO/C-BP) hybrids are first fabricated as a promising anode material for advanced sodium-ion batteries. Under the protection of argon (Ar) atmosphere, the direct high-energy mechanical milling of the BP nanoparticle and NTO/C results in the formation of NTO/C-BP hybrids. In other words, the BP nanoparticle can be interconnected with bare NTO by P-O-Ti bonds and/or form stable P-C bonds with the carbon coating layer on the surface of NTO. The NTO/C-BP hybrids are not only beneficial for enhancing specific capacity but also have a great protective effect on the exposure of BP to air by the synergistic effect between BP and NTO/C. The results show that the NTO/C-BP hybrids can deliver very high specific capacity (∼225 mA h g-1 after 55 cycles at 20 mA g-1, ∼183 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1).

However, their commercialization is restricted by their inherent drawbacks such as low initial coulombic efficiency, modest cycling performance and poor rate capability. To overcome these problems, we have proposed an construction strategy of a spinel-embedded and Li 3 PO 4 modified Li[Li 0.2 Mn 0.54 Ni 0.13 Co 0.13 ]O 2 oxides through a facile wet chemical deposition route. During the modification process, Li + in the pristine could be partially exchanged by H + concomitant with the chemical deposition of Li 3 PO 4 . After a low-temperature calcination process, the spinel structure is formed accompanied with the extraction of H + and the interaction between Li 3 PO 4 coating layer and the surface of pristine particles was enhanced. The as-designed structure is characterized by Raman spectra, Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). The practical results confirm that the capacity retentions and rate capability are significantly improved after such modification. The modified sample delivers much higher capacity retention of 83.57% after 150 cycles at 1C rate compared with 70.44% for bare material. Our facile modification approach combines the advantage of spinel phase and Li-ion conductor Li 3 PO 4 particles.

It can improve resource utilisation and the flexibility of power grid operation through the effective regulation. However, the degree of residential air conditioning to participate in demand response is affected by the outdoor temperature, users' comfort settings, thermal storage and insulation properties of buildings. Moreover, the difficulty of assessing the demand response potential is further increased by the uncertainty of the influencing factors. To guide the residential air conditioners to participate in the power grid operation, the aggregated air conditioner model is established to describe the relationship among the total power, the external environment, and the indoor temperature.

Improving the conductivity of sulfur cathode and stabilizing the polysulfide shuttle are the key factors for obtaining high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, metallic and polar TiB2 nanomaterials are applied for the first time as sulfur hosts. The 70S/TiB2 composite exhibits a long-term cycling stability up to 500 cycles at the current density of 1 C. It is worth noting that even when the sulfur areal mass loading is up to 3.9 mg cm-2, a stable capacity of 837 mA h g-1 can be still maintained after 100 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical performance can be attributed to the strong anchoring effect of TiB2 to lithium polysulfides, which is confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculations with a favorable surface-passivated chemistry.

However, the deficiencies such as low activity and high cost of the electrocatalysts at anodes greatly hinder their commercialization. The commonly used carbon black supports lack the capacity of regulation over the supported noble metals towards efficient electro-catalytic oxidation of fuels. In this Mini-Review, the prerequisite factors in advanced supports are outlined, ranging from self-supported precious metal alloys as well as non-noble metal materials, while simultaneously revealing the superiorities of some advanced supports beyond carbon black in terms of electronic conductivity, synergy with surface precious metals, chemical and electrochemical stability, and other possible interactions. The effects arisen from microscopic morphology, nano-structure, and composition on the electrocatalytic activity/stability are also discussed. Finally, several of the most promising supports are highlighted, and the research trends of synergistic supports in future PEFCs are predicted. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In addition, flexible solid-state iron anode-based rechargeable batteries with distinctive counter electrode coupling are quite lacking. Herein, an interesting “carbon glue” penetration strategy toward Fe3O4 nanorod film anode is proposed. This design not only immobilizes the nanorods and maintains strong adhesion with the current collector but also ensures continuous electrically conductive pathway, resulting in dramatically increased stability (≈99% capacity retention after 1000 cycles) and excellent rate performance (1.2 min charging with ≈70.6% initial capacity kept). By pairing with a new-type Ni0.49Cu0.51O nanowire array cathode, a unique 1.2 V flexible rechargeable nickel–copper//iron alkaline battery is further assembled, which stores energy based on redox electrochemistry of transition metal ions. It delivers high volumetric energy and power densities (7.21 mWh cm−3; 299.30 mW cm−3), and demonstrates outstanding stability up to 5000 cycles. In particular, with the utilization of quasi-solid-state electrolyte, the device still maintains good performance upon substantially bending and twisting. This work presents a new concept to design high stability iron anode-based alkaline batteries and further pushes forward the development of emerging flexible energy storage systems. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, a lack of promising anode materials still hinders the development of SIBs technology. Herein, we for the first time report a new one-dimensional tunnel-structure anode material, Na1.68H0.32Ti2O3SiO4·1.76H2O, for SIBs. This material can deliver a reversible capacity of 110 mAh g-1 at a current density of 20 mA g-1 and with an average working voltage of 0.4 V vs Na+/Na. The structure changes of this material during discharge/charge processes were investigated by using in situ laboratory X-ray diffraction. The results indicated that sodium insertion proceeds via a topotactic intercalation pathway. We also identified predehydration as an effective avenue to further improve the capacity of Na1.68H0.32Ti2O3SiO4·1.76H2O anode (reversible capacity of 131 mAh g-1 at a current density of 20 mA g-1 after the predehydration process).

In this report, novel FeOx nanoarrays were directly constructed on three-dimensional (3D) copper foam current collector (denoted as CF@FeOx NAs) via facile hydrothermal growth followed by a postannealing process. The nanoarrays were stacked by numerous FeOx porous nanoblocks, exhibiting a unique hierarchical structure. The loading density of FeOx in the CF@FeOx NAs reached 2.5 mg cm-2 owing to the hierarchical structure of the novel 3D nanoarray electrode. When tested as an anode for LIBs, the 3D integrated electrode delivered high areal capacities of 3.33 and 2.61 mAh cm-2 at 0.25 and 1.25 mA cm-2, respectively. A high areal capacity of 2.12 mAh cm-2 was retained at 2.5 mA cm-2 after 500 cycles, which is the best electrochemical performance in terms of areal capacity for the iron oxide-based electrodes reported so far. Even at a higher current density of 12.5 mA cm-2, the areal capacity was still maintained at 0.96 mAh cm-2, demonstrating good rate capability. A lithium full cell test was also conducted using LiNi0.8Co0.05Al0.15 (NCA) as a cathode and the CF@FeOx NAs as an anode, which exhibited a good areal capacity of 0.94 mAh cm-2 at 2.5 mA cm-2 after 50 cycles.

Lithium nitrate (LiNO3) is widely applied as an effective additive in ether electrolyte to increase the interfacial stability in batteries containing lithium metal anodes. However, because of its poor solubility LiNO3 is rarely utilized in the high-voltage window provided by carbonate electrolyte. Dissolution of LiNO3 in carbonate electrolyte is realized through an effective solvation regulation strategy. LiNO3 can be directly dissolved in an ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate electrolyte mixture by adding trace amounts of copper fluoride as a dissolution promoter. LiNO3 protects the Li metal anode in a working high-voltage Li metal battery. When a LiNi0.80Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathode is paired with a Li metal anode, an extraordinary capacity retention of 53 % is achieved after 300 cycles (13 % after 200 cycles for LiNO3-free electrolyte) and a very high average Coulombic efficiency above 99.5 % is achieved at 0.5 C.

However, little is known about the relationships between vacancy feature and lithium (Li) storage behaviors of inorganic materials. Here, we discovered that the types and abundance of atom vacancies on anode materials strongly affect their Li storage performance. By comparing the Li storage performance between two hematite (α-Fe2O3) cubes with similar morphology but different predominant vacancies and applying the density functional theory computations on the Li-ion diffusion rate and substitution energy of Fe ions by Li ions, we show that the vacancies, in particular the large size vacancies on the surface of anode materials, could effectively reduce the barriers of Li-ion diffusion and decrease the substitution energy of Fe ions. This new finding may advance the design and development of novel anode materials with excellent performance for Li-ion batteries. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Anodes; Density functional theory; Hematite; Ions; Lithium-ion batteries; Anode material; Design and Development; Enhanced efficiency; Inorganic materials; Ion diffusion; Ion-diffusion rate; Physical and chemical properties; Vacancy associates; Storage (materials)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054879416

The biggest challenge regarding the application of the Li–S battery is to suppress the polysulfide shuttle while maintaining a high sulfur loading mass. Here, a dual polysulfide confinement strategy is designed by confinement of sulfur in polydopamine-coated MXene nanosheets (denoted as S@Mxe@PDA) that performs as a high-performance cathode for Li–S cells owing to their inherently high underlying metallic conductivity and chemical bonding and strong chemical adsorption to lithium polysulfides (LPs). This dual LPs confinement strategy is supported by the results of density functional theory calculations. It is demonstrated that the S@Mxe@PDA cathode exhibits outstanding electrochemical properties, including high reversible capacity (1044 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles at 0.2 C), superior rate capability (624 mAh g−1 at 6 C) and excellent cycling stability (556 mAh g−1 after 330 cycles at 0.5 C with 4.4 mg cm−2 sulfur loading).

Harvesting and utilization of these energies require efficient and low cost energy conversion and storage devices, whose performance essentially depends on the properties of the electrode materials. The properties of materials are greatly affected by synthesis methods and can be tuned by chemical modifications. Many approaches have therefore been developed toward this end. Among them, plasma has attracted increasing attention because of its great efficacy in producing and modifying materials under mild conditions.

This study proposes an optimal design methodology for MH heat storage reactors (MHHSRs), integrating the optimal design principle (ODP) and a new design procedure. Based on the optimal design methodology, the design of the powder bed with helical heat transfer fluid (HTF) tube is conducted via numerical simulation. A mathematical model is established for the thermal coupling between the powder bed and the HTF tube. The gravimetric exergy-output rate (GEOR) is adopted to evaluate the overall discharging performance. First, the helical HTF tube is optimized and improved based on the ODP, which increase the GEOR from 198.4 to 255.4 W kg−1. The optimal helical diameter is 30 mm and the optimal improved structure is determined as a U-shaped double helical tube. Then, the structural improvement of the reaction bed is supplemented, achieving reductions of material and energy consumption by 12.2% and 11%, respectively. The final design of the powder bed with helical tube based on optimal design methodology improves the GEOR from 198.4 to 306.1 W kg−1, which constitutes a significant increase of 54.3%. This optimal design methodology is validated and efficiently guides the design of advanced MHHSRs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Improvement of reaction bed; Metal hydride reactor; Optimal design methodology; Reductions of material and energy consumption; Thermochemical heat storage","Energy utilization; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Hydrides; Optimal systems; Powder metals; Storage (materials); Structural optimization; Traveling wave tubes; Tubes (components); Exergy output rate; Improved structures; Improvement of reaction bed; Metal hydrides; Optimal design; Structural improvements; Thermal coupling; Thermo-chemical heat storages; Structural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051674493

The use of phase change materials in a building envelope can improve heat storage capacity and the thermal behavior of the wall. However, the small thermal conductivity of the phase change materials slows down the process of heat absorption and release. The present study suggests a new technical solution for improvement of thermal behavior of a phase change material plasterboards. It consists of perforating the panel with several small holes yielding a greater contact surface area with the surrounding air. This passive enhancement technique is implemented experimentally and numerically to check its performance. Results show that the perforated panels produces an augmentation in heat absorption and release. The average increase was 100% for heat absorption and 175% for heat release as compared to a standard panel without holes. In addition, a perforated panel with a given thickness can absorb heat as much as a standard panel three to four times thicker. Furthermore, it was found that the absorbed and released heat flux values have a direct relationship with the ratio of the panel thickness to the holes spacing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ansys Fluent; Heat absorption; Heat release; PCM; Phase change materials; Plasterboard","Heat flux; Heat storage; Pulse code modulation; Thermal conductivity; Ansys Fluent; Contact surface area; Heat absorption; Heat release; Heat storage capacity; Microencapsulated phase change material; Numerical investigations; Plasterboard; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051667556

In the present paper, the thermal performance of PCMs-based lightweight wallboards integrating PCMs with insulation materials are investigated by comparative experiments. By using two reduce-scale test cells, the experiments are conducted in an artificial climate chamber which is controlled by harmonic and linearly rising/falling temperature changing processes. The comparisons of different PCM layer arrangements and layout areas on the wallboard thermal performance are conducted. Experimental results depict that the PCMs-based lightweight wallboard with PCM layer arrange on interior surface can reduce 32.4% of the temperature fluctuation amplitude and delay the lag time from 2.9 h to 4.1 h compared with the arrangement on exterior surface. To provide a convenient approach for engineers and architects to estimate the thermal performance of PCM envelopes in early design stage, a simple thermal design method is proposed based on harmonic response method and equivalent specific heat capacity principle. The calculation results of interior surface temperature agree well with the experimental results with an 7.7% relative error. The present work could provide validation data for simulation investigations of PCM envelopes and provide references for PCM envelopes thermal design. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial controlled condition experiments; Phase change envelopes; Thermal design method; Thermal performance","Building materials; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Paper; Phase change materials; Specific heat; Thermal insulation; Walls (structural partitions); Artificial climate chamber; Building energy consumption; Controlled conditions; Indoor thermal environments; Phase Change; Thermal design methods; Thermal Performance; Thermal storage performance; Structural design; building; energy use; experimental study; insulation; performance assessment; surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051621575

The unique vesicle-like nanostructure can greatly improve the infiltration of the electrolyte with abundant electroactive sites, thus leading to a shortened ions-diffusion path. Introducing rGO can not only enhance the conductivity but also avoid the restacking and pulverization of MoS2 during a long charge/discharge process. These advantages endow the MoS2/rGO nanovesicles with an improved rate capability (528 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1). They also possess superior cycling stability (almost without capacity loss after 200 cycles), much higher than MoS2/rGO nanosheets. More importantly, the MoS2/rGO nanovesicles are further assembled on flexible carbon cloth substrate by a simple dip-coating process, which also possess impressive electrochemical performance and mechanical strength, showing a huge potential for application in flexible energy storage devices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Flexible electrode; Lithium ion batteries; MoS2; Nanovesicle; rGO","Electrolytes; Inorganic compounds; Ions; Layered semiconductors; Lithium-ion batteries; Molybdenum compounds; Reduced Graphene Oxide; Dip-coating process; Electroactive sites; Electrochemical performance; Flexible electrodes; MoS2; Nanovesicle; Polystyrene nanospheres; Two-dimensional metals; Sulfur compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048607386

Energy storage is paramount in electric and hybrid vehicles, in green but intermittent energy sources, and in smart grids in general. Lithium is a vital raw material for the build-up of both currently available lithium-ion batteries, and prospective next generation batteries such as lithium-air and lithium sulphur. The continued availability of lithium can only rely on a strong increase of mining and ore processing. It would be an inconsistency if the increased production of lithium for a more sustainable society would be associated with non-sustainable mining practices. Currently 2/3 of the world production of lithium is extracted from brines, a practice that evaporates on average half a million litres of brine per ton of lithium carbonate. Furthermore, the extraction is chemical intensive, extremely slow, and delivers large volumes of waste. This technology is heavily dependent on the geological structure of the deposits, brine chemical composition and both climate and weather conditions. Therefore, it is difficult to adapt from one successful exploitation to new deposits. A few years of simulations and piloting are needed before large scale production is achieved. Consequently, this technology is struggling with the current surge in demand. At time of writing, only 5 industrial scale facilities are in operation worldwide, highlighting the shortcomings in this technology. Both mining companies and academics are intensively searching for new technologies for lithium recovery from brines. However, focus on the chemistry of brine processing has left unattended the analysis of the sustainability of the overall process. Here we review both the current available technology and new proposed methodologies. We make a special focus on an overall sustainability analysis, with particular emphasis to the geological characteristics of deposits and water usage in relation to mining processes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Aquifer; Batteries; Brine deposits; Lithium; Magnesium; Sustainable mining","Aquifers; Brines; Chemical analysis; Deposits; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental impact; Geology; Hybrid vehicles; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Magnesium; Magnesium deposits; Smart power grids; Solar cells; Sustainable development; Chemical compositions; Electric and hybrid vehicles; Geological characteristics; Geological structures; Intermittent energy source; Large scale productions; Sustainability analysis; Sustainable mining; Lithium deposits; lithium; lithium carbonate; aquifer; brine; environmental impact; lithium; magnesium; mining; processing; battery industry; chemical composition; chemical modification; chemical procedures; climate; desert; electricity; energy resource; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; evaporation; geology; green chemistry; mining; priority journal; Review; simulation; sustainable development; technology; weather",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047418710

Centralized solar hot water system has been widely used in residential buildings in China because it is suitable for multi-story and high-rise buildings. The application of phase change thermal storage in distributed solar hot water system has been widely studied. By contrast, few researches have focused on centralized solar hot water system. This paper aims to investigate the centralized solar hot water system with phase change material (PCM) as thermal energy storage. Through experiments, stainless steel ball was selected as the unit to package paraffin wax, and expanded graphite was added to enhance the heat transfer performance. According to the working temperature of solar collector, two materials with melting temperature of 55 °C and 60 °C were selected to test the properties of heat storage, heat releasing and thermal insulation of the water tank with PCM at different levels of solar irradiation. In addition, solar fraction of the system was calculated based on the maximum daily demand of users. The results showed that the PCM can complete the heat storage within 2–4.5 h at 10.8 MJ/m2, 15.1 MJ/m2 and 19.4 MJ/m2 solar irradiation. The average heat releasing rate was 78% for the 55 °C PCM and 83% for the 60 °C PCM. The average solar fraction of the system with 55 °C PCM was 75% and 80% for the system with 60 °C PCM. Similarly, control mode 1 is more appropriate to the buildings with low occupancy rate or low hot water demand. By contrast, control mode 2 is more appropriate to the buildings with high occupancy rate or large fluctuation of hot water demand. Finally, the results showed that the centralized solar hot water system with PCM performed better than that without PCM. The solar fraction was improved significantly. Meanwhile, it is more effective to use 60 °C PCM in centralized solar hot water system than 55 °C PCM. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Heat releasing; Heat storage; Phase change material; Solar fraction; Solar hot water system","Energy utilization; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Hot water distribution systems; Irradiation; Phase change materials; Solar radiation; Storage (materials); Tall buildings; Thermal insulation; Water tanks; Heat transfer performance; Phase change heat storages; Phase-change thermal storages; Residential building; Solar fraction; Solar hot water systems; Stainless steel balls; Working temperatures; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053166276

The traditional theoretical model of the phase change process is unable to sufficiently describe the mixed PCM; therefore, a new model aimed at analyzing the characteristics of the volumetric change rate, as well as the freezing and melting times of the mixed PCM, is theoretically constructed. In this paper, the effective heat capacity method is used, and the effects of porosity are considered when the PCM is in the solid state. Comparisons of this model with the traditional model are carried out using both simulations and experiments for different pressures and geometric structures. Our results indicate that the introduced model has better accuracy when describing the phase change process of the pure PCM mixed with an insoluble liquid.

In this study, we have employed density functional theory calculations to explore the electrochemical properties of Li and Na atoms, adsorption and diffusion on 2D carbon nanosheets named Octagon-Pentagon-Graphenes (OPGs). Two types of OPGs are considered, i.e. OPG-L and OPG-Z, and were found to be stable with much lower binding energies than that of graphdiyne. Both the nanosheets can combine Li/Na atoms strongly and easily. In the OPG-L, low energy barriers of 0.292 and 0.265 eV are obtained for the diffusion of Li and Na atoms, while in the OPG-Z, these barriers are much smaller. At room temperature, the diffusion rate of a Li atom on the OPGs is estimated to be at least 10 times faster than that on graphene. An ultrahigh Li/Na storage capacity of 2230 mA h g-1 can be achieved in both the OPG-L and OPG-Z, which is about 6 times larger than the 372 mAh g-1 of graphene. During the whole processes of Li/Na ion insertion, the OPGs exhibit a low average operating voltage and good metallic properties. Our results suggest that high specific capacity and rate capability could be expected in OPG-based Li/Na ion batteries. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anodes; Atoms; Binding energy; Density functional theory; Diffusion; Graphene; Ions; Nanosheets; Carbon nanosheets; High rate capability; High specific capacity; Metallic properties; Operating voltage; Rate capabilities; Storage capacity; Two Dimensional (2 D); Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054263184

Thus, sandwich-like Co(CO3)0.5(OH)/graphene composite is obtained here through confined growth and layer-by-layer self-assemblies by one-pot stirring solvothermal reaction. The molecular formula of the composite is exactly proved as Co(CO3)0.5(OH) without any crystal water. Furthermore, layer-by-layer stacking between Co(CO3)0.5(OH) and graphene are also observed with thickness of about several nanometers. The graphene layers between Co(CO3)0.5(OH) layers not only enhances the transfer of electron, but also releases the tension resulting from the volumetric effect during repeated lithiation/delithiation. Thus, highly reversible charge/discharge capacities of 1200 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 are obtained with high coulombic efficiency closed to 100% after 150 cycles, which is due to the potential reduction of carbon and hydrogen. In addition, even at high current densities of 0.5 and 1.0 A g−1, reversible charge/discharge capacities of about 806/807 and 609/611 mAh g−1 are remained after 300 cycles.

Solid oxide fuel cells are efficient power plants that not only generate electricity with high energy efficiency but also produce high quality waste heat that can be further used for hot and chilled water production. In this work, we present a concept of combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) energy system which uses solar power as a primary energy source and utilizes a reversible solid oxide fuel cell (R-SOFC) for producing hydrogen and generating electricity in the electrolyser (SOEC) and fuel cell (SOFC) modes, respectively. The system uses “high temperature” metal hydride (MH) for storage of both hydrogen and heat, as well as “low temperature” MH's for the additional heat management, including hot water supply, residential heating during winter time, or cooling/air conditioning during summer time. The work presents evaluation of energy balances of the system components, as well as heat-and-mass transfer modelling of MH beds in metal hydride hydrogen and heat storage system (MHHS; MgH2), MH hydrogen compressor (MHHC; AB5; A = La + Mm, B[dbnd]Ni + Co + Al + Mn) and MH heat pump (MHHP; AB2; A = Ti + Zr, B[dbnd]Mn + Cr + Ni + Fe). A case study of a 3 kWe R-SOFC is analysed and discussed. The results showed that the energy efficiencies are 69.4 and 72.4% in electrolyser and fuel cell modes, respectively. The round-trip COP's of metal hydride heat management system (MHHC + MHHP) are close to 40% for both heating and cooling outputs.

In this study, a kind of composite phase change material particles (CPCMPs) were prepared by vacuum impregnation method with expanded perlite (EP) as supporting material and paraffin as phase change material. Thus, a PCM plate was fabricated by mould pressing method with CPCMPs and then composite phase change humidity control wallboard (CPCHCW) was prepared by spraying the diatom mud on the surface of PCM plate. The composition, thermophysical properties and microstructure were characterized using X-ray diffraction instrument (XRD), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Additionally, the hygrothermal performance of CPCHCW was characterized by temperature and humidity collaborative test. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) CPCMPs have suitable phase change parameters with melting/freezing point of 18.23 °C/29.42 °C and higher latent heat of 54.66 J/g/55.63 J/g; (2) the diatom mud can control the humidity of confined space with a certain volume; (3) the combination of diatom mud and PCM plate in CPCHCW can effectively adjust the indoor temperature and humidity.

ExG is introduced into PG to enhance its thermophysical properties. The results of SEM, FT-IR, and XRD indicate that PG and ExG are physically well combined in the composites. DSC results show that the phase change temperature of the PG/ExGs are not significantly different from those of PG. The melting latent heat of PG/ExG containing 1, 2, and 4 wt% ExG are 163.8, 161.6, and 160.1 J g−1, respectively. Although the latent heat of PG/ExG decreases with the addition of ExG, the total heat storage capacity of PG/ExG increases due to the increase in specific heat of composite PCMs. The thermal conductivities of PG/ExG containing 1, 2, and 4 wt% ExG are 0.647 W/(m · K), 0.863 W/(m · K), and 0.944 W/(m · K), respectively, while that of PG is just 0.232 W/(m · K).

The results of thermal cycling tests substantially indicate that the PG-based SS-PCMs have noticeable thermal reliabilities after 100 cycles.

This paper aims to investigate the influence of the amount of impurity SO4 2− on thermal performance of solar salt, including thermodynamic parameters like melting point, liquidus temperature, thermal decomposition temperature, thermal stability, and thermophysical properties such as density, viscosity at different temperature. The melting point and thermal decomposition temperature of the mixtures were measured by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) and Thermo-gravimetric (TG), respectively. The liquidus temperature was obtained by a cooling curve, and the density was determined with a homemade device based on the Archimedes principle. Additionally, viscosity measurements were obtained using a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer. It was found that: SO4 2− makes no negative influence on melting point, liquidus temperature and density. The results of viscosity show that controlling the SO4 2− level within 0.1 wt.% in nitrates is necessary. For the thermal stability at 565 °C, SO4 2− increases the mass loss of nitrates a little more than pure nitrates, as well as easily forms insoluble compounds with cations, especially Na+. Meanwhile, the mass loss mechanisms was confirmed in especial by the vaporization of the nitrates, followed by the release of O2. In conclusion, it is critical to maintain SO4 2− content below 0.01 wt.% for addressing flow problems and reducing instability at high temperature. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

How to properly recycle these spent LiFePO4 batteries becomes an extremely thorny subject. Here, a sustainable and facile strategy has been developed to regenerate LiFePO4 materials as novel anode materials for alkaline secondary batteries. For the first time, it has been interestingly found that the repaired LiFePO4 anode with Bi2S3 additive in alkaline solutions can deliver prominent anodic performance, with a high specific capacity of ∼242.2 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 (showing a charge efficiency of ∼88.1%), excellent high-rate performance (∼173.6 mAh g-1 still retains even at 1250 mA g-1), and good cycling life (capacity retention of ∼97.5% after 100 cycles at 50 mA g-1). It is first discovered that alkaline LiFePO4 anode goes through a dissolution-deposition process during the charge-discharge process. Furthermore, a unique alkaline Ni(OH)2/LiFePO4 battery system is successfully established by adopting the recovered LiFePO4 materials and Ni(OH)2 cathodes. The assembled full battery with a commercial electrode loading lever of ∼30 mg cm-2 can deliver both high specific energy and power densities, which is comparable with commercial Ni/Fe batteries. This work not only proposes an attractive route to recycle spent LiFePO4 of lithium-ion batteries in large scale but also offers an economical way to produce sustainable anodes for Ni/Fe batteries. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.","Alkaline rechargeable batteries; Anode material; Electrochemical performance; Recycling; Spent LiFePO4","Anodes; Bismuth compounds; Electric discharges; Electronic Waste; Iron compounds; Layered semiconductors; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Nickel compounds; Recycling; Alkaline rechargeable batteries; Alkaline secondary batteries; Anode material; Charge-discharge process; Electrochemical performance; High specific capacity; High-rate performance; LiFePO4; Sulfur compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053176575

The limited operating flexibility of combined heat and power (CHP) units is one of the major barriers to integrating wind energy. In this study, wind power integration is enhanced by using the free heat storage of the primary district heating network (DHN) and introducing extra heat pumps (HPs). A novel short-term dispatch model is proposed to minimize the total primary energy consumption (TPEC) of the district energy system (DES). After necessary linearization processes, the unit commitment problem can be solved efficiently and analytically by the interior point method. A test DES that contains a real large-scale DHN is utilized to verify the feasibility of the proposed dispatch model. In case studies, comparisons are made to evaluate the improvement of wind power integration and TPEC reduction under different operating scenarios. The results show that both heat storage utilization and electric HP introduction can reduce wind curtailment considerably, however, exhaust heat recycling has a better performance. In addition, using the existing heat storage of the primary DHN could reduce the TPEC of DES further even if electric HPs have already been used. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Combined heat and power; Exhaust heat recycling; Free heat storage; Short-term dispatch model; Wind power integration","District heating; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Integration; Optimization; Recycling; Wind power; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power units; District heating networks; Exhaust heat; Primary energy consumption; Short term; Unit commitment problem; Wind power integrations; Electric load dispatching; combined heat and power; energy efficiency; heat budget; heating; integrated approach; numerical method; numerical model; performance assessment; recycling; wind power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053084143

The design of self-integrated electrodes can be treated as a valid approach to achieve this goal. In this work, a facile and low-cost wet chemical oxidation strategy is put forward to prepare self-integrated porous leaf-like CuO nanoplates on Cu foil substrates in situ. These nanoplates are then directly used as the anode for LIBs. The morphology, structure, and composition of the resultant CuO/Cu hybrid foils are characterized, and the relevant lithium storage properties of this anode are also investigated by using standard electrochemical tests. The results show that the CuO/Cu hybrid-based anode possesses a porous leaf-like morphology and self-integrated architecture.

The fully connected aluminum meshes and the phase change material (NaCO3) with the presence of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are used as the thermal energy storing medium in the thermal battery. The aluminum meshes behave like heat carriers and increase heat diffusion rates, while the use of MWCNT in the phase change material enhances the thermal conductivity of the thermal energy storing medium. The flow field, temperature rise, and liquid fraction are simulated numerically in the thermal battery using the finite element code for various concentrations of MWCNT. The findings revealed that the aluminum meshes improve the thermal conduction in the energy storing medium. Temperature increases locally in the storing medium and disturbs the uniform-like temperature distribution inside the thermal battery when only phase change material is used. The presence of MWCNT enhances the thermal conductivity and minimizes the excessive temperature rise inside the storing medium.

Paraffin waxes have high thermal energy storage density but low thermal conductivity and, hence, require large surface area. In this paper, we examine the thermal-optical behavior of paraffin wax hosting several concentrations of graphite or graphene, aiming to provide an emerging class of PCMs. Scanning electron microscope SEM were used to characterize the microstructure of the so-formed composite. Heat transfer rates of paraffin wax composites were investigated during heating and cooling phases. The thermal properties were measured using a differential scanning calorimeter DSC). Thermo-optic switching (TOS) based on transmission versus time and temperature under electric heating was analyzed. Results show that both graphite and graphene accelerate melting and solidification heat transfer rate of the paraffin composites. It was observed that, although both graphite and graphene promote decreasing of switching and saturation times, paraffin wax-graphene composite samples cause up to 54% reduction in thermo optical switching time when increasing graphene concentration. These findings have important implication for understanding paraffin-graphene reactivity and surface area modification. These experiments showed a route for paraffin wax hosting carbon fillers as thermo optical sensing materials to be used in TOS device applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Graphene; Graphite; Heat transfer rate; Paraffin wax; Phase change materials (PCMs); Thermo-optical properties","Differential scanning calorimetry; Fillers; Graphene; Graphite; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Optical properties; Paraffins; Phase change materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Switching; Thermal conductivity; Differential scanning calorimeters; Heat transfer rate; Heating and cooling; Low thermal conductivity; Melting and solidification; Thermo-optic switch; Thermo-optic switching; Thermo-optical properties; Paraffin waxes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051405016

Various materials as the host of sulfur have been applied to improve the performance of lithium sulfur batteries. However, the poor conductivity of sulfur and polysulfides shuttle effect result in poor cycling performance and lower specific capacity. Here, a novel chemical and physical entrapment strategy to improve the electrochemical performance is introduced by designing and synthesizing a 3D network composite which consists of intertwined TiO2-B nanotubes and carbon nanotubes as the sulfur hosts. In this unique structure, carbon nanotubes serve as the long-range conductive network which facilitates the transfer of electrons during redox reaction. Theoretical calculations reveal that TiO2-B provides a strong chemical binding for polysulfides, and each TiO2-B nanotube as an independent reaction chamber provides an efficient barrier to restrict the shuttling of the polysulfides.

Indeed, technical parameters such as the state of charge (SOC), battery voltage/temperature, and charging/discharging currents were monitored together with power flow into and out of the battery inverter. The incremental charge/discharge efficiency between two SOCs, the duration of charge (Tc) and discharge (Td) cycles, Coulomb efficiency and the internal resistance of the battery bank, were evaluated from the measured data. Furthermore, a statistical analysis of the SOC was performed in order to specify the delivered energy from the battery bank. This allowed the assessment and a detailed understanding of the system operating performance from a technical and economical point of view. The average minimum and maximum SOC of the battery were found to be respectively, 34.0% and 87.45%, for the monitored period. The incremental cycle efficiency (Ycd) was found to vary between 68 and 90%. A low efficiency is usually observed when either the charge or the discharge durations are small (or the corresponding currents are high). The Coulomb efficiency is marked by a quasi-constant degradation rate of 1.8% per year, and the internal resistance of the battery bank increased from 0.07 to 0.27 Ohms during the 4 year monitoring period. From the monitoring of these parameters, and by using real costs, the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) was determined for various discount and capacity degradation rates as well as battery bank replacement periods. The calculated LCOS was affected by the discount rate and the replacement period of the battery bank. Additionally, the LCOS analysis revealed that for PV standalone systems lead-acid battery is more cost effective than li-ion on the short term. The latter storage technology is expected to be cost effective for medium and long term. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coulomb efficiency; Incremental efficiency; Internal resistance; Lead-acid batteries; Levelized cost of storage; Photovoltaic power plant; Standalone","Acid resistance; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Degradation; Digital storage; Electric load flow; Lithium-ion batteries; Photovoltaic cells; Coulomb efficiency; Internal resistance; Levelized costs; Photovoltaic power plant; Standalone; Lead acid batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050857008

Then, SAT modified with the additives of 2 wt% disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate (DHPD) and 2 wt% carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC) showed the best performance in reducing supercooling. Finally, a laboratory-scale experiment was conducted to investigate the heat-charging and discharging performance of the heat storage units based on a copper foam/SAT composite PCM. The findings indicated that the heat-charging rate was based mainly on the heat power level, and the composite PCM with fewer thermal conductivity enhancers showed better heat storage performance.

However, its insulation strength is susceptible to impurities, temperature, pressure, and other factors. Hence, it is of great significance to study the effect of temperature on breakdown characteristics of propylene carbonate. In this paper, the effect of temperature on breakdown characteristics of PC was carried out under microsecond pulse. First, pulsed breakdown setup was built. The temperature of PC varied from-50 °C to 50 °C. Breakdown voltages were captured with a capacitive voltage divider and streamer patterns are obtained by ultrahigh-speed cameras. Second, the experimental results are obtained. The breakdown strength of PC increases with increasing temperature. It is 239 kV/cm at-50 °C and rises to 407 kV/cm at 50 °C. At low-temperature breakdown, electron current is more concentrated and breakdown voltage is more stable. Moreover, the energy release for streamer at low temperature is more concentrated, but it is more dispersed for streamer at high temperature. At last, considering the CO2 solubility in PC, PC generates more bubbles and the increase of temperature benefits the release of bubbles at low temperature, resulting in lower breakdown strength. Because of the moisture in PC, breakdown strength of PC falls slightly near 0 °C. Thus, the experimental results are explained by use of stream theory and bubble breakdown theory. PC can adapt to wide-range temperatures, effectively expanding practical applications of the PC in pulsed power source. © 1973-2012 IEEE.","Dielectric breakdown; dielectric liquid; pulse power systems; temperature","Carbonation; Dielectric liquids; Dielectric materials; Dielectric properties of liquids; Electric breakdown; Electric conductivity; Electrodes; Propylene; Rail guns; Temperature measurement; Voltage dividers; Breakdown characteristics; Capacitive voltage dividers; Effect of temperature; Increasing temperatures; Plasma temperature; Pulse power systems; Pulsed power sources; Ultra-high speed cameras; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049945369

In the case of CO2 reduction, Sn-based electrocatalysts and their associated electrodes have shown great promise. In this review, recent progresses in Sn-based electrocatalysts and their associated electrodes for CO2 reduction are briefly reviewed with a focus on catalyst synthesis, electrode fabrication, and electrocatalytic performance. Sn-based catalytic performance is greatly affected by the structure, morphology and composition of the catalyst, which in turn are strongly dependent on synthesis strategies and processes. Here, three catalyst synthesis methods: hydrothermal, electrodeposition and plasma treatment methods will be discussed and analyzed. Furthermore, electrode fabrication methods using Sn-based catalysts for CO2 electroreduction will also be discussed to optimize catalytic activity, stability, and product selectivity so as to maximize CO2 electroreduction performance.

Compared to Li-ion batteries, slashed fabrication cost has been predicated for Na-ion and K-ion batteries, making them promising candidates for stationary energy storage. Potassium ion has a much larger radius than that of lithium ion, which would lead to a more severe volume change during K ions insertion. An intriguing question is whether the electrode optimization strategies developed in Li-ion batteries could be extended to K-ion batteries. In this study, Sb is used as a model alloy anode to explore the effect of nanocarbon incorporation on the cyclic stability. Through the preparation of Sb/reduced graphene oxide composite electrode, a reversible capacity of over 300 mAh/g is obtained with decent capacity retention. In contrast, neat Sb shows a fast capacity fading due to the volume expansion during alloying with K ions. This study suggests that the preparation of alloy/nanocarbon composite remains an effective approach in developing advanced anodes for K-ion batteries.

There is an obvious voltage decay phenomenon, when the capacitor is disconnected from the power supply, and the higher the energy density is, the faster the voltage decays. And the voltage maintaining performance (VMP) of capacitor is of special interests especially in the occasion, which has high requirement of the output energy efficiency. For the HED capacitor made of metallized films, there are three factors affecting the VMP: self-healing, dielectric leakage, and polarization. In order to investigate the effect of above factors on the VMP of HED capacitor, the experiments and analysis of self-healing characteristics, dielectric leakage in stable status, and slow polarization are carried out. For a 4 kV/0.8 MJ/m3 HED capacitor, the self-healing is responsible for 12.68% of the whole voltage decay, and the dielectric leakage contributes for 7.89% with the fact that the insulation resistance is in the range of 6.06 × 102-6.31 × 102,M Ω. Thus, the voltage decay is mainly caused by the slow polarization. Then a VMP simulation without considering self-healing process is established, and different working parameters such as charging time and holding time are studied by using the VMP simulation. When the charging time is 40, 13.3, and 1.3 s, the voltage decay in 60 s is 3.06%, 3.57%, and 3.85%, respectively, and when the holding time is 0, 10, 100, and 1000 s, the percentage of 60 s voltage decay is 3.06%, 2.71%, 1.23%, and 0.70%, respectively. The results based on the space charge reveal the facts that shorter charging time and holding time would result in faster voltage decay. With the consideration of the energy output efficiency and insulation voltage withstand capability, the charging time and holding time would be compromise values. © 1973-2012 IEEE.","Dielectric leakage; high energy density (HED) capacitor; polarization; self-healing; voltage maintaining performance (VMP); working parameters","Capacitors; Decay (organic); Dielectric materials; Electric conductivity; Electric power systems; Electrodes; Energy efficiency; Insulation; Polarization; Dielectric leakage; Energy storage components; High energy densities; High energy density capacitors; Insulation resistance; Self healing characteristics; Self-healing; Working parameters; Capacitance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048618291

MgCl2·6H2O–Mg(NO3)2·6H2O eutectics have a melting point near 60 °C with a large energy storage density suitable for use in the thermal energy storage unit of a water heating system. However, the low thermal conductivity of the eutectic limits its heat extraction rate. In this study, we combine the eutectic and expanded graphite (EG) to prepare a high thermal conductivity composite PCM and study its cycling performance over 200 thermal cycles. The thermal conductivity of the composite PCM increased from 0.5 to 3.7 W m−1 K−1, ensuring faster heating and cooling. The images obtained from scanning electron microscopy and leakage testing showed that the maximum loading mass fraction of the eutectic in the EG reached 85 wt %. Infrared spectra and X-ray diffractometry patterns confirm that composites with compositions between those of EG and the eutectic were composed of the physical mixture. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that the composite PCM lost less mass at 300 °C compared to the pure eutectic, and differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated that the composite PCM had a melting point of 52.3 °C and a small subcooling degree of 2.7 °C, compared to 56.6 and 18.4 °C for the pure eutectic, respectively. All these measurements demonstrated that the composite PCMs changed less after 200 thermal cycles than the pure eutectic, which had an observable stratification caused by phase separation. The composite PCM developed was thermally conductive, shape-stabilized, and more thermally stable during cycling than the pure eutectic.

The main idea of this novel configuration is to control the SAPF only to compensate the harmonic currents. In fact, the SAPF DC-side voltage and the PV system are directly connected to the common DC-bus of the hybrid system, which is regulated by the batteries through a buck-boost converter (BBC). Due to its regulation through a large Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), good dynamic response of the DC voltage is obtained, during a sudden variation in nonlinear load. Hence, the SAPF capabilities of harmonic filtering are enhanced. In addition, the proposed system is controlled to operate at the maximum power point under abrupt conditions, and to meet the load demand and maintain the output voltage and frequency at their desired values despite changes in load conditions.

However, the weak interaction between soluble polysulfide and carbonaceous electrode is unable to restrict the soluble polysulfide shuttle effect, leading to the short cycling life. Herein, we innovatively design an asymmetric self-supporting hybrid sponge electrode whose one side is covered by deeply fluorinated carbon nanotubes (F-CNTs, F/C ratio of 0.88) with the appropriate thickness of ∼0.5 μm and the other side is kept bare as the current collector for the high-performance Li-polysulfide battery. The carbon nanotubes sponges (CSP) provides enough space for a high sulfur loading, three-dimensional net structure for fast ions diffusion and connective electrical conductive networks for electrons transfer. The F-CNTs layer shows a strong affinity to soluble polysulfide according to first-principles calculations, which restrains the diffusion of soluble polysulfide from CSP to anode and suppress the shuttle effect significantly. As a result, a high specific capacity of 1344 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, an excellent rate capability of 780.9 mAh g−1 at 2 C and a great cycling stability for 400 cycles with ∼0.11% capacity decay per cycle have been achieved at the sulfur loading of 2.55 mg cm−2.

However, the lower thermal conductivity of the phase change material (PCM) used in LHS system seriously weakens thermal energy charging and discharging rates. In order to improve the thermal performance of LHS system, a lot of research on performance enhancement have been carried out. This review paper will concern on the development of PCMs and performance enhancement methods for LHS system in the last decade. The available enhancement methods can be classified into three categories: using high thermal conductivity additives and porous media to enhance PCM thermal conductivity, using finned tubes and encapsulated PCMs to extend heat transfer surface, using multistage or cascaded LHS technique and thermodynamic optimization to improving the heat transfer uniformity. The comparative reviews on PCMs, corresponding performance enhancement methods and their characteristics are presented in present paper. That will help in selecting reliable PCMs and matching suitable performance enhancement method to achieve the best thermal performance for PCM based LHS system.

In this paper, a modularized thermal storage unit (MTSU) was proposed to overcome such fatal drawback. Once the PCMs reach their limit, the completely phase-changed MTSU will be replaced by a new one due to the modularization. Such online thermal charging and offline thermal discharging working characteristics enable the continuous working of electronics. The proposed MTSU is fabricated by encapsulating paraffin with epoxy resin, and the paraffin is thermally enhanced via copper or nickel foams. Theoretical and experimental validations reveal that the ETC is increased by 376% via copper foam with the porosity of 95.52%, and by 205% for nickel foam with the porosity of 95.61% due to the relatively lower skeleton thermal conductivity of nickel foam. The cycled test revealed that the proposed MTSU has good thermal stability. Compared with the conventional TSU, the proposed MTSU avoids the slow re-solidification process and exhibits potential for continuous thermal storage over long periods of time. The proposed MTSU is expected to be applied in the field of driving batteries and solar-thermal conversion system. © 2018","Continuous thermal storage; Effective thermal conductivity; Metal foams; Modularized thermal storage unit; Paraffin; Series-parallel model","Copper; Electronic cooling; Epoxy resins; Heat storage; Metal foams; Modular construction; Nickel; Paraffins; Phase change materials; Porosity; Storage (materials); Thermal management (electronics); Effective thermal conductivity; Electronics cooling; Experimental validations; Series-parallel model; Solar thermal conversion; Solid-liquid phase change materials; Thermal storage; Thermal storage units; Thermal conductivity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046171036

However, accidents related to LIBs frequently occur. This study focuses on failure results, characteristics, and phenomena. Lithium-ion batteries under different states of charge (SOCs) (0%, 30%, 50%, 80%, 100%, and 120%) at high temperatures have been investigated with the thermal abuse test. During the experiments, several typical failure processes were captured. According to the phenomena, 2 failure modes (smoke and jet fire) and 3 stages (primary reaction, tempestuous reaction in the middle time period, and extinguishing reaction in the final stage) were observed. A substantial amount of gas was vented, and jet fire was detected in the middle period. Only gas vented when the SOC was lower than 50%, whereas vented gas and jet fire were detected simultaneously when the SOC exceeded 50%. The results indicated combustible behaviors and exothermic reactions related to the SOC. An increase in the SOC caused a decrease in the thermal runaway initial temperature and the maximum increase in temperature. A higher SOC determined intense chemical reactions in the cell at higher temperatures, which caused a significant amount of materials to spew out of the batteries as well as additional mass loss. Relationships between failure characteristics and internal reactions were analyzed. The SOC should be lower than 50% in transportation or storage. The intercalated lithium capacities were the main reason for the series of domino reactions, which caused runaway in the terminal. These studies can serve as a reference for safety applications, transportation, and loss prevention in LIBs.

However, the strong affinity of the material to water is undesirable for manipulation. Herein, we report an approach for modifying the surface of LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 (NCM) with a layer of 4-vinylbenzeneboronic acid (4-VBBA) to alter the surface properties of NCM. The presence of a 4-VBBA layer can lead to the surface of NCM becoming less hydrophilic, while having comparable wettability of the electrolyte. Importantly, the electrochemical performance of NCM, modified with 4-VBBA (NCM@B), can be greatly improved, relative to that of pristine NCM. Although both of the materials can deliver high specific discharge capacity at 0.1 C (189 mA h g −1 for NCM and 190 mA h g −1 for NCM@B), NCM@B exhibits better rate capability and improves ability to cycle (85.9 mA h g −1 for NCM and 105.6 mA h g −1 for NCM@B at 2 C, capacity retention of 46.5% for NCM and 66.1% for NCM@B after 500 cycles). It is demonstrated that that less F-containing species, which may have great effect on the electrochemical performance of the electrode materials, are formed in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film on the surface of NCM@B, probably due to the blockage of the residual water in the electrolyte by the 4-VBBA layer to the electrode surface. The strategy may be applicable to various metal oxide electrode materials sensitive to humidity. © 2018","4-Vinylbenzeneboronic acid; Lithium ion battery; Lithium storage; Nickel-rich layered cathode; Surface modification","Cathodes; Electric discharges; Electrochemical electrodes; Lithium-ion batteries; Manganese compounds; Metals; Nickel compounds; Solid electrolytes; Surface treatment; Electrochemical performance; Layered cathode; Lithium storages; Metal oxide electrodes; Solid electrolyte interphase film; Specific discharge capacity; Specific energy density; Transitional metal oxide; Lithium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047056217

Herein, hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene porous carbon support PCMs have been successfully synthesized by carbonizing a graphene oxide@metal-organic framework (GO@MOF) template, which simultaneously realizes large phase change enthalpy and high thermal conductivity. During the carbonization process, MOFs were converted into hierarchical porous carbons, whereas GO was reduced to high-thermal-performance reduced graphene (rGO). Thus, a hierarchical 3D porous carbon structure with high porosity and large specific surface area was obtained, which provided a suitable condition for encapsulating PCMs. Furthermore, the pores of carbon stabilized the PCMs by capillary force and surface tension. The interaction between the PCM molecule and rGO significantly decreased the interfacial thermal resistance and made the composites reveal high thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the 3D network structure promoted the stretching and crystallization characteristics of the stearic acid molecule in the confined pore space, which enhanced the heat release efficiency. Compared with the rGO/MOF-5-C support, the hierarchical 3D structure of rGO@MOF-5-C revealed a thermal conductivity of 0.60 ± 0.02 W m-1 K-1, which was 27.7% improvement, with large phase change latent heat of 168.7 J g-1, which increased by 18.5%.

Herein, a pollen biomass-derived carbon electrocatalyst with a three-dimensional porous framework, coupled with uniform distribution of FeSe nanoparticles, has been prepared by pyrolysis of the pollen precursor, followed by selenylation. The optimal catalyst FeSe/NC-PoFeSe exhibits a superb ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.86 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode and OER activity with a low overpotential (330 mV at 10 mA cm-2) in alkaline media, compared with commercial Pt/C and IrO2/C catalysts, respectively. On the basis of the characterization results, we ascribe the enhanced ORR performance to sufficient Fe-Nx, pyridinic N, and graphitic N and the excellent OER performance in the presence of FeSe nanoparticles uniformly mounted on the N-doped carbon materials. In addition, we believe that the coupling effect between the FeSe nanoparticles and biocarbon led to a further improvement in the electrochemical performance.

However, it still faces problems such as poor reversibility and short cycle life. Here, citrus maxima peel (CMP) was used as a precursor to prepare activated and Fe-loading carbon (CMPACs and CMPACs-Fe, respectively) via pyrolysis in nitrogen atmosphere at 900 °C, in which KOH was added as an activator. Electrochemical measurements show that CMPAC-based Li-O2 battery possesses high specific capacity of 7800 mA h/g, steady cycling performance of 466 cycles with a corresponding Coulombic efficiency of 92.5%, good rate capability, and reversibility. Besides, CMPACs-Fe-based O2 electrode delivers even lower overpotential in both charge and discharge processes. We conclude that these excellent electrochemical performances of CMPACs and CMPACs-Fe-based O2 electrode benefit from their cellular porous structure, plenty of active sites, and large specific surface area (900 and 768 m2/g), which suggest that these biomass-derived porous carbons might become promising candidates to achieve efficient lithium oxygen battery. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","biomass-derived porous carbon; catalyst; Fe loading; Li-O2 batteries; oxygen electrodes","Carbon; Catalysts; Electric discharges; Lithium; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Lithium-air batteries; Oxygen; Porous materials; Potassium hydroxide; Electrochemical measurements; Electrochemical performance; High specific capacity; Large specific surface areas; Lithium-oxygen batteries; Nitrogen atmospheres; Oxygen electrode; Porous carbons; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053620931

To make a practical rechargeable LOB, it is necessary to ensure the stability of the Li anode in an oxygen atmosphere, which is extremely challenging.

With the assistance of BA, a continuous and compact SEI film is formed on the Li-metal surface in an oxygen atmosphere, which can significantly reduce unwanted side reactions and suppress the growth of Li dendrites. Such an SEI film mainly consists of nanocrystalline lithium borates connected with amorphous borates, carbonates, fluorides, and some organic compounds.

We report a simple synthesis approach to coaxially grow MoS2 nanosheets on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which were precoated with polydopamine (PDA), with the ability to readily control phase and morphology. It is found that the thin PDA layer on CNTs surface with abundant catechol base and chinone base can effectively attract both Mo4+ and S2- for subsequently in situ forming MoS2 shell and sheet-like morphology, and therefore, it is essential for the successful deposition of MoS2. The as-prepared MoS2 nanosheets/CNTs (MoS2@CNT) composite with a unique hierarchical hybrid nanostructure with large active surface and enhanced structural robustness has greatly promoted the charge-transfer process and enhanced the electrochemical properties when used as the electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries.

The main bottleneck of conventional electrodes is the rapid fading of the hydrogen catalyst performance in the highly corrosive environment. Here, we show that a simple coating of the catalyst can effectively protect the catalyst surface from corrosion in concentrated HBr and maintain a high catalytic activity. We polymerize dopamine on the surface of the catalysts and apply a gentle annealing step to obtain a few nanometers thin conformal polydopamine layer, which acts as a semipermeable barrier that effectively blocks Br. The catalytic activity was measured on a glassy carbon rotating disc electrode after dipping in 3 M HBr at 40 °C to accelerate the corrosion. The unprotected catalyst is irreversibly poisoned after 30 min (50% activity loss), while the hydrogen oxidation reaction activity of the protected catalyst remains high, even after dipping the catalyst layer in concentrated HBr for hours, with almost unchanged hydrogen diffusion constant. In principle, the polydopamine coating technique is compatible with all existing catalysts, as the polymerization involves only a room temperature step in a buffered aqueous solution and the coating displays an excellent adhesion to any substrate.

Here, an integrated vertically aligned carbon/MoS2 aerogel (VA-C/MoS2) with oriented pores has been developed. Vertically aligned pores ensure fast transportation of electrons and rapid penetration of electrolyte, meanwhile decreasing the transfer resistance of ions in this VA-C/MoS2 anode. The good electrical conductivity of three-dimensional (3D) carbon matrix with interconnected microstructures, coupling with the homogeneously anchored MoS2 nanoflakes, promotes that all the active sites of MoS2 can be exploited during the electrochemical process. Due to these structural features of the VA-C/MoS2 aerogel, an excellent specific capacity of 1089 mAh/g, a high rate capability, and a long-term cycling stability up to 1000 cycles have been simultaneously achieved. Importantly, the areal capacity achieved by VA-C/MoS2 aerogel (12.4 mAh/cm2) based on a high mass loading of MoS2 (16 mg/cm2) is a 10-fold increase compared with the result of pure MoS2 aggregations (1.24 mAh/cm2).

Moreover, the aluminum cell is a complex device whose energy density is determined by various parameters, most of which are often ignored, resulting in failure to achieve the maximum performance of the cell. The purpose here is to discuss how to further develop reliable nonaqueous AIBs. First, the current status of nonaqueous AIBs is reviewed based on statistical data from the literature. The influence of parameters on energy density is analyzed, and the current situation and existing problems are summarized. Furthermore, possible solutions and concerns regarding the construction of reliable nonaqueous AIBs are comprehensively discussed. Finally, future research directions and prospects in the aluminum battery field are proposed. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Results show that the addition amount of ethanol serving as the etching agent has a great influence on the oriented growth and size (thickness-to-diameter ratio) of VS2 nano-grains.

Using solar energy in distributed energy systems has the potential to further reduce fossil fuels consumption, and ease carbon emissions. This paper proposes a novel CCHP system by combining concentrated photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) technology with an advanced air-handling process that realizes independent control of temperature and humidity. The heat produced from a PV/T collector is for desiccant regeneration in a two-stage liquid desiccant cycle in summer, and can be directly supplied to nearby users in winter. An office building under typical climate conditions of Beijing in 2002 was adopted to determine its various energy demands. Due to the efficient use of solar energy, annual energy saving ratio and CO2 emissions reduction ratio are predicted to be 73.28% and 74.55%, respectively. Two extreme conditions determining whether the excess heat from the PV/T collector is used were compared to demonstrate the top and bottom limitations of economic performance. The integrated performance, considering energy, environment and economic factors, reaches 37.48% when no excess heat from PV/T collector is used, and it can be further improved by thermal storage or recovering the excess heat to produce other products.

Based on the heat storage characteristics of a building, the energy consumption prediction model of the building considering different heating zones with different orientations is developed using the Resistor-Capacitor thermal network model. Then, different optimal control methods of the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system in the building are developed. The energy consumption management of the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system is achieved by adjusting the room temperature within the suitable temperature comfort range. In order to further consider the impact of the integration of smart buildings on the economic and security operation of the active distribution network, the optimal scheduling method of the active distribution network with integrated smart buildings is developed considering the load factor of the aggregation of the smart buildings. Finally, the optimal scheduling results of the aggregation of the smart buildings under different heating, ventilation and air-conditioning control methods in the winter heating scenario are analyzed. In addition, based on the branch flow model, the optimal power flow model of active distribution network with on-load tap changer is constructed by piecewise linearization and second-order cone relaxation to achieve flexible and optimal operation of the active distribution network. Thus, the impacts of the optimal schedules of the aggregation of smart buildings on the economic and security operation of the active distribution network are further evaluated. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed optimal scheduling method can make full use of the demand response potential of the smart buildings and further contribute to the operating costs reduction of the smart buildings. Meanwhile, the optimization of the active distribution network with the load factor of the aggregation of buildings can reduce the power loss and increase the minimum voltage magnitude of the active distribution network utilizing the flexibility of the smart buildings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Activedistribution network; Branch flow model; Heating; Piecewise linearization; Resistor-capacitor thermal network model; Second-order cone relaxation; Ventilation and air-conditioning system","Air conditioning; Electric load flow; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Heating; HVAC; Linearization; Numerical methods; Operating costs; Predictive analytics; Resistors; Scheduling; Ventilation; Voltage control; Branch flow; Piecewise linearization; Second order cone; Thermal network models; Ventilation and air conditioning; Buildings; air conditioning; building; control system; distribution system; energy use; heating; model; modeling; numerical method; temperature; ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047793214

Herein, we report the fabrication of isolated single-atom Fe anchored on porous nitrogen-doped carbon from the pyrolysis of a well-designed solely Fe-tetrapyridophenazine coordination complex. The N-rich bridging ligand, tetrapyridophenazine (tpphz) is first employed as a spatial isolation agent of Fe that suppresses its aggregation during high temperature pyrolysis, resulting in highly reactive and stable single-atom Fe ORR catalysts. The catalyst shows remarkable ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.863 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) (21 mV more positive than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C) and excellent durability in 0.1 M KOH. Whereas in acidic media, the Fe single atoms also demonstrate ORR activity comparable to and stability much higher than those of Pt/C. Notably, Zn-air cells made using the as-prepared catalyst as the cathode provide a high open circuit voltage (1.53 V) and gravimetric energy density (947 W h kg-1), which are higher than commercial Pt/C based Zn-air cells (1.50 V and 828 W h kg-1).

In this research, a novel sandwiched spherical tin dioxide/graphene with a three-dimensional interconnected closed pore structure is synthesized. The microstructural characterization shows that the spherical graphene with submicron sized diameters interconnects with each other forming an interconnected flexible conductive network, whereas a large number of SnO2 nanoparticles (approximately 5 nm) are limited homogeneously in between the interlayers of the sphere-like graphene shell. The sandwich structure of the SnO2/graphene and the closed graphene sphere can provide double protection for the SnO2.

To address this issue, a layered g-C3N4@reduced graphene oxide composite (g-C3N4@RGO) was prepared via a scalable and easy strategy. The resultant g-C3N4@RGO composite possesses large interlayer distances, rich N-active sites, and a microporous structure, which largely improves Li storage performance. It shows excellent cycle stability (899.3 mA h g-1 after 350 cycles under 500 mA g-1) and remarkable rate performance (595.1 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles under 1000 mA g-1). Moreover, the g-C3N4@RGO electrode exhibits desired capacity retention and relatively high initial Coulombic efficiency of 58.8%. Impressively, this result is better than that of RGO (29.1%) and most of RGO-based anode materials reported in the literature. Especially, the g-C3N4@RGO-based electrode is enough to power two tandem red-light-emitting diodes and run a digital watch. Interestingly, the electronic watch can work continuously for more than 20 days. This novel strategy shows the great potential of g-C3N4@RGO composites as energy-storage materials. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","anode; g-C3N4@RGO; graphene; layered structure; rate capability; urea","Anodes; Composite films; Graphene; Ions; Urea; Watches; g-C3N4@RGO; High current densities; Initial Coulombic efficiency; Interlayer distance; Layered Structures; Micro-porous structure; Rate capabilities; Reduced graphene oxides; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052732572

However, it still needs great efforts to develop electrode materials with ultrafast gravimetric and volumetric Na-storage performance, due to difficult balance between Na-ion diffusion kinetics and pressing density of materials. In this work, Bi2Se3/graphene composites, synthesized by a selenization reaction, are investigated as anode materials for SIBs. Na-ion storage mechanism of Bi2Se3 should be attributed to a combined conversion-alloying one by a series of ex situ measurements. In the composites, Bi2Se3 particles with an average diameter of 100 nm are uniformly dispersed onto graphene with strong interfacial interaction. Despite their nanoscale size, the pressing density of Bi2Se3/graphene composite could still reach a high value of 2.07 g/cm3. Therefore, the composites can deliver a high gravimetric specific capacity of 346 mAh/g and volumetric specific capacity of 716 mAh/cm3 at a current density of 0.1 A/g. Remarkably, the composites exhibit an ultrafast Na-storage capability and a negligible capacity fading with the increasing of current density from 0.2 to 5 A/g.

Using liquid metal as a mediator, herein we report a novel painting-alloying-dealloying strategy to synthesize flexible, self-supported hexagonal β-Co(OH)2 nanosheet arrays anchored on Co plates. Free of any binder/conducting agent, the integrated Co(OH)2/Co electrode exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity (merely 332 mV @ 10 mA cm−2) and stability (25 h with negligible degradation) towards OER in an alkaline solution, as benchmarked with the state-of-art Co-based catalysts. The enhanced performance of this electrode originates from the unique ultrathin (∼15 nm) nanosheet morphology (providing abundant active sites), the in-situ growth characteristic (improving the electronic conductivity) and the open array structure (accelerating the transfer of electrolyte and the release of gases). Thanks to the merit of liquid metal, both the pattern and shape of the integrated electrode can be facilely designed and regulated, without influencing the OER activity. Furthermore, using a separator between the anode and cathode, the integrated architecture of electrodes allows for the compact-type electrolyzer for overall water splitting. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dealloying; Hexagonal Co(OH)2 nanosheets; Overall water splitting; Oxygen evolution reaction; Painting","Dealloying; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytes; Liquid metals; Nanosheets; Oxygen; Painting; Co-based catalysts; Electrocatalytic activity; Electronic conductivity; Integrated architecture; Integrated electrodes; Oxygen evolution reaction; Renewable energy storages; Water splitting; Electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050722486

Here, a novel molecule-assisted strategy for synthesis of ultrasmall ruthenium oxide on nitrogen-doped carbon matrix catalyst (RuO2/N-C) is presented. 1,10-Phenanthroline molecular (Phen), which contains an abundant nitrogen element and can strongly coordinate with metal ions, is selected as the assistant to prepare RuO2/N-C. The space confinement effect in this process gives RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with size ca. 1.7 nm, making them ultraefficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for both HER and OER. The resultant RuO2/N-C catalyst exhibits striking catalytic performances in strong alkaline solution, affording a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at low overpotentials of 40 mV for HER and 280 mV for OER, respectively. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the excellent performances are due to the ultrasmall size of RuO2 NPs and the synergistic effect between RuO2 and N-C. More importantly, these RuO2/N-C composites can be utilized as bifunctional electrocatalysts as both anode and cathode and display superior water splitting activity to that of the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts couple, suggesting the potential applications of our catalyst for large-scale H2 and O2 production in the future. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","Bifunctional electrocatalysts; Highly efficient; Molecule-assisted strategy; Overall water splitting; RuO2/N-C","Carbon; Density functional theory; Doping (additives); Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electrolysis; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Metal ions; Metals; Molecules; Nanoparticles; Nitrogen; Platinum compounds; Synthesis (chemical); Bifunctional electrocatalysts; Energy storage and conversions; Highly efficient; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Nitrogen-doped carbons; Oxygen evolution reaction; RuO2/N-C; Water splitting; Ruthenium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052793932

However, little attention has been paid to hydrogen-ion storage devices because they generally deliver relatively low Coulombic efficiency as a result of the hydrogen evolution reaction that occurs in an aqueous electrolyte. Herein, we successfully demonstrate that hydrogen ions can be electrochemically stored in an inorganic molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) electrode with high Coulombic efficiency and stability. The as-obtained electrode exhibits ultrafast hydrogen-ion storage properties with a specific capacity of 88 mA hg−1 at an ultrahigh rate of 100 C. The redox reaction mechanism of the MoO3 electrode in the hydrogen-ion cell was investigated in detail. The results reveal a conversion reaction of the MoO3 electrode into H0.88MoO3 during the first hydrogen-ion insertion process and reversible intercalation/deintercalation of hydrogen ions between H0.88MoO3 and H0.12MoO3 during the following cycles.

However, they are still challenged by poor cycling performance of Na-storage electrode materials. Herein, carbon-coated Na2.2V1.2Ti0.8(PO4)3 is reported as a novel cathode for high-performance aqueous SIBs, which is obtained by studying the effect of Ti substitution on the charge/discharge properties of a Na3-xV2-xTix(PO4)3 (0≤x≤1) system in 6 M NaClO4 aqueous electrolyte. Experimental results indicate that the material is composed of approximately 200 nm Na2.2V1.2Ti0.8(PO4)3 crystals uniformly coated with a thin layer of carbon (ca. 4 nm). During Na extraction/insertion, it undergoes a one-step, two-phase reaction mechanism through the reversible electrochemistry of the V4+/V3+ redox couple, showing a reversible capacity of around 62 mAh g−1 at the current rate of 1 C and a well-defined potential plateau of 0.50 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). More importantly, it achieves outstanding high-rate capability with a discharge capacity of approximately 40 mAh g−1 at the current rate of 10 C, and excellent cycling performance with capacity retention of 93.4 % after 500 cycles. The good electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique Ti-substituted composition, thin-layered carbon coating and high-concentration electrolytes. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this article, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that using TiC MXene TinCn− 1O2 (n = 2, 3, 4) as the cathode of lithium–air batteries (LABs) can potentially improve its efficiency by increasing the cathode conductivity and lowering the charging overpotential. In addition, the conservative predicted storage density is as high as ≈0.5 kWh kg−1. Compared with the bulk TiC{111}, the favorable structural agreement between the TiC MXenes and Li2O2, and better interfacial conduction help Li2O2 continuously grow on the TiC MXene; and the higher specific surface area (SSA) makes more Li2O2 deposition possible. The predicted reaction path calculations reveal that TiC MXenes have the charging overpotential of 0.13 V because they are excellent catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thus, the lower charging overpotential can extremely suppress the side reactions and accelerate the OER rate. All the evidence supports that TiC MXene is a potential high energy density cathode for LABs. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Utilizing the features from the terminal voltage response of the Li-ion battery under current pulse test, a new method is proposed in this paper by using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique for accurately estimating the battery SOH. Since the terminal voltage measured at the same condition varies with the battery aging process, the features for SOH estimation are extracted from the voltage response under a specific current pulse test. The benefit of the proposed method is that the features come from the short-term test, which is much convenient to be obtained in real applications. After applying the short term current pulse test (few seconds), the keen points and the slopes in the voltage response curve are selected as the potential candidate features. In order to find the most effective feature for SOH estimation, all the possible combinations of the features are investigated and compared. Afterwards, SVM is able to establish the optimal SOH estimator on the basis of the optimal feature combination and the battery SOH.

The PFL is rolled n circles on a support cylinder simultaneously by two layers of copper foil electrodes and two layers of insulation dielectrics. The first circle of the two electrodes are elicited in opposite directions along the axis, acting as the quasi-coaxial output structure of the PFL, and the left n − 1 circles of the PFL form a complete rolled strip line of n − 1 circles. The rolled PFL is convenient to realize HV insulation and is able to output a pulse with good quality. Characteristic parameters of the PFL are designed theoretically. Besides, the pulse discharge process of the PFL is simulated by computer simulation technology (CST) modeling, and the simulation result verifies the correctness of theory design. Furthermore, a rolled PFL with a characteristic impedance of 4.4 Ω is developed. The test characteristic impedance of the developed PFL by the incident pulse method confirms to the theory design. The discharge voltage waveform with a full width at half maximum of 57 ns of the PFL is acquired, which has a rise time of 6.8 ns. The HV test of the rolled PFL is carried out, and a discharge current pulse with an amplitude of 7 kA is acquired when the PFL is charged to 70 kV. It is calculated that the developed PFL has an energy storage density of 2.5 J/l.

However, their poor thermal conductivity and shape stability during utilization always restrict their further application. In this paper, polyethylene glycol/expanded perlite phase change materials with Cu powder phase-change materials (PEG-Cu/EP PCMs) are prepared by vacuum impregnation to overcome these problems. The results indicated that Cu particles are well dispersed in PEG and uniformly enwrapped inside the pores and surfaces of EP due to their excellent physical interactions by capillary force and surface tension. Thus the as-prepared composites exhibit superior shape stability around the working temperature around 253 °C.

However, paraffin wax has a low thermal conductivity, i.e., 0.25W/mK, which lowers the rate of heat transfer from the wax to the pipes of water heaters, especially when it solidifies over the pipes. An experimental setup was developed to investigate the influence of (1) finned pipes and (2) metallic strips on the performance of solar water heaters that contains a heat storage material, i.e., paraffin wax. It has been found that the presence of fins and metallic strips inside the wax is acting as channels of heat transfer across the wax, such that the heat transfer process continues even if the wax solidifies over the heat exchange pipes. Also, adding fins and metallic strips has enhanced the temperature homogeneity in the molten wax. The amount of heat energy released by the wax to the flowing water has increased by 47% in case of using finned water pipes than unfinned pipes, and by 304% in case of using copper strips. It can be concluded from the performed experiments that adding fins or metallic strips to solar water heaters that contain paraffin wax improves the heating capability of the water heater. © 2017, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.","Fins; Heat storage; Metallic strips; PCM; Phase change materials; Solar collector",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051421030

Microstructures of experimental alloys were analyzed by scanning electron microcopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with electron diffraction (ED). The electrochemical and kinetic characteristics of the ball-milled composite alloys were further evaluated based on their galvanostatic charge–discharge measurement, high-rate dischargeability (HRD), hydrogen diffusion behavior, as well as electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS). Results indicated that the ball-milled alloy with 3 wt.% TiF3 exhibited the best electrochemical discharge capacity, which was not only related to the formation of amorphous and/or nanocrystalline phase but to the formation of MgF2 because it can effectively reduce the thermodynamic stability of hydride. With increasing TiF3, the cycle degradation rates of the milled alloys were ameliorated remarkably. This improvement was attributed to the formation of an amorphous phase (which possesses strong anticorrosive and antioxidation abilities) as well as the formation of MgF2 and TiNi secondary phases. The ball-milled alloy with 3 wt.% TiF3 additive exhibited the strongest electrochemical kinetic properties, related to the highest hydrogen diffusion rate in the alloy (which was associated with multiple defects and grain boundary of amorphous and/or nanocrystalline phases) and the electrochemical reaction on the surface of alloy (which was related to the lowest apparent activation energy). © 2018, ASM International.","activation energy; amorphization; cycling life; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; nanostructured materials","Activation energy; Amorphization; Ball milling; Binary alloys; Degradation; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Electric discharges; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Grain boundaries; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium compounds; Microstructure; Nanocrystals; Nanostructured materials; Nickel; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface reactions; Thermodynamic stability; Titanium alloys; Apparent activation energy; Cycling life; Electrochemical discharge capacities; Electrochemical impedance spectra; Electrochemical kinetics; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical reactions; High rate dischargeability; Nanocrystalline alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051230526

The effects of different diameters on thermal energy storage (TES) charging rate and TES density are numerically analyzed primarily. Second, the optimized hierarchical structure of PBTES is further constructed based on the proposed optimal comprehensive index called TES rate density. The optimal diameter pair of capsules exists when one of the diameters is fixed to obtain the optimized TES charging rate and TES rate density. Moreover, the thermal performance of diameter-changed two-layered PBTES is obtained compared to that of single-layered PBTES system. Finally, thermal performance of two-layered PBTES is experimentally examined. The influence of different inlet temperature and mass flow on the thermal performance of the system are investigated. The results are concluded as follows. (1) The phase change material of the lower-layer is melted faster by adopting the two-layered PBTES system. The improvement of heat transfer performance and enhancement of uneven heat transfer temperature can further increase the thermal performance of the system. (2) When the air inlet temperature increases from 425 °C to 465 °C, the TES charging rate can be increased by 60.5% and the heat storage efficiency rises from 84.8% to 91.1%. The TES charging rate is raised by 23.5% when the mass flow rate increases from 180 kg·h−1 to 260 kg·h−1 and the heat storage efficiency is decreased slightly. (3) With the same inlet temperature and mass flow, the TES charging rate of diameter-changed two-layered PBTES is better than that of single-layered PBTES. The maximum TES charging rate of the former system can be increased by 12.4% compared to that of the latter system, and TES rate density of two-layered PBTES can be improved by 13% as well. In summary, the new diameter-changed two-layered PBTES is an optimized system of heat storage.

It was established that regardless of the sublayers used while annealing caused platinum to recrystallize and texturize in the direction [111], and the texture is suppressed in the directions [200] and [220]. The annealing caused the drop of the volume resistivity of thin films from 0.2 to ca. 0.15 μOhm×m, and practically shown no dependence on the film thickness in case it exceeded 200 nm. As a result of recrystallization Pt films became unsmooth at low annealing temperatures and as the temperature increased hillocks were formed on the film surface. Relaxation of the compressive stress in the Pt film, facilitating the reduction of its free energy and modification of the lattice parameter towards the equilibrium value, is known to be the major hillock formation mechanism. The level of intrinsic stress in the film and the annealing temperature both determine the initial hillock formation. The final hillock height, density, and size are related to the Pt layer thickness, sublayer structure, and to the annealing time and temperature.

The online adaptation of the equivalent circuit model is employed to maintain accurate estimations by capturing battery age-dependent dynamics. The Lyapunov-based adaptation law is employed to enable the production of internal battery state and age-dependent parameters estimations using only battery terminal voltage and noisy current measurements. Though parameters vary with aging, temperature or other factors, accurate estimations are still achieved without prior knowledge of battery parameters. Besides, the stability of the proposed observer can also be guaranteed by Lyapunov direct method. The proposed method is verified using data collected over randomized discharge profiles.

Nevertheless, the practical applications are heavily hindered by polysulfide shuttle effect, which would cause fast capacity fading. Polysulfide adsorption has been proved to be an effective strategy via chemical bonding or physical constraint. Here, a fresh LixLayTiO3 and acetylene black hybrid coated separator was constructed to suppress the migration of polysulfides and served as an upper current collector to fully utilize the active material. The acetylene black embellished separator and the pristine one were used as reference. Comprehensive and systematic results proved that the hybrid coated separator could not only effectively trap polysulfides, but also promote the conversion of polysulfides, which would improve the rate and cycle performance. The as-prepared sample with 1.0% LixLayTiO3 addition showed the best electrochemical performance with a high capacity of 890 mA h g-1 at 1600 mA g−1. An enhanced cycling performance with 716 mA h g-1 retained after 100 cycles at 800 mA g−1 was observed, corresponding to a capacity retention of 81.2%.

In order to achieve efficient heat storage and release capacity, a novel and compact LHTES equipment which is integrated with several parallel U-tube rectangular heat storage units (HSUs) has been developed and investigated experimentally. The thermal storage equipment developed here can be applied in many areas such as low-temperature waste heat recovery, solar heat utilization, agricultural green house heating, etc. Filled with modified paraffin enhanced by large porosity copper foam in the HSUs in the LHTES equipment, the maximum heat storage capacity and rate reached 1.907 MJ and 198.7 W respectively when the inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid (HTF) was set to be 85 °C.

Here, we design and fabricate a multi-functional interlayer by padding the molybdenum net with graphite or graphite/molybdenum trioxide composite that is able to adsorb polysulfide effectively thus alleviate the diffusion of polysulfide. The weak molybdenum-oxygen bonds on the surface of molybdenum trioxide nanoparticles provide efficient adsorption site to capture polysulfide.

The fibrous anode and cathode with diameters of 750 µm and 250 µm, respectively, are thick enough to reconnect by visual observation. The LIB can be assembled by the as-prepared cathode, anode and gel polymer together with the self-healing protective shell. The flexible and self-healable LIB has a capacity of 82.6 mAh g−1 under a series of deformation and retains 50.1 mAh g−1 after the 5th healing process at a current density of 0.1 A g−1.

After linked by tetramer aniline, the graphene materials showed remarkably enhanced electrochemical performances. The conductivity of the graphene was increased from 5.8 S cm−1 to 41.7 S cm‒1, under the strong doping effect between Gr and tetramer aniline by means of the π‒π interactions, which was analyzed by FT‒IR, UV–vis and XPS spectra. In addition, the aniline oligomer attached to reduced graphene oxide (AOAG) showed a remarkable energy-storage behavior due to the synergistic effect. The capacitance of AOAGs can be 370 F g−1, while it is 114 F g−1 and 129 F g−1 for graphene oxide and tetramer aniline respectively. Because the covalent bonding between graphene and aniline oligomer can effectively combine the excellent mechanical strength of graphene and the large faradic pseudocapacitance of aniline oligomer, the AOAGs showed quite high charge-discharge cycle stability besides remarkable capacitance.

The technique is based on coupling the condenser of the AC unit with a heat exchanger of the cold energy storage PCM. The cold energy storage of the PCM is transferred to the condenser of the AC unit by the cooled ambient air passing through the PCM heat exchanger. The cold energy storage is charged to the PCMs by using the cold ambient air at night during the charging process where the PCMs are solidified during this process. Then, at the next daytime, the charged cold energy storage is discharged by the hot ambient air which is cooled down and transferred to the condenser of the AC unit. The effect of adding the studied nanoparticles on the charging and discharging process of the PCMs, and the performance of the AC unit is studied. The study is carried out at inlet air temperatures to the PCMs of 40 and 45 °C and concentrations ratios of the nanoparticles with the PCMs of 1% and 5%. The mathematical model of the physical model is solved numerically by using finite volume method and the numerical model is validated with an experimental setup. The results indicate that, during the discharging process, increasing the inlet air temperature to the PCM decreases the melting time and increases the saving power of the AC unit.

Herein, for the first time, a rapid MOFs-gel technique is skillfully employed for the facile and scalable synthesis of red phosphorus (red-P) nanoparticles inlaid Fe-benzenetricarboxylic (BTC) composite. During the subsequent phosphorization process, Fe-BTC was transformed into porous FePx, finally achieving a porous phosphorus-rich FePx@P composite with controllable amounts of red-P nanoparticles embedded in porous FePx matrix. Due to the unique structure and synergistic effect between components in the composite, the FePx@P composite with an optimized loading content of 61.2 wt% P exhibits excellent electrochemical performance for LIBs anodes (1283.9 mAh g−1 under 100 mA g−1 after 80 cycles and 418.2 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 1600 cycles). The abundant pores inside the FePx matrix can store sufficient electrolyte for fast ion transfer, as well as provide enough space for alleviating the volume change during charge/discharge process.

In this paper, a series of shape-stabilized phase change materials (ss-PCMs) were engineered with three silica matrices as support and paraffin as PCMs through solution impregnation. These porous silica matrices serve as an ideal skeleton for shape stabilization of melted paraffin PCMs and yield desirable thermal properties of paraffin confined in silica pores. The textural and chemical properties, crystallization, interfacial interactions, and thermal properties and stability are investigated using various techniques including nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, Fourier transformation infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, small- and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy, as well as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The effect of the pore structure on crystallization of PCMs was studied and a novel phase change was unveiled. The phenomena of melting point depression and confinement effects are in line with theoretical thermodynamics, and the physical state of paraffin at the interfacial region in mesopore channel is analyzed considering pore geometric factors, revealing a non-melting interface layer in MCM-41.

However, this technology requires considerable efforts to overcome a number of technical challenges such as high-energy consumption, intermittency of solar radiation, and high-water consumption. This paper proposes an optimized multi-effect distillation (MED) process driven by steam at 70 °C and 0.3 bar, which is provided by a linear Fresnel collector. The aim of the proposed integrated system is to reduce the equivalent mechanical energy of the MED process, and utilize the most cost-effective storage system. Moreover, we incorporated an air-cooled condenser instead of a water-cooled condenser, to reduce the water cooling facilities. A computer model was developed using the Engineering Equation Solver tool, to solve the mass and energy balance equations of the integrated system (under different operating conditions). Under the operating conditions of Qatar, the simulation results showed that 1 m2 of solar linear Fresnel collector produces 8.6 m3 of freshwater per year. The equivalent mechanical energy of the optimized MED desalination plant is 8 kWh/m3, which is 59% lower than that of existing commercial MED facilities with thermal vapor compression (19 kWh/m3). This significant reduction in equivalent energy consumption would reduce the required solar field size by 25%. This study also showed that using a water storage system (instead of thermal energy storage) results in a lower total system capital cost. Furthermore, by integrating an air-cooled condenser, the overall plant water consumption reduced by 2 m3 of sea water per m3 of feed water. The performance of the air-cooled condenser can vary by as much as 300% due to fluctuations in dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air-cooled condenser; Linear Fresnel collector (LFC); Multi-effect distillation (MED); Solar desalination; Thermal vapor compression (TVC)","Cooling systems; Cooling water; Cost effectiveness; Desalination; Distillation; Distilleries; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Integrated control; Seawater; Water supply; Air-cooled condensers; Linear Fresnel collectors (LFC); Multieffect distillation; Solar desalination; Thermal vapor compression; Computer operating systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048268487

However, the search for an anode with appropriate Na storage and high structural stability still remains challenging. In this work, the carbon microsphere films-coated Ni foam is prepared by a simple chemical vapor deposition method and is used as a novel anode for the long-lifespan Na-ion batteries. These carbon microspheres possess special onion-like structures that enhance the Na-ions intercalation and exhibit excellent Na storage properties. In addition, directly coating the carbon microsphere films on Ni foam current collectors without binders and conductive additives results in an integrated electrode structure, which avoids the undesirable interfaces and reduces the packaging volume. Compared to the common used hard carbon anode with long discharge plateau and short lifespan, this integrated electrode exhibits a slope discharge profile with higher security and demonstrates a long lifespan of 700 cycles with a high capacity retention of 83%.

Nevertheless, they suffer from the relatively low intrinsic thermal conductivity. Filling the PCMs with graphite-nanosheets (GNs) by ultrasonic exfoliating could alleviate this problem, and GNs with longer ultrasonic exfoliation time is reported to possess larger effective thermal conductivity (ETC) monotonously. In this paper, we discover a non-monotonous variation of ETC for the first time, when enhancing the ETC of paraffin with ultrasonic exfoliated GNs. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is explained by the variation of GNs morphologies over time in the paraffin. Experimental results reveal that longer exfoliation time can increase the aspect ratio and ETC, but over a critical time, the bending stiffness of GNs decrease and the particles tend to be folded with increased interfacial thermal resistance and decreased ETC. The ETC as a function of ultrasonic time shows an obvious peak value at ∼2 min, and the ETC could be increased from 0.3 to 3.0 W/(m·K) at GNs loading of 4 wt% with negligible effect on the phase change characteristics. In addition, the GNs/paraffin composite exhibits the quick thermal response and longer working time. The present non-monotonous discovery reveals the underlying mechanism and provides suggestions on the improvement of ultrasonic exfoliation process. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Effective thermal conductivity; Graphite nanosheets; Non-monotonous variation; Phase change characteristics; Thermal storage performance; Ultrasonication exfoliation","Aspect ratio; Graphite; Heat storage; Nanosheets; Paraffins; Phase change materials; Effective thermal conductivity; Graphite nano-sheets; Non-monotonous variation; Phase Change; Thermal storage performance; Ultra-sonication; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047450610

On that account, heterostructures with the excellent interface effects and the formation of built-in potential at the hetero-interface have emerged as a promising solution to address the above issue. In this paper, we prepared SnSe/SnO2@Gr heterostructure composite, in which the SnO2 nanospheres are homogeneously dispersed and wrapped into the Graphene matrix, interconnecting to form a three dimensional (3D) hierarchical architecture, followed by the selenium treatment to obtain SnSe/SnO2 heterostructure. This distinctive nanoarchitecture can enhance charge transfer and lithium-ions diffusion, as well as improving specific conductivity and charge/discharge capability of SnSe/SnO2@Gr heterostructure. When used as anode material for lithium ion batteries, SnSe/SnO2@Gr shows a higher rate capability than SnO2@Gr and SnO2. Moreover, after 200 cycles, the storage capacity of SnSe/SnO2@Gr is still up to 810 mAh/g and almost remains unchanged, suggesting a high cyclability. It is noted that the enhanced electrochemical performance of SnSe/SnO2@Gr can be attributed to the built-in electric field of heterojunction, which is proved by the DFT calculation and CI-NEB methods, illustrating that the existence of the built-in electric field adds an additional electromotive force (φE) to boost the electron mobility of the active material. Noteworthy, the results show that the large difference of the work function of the two semiconductor materials could lead to the high additional potential (φE), which surly be the beneficial for improving the performance of the battery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Charge transfer; DFT calculation; High power capability; Lithium-ion batteries; SnSe/SnO2 heterostructure","Anodes; Charge transfer; Charging (batteries); Density functional theory; Design for testability; Electric discharges; Heterojunction bipolar transistors; Heterojunctions; Ions; Layered semiconductors; Selenium compounds; Anode material for lithium ion batteries; DFT calculation; Electrochemical performance; Hierarchical architectures; High power capability; High-performance anode materials; Rechargeable lithium ion battery; Semiconductor heterojunctions; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046011406

By studying the lithiation mechanism of Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) using in-situ electron holography, we find that double charge layers are formed at the interface of the insulating Li4Ti5O12 (Li4) phase and the semiconducting Li7Ti5O12 (Li7) phase, and can greatly boost the lithiation kinetics. The electron wave phase of the LTO particle is found to gradually shrink with the interface movement, leaving a positive electric field from Li7 to Li4 phase. Once the capacitive interface charges are formed, the lithiation of the core/shell particle could be established within 10 s.

In addition, the full cell consisting of Ge/rGO-2 anode and LiFePO4 cathode also delivers good cycling stability with high energy density. The 3D conductive rGO network provides the pathway for electron transportation and promotes to form stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Furthermore, the void space deduced from the porous structure can effectively accommodate volume changes and enhance the structural integrity of Ge/rGO microspheres. This facile and scalable synthetic strategy is beneficial for large-scale production of Ge-based electrode materials for further application in high energy and power density LIBs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anode materials; Germanium; Hierarchical porous structure; Lithium-ion batteries; Spray drying","Anodes; Cathodes; Germanium; Germanium oxides; Graphene; Iron compounds; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Microspheres; Porosity; Reduced Graphene Oxide; Solid electrolytes; Spray drying; Anode material; Electrochemical performance; Electron transportation; Hierarchical porous structures; High reversible capacities; Large scale productions; Solid electrolyte interphase layer (SEI); Spray drying technique; Phosphorus compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048150171

Metal vanadates have been regarded as a fascinating group of materials in many areas, especially in lithium-ion storage. However, there has not been a versatile strategy to synthesize flexible metal vanadate hybrid nanostructures as binder-free anodes for Li-ion batteries so far. A convenient and versatile synthesis of MxVyOx+2.5y@carbon cloth (M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu) composites is proposed here based on a two-step hydrothermal route. As-synthesized products demonstrate hierarchical proliferous structure, ranging from nanoparticles (0D), and nanobelts (1D) to a 3D interconnected network. The metal vanadate/carbon hybrid nanostructures exhibit excellent lithium storage capability, with a high areal specific capacity up to 5.9 mAh cm−2 (which equals to 1676.8 mAh g−1) at a current density of 200 mA g−1.

Pseudocapacitance could provide an effective way for the development of electrode materials with both high energy and power densities. 3D graphene/α-Fe2O3 nanocrystal composites have been inspired by the combination of facet engineering and composite construction. The materials are evaluated as anode materials for secondary lithium ion batteries. Compared with the pristine α-Fe2O3 nanocrystal with oriented facet, the composites render evidently enhanced rate capability and long life span.

However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide makes it difficult to commercialize stable Li-S batteries. In this work, we designed a gelatin-polyethylenimine composite (GPC) as functional binder for Li-S batteries to improve the stability of electrode during discharge-charge process. GPC binder combines the dispersion and adhesion ability of gelatin, which keeps cathode homogeneous and stable during electrochemical reaction, and adsorption capability of PEI for polysulfide, which suppresses the “shuttling effect”. The result shows that GPC used as a binder remarkably enhanced cyclic performance of Li-S battery with good capacity retention of about 100% at current density of 1C (sulfur loading 1.5 mg cm−2) after 100 cycles. We believe that GPC would be a promising binder for highly stable Li-S batteries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Binder; Electrochemical performance; Gelatin-polyethylenimine composite; Lithium-sulfur battery; Sulfur cathode","Binders; Cathodes; Electric discharges; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Polysulfides; Adsorption capability; Cyclic performance; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical reactions; Good capacity retentions; High specific capacity; Polyethylenimines; Sulfur cathodes; Lithium sulfur batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048887045

The Cu2+ ions formed an anorthic Mn2+-doped Cu2SnS3 structure with Eg = 1.44 eV, which altered the material's optical and photo/electrochemical properties. After coating the bare Nb2O5 electrode with Mn2+-doped Sn2S3 or Mn2+-doped Cu2SnS3 NCs, the photoluminescence spectrum was blue-shifted to 411.13 nm from 411.69 nm. Compared to the sample without Cu2+, the Cu2+-incorporated sample showed a slightly stronger emission at the same position, possibly due to disorder in the crystalline structure based on variations at the interface of Mn2+-doped Cu2SnS3 NCs. Electrochemical analysis showed a lower charge transfer resistance in the Mn2+-doped Cu2SnS3, which is related to its larger electroactive surface area. The larger electroactive surface area is attributed to the Faradaic redox processes at the electrode surface, which suppresses the carrier recombination. The coexistence of Cu2+ and Mn2+ ions shortened the electron transport pathway at the interface and improved the carrier diffusion coefficient and diffusion length, leading to a higher specific capacitance that implies higher energy storage performance. Finally, the I-V characteristics of the Mn2+-doped Cu2SnS3-coated Nb2O5 electrode under various light illumination conditions indicated its better efficiency in photoresponse, electron generation, and charge collection, owing to a superior charge transport mechanism. Detailed results were obtained about the charge dynamics in the as-prepared photo/electrochemical devices with Cu2+ incorporation in the Mn2+-doped SnS3 electrode. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Manganese-doped copper tin sulfide; Manganese-doped tin sulfide; Nanocrystal; Photo/electrochemical properties","Charge transfer; Copper compounds; Electrodes; Electron transport properties; IV-VI semiconductors; Layered semiconductors; Nanocrystals; Niobium oxide; Photoluminescence spectroscopy; Sulfur compounds; Tin compounds; Charge transfer resistance; Charge transport mechanisms; Chemical bath deposition methods; Electroactive surface areas; Electrochemical characteristics; Photo/electrochemical properties; Photoluminescence spectrum; Tin sulfide; Manganese compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046712869

When carbon materials are used for immobilizing sulfur, the technical challenge is designing their framework to relieve the shuttle effect of polysulfides intermediates and the volume change of sulfur, and to improve the conductivity of sulfur. Herein, polyaniline-based carbon (PANI-C) coated corn starch-based activated carbon spheres (ACS@PANI-C) was prepared and used as hosts of sulfur, which can effectively combine the advantages of physical entrapment and chemical binding interactions of sulfur species.

A series of hybrid microcapsules were successfully synthesized through in situ polymerization in an oil-in-water emulsion stabilized by sodium salt of styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer and SiC synergistically. The scanning electron microscopic investigation revealed that the microcapsules presented regular spherical morphology. The chemical compositions and crystalline structures of the resultant microcapsules were characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction, confirming that SiC nanoparticles have been embedded in the PMF shell. Thermogravimetric analysis and a temperature-regulated test indicated that the prepared microcapsules possessed high thermal stability and good thermoregulating ability. Differential scanning calorimetry examination showed that the resulting hybrid microcapsules can maintain high effective core content and high encapsulation efficiency, and the supercooling crystallization was obviously suppressed after the incorporation of nano-SiC.

The disposal and reuse of large number of waste acrylic fibers from fabric manufacturers or waste recovery is an urgent economic and environmental issue. Here, a porous carbon was derived from waste acrylic fibers via pre-oxidized, carbonization and KOH activation. Furthermore, we adopted melamine as nitrogen source to dope the porous carbon materials. When used as the anode of lithium ion batteries, this nitrogen-doped porous carbon shows high reversible capacity of ca. 1200 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. Reversible capacities of 550 and 370 mA h g−1 are obtained at higher current densities of 1 and 5 A g−1 after 500 cycles, respectively. The outstanding electrochemical performance are a result of its large mesopore volume, high-level N-doping (especially, pyridinic-N), large quantity of edge defects, and three-dimensional hierarchical porous architecture.

Without the requirement of detailed physical and thermal parameters of batteries, this article proposed a data-driven model using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to predict the battery temperature with the inputs of ambient temperature, current and state of charge. Thermal response of a Li-ion battery module was experimentally evaluated under various conditions (i.e. ambient temperature of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C, and current rate of C/2, 1C and 2C) to acquire the necessary data sets for model development and validation. A Sugeno-type ANFIS model was tuned using the obtained data. The numbers of input membership functions (MFs) representing the three input parameters of this model are 1, 2, 3, respectively. The input and output MFs are Gaussian curve and linear types, respectively. The optimization method is a hybrid one which is a combination of the back-propagation and the least squares methods. Compared with the validating data, the ANFIS model was able to accurately predict the battery temperature under various operating conditions. With fewer sensors for data acquisition and less computation complexity, this method could be a possible tool for the online temperature prediction of power batteries in electric vehicle applications.

In order to develop a convenient method for the evaluation and design of the one-tank thermocline heat storage system, the idea of effectiveness-number of transfer unit method (ε-NTU) for heat exchanger design was employed in which three dimensionless design parameters are defined including the ratio between overall thermal conductance and the total thermal capacity of heat transfer fluid flowing through the system during discharging process (i.e., NTU), the ratio between thermal capacity of solid particles and total thermal capacity of heat transfer fluid through the system during the discharging process (i.e., Cs ∗), the ratio between overall thermal conductance in the charging process and that in the discharging process (i.e., (hA)∗). A transient one-dimensional dispersion-concentric model is then applied to study the effects of three dimensionless parameters on the effectiveness of one-tank system. It is shown that the effectiveness of the one-tank thermocline heat storage system is closely related to NTU, Cs ∗ and (hA)∗. Based on the simulated results, general performance evaluation charts and the related effectiveness correlations are also proposed for evaluation and design of the one-tank system.

Most of today’s operating nuclear reactor systems are producing saturated steam at relatively low pressure. This, in turn, limits their thermodynamic efficiency. Superheating of nuclear steam with solar thermal energy has the potential to overcome this drawback. An innovative configuration of a hybrid nuclear-CSP plant is assembled and simulated. It brings together a small pressurised water reactor and a parabolic trough solar field. The solar heat is transferred to nuclear steam to raise its temperature. Continuous superheating is provided through molten salts-based thermal energy storage (TES). The results from design point calculations show that solar superheating has the potential to increase nuclear plant electric efficiency significantly. Solar heat to electricity conversion efficiency defined as the ratio of extra generated power to collected solar energy reaches unprecedented rates of 52%.

Herein, we introduce a continuous self-sacrifice template strategy for synthesis of the novel NiCo2O4/Co,N-CNTs nanocages (NCs) as an efficient ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst for Zn-air batteries. The NiCo2O4 and Co,N-CNTs are derived from the external and internal self-sacrifice of ZIF-67, respectively. The as-prepared NiCo2O4/Co,N-CNTs NCs display remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward ORR (E1/2 = 0.862 V) and OER (Ej10 = 1.569 V) simultaneously, outperforming the commercial catalysts like Pt/C and RuO2, respectively. The reversible oxygen electrode index (Δ = Ej10 (OER) - E1/2 (ORR)) is ∼0.707 V in alkaline electrolyte. Interestingly, NiCo2O4/Co,N-CNTs NCs act as a cathode electrocatalyst in a primary Zn-air battery system with a high power density of 173.7 mW cm-2. Therefore, the continuous self-sacrifice template strategy proposed in this work is expected to inspire the design of high-performance bifunctional nonprecious electrocatalysts for application in sustainable energy conversion devices.

However, it is a great challenge for most LTMS electrodes to have long cycling life and high-rate capability due to their larger volume expansion and the formation of soluble polysulfide intermediates caused by the conversion reaction. Herein, layered CuS microspheres with tunable interlayer space and pore volumes are reported through a cost-effective interaction method using a cationic surfactant of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). The CuS–CTAB microsphere as an anode for SIBs reveals a high reversible capacity of 684.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and 312.5 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 1000 cycles with high capacity retention of 90.6%. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique structure of this material, and a high pseudocapacitive contribution ensures its high-rate performance. Moreover, in situ X-ray diffraction is applied to investigate their sodium storage mechanism. It is found that the long chain CTAB in the CuS provides buffer space, traps polysulfides, and restrains the further growth of Cu particles during the conversion reaction process that ensure the long cycling stability and high reversibility of the electrode material. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Based on a single factor test method, 52# paraffin and liquid paraffin were heated and melted together to prepare the composite phase change material, which was infiltrated into the ceramisite by vacuum adsorption. The ceramisite adsorbed with paraffin was encapsulated using acrylic emulsion, epoxy resin, or cement paste. The sand in the traditional ceramisite was replaced with the phase change ceramisite to prepare the phase change energy storage mortar for the building application. Using mercury porosimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermal conductivity detection, the phase transition temperature, phase transition latent heat, encapsulation effectiveness, adsorption rate, coefficient of thermal conductivity, and specific heat capacity of the mortar were measured for the phase change ceramisite. The results indicated the following: the phase transition temperature of the composite paraffin could accommodate the range of indoor and outdoor thermal environments (18°C–35°C); a large amount of paraffin could be adsorbed into the ceramisite interior by vacuum adsorption, with the adsorption rate being higher than 58 %; with incorporation of the phase change ceramisite, the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the mortar gradually decreased and the specific heat capacity gradually increased; and when the ceramisite ratio reached 50 %, the coefficient of thermal conductivity decreased by 51.47 % and the specific heat capacity increased by 80.6 %, indicating favorable heat storage performance.

Here, cobalt hexacyanocobaltate (Co3[Co(CN)6]2), a typical Prussian blue analog (PBA), is reported as an anode material for nonaqueous KIBs. The as-prepared Co3[Co(CN)6]2 exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 324.5 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, a superior rate capability (221 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1), and a favorable long-term cycling stability (200 cycles with 82% capacity retention).

A designed solvent-Thermal method involving thiourea as stabilizer and acetone-H2O mixture as solvent has been employed to fabricate SnO2-WCC composites, which exhibit uniform deposition of well-dispersed SnO2 nanoparticles on the surface of WCC.

The interdigital LIMCs were fabricated via layer-by-layer mask-assisted deposition of graphene and electrode materials, without the need for metal current collectors, additives or polymer binders. The as-assembled LIMCs delivered a record volumetric energy density of 53.5 mW h cm-3. Furthermore, they exhibited outstanding mechanical flexibility without performance degradation under repeated bending, superior electrochemical metrics and safety at a high temperature of 80 °C due to the highly stable ionogel electrolyte and the absence of a separator.

Ge nanostructure materials with different morphologies may lead to distinctly different application performances. In this work, Ge nanorod architectures were successfully template-free electrodeposited on ITO substrate from the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([Emim]Tf2N) containing dissolved GeCl4 with the assistance of UV light. The UV irradiation influences the conformation of imidazolium rings of [Emim]+ adsorbed during the deposition process. A solution template has been formed on the surface of the electrode which inhibited the lateral growth of Ge nuclei and promoted the growth of Ge nanorod structures. Consequently, the coral-like Ge nanorod bundles (NRBs) has been obtained.

One of the solutions to increase energy savings in buildings and dwellings is to increase the thermal performance of their envelope. The use of phase change materials (PCMs) has gained attention during recent years, especially in northern climates, since they can be used to enhance the thermal inertia of light building materials. Usually, the thermal envelope of a dwelling in Chile is made of brick or wood together with light building materials such like fiber-cement, plasterboard, and thermal insulating materials as polystyrene foam. The experimental part of this work deals with the thermal characterization of an organic PCM (hexadecane), which has a relatively low phase transition temperature. The characterization involves the measurement of density, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity as a function of temperature, and the determination of phase change temperature and latent heat. The thermophysical properties were implemented in a set of thermal simulations of an actual project dwelling located in Santiago and Puerto Montt. The numerical results in terms of heat storage and temperature profiles in the envelope, and heating and cooling demands are shown for different insulation levels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy demands; EnergyPlus; Phase change material; Thermal envelope","Building materials; Cement manufacture; Electric insulating materials; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Housing; Phase change materials; Specific heat; Thermal conductivity; Thermal insulation; Wood; Energy demands; Energy plus; Low phase transition temperatures; Phase change temperature and latent heats; Temperature profiles; Thermal characterization; Thermal envelope; Thermal simulations; Thermal insulating materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049526022

In this paper, commercial Co3O4 nanoparticles/carbon composite nanofiber mats were synthesized by sol-gel electrospinning. When directly applied, such flexible negative electrodes as sodium-ion batteries, revealed high specific capacity and excellent rate performance simultaneously, which are not only attributed to the high electronic conductivity of carbon nanofiber mats that could enhance the ionic and electronic transport property, but also attributed to its three-dimensional fibrous network that could prevent the aggregation of commercial Co3O4 nanoparticles.

However, traditional carbon-based anodes are incapable of satisfying the ever-growing demand for high energy density owing to their low intrinsic theoretical capacity. Therefore, the research of post-carbon anodes (such as transition metal) for LIBs has exponentially increased. Among them, NiCo2O4 together with its composites have been widely studied by academic workers due to their high theoretical capacity and excellent electronic conductivity. In this review, the electrochemical reaction mechanism and recent progress including the synthetic method, various nanostructures and the strategies for improving performance of NiCo2O4 are summarized and discussed here. Specially, the hollow porous nanostructured NiCo2O4-based materials composed of 2D structures usually exhibit excellent capacity and stable cyclability. This review also offers some rational understandings and new thinking of the relationship between the synthetic method, morphologies, blending, current collector and electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4-based anodes.

The effects of NaCl amount, heating temperatures and heating rates on the grain size and dispersity of MnO crystals are systematically investigated, respectively. The results show that NaCl plays an important role in providing the surface to fabricate the MnO/C nanosheet composites. The thickness of MnO/C nanosheet is influenced by the amount of NaCl, and its optimal amount is 7.5 g as the weight ratio of 12.146 to Mn(Oleate)2. The dimension and morphology of the MnO nanocrystals embedded on the carbon nanosheets are affected by the heating rates and heating temperatures of NaCl@Mn(Oleate)2 particles as well.

The worried issue of solution leakage was solved by controlling its salt content below the threshold value. The microstructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Research on nitrogen adsorption suggested that because of the impregnated salt, composite sorbents presented different pore structure from pure activated alumina. Based on the measured results of water isotherms, the sorption equilibrium states represented by the mass concentration of the inside LiCl solution were evaluated. Moreover, the multistage sorption process-physical adsorption, chemical adsorption and liquid-gas solution absorption were quantitative analyzed based on the capillary condensation mechanism and hydrous reaction equation.

However, they usually demonstrate limited cycle life and inferior rate capability due to the pulverization and aggregation of active materials. V2O3 is considered to be an attractive electrode material due to its intrinsic tunnel structure provided by 3D V-V framework. Herein, a flexible and self-standing electrode of V2O3 nanoparticles embedded in porous N-doped carbon nanofibers (V2O3@PNCNFs) has been fabricated through a facile electrospinning method and subsequent thermal treatment. Electrochemical kinetic analysis, in situ XRD, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggest that the potassium storage of V2O3 is dominated by intercalation pseudocapacitance and only up to 1 mol K+ can insert into V2O3 crystal. Different from the conversion reaction in conventional transition metal oxides, in the mechanism of intercalation pseudocapacitance, K+ intercalate into the tunnels of V2O3 accompanied by a faradaic charge-transfer with no crystallographic phase change. This mechanism combines short charging/discharging times with long cycle life, which is reported in PIBs for the first time.

An experimental test setup was established in the Laboratory for Advanced Energy Materials at US-Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Energy (USPCAS-E) for investigating heat transfer during charging and discharging using butyl stearate as PCM for free-cooling application. Effects of airflow rate and different metal additions on PCM charging and discharging were also assessed. Analysis of the data indicated that the increased airflow cuts the PCM charging time but reduces the time for useful cold availability. The addition of metals like aluminum (Al) and copper (Cu) powders to the PCM enhances the heat transfer rate during the charging process by 25 and 15%, respectively.

However, the development of VO2 is hindered by the severe issues of poor electrical conductivity, large volume changes and low energy density. In this study, nano-micro structure VO2/CNTs spheres are well designed and successfully synthesized through a one-step solvothermal method, where the carbon nanotubes are inlayed throughout the whole microspheres. This unique structure enables carbon nanotubes to improve the ion and electron conductivity of VO2. Besides, it can achieve a high tap density (&gt; 1.3 g cm3) of VO2/CNTs electrode, which is higher than nanomaterials (&lt; 1.0 g cm3), and compatible with the current commercial anode materials. The Li+ storage behavior of VO2/CNTs is studied systematically in the potential range 0.01–3.0 V, it can obtain a high reversible specific capacity of 537.6 mA h g−1 at the current density of 0.05 A g−1. Furthermore, the lithium insertion/extraction reaction mechanism of nano-micro structure VO2/CNTs is clarified. The results demonstrate that the nano-micro structure relieves the volume changes during charge/discharge cycling. Therefore, it provides an insight to create functional materials with nano-micro structure for a wide range application. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Carbon nanotubes; Lithium ion battery; Nano-micro structure; Vanadium dioxide","Anodes; Carbon nanotubes; Functional materials; Ions; Microstructure; Vanadium dioxide; Yarn; Anode material for lithium ion batteries; Charge/discharge cycling; Electrical conductivity; Electron conductivity; Nano-micro structure; Reversible specific capacity; Solvothermal method; Theoretical capacity; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047607100

Several methodologies have been developed to expedite the OER process. However, producing catalysts with excellent performance still remains challenging. Herein, we successfully achieve an enhanced OER performance in amorphous (Co1-xFex)2BOy(OH)z (x = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50%) by improving electrode kinetics. The incorporation of Fe3+ not only improves the charge transfer rate, but also modulates the absorption ability of Fe3+ ions to hydroxyl, as evidenced by the decrease of 3d electron density from the Mössbauer measurement. As a consequence, (Co0.7Fe0.3)2BOy(OH)z shows a superior electrocatalytic performance with a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 308 mV and a Tafel slope of 39 mV dec−1, which are smaller than those observed for undoped parent catalyst Co2BOy(OH)z and commercial IrO2. Moreover, (Co0.7Fe0.3)2BOy(OH)z catalyst has a high stability in OER electrocatalytic process. The current density still remains about 70% after continuous electrocatalytic reaction for 12 h. (Co0.7Fe0.3)2BOy(OH)z used as anode also catalyzes overall water splitting reaction to give a current density of 20 mA cm-2 at 1.62 V when taking Pt/C catalyst as cathode.

Using a template-assisted method we demonstrate the synthesis of 3D, porous network monoliths of hybrid ZnO-graphene thin-films in various controlled configurations. The thin-film composites are realized by thermal CVD growth of few-layers graphene on macroporous nickel foam, followed by an ALD coating process of the ZnO film. Notably, the graphene shell fully preserved its network structure after performing complete chemical etching of the nickel scaffold. The challenge of ZnO layer deposition directly on the graphene surface was solved by hydrophobicity adjustment using UV-ozone treatment prior to the atomic layer deposition process. Structural and morphological characterization revealed the formation of hexagonal crystalline zinc oxide films, conformally deposited on the few-layer graphene surface, while the electrical conduction analysis indicates excellent conductivity and interlayer electrical contact for these hybrids.

Its electrochemical performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It was found that the appropriate amount of NaOH(s) can make MBP present a ladder-shaped structure or plackets on the layer edge, which may provide more active sites and channels for charge storage to improve its electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance of MBP samples exfoliated with appropriate amounts of NaOH(s) can quickly enter a relatively stable range of 110–90 F/g after the 75th cycle, and finally stabilize at about 90 F/g after thousands of cycles under the current density of 2 A/g, which demonstrates their good stability in the range of long charge/discharge cycles.

However, the use of historical solar radiation is inconvenient for thermo-economic optimization because it involves considerable computational effort for simulation. To overcome this inconvenience, we propose the thermo-economic optimization of SORC by using typical solar radiation year (TSRY). TSRY is a synthesis of typical solar radiation on the basis of historical solar radiation, indicating that TSRY can reflect the typical features of fluctuations in solar radiation in a specific area. Afterward, the multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) is selected to optimize the dynamic performance of a small-scale SORC by using the TSRY. In GA, the evaporation temperature and capacity of thermal energy storage are taken as optimization parameters, and the power output and fluctuation in power output are optimization goals. Accordingly, Pareto frontiers that optimize the SORC performance can be obtained. The effect of different parameter combinations in the Pareto frontiers and the scale of the SORC on thermo-economic are further analyzed using annual net profit as an indicator. Our analysis shows that a minimum SORC scale for profitability is set for a given location, and the profit growth rate increases as the system scale increases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Annual net profit; Organic Rankine cycle; Solar energy; TSRY","Genetic algorithms; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Profitability; Rankine cycle; Solar energy; Evaporation temperature; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Net profits; Optimization parameter; Organic Rankine cycles; Solar organic Rankine cycle; Thermoeconomic optimization; TSRY; Solar radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047056753

The receiver is a hollow concentric cylinder with inner and outer radii being 0.09 m and 0.1 m, respectively. The thickness or the gap between the two layers of the receiver is 0.01 m and is filled with heat transfer oil. The outer layer of the receiver is surrounded by the vertical cylindrical PCM tubes of diameter 0.025 m. The three modes of heat transfer, radiation, convection, and conduction, are explained and analyzed by heat transfer network. The schematic view of the receiver is shown with the help of sketchup software. The performance parameters, heat loss factor, optical efficiency factor, cooking power of the solar cooker, were calculated with and without PCM in the receiver. 7.74 W m-2 and 2.46 W m-2 are the heat loss factors, and 0.098 and 0.22 are the optical efficiency factors of the solar cooker without and with PCM presented in the receiver. The optical efficiency factor of the solar cooker with PCM receiver is two times more than that receiver without PCM. The cooking power of the solar cooker with PCM receiver is 125.3 W which is 65.6 W more than that of the cooking power without PCM receiver. From these results, it can be concluded that the design of PCM solar cooking system can expand the applicability of solar cookers as a compatible cooking solution for cooking applications instead of using fossil fuel based cooking systems. © Copyright 2018 by ASME.","Heat storage medium; Heat transfer; Optical efficiency factor; Phase change material","Efficiency; Fossil fuels; Heat losses; Heat storage; Oils and fats; Phase change materials; Solar energy; Solar equipment; Concentric cylinders; Cooking systems; Heat storage systems; Heat transfer networks; Optical efficiency; Performance parameters; SketchUp software; Storage medium; Heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046648627

A complete mathematical model, where a heliostat field was deployed and annually optimized is presented. This optimized heliostat field was then integrated with the supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) recompression Brayton cycle through a two-tank thermal storage system. Finally, exergy analysis was conducted for the entire integrated system. Molten salt was used as the medium in the storage tanks, and the analysis was performed for June 11, March 16, and December 10. The analysis was conducted for each complete day so that the storage system operated for 24 h without the need for any auxiliary heat source irrespective of the net power output of the integrated system. It was concluded that the highest and the lowest exergy destruction occurred in the central receiver system and the thermal storage system, respectively. For the month of June, the exergy destruction rate for the heliostat field and the solar tower is 1,295,605 and 156,254 kWh/day, respectively, which together constitute the total exergy destruction of the central receiver. In addition, the combined exergy destruction of all the components of supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle is 138,432 kWh/day, and for thermal storage the exergy destruction rate is 4,735 kWh/day. Furthermore, the net energy efficiency of the whole system at solar noon for the month of June, March, and December is 6.93, 5.71, and 4.45%, respectively. Lastly, the electrical second law efficiency is 7.44, 6.14, and 5.04% for the months of June, March, and December, respectively.

The experimental value of maximum encapsulation mass fractions of LiNO3-EVM, NaNO3-EVM, and KNO3-EVM is, respectively, 84.6, 85.7, and 87.0 wt%, which is lower than the theoretical value since the pore structures of EVM are not fully filled by PCMs. SEM results indicate that the PCMs are uniformly distributed and embedded into the pores or on the surfaces of EVM. The excellent chemical compatibility of PCMs with EVM is confirmed by XRD and FT-IR results. DSC tests indicate the phase change temperatures of three fs-CPCMs are between 243.1 and 325.1 °C and that latent heats are between 83.1 and 295.4 J g−1. After 100 melting/solidification cycles, the decrease in latent heats of fs-CPCMs are below 1.91%, exhibiting desirable thermal reliability.

Moist air motions are simultaneously driven by the internal heat generation and external concentration difference imposed across the enclosure. Identical porous and solid layers are attached to the vertical walls, and the walls are held at constant temperatures and concentrations. The horizontal walls of the enclosure are assumed to be adiabatic and impermeable. The aspect ratio of the cavity is equal to 1.0 and the saturating fluid is moist air (Pr = 0.7 and Le = 0.8). Present research covers the range of Rat from 103 to 107, N from −10.0 to 10.0, Da from 10−9 to 10−1, Φ from −90° to 90°, and Krf and Krs from 0.1 to 10.0. The results show that the thermal and solutal buoyancy forces are always aiding with each other and the minus sign of N only has influence on the fluid orientations. For the vertical case, heat and moisture transfer of fluid/porous interface is analyzed as a function of the buoyancy ratio. Average Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are increasing functions of Rat, N, Krp and Krs.

In this study, a carbon nanotube (CNT)-coated sponge with macro-porous structure, high surface area, and high conductivity was constructed as an anode to encapsulate Escherichia coli K12 (E. coli K12) cells. To achieve high power generation of the MFC, the optimal concentration of the CNT coating the sponge was found to be 30 mg mL−1. At this concentration, a maximum power density of 787 W m−3 and a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 80.9% were obtained with a long stable electricity generation process in batch mode. This indicates that the biofilm on the CNT (30 mg mL−1)-coated sponge possessed excellent electroactivity and stability. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images confirmed that the CNT-coated sponge provided a suitable microenvironment for E. coli K12 cells to maintain their attachment and colonization. Additionally, a CNT-dependent viability phenomenon of the E. coli K12 cells was discovered after electricity generation. This CNT-dependent viability of the E. coli K12 cells was stable and sustainable after storage at −20 °C in a milk tube for one year. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon nanotube; CNT-dependent viability; Electrogenic activity; Escherichia coli K12; Microbial fuel cell","Anodes; Chemical oxygen demand; Electric power generation; Escherichia coli; Microbial fuel cells; Scanning electron microscopy; Yarn; Chemical oxygen demand removals; CNT-dependent viability; Electricity generation; Escherichia coli K-12; High-power generation; Maximum power density; Microenvironments; Optimal concentration; Carbon nanotubes; carbon nanotube; nanocoating; carbon nanotube; Article; bacterial cell; bacterial colonization; bacterial viability; batch process; biofilm; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; electric conductivity; electric potential; electricity; electrochemistry; Escherichia coli K 12; microbial activity; microbial fuel cell; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; physical chemistry; scanning electron microscopy; storage temperature; surface area; biochemical oxygen demand; bioenergy; chemistry; cytology; electrode; growth, development and aging; immobilized cell; microbial viability; microbiology; physiology; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Biofilms; Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis; Cells, Immobilized; Electric Conductivity; Electricity; Electrodes; Escherichia coli K12; Microbial Viability; Nanotubes, Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042685215

Of importance to note in the composite materials is joint occurrence of anion doping at Li6.25La3Zr2Al0.25O12 bulks and lithiated interface at Li6.25La3Zr2Al0.25O12 grain boundaries. Lattice distortion based on Br− substitution at partial O2− sites and high densification resulted from mergence effect of LiBr have been detected in the composite electrolytes. Li-ion conductivity and transport kinetics are thereby enhanced after LiBr incorporation. Also, LiBr addition into Li6.25La3Zr2Al0.25O12 causes the appearance of finely microporous feature for the composite materials without compromising pellet densification, which can favor interfacial contact and Li-ion motion between the composite electrolytes and electrode. A full cell with a Li metal anode, the newly developed solid electrolyte, tiny amount of liquid electrolyte, and a LiCoO2 cathode has been assembled in sequence. High cycle stability of the full cell can be derived from capacity retention of 91.8% and high discharge capacity of 111.6 mAh g−1 after 70 cycles at room temperature.

The results showed that for a square heat storage unit with 20 mm diameter of the center heating tube and 6400 mm2 cross- sectional area, the melting and solidification time of PCM are first decreasing and then increasing with the increase of ratio of width-height. Especially, when the ratio of width-height is 1.56, the melting time of PCM is shortest, and this ratio of width-height is defined as the optimum melting ratio of width-height.

Owing to the anisotropic self-assembly of iron selenide, rod-like FeSe2 coates with nitrogen-doped carbon is prepared through the thermal reaction of Prussian blue with selenium. Notably, the cyano groups are effectively transformed into N-doped carbon with FeNC bonds, which uniformly coats FeSe2, prompting Na+ transportations. Interestingly, the particle size is tailored by heating rates, along with increased carbon content, leading to broadened energy levels for redox reaction. Bestowed by these advantages, the FeSe2/N-C as Na-storage anode delivers impressive electrochemical properties. Even at a rather high rate of 10.0 A g−1, a considerable capacity of 308 mAh g−1 is yielded over 10 000 loops. Supported by the detailed analysis of kinetic features, reduced size of particles could bring about the enhanced contributions of pseudocapacitive and quickening rate of ions transferring. The phase evolutions are further investigated by in situ EIS and ex-situ technologies. The work is expected to provide a new strategy to prepare metal-selenide with controllable size and induce the faster kinetic of high-rate materials. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To study thermal performance of the PCM wall and optimize the application of PCMs, a thermal performance testing equipment was designed and the case that solar light suddenly irradiated the PCM layer in daylight and disappeared at night in an air-conditioning room was experimental and numerical simulated. Results show that PCM layers can change the absorptivity of the wall, and then improve surface temperature and heat flux in heat storage process. The addition of the PCM to the wall can enhance the heat storage in the wall. Besides, the wall surface temperature in heat release process was improved. To make the heat released constantly in a long time at night, the PCM with proper phase change temperature, narrow phase change range and large latent heat should be chosen.

However, the oxygen-involving process inevitably leads to instability of the oxygen framework and ultimately lattice oxygen release from the surface, which incurs capacity decline, voltage fading, and poor kinetics. Herein, it is identified that this predicament can be diminished by constructing a spinel Li4Mn5O12 coating, which is inherently stable in the lattice framework to prevent oxygen release of the lithium-rich layered oxides at the deep delithiated state. The controlled KMnO4 oxidation strategy ensures uniform and integrated encapsulation of Li4Mn5O12 with structural compatibility to the layered core. With this layer suppressing oxygen release, the related phase transformation and catalytic side reaction that preferentially start from the surface are consequently hindered, as evidenced by detailed structural evolution during Li+ extraction/insertion. The heterostructure cathode exhibits highly competitive energy-storage properties including capacity retention of 83.1% after 300 cycles at 0.2 C, good voltage stability, and favorable kinetics. These results highlight the essentiality of oxygen framework stability and effectiveness of this spinel Li4Mn5O12 coating strategy in stabilizing the surface of lithium-rich layered oxides against lattice oxygen escaping for designing high-performance cathode materials for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this work, we propose a highly ordered porous electrolyte additive derived from SSZ-13 for high-rate all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. The nanoporous adsorption effect provided by the highly ordered porous nanoparticles in the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolyte is found to significantly improve the Li+ conductivity (1.91 × 10-3 S cm-1 at 60 °C, 4.43 × 10-5 S cm-1 at 20 °C) and widen the electrochemical stability window to 4.7 V vs Li+/Li. Meanwhile, the designed PEO-based electrolyte demonstrates enhanced stability with the lithium metal anode. Through systematically increasing Li+ diffusion, widening the electrochemical stability window, and enhancing the interfacial stability of the SSZ-composite electrolyte (CPE) electrolyte, the LiFePO4/SSZ-CPE/Li cell is optimized to deliver high rate capability and stable cycling performance, which demonstrates great potential for all-solid-state energy storage application.

Minimizing the overall monetary cost and maximizing the use of renewable energy sources are not the exclusive optimization goals, but also guaranteeing the thermal comfort is an important goal. This paper deals with a comprehensive approach of a mixed-integer quadratic-programming model predictive control scheme based on the thermal building model and the building energy management system. Calculating the global optima while handling continuous and binary constraints as well as variables and considering both the thermal and electrical part of a smart home are the key aspect of the proposed model predictive controller. By inclusion of disturbance forecasts, occupancy prediction, and individual user weights the control scheme is optimally suited for implementation in real buildings. Furthermore, the occupancy prediction in this research is based on an unsupervised method, which is useful for an effective implementation. This work demonstrates the optimal management of appliances such as heating, a battery storage, a freezer, a dishwasher, a photo-voltaic system, and the opportunities to buy from and sell to the smart grid.

Metal foam, as an effective additive to enhance the effective thermal conductive coefficient of phase change materials, has been wildly used in the LTES system. In support of the future space exploration, solid–liquid phase change within metal foam under different gravitational accelerations and corresponding heat transfer characteristics are investigated in this work to enhance understanding of heat transfer capability in reduced gravity conditions. A pore-scale lattice Boltzmann method with the double distribution functions is developed to study the solid–liquid phase change problems with the natural convection heat transfer in metal foam. Here, microstructure of metal foam is experimentally obtained by the use of X-ray computed tomography. Two numerical validation cases are performed, one for fluid–solid conjugate heat transfer problem, and the other for melting process in a square cavity without the porous media. The presented lattice Boltzmann results are in good agreement with previous analytical and numerical results. Based on the analysis of temperature and velocity fields during melting within metal foam, it is found that the clockwise circulation, caused by the temperature gradient, leads to the inhomogeneous distribution of liquid–solid interface along vertical direction. What's more, gravity effects on the temperature and velocity fields together with the average Nusselt number and liquid fraction coefficient are investigated. Results show that with the decrease of gravitational accelerations from 1g to 0g, the maximum vertical velocity reduces and the thickness of velocity boundary layer thickens accordingly, and results in the pronounced reduction of average Nusselt number and melting rate. The natural convection appears to be even more tenuous as gravitational acceleration decreases, leading to the dominant heat transfer mechanism transited from convection to conduction, and finally alleviating the phase change process. The liquid fraction under 0g, 0.01g and 0.1g conditions are 54.6%, 58.9% and 67.9% respectively of that under 1g conditions at Fo = 0.06. In addition, porosity effects on phase change heat transfer characteristics are discussed by comparing the liquid fraction with porosity of 0.9, 0.94 and 1. It is found that metal foam with lower porosity shows higher effective thermal conductivity and outstanding heat transfer performance, while the restriction on natural convection should not be neglected, especially for melting region which is dominated by natural convection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Gravity effect; Lattice Boltzmann method; Metal foam; Phase change; Pore scale","Boundary layers; Computational fluid dynamics; Computerized tomography; Conductive materials; Distribution functions; Heat storage; Kinetic theory; Liquids; Mechanical permeability; Melting; Metal melting; Metals; Natural convection; Nusselt number; Phase change materials; Phase interfaces; Porosity; Sailing vessels; Space research; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Velocity; Conjugate heat transfer problem; Effective thermal conductivity; Gravity effects; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Lattice Boltzmann method; Phase Change; Pore scale; Thermal conductive coefficient; Metal foams; gravity; heat transfer; numerical method; phase transition; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045086982

For that, Ag/5A and Ni/5A zeolites with different amounts of metal (4, 10 and 20 wt%) were prepared by wet impregnation method. The physicochemical characterization of the adsorbents was carried out by N2-adsorption, AAS, XRD, FTIR, FE-SEM/EDS, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD and TGA-DSC analyses. The results showed that the incorporated metals were well distributed in different sites into the 5A zeolite, without a substantial modification of its crystal structure and morphological characteristics. Water vapor uptake and water enthalpy adsorption of zeolites were determined simultaneously by a non-isothermal method in a TGA-DSC thermal analyzer, prior saturation of samples with water vapor. It was found that the water molecules adsorption by the metal/zeolites was carried out on different adsorption sites with different interaction energies. Furthermore, it was noted that Ag and Ni metals had a remarkable influence on water adsorption properties of zeolites.

In this work, we propose a practical design method of thermal concentration utilizing fiber reinforced composite microstructures. The effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of the microstructure is determined using effective medium theory, and the ETC is designed to meet the perfect conductivity profile calculated by the transformation thermodynamics approach. In the design, we choose microstructures with appropriate fiber volume fractions to match with the required conductivity distribution. Numerical examination is performed to verify the thermal concentrating effects. In the numerical model, we use stainless steel and air as the fiber material and matrix material, respectively. The proposed thermal concentrator can be easily fabricated by naturally available materials, which paves a new avenue for thermal harvesting in solar cells, thermal energy storage and other related fields. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","fiber reinforced composite; microstructures; thermal concentration; transformation thermodynamics","Design; Fiber reinforced plastics; Heat storage; Microstructure; Reinforcement; Solar cells; Steel fibers; Conductivity distributions; Effective medium theories; Effective thermal conductivity; Fiber reinforced composites; Fiber volume fractions; Numerical examination; Practical design method; Thermal concentration; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049966602

However, the lack of suitable electrodes to host large K+ for rapid as well as reversible insertion/extraction hinders the developments of KIBs. As an attempt, the phosphoric acid doped SnO2-graphene-carbon (P-SGC) nanofibers synthesized with a facile electrospinning method are introduced and applied as anode materials for KIBs. The P-SGC anodes present a reversible capacity of 285.9 mAh g-1 over 60 cycles at the current density of 100 mA g-1, and the high rate capacity of 208.53 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 as well.

Here, we design aqueous hybrid Na-Zn batteries by using a carbon-coated Zn (Zn@C) anode, 8 M NaClO4 + 0.4 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 concentrated electrolyte coupled with NASICON-structured cathodes. The Zn@C anode achieves stable Zn stripping/plating and improved kinetics without Zn dendrite formation due to the porous carbon film facilitating homogeneous current distribution and Zn deposition. Furthermore, the concentrated electrolyte offers a large electrochemical window (∼2.5 V) and permits stable cycling of cathodes.

However, their development still stays at the infancy stage due to the lack of suitable electrode materials with reversible depotassiation/potassiation behavior, resulting in poor rate performance, low capacity, and cycling stability. Herein, the first example of synthesizing single-crystalline metallic graphene-like VSe2 nanosheets for greatly boosting the performance of KIBs in term of capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability is reported. Benefiting from the unique 2D nanostructure, high electron/K+-ion conductivity, and outstanding pseudocapacitance effects, ultrathin VSe2 nanosheets show a very high reversible capacity of 366 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1, a high rate capability of 169 mAh g−1 at 2000 mA g−1, and a very low decay of 0.025% per cycle over 500 cycles, which are the best in all the reported anode materials in KIBs. The first-principles calculations reveal that VSe2 nanosheets have large adsorption energy and low diffusion barriers for the intercalation of K+-ion. Ex situ X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that VSe2 nanosheets undertake a reversible phase evolution by initially proceeding with the K+-ion insertion within VSe2 layers, followed by the conversion reaction mechanism. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

One way of improving the performance of a latent thermal energy storage system is by implementing the multiple phase change materials (PCMs) design. The behavior of a packed bed latent heat thermal energy storage system at different cases is numerically analyzed. The molten salt is considered for the heat transfer fluid (HTF) with phase change material (PCM) capsules as the filler. In this design, spherical capsules filled with PCMs of different thermo-physical properties are used. The capsules are packed in the bed at different sections based on the PCM melting temperature. The model developed using the Concentric-Dispersion (C-D) equations. The governing equations are solved in MATLAB, and the results obtained are validated against experimental data from the literature. The performance of the systems is calculated. The results show that the three-stage PCMs system with different melting point exhibited the highest energy and exergy efficiency during a charging discharging cycle. Moreover, results show that the three-stage PCMs unit can improve the heat transfer rate greatly and shorten the heat storage time effectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrating solar power; Melting temperature; Phase change material; Spherical capsule","Digital storage; Dispersions; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Latent heat; Melting point; Packed beds; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Concentrating solar power; Energy and exergy efficiency; High temperature thermal energy storages; Latent heat thermal energy storage systems; Latent thermal energy storages; Numerical comparison; Spherical capsule; Thermo-physical property; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047190055

However, these batteries still suffer from many critical issues, such as low capacity, poor cycle life, and low round-trip efficiency, rendering the practical application of these batteries rather sluggish. Cathode catalysts with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and evolution reaction activities are of particular importance for addressing these issues and consequently promoting the application of Li–O2 batteries. Thus, the rational design and preparation of the catalysts with high ORR activity, good electronic conductivity, and decent chemical/electrochemical stability are still challenging. In this Review, the strategies are outlined including the rational selection of catalytic species, the introduction of a 3D porous structure, the formation of functional composites, and the heteroatom doping which succeeded in the design of high-performance cathode catalysts for stable Li–O2 batteries. Perspectives on enhancing the overall electrochemical performance of Li–O2 batteries based on the optimization of the properties and reliability of each part of the battery are also made.

Nevertheless, owing to its insulating nature, a formidable challenge remains as to realize high rate capability. Herein, Na2+2xFe2-x(SO4)3/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been designed and realized by a facile one-stepped synthesis. Its structural, morphological and electrochemical properties have been characterized and compared with those of the bare NFS material. As a result, NFS/rGO cathode demonstrates enhanced electrochemical performance, as reflected by the initial specific capacity of 90 mAh g−1 and a high specific capacity of 80 mAh g−1 over 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 C (1 C = 120 mA g−1), an excellent rate capability with specific capacity of 60 mAh g−1 at high current density of 20 C (2.4 A g−1) and long-term cycle life with capacity retention of 84% over 500 cycles at 20 C rate (2.4 A g−1). This improvement may be attributed to the high electronic conductivity of rGO, which facilitates the charge transfer reactions between the active materials and electrolyte interface, and promotes the sodium ion diffusion in the electrode.

Despite intensive efforts, most electrode materials exhibit areal capacities lower than that of the graphite anodes (4 mA h cm−2). An effective and low-cost approach is reported to attain a high areal capacity via an intense densification by compacting a porous carbon nanotube sponge grafted with Co3O4 nanoparticles. The hybrid sponge can be compacted to a large degree (up to a tenfold densification) while still keeping its structural integrity and the 3D porous network.

However, traditional carbon anode materials usually show poor performance in KIBs due to the large size of K ions. Herein, a carbonization-etching strategy is reported for making a class of sulfur (S) and oxygen (O) codoped porous hard carbon microspheres (PCMs) material as a novel anode for KIBs through pyrolysis of the polymer microspheres (PMs) composed of a liquid crystal/epoxy monomer/thiol hardener system. The as-made PCMs possess a porous architecture with a large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area (983.2 m2 g−1), an enlarged interlayer distance (0.393 nm), structural defects induced by the S/O codoping and also amorphous carbon nature. These new features are important for boosting potassium ion storage, allowing the PCMs to deliver a high potassiation capacity of 226.6 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 over 100 cycles and be displaying high stability by showing a potassiation capacity of 108.4 mA h g−1 over 2000 cycles at 1000 mA g−1. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate that S/O codoping not only favors the adsorption of K to the PCMs electrode but also reduces its structural deformation during the potassiation/depotassiation. The present work highlights the important role of hierarchical porosity and S/O codoping in potassium storage. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Therefore, engineering transition metal oxides into three-dimensional (3D) carbon networks as anodes is expected to achieve long cycling life and excellent rate performance. Here, we report a facile and environmental friendly method for the in-situ synthesis of 3D carbon coated bimetallic oxides with porous network structure. The carbon matrix originates from citric acid, which can be used as food additive. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between ultrafine metal oxides and the conductive carbon layers, the as-synthesized ZnO-CoO nanoparticles dispersed in the porous carbon network (ZnO-CoO@C) exhibit faster lithium diffusion kinetics and significantly improved specific capacity at various current densities and extended cycling life (503 mAh g−1 after 700 cycles at 2000 mA g−1). Full-cell assemblies using ZnO-CoO@C as anode and the commercially available material NCM523 as cathode, display a high charging capacity of 94 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1.

The assistant ionic conductor is achieved by impregnating an ionic liquid (Li-IL) into a porous metal-organic framework (MOF) host. When integrated with LLZO solid-state electrolyte (SSE), the solidified Li-IL guest can make direct contact with the LLZO particles through the open channels in MOF host, which changes the original unstable solid-solid contact into “nanowetted” interfaces to boost Li+ transport. Benefited from the unique nanowetted interfaces, the hybrid SSE demonstrates a high ionic conductivity of 1.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 with a wide electrochemical window of 5.2 V, and also exhibits excellent compatibility with Li metal anode. Furthermore, the LLZO based LiCoO4 and LiFePO4 SSBs with the ionic conductor additive to favor the interfacial Li+ transport achieve high capacity retention of 97% after 150 cycles with reasonable rate capability. The good electrochemical performance is attributed to the effective Li+ transport networks established inside the SSBs by the ionic conductor through the nanowetted interfacial mechanism, which is proved to be a promising approach to the safe and high-power energy storage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Interfacial Li+ transports; Ionic conductors; Nanowetted interfaces; Solid-state batteries","Crystalline materials; Electric batteries; Interface states; Ionic conduction in solids; Ionic conductivity; Ionic liquids; Iron compounds; Lithium compounds; Ore sinter; Organometallics; Solid state devices; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical window; Interfacial Li^+ transports; Interfacial mechanism; Interfacial resistances; Ionic conductor; Solid state batteries; Solid-state electrolyte; Solid electrolytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046848835

Water salinity reduces evaporation, and as a result affects the energy budget of the lake, including stored heat. In this study, we explore the seasonal and diurnal variations of evaporation and other energy fluxes over the Dead Sea, the deepest and saltiest hypersaline lake on Earth. We present two consecutive years observations using Eddy Covariance system, meteorological stations and a buoy station measuring the water column properties. These observations reveal the effects of synoptic and mesoscale atmospheric circulation on lake evaporation. The seasonal cycle of evaporation is characterized by two peaks. The summer evaporation peak is related to high radiation inputs. The winter peak stem from the high heat storage of the deep lake, with evaporation driven by high vapor pressure demand, combined with synoptic scale wind systems and thermal instability. In summer, the synoptic circulation is stable, providing a weak background wind velocity (Persian trough), hence, the dominant diurnal wind pattern is induced by the Mediterranean Sea Breeze (mesoscale circulation). The two years of eddy covariance measurements in the hypersaline Dead Sea, located in a hyperarid region, revealed annual evaporation rate of 1.13 ± 0.13 m yr−1. We explored several evaporation models versus the directly measured evaporation, and found that the most reliable is a mass transfer model, that was calibrated here for the Dead Sea. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Eddy covariance; Net radiation; Thermal stability; Vapor pressure difference; Water activity; Wind speed","Budget control; Heat storage; Hydrostatic pressure; Lakes; Mass transfer; Meteorology; Thermodynamic stability; Wind; Eddy covariance; Net radiation; Vapor pressure differences; Water activity; Wind speed; Evaporation; atmospheric circulation; buoy system; diurnal variation; eddy covariance; energy flux; evaporation; hypersaline environment; lake; net radiation; pressure gradient; seasonal variation; synoptic meteorology; vapor pressure; water column; wind velocity; Dead Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046664238

Precisely, the pond was exposed to meteorological data of the Agafay site (located 30 km south of Marrakesh-Morocco) covering the period from January 2015 to May 2017. We considered three different heat extraction technics (HET) including the reference one (R-HET) that limits the heat draw to the heat storage zone using horizontal tubes. The other two methods consider an additional heat draw from the intermediate non-convective zone using horizontal (HT-HET) and vertical (VT-HET) tubes. We elaborated a transient mathematical model based on energy balance equations for the pond (including the ground) and the extraction's tubes. This model was solved using a MATLAB code based on the fully implicit finite-difference scheme that has been developed for this purpose. The study focuses on the examination of the thermal performances of the considered SGSP for each of the three heat extraction methods based on energetic and exergetic analysis. The obtained results reveal that the third method of heat extraction (VT-HET) provides higher energy and exergy efficiencies by reducing the total heat losses towards the pond's surroundings and saving exergy from destruction. The amount of energy/exergy extraction improvement recorded is around 22.5%/30% compared to the reference heat extraction technic (R-HET) against an improvement of only 1.7%/0.6% for the HT-HET. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy and exergy efficiencies; Heat exchangers; Heat extraction; Salt gradient solar pond; Thermal storage","Digital storage; Exergy; Extraction; Finite difference method; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Lakes; MATLAB; Meteorology; Solar water heaters; Energetic and exergetic analysis; Energy and exergy analysis; Energy and exergy efficiency; Energy balance equations; Fully implicit finite differences; Heat extraction; Salt gradient solar pond; Thermal storage; Solar ponds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046336545

Our target is to enhance the PCMs thermal conductivity without evidently altering other thermal property criteria. Herein, we propose a facile, low-cost and controllable strategy to construct compactly interconnected 3D celosia-like highly graphitized thermally conductive network carbon via carbon quantum dots (CQDs) deriving from acetone and divinyl benzene (DVB). Novel function of CQDs is firstly developed for superior thermal energy harvesting, thus expanding their conventional fluorescence and catalysis field to novel thermal energy storage. Importantly, our constructed 3D graphitized network carbon better infiltrates macromolecule polyethylene glycol (PEG) and fully releases crystallization via controllable crosslinking reaction. This strategy simultaneously integrates sufficient power capacity and incremental thermal conductivity (enhanced by 236%) of the PCMs, and thermal enthalpy is considerably approaching the theoretical value. Alternatively, the composite PCMs are thermally and durably stable. These results indicate that resulting shape-stabilized PCMs are a very promising candidate for renewable thermal energy storage in virtue of the superior comprehensive properties. © 2018","3D network carbon; Carbon quantum dots; Divinyl benzene; Phase change materials; Thermal energy storage","Acetone; Benzene; Benzene refining; Carbon; Crosslinking; Energy harvesting; Graphitization; Heat storage; Nanocrystals; Phase change materials; Semiconductor quantum dots; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; 3D networks; Carbon quantum dots; Comprehensive properties; Conductive networks; Crosslinking reaction; Divinyl benzenes; Low thermal conductivity; Theoretical values; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045623524

However, several major hurdles to address are poor rate performances and the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, a facile strategy to tailor hard carbons with graphitic nanostructures and rational specific surface area is proposed to improve sodium storage. Resin-derived carbon nanobroccolis (CNB) with in situ decorated graphitic nanostructures have been successfully synthesized by self-assembly and low-temperature catalytic carbonization process. As a result, attribute to in situ tailored graphitic nanostructures in hard carbons and rational specific surface area, CNB electrodes possess less charge transfer resistance and excellent sodium ions diffusion kinetics and successfully achieve fast and efficient sodium storage. When used as anode for sodium-ion batteries, CNB electrodes exhibit excellent high-rate capability of 137 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 and enhanced ICE of 52.6%.

With respect to her continued dependence on oil and gas and seasonal variations on water level for hydropower, immediate reliable and steady electricity generation in the country is not guaranteed. Incorporating alternative source of energy like solar is a solution. Solar Chimney technology is not yet technically and economically mature, as investment on it is still low, thereby posing more financial risks at least at the megawatt capacity. Photovoltaic and Solar Thermal technologies are technically and economically more established, but they can only ensure 24-h power supply with the aid of energy storage systems. Solar thermal value addition is on its propensity for thermal energy storage and hybridization with liquid fuels at commercial capacity. Hence, due to technology advancement and the country's high direct normal irradiation potential, concentrating solar power is the more suitable solar power technology for commercial electricity generation in Nigeria. In this paper, concentrating solar power technologies are analysed under operational, environmental and social conditions in Nigeria using data from desktop survey to determine the most suitable technology for solar thermal electric power plant. It is observed that the technical maturity of parabolic trough concentrator distinguishes it for preference to all other technologies and would exert moderate pressure on land requirement even though, it is the most expensive and water demanding technology. In terms of unit cost of electricity and water usage capabilities, parabolic dish concentrator is least expensive and uses least water but lacks proven commercial application. Solar tower is technically simpler and possesses better thermodynamic properties than the rest but its low installed capacity increases its financing risk. Hence, the trough system is the most suitable for immediate and medium term projects given its proven technology maturity and flexible financing mechanism. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrating solar power; Direct normal irradiance; Nigeria; Renewable energy; Solar electric power plant; Solar power","Concentration (process); Digital storage; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric power plants; Electric power systems; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Heat storage; Investments; Solar chimneys; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Water levels; Concentrating solar power; Direct normal irradiances; Nigeria; Parabolic dish concentrator; Parabolic trough concentrators; Renewable energies; Solar thermal technology; Unit cost of electricity; Electric power transmission networks",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044620758

In this work, we simultaneously designed the heterogeneous component and structure of the novel hybrid based on Kirkendall effect. The composite was composed of quasi-hexagonal Cu 1.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 nanoplates as a shell and CuO with voids as a core. The hybrids were characterized by using XRD, FTIR, TEM and SEM. It was found that the heating rate greatly influences the combination form of Cu 1.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 and CuO. The quasi-hexagonal Cu 1.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 nanoplates were assembled into branch-like shell decorated on the CuO surface under the low heating rate. However, the high heating rate led to a compact Cu 1.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 shell, although the shell was also assembled by quasi-hexagonal nanoplates. The reasonable formation mechanism of the unique component and structure was proposed. Such a hybrid with the branch-like shell exhibited the best lithium storage performance. The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the unique component and structure.

In this work, carbon-coated CoP 3 (CoP 3 @C) nanocomposites have been obtained by a high energy mechanical milling and used as an anode of sodium ion battery for the first time, showing a larger discharge capacity, longer cycling life and better rate capability as compared to plain CoP 3 . The superior performance is not only originated from significantly enhanced diffusion kinetics associating with the improvement of electron conductivity and volume change based on the presence of carbon layer, but also attributed to the partially pseudocapacitive behaviors of the redox reaction to construct a rapid electron transport pathway. In addition, the XRD and TEM analysis reveal that the Na-storage mechanism of the CoP 3 @C anode involves a conversion reaction from CoP 3 to Na 3 P and metallic Co at the initial discharge and charge state.

In the as-fabricated hybrid structure, high-capacity (Fe,Co)3O4 sub-microparticles (zero-dimension) and Co3O4 nano-rods (one-dimension) are composited with highly conductive network of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nano-sheets (two-dimension). Benefiting from the unique architecture, the volume expansion of (Fe,Co)3O4, Co3O4 during charging/discharging and their direct exposure to the electrolyte have been effectively alleviated by the spatially confining effects of rGO nano-sheets. On the other hand, the intrinsic wrinkle morphology of graphene nano-sheets was alleviated by the nano-rods support, leading to enhanced transportation mobility of electrons and ions. Furthermore, the formed hierarchical pores effectively increase the reaction sites and kinetics. As a result, the as-built electrode of the ternary composite shows remarkably cycling stability (1668.5 mAh g−1 for the first cycle and 80.97% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1) and rate capability (341.6 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1), which are much superior to those of binary composites.

However, the intrinsic poor electroconductivity and side effects like volume expansion of Cr2O3 severely limit its capacity and cyclability at high charge/discharge rates. To address the problem, the amorphous Cr2O3/N-doped carbon nanosheets (denoted as a-Cr2O3/NC) have been designed and prepared by an easy one-step solution combustion synthesis method from a uniform solution of chromium nitrate, glucose, and glycine. The as-synthesized a-Cr2O3/NC consist of amorphous Cr2O3 particles and N-doped carbon sheet, where the amorphous Cr2O3 is evenly encapsulated in the carbon sheet support. An anode prepared from the synthesized a-Cr2O3/NC demonstrates much higher specific capacity and better cycling performance than the crystalline Cr2O3 anode. Upon extended cycling, the a-Cr2O3/NC anode exhibits good long-term stability and its reversible capacity retains as high as 782.4 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1. Such good performance stems from its unique structure. The amorphous structure of Cr2O3 can furnish a mass of enterable active sites which can favor the lithium ions insertion/extraction, whereas the sheet-like N-doped carbon support can increase the electroconductivity and facilitate the transportation of lithium ions and electrons. © 2018 The American Ceramic Society","amorphous; anode materials; Cr2O3/C nanosheets; solution combustion synthesis","Amino acids; Amorphous carbon; Amorphous materials; Anodes; Combustion synthesis; Doping (additives); Electric conductivity; Electrodes; Lithium; Mass transportation; Nanosheets; Amorphous structures; Anode material; High charge/discharge rates; High energy densities; Lithium storage properties; Long term stability; Reversible capacity; Solution combustion synthesis; Chromium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042064033

To achieve high Coulombic efficiencies in SiOx-based anodes, a new class of Sn2Fe@SiOx composites have been fabricated by ball milling, to greatly enhance the reversibility of conversion reactions in lithiated SiOx. In this multiple-phase composite, the in-situ formed nanosized Sn2Fe are firmly attached on the SiOx surfaces to build up insulated/metallic interfaces, which can promote the Li extracting from Li-Si-O glass and regenerating of SiOx during de-lithiation. The Sn2Fe@SiOx composites contribute high ICE values up to 78%, among the highest values reported so far for SiOx-based powder anodes. In addition, the Sn2Fe@SiOx composites demonstrate large stable capacities of 700 mAh/g at 200 mA/g with Coulombic efficiencies beyond 99%, and superlong lifetime of more than 1000 cycles at high rate of 1000 mA/g. All these data indicate the promising potential of Sn2Fe@SiOx as an interface material for high-performance anodes. Furthermore, both the material design strategy and fabrication method are simple, cost effective, and scalable, we hope this work can be beneficial in paving the way towards the solution of the reversibility issue of other conversion-type anode materials for high energy Li-ion batteries. © 2018","Conversion reaction; Initial Coulombic efficiency; Interface; Silicon suboxide anode; Tin alloys","Ball milling; Binary alloys; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Industrial research; Interfaces (materials); Lithium-ion batteries; Silicon compounds; Tin alloys; Conversion reactions; Coulombic efficiency; Fabrication method; High-performance anodes; Initial Coulombic efficiency; Interface materials; Material designs; Silicon sub oxides; Anodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041552909

In this study, a hierarchically porous sulfur- and oxygen-co-doped carbon (PSOC) is obtained through direct carbon dioxide activation of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) with abundant sulfur and oxygen atoms in the polymer backbone. Both sulfur and oxygen heteroatoms are introduced into carbon matrix through a rational preparation approach. The morphology, microstructure, and chemical property of the as-prepared PSOC have been analyzed by using various characterization methods, including scanning/transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen sorption test, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. PSOC displays a high specific surface area (1160 m2 g−1) and hierarchically porous structure (micropores, mesopores, and macropores). Owing to its excellent surface property and porosity parameters, PSOC exhibits a good gas adsorption capacity (carbon dioxide: 16.6 wt %; methane: 2.7 wt %) at 273 K under 1.0 bar when used as a gas sorbent. In addition, PSOC as an anode material shows a high reversible capacity of 931 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and excellent cycling performance (504 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 200 cycles). As a result, the as-prepared PSOC demonstrates a promising potential in the fields of gas adsorption and energy storage. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon dioxide activation; Gas adsorption; Heteroatom-doping; Lithium-ion battery; Porous carbon","Adsorption; Anodes; Carbon dioxide; Chemical activation; Chemical analysis; Electric batteries; Gas adsorption; Gases; Oxygen; Porosity; Porous materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Secondary batteries; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Carbon dioxide activation; Characterization methods; Heteroatoms; High reversible capacities; High specific surface area; Physicochemical property; Poly-3 ,4-ethylenedioxythiophene; Porous carbons; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041491420

However, it is technically challenging, in particular, for the simultaneous estimation of battery internal impedance and state-of-charge, which are two key state variables affecting battery performance. This paper reveals that the commonly used state-of-charge estimation schemes based on Bayesian filters are fundamentally flawed in taking state constraints into account. Constrained Bayesian dual filtering framework for parameter estimation and state-of-charge estimation are designed in this paper to improve the estimation accuracy and robustness. After a state-of-charge and open-circuit-voltage mapping is accurately identified, a dual-filtering framework is introduced to simultaneously estimate the state-of-charge and model parameters which gives rise to the dynamics. The inequality constraints of state variables in Bayesian dual-filtering framework are also taken into account. The state-of-charge and model parameter estimation results of the constrained dual-filtering are regarded as the mean of constraints. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted to validate that the proposed method is superior over existing methods in providing improved accuracy and robustness. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian filtering; Constrained state estimation; lithium-ion battery model; System identification","Charging (batteries); Constraint theory; Electric batteries; Fault detection; Identification (control systems); Ions; Lithium; Lithium-ion batteries; Open circuit voltage; Parameter estimation; Secondary batteries; Bayesian filtering; Comparative experiments; Constrained state estimation; Energy storage systems; Lithium ions; Model parameter estimation; Simultaneous estimation; State-of-charge estimation; Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041470049

Finally a new protective layer on the surface of Li foil was formed. This protective layer could not only effectively stabilize the interphase of lithium anode, but also suppress the formation of dendritic lithium.

The integrated power generation plant consists of the solar field that is represented by parabolic trough solar collectors (PTSCs), a thermal energy storage system, and a power block. The effect of dispersing copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles into Therminol VP-1 and Syltherm 800 fluids is investigated. The effect of the nanofluids on the power output, energetic and exergetic efficiencies, and entropy generation of the PTSC is studied, in addition to their effect on the output performances and cost parameters of the ISPGP for 2 modes of operation. The first mode of operation assumes no storage, while the second mode of operation assumes a storage period of 7 hours. The most efficient nanofluids are selected to replace Therminol and Syltherm. Yearly, monthly, and daily analyses are carried to study the magnitude of improvement that is caused by the nanofluids on the performance of the PTSC and ISPGP. The simulation results show that the presence of the nanofluids decreased the pressure drop inside the PTSC and lowered the required pumping power. Moreover, it is established that 5% Cu/Therminol and 4% Ag/Therminol are the best replacements for Therminol for the first and second modes of operation, respectively; 5% Ag/Syltherm is the best replacement for Syltherm for both modes of operation. The monthly power output of the PTSC is increased by 11.1% and 11.7% when 5% Cu/Therminol and 4% Ag/Therminol are used, whereas an increase of 18.2% occurs when 5% Ag/Syltherm is used. The nanofluids increased the total power output of the ISPGP while decreasing the levelized cost of electricity (LEC). For instance, when comparing 5 % Ag/Syltherm with Syltherm, the annual energy output increased from 121 to 125 GWh, while the LEC decreased from 5.86 to 5.70 c/kWh. In addition, it is proven that the ISPGP performs better when the thermal energy storage system is used. For example, when Therminol is used, the annual energy output of the ISPGP increased from 123 to 208 GWh and the LEC was lowered from 5.75 to 4.11 c/kWh.

Here we demonstrate an eco-friendly, low-cost zinc-iodine battery with an aqueous electrolyte, wherein active I2 is confined in a nanoporous carbon cloth substrate. The electrochemical reaction is confined in the nanopores as a single conversion reaction, thus avoiding the production of I3− intermediates. The cathode architecture fully utilizes the active I2, showing a capacity of 255 mAh·g−1 and low capacity cycling fading. The battery provides an energy density of ∼ 151 Wh·kg−1 and exhibits an ultrastable cycle life of more than 1,500 cycles.

Here, a simple and effective approach is proposed for the rational design and preparation of hierarchical three-d imensional (3D) amorphous N-doped carbon nanotube@MoS2 nanosheets (3D-ANCNT@MoS2) via a simple hydrothermal method, followed by an annealing process. With such a unique nanoarchitecture, ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets grown on the external surfaces of polypyrrole-derived ANCNTs are assembled to form a hierarchical 3D nanoarchitecture, where the adopted ANCNTs serve not only as the template and continuous conductive matrix, but can also prevent MoS2 from aggregating and restacking, and help to buffer the volumetric expansion of MoS2 during cycling. More importantly, when evaluated as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the 3D-ANCNT@MoS2 composite exhibits excellent cycling stability, superior rate performance, and reversible specific capacity as high as 893.4 mAh•g-1 at 0.2 A•g-1 after 200 cycles in a half battery, and 669.4 mAh•g-1 at 0.2 A•g-1 after 100 cycles in the 3D-ANCNT@MoS2//LiCoO2 full battery. With respect to sodium-ion batteries, the outstanding reversible capacity, excellent rate behavior, and good cycling performance of 3D-ANCNT@MoS2 composites are also achieved.

On the other hand, the investigation of phase change materials (PCMs) in the building sector was tested consisting a very promising field of research and development. A number of substances have been tested as potential PCMs; however, only few of them have been further developed for commercial purposes. This is attributed to a number of thermophysical barriers, which make the applications of PCMs in buildings difficult. Several studies have examined the potential of PCM use, either incorporated into building envelopes or in heating and cooling applications. Regarding building envelope applications, PCMs are used to mainly ensure indoor thermal comfort and contribute to energy performance. The positive impact of PCMs on the building's annual cooling and heating loads in various climate zones is a common conclusion. Concerning heating and cooling applications, the main idea has been to substitute the storage medium with PCMs, which have higher storage capacity. Hence, the use of PCMs can be considered as scientifically mature, although there are still technical, environmental, and economic barriers. The present study is the state of the art of the existing research of PCM for thermal applications taking into consideration environmental (based mainly on life cycle analysis methodology) and economic performance (accounting to life cycle cost analysis methodology) criteria, while excluding solar power generation applications.

Although the induced safety concerns, inferior rate, and cycling performance severely hinder the commercialization of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) and sodium metal batteries (SMBs), the recent development of nanotechnology-based solutions really revives the lithium/sodium metal anodes for high-energy batteries. In this work, an ultrastable carbon textile (CT)-based host with excellent infiltration for both metallic Li and Na has been designed and exhibits more flat voltage profiles, lower stripping/plating overpotential, and better cycling stability both in symmetric cell and full cell configurations, even in additive-free carbonate-based electrolyte compared with pure Li/Na electrodes. The highly conductive and mechanically robust three-dimensional CTs not only offer a stable scaffold against hyperactive lithium and sodium but also enable uniform nucleation and growth during stripping/plating process, which effectively suppress the dendrite growth and stabilize the electrode dimension. This facile strategy provides new insights into the design of stable hosts with prestored alkali metal to address the multifaceted issues in LMBs and SMBs simultaneously. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","alkali metal infiltration; carbon textiles; lithium metal anodes; sodium metal anodes; stable host","Anodes; Electrolytes; Lithium; Secondary batteries; Sodium; Virtual storage; Carbonate-based electrolytes; Cell configurations; Cycling performance; Electrode dimensions; High energy densities; Mechanically robust; Metal infiltration; Nucleation and growth; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047598292

So far, epitaxial growth is one of the very limited ways to obtain high-quality silicene, which severely impedes the research and application of silicene. Therefore, large-scale synthesis of silicene is a great challenge, yet urgently desired. Herein, the first scalable preparation of free-standing high-quality silicene nanosheets via liquid oxidation and exfoliation of CaSi2 is reported. This new synthesis strategy successfully induces mild oxidation of the (Si2 n)2 n − layers in CaSi2 into neutral Si2 n layers without damage of pristine silicene structure and promotes the exfoliation of stacked silicene layers. The obtained silicene sheets are dispersible and ultrathin ones with monolayer or few-layer thickness and exhibit excellent crystallinity. As a unique 2D layered silicon allotrope, the silicene nanosheets are further explored as new anodes for lithium-ion batteries and exhibit a nearly theoretical capacity of 721 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and an extraordinary cycling stability with no capacity decay after 1800 cycles in contrast to previous most silicon anodes showing rapid capacity decay, thus holding great promise for energy storage and beyond. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here we report a facile one step solid state alloying route to synthesize nanoclustered Mg3Bi2 alloy as a high-performance anode to build up a 2 V Mg-ion battery using noncorrosive electrolyte. The fabricated nanoclustered Mg3Bi2 anode delivers a high reversible specific capacity (360 mAh g-1) with excellent stability (90.7% capacity retention over 200 cycles) and high Coulombic efficiency (average 98%) at 0.1 A g-1. The good performance is attributed to the stable nanostructures, which effectively accommodate the reversible Mg2+ ion insertion/deinsertion without losing electric contact among clusters. Significantly, the nanoclustered Mg3Bi2 anode can be coupled with high voltage cathode Prussian Blue to assemble a full cell using noncorrosive electrolyte, showing a stable cycling (88% capacity retention over 200 cycles at 0.2 A g-1) and good rate capability (103 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and 58 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1).

Composites of Ni-doped CeO2 (Ce1-xNixO2, x = 0, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.20) nanoparticles were formed with carbon by hydrothermal treatment at a temperature of 150 °C for 12 h, hitherto referred to as carbon/CeO2, carbon/5Ni–CeO2, carbon/10Ni–CeO2 and carbon/20Ni–CeO2 for x = 0, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.20, respectively. CeO2 nanoparticles without carbon were also prepared by the same method for comparison. All samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (Raman), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) - elemental mapping, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and a potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical cell system. The samples exhibited XRD and Raman peaks corresponding to carbon and FCC CeO2, confirming the formation of composites. The presence of Ce4+, Ce3+/oxygen vacancies and Ni2+ in all composites was confirmed by XPS measurements. The specific capacitances at a current density of 0.25 A/g were in the range of 138.8–252.6 F/g for electrodes made from carbon/Ni-doped CeO2, which were higher than that of CeO2 (11.9 F/g) and carbon (64.1 F/g) alone.

A ternary salt mixture consisting of 52% KNO3, 18% NaNO3, and 30% LiNO3 by wt% is used as the thermal energy storing medium inside the thermal battery. Since the thermal conductivity of the ternary salt mixture is low, aluminum meshes are introduced to create a thermal conduction tree inside the thermal energy storing medium. The actual field data are used in the simulations to resemble the solar irradiation emanating from the parabolic trough and focusing onto the thermal battery outer surface. To improve the uniform heating at the outer surface, the thermal battery rotation along the centerline of the trough is considered. The temperature parameter is introduced to assess the uniform-like temperature distribution inside the ternary salt mixture. It is found that the use of aluminum meshes improves the heat diffusion in the phase change material of the ternary salt mixture; in which case, it acts like a thermal conduction tree inside the thermal battery. The rotation of the thermal battery results in uniform-like temperature distribution across the thermal battery cross section and suppresses the excessive temperature rise because of the local heating in the close region of the thermal battery outer surface.

However, its development is severely hindered by large overpotential and limited capacity, far less than theory, caused by sluggish oxygen redox kinetics, pore clogging by solid Li2O2 deposition, inferior Li2O2/cathode contact interface, and difficult oxygen transport. Herein, an open-structured Co9S8 matrix with sisal morphology is reported for the first time as an oxygen cathode for Li–O2 batteries, in which the catalyzing for oxygen redox, good Li2O2/cathode contact interface, favorable oxygen evolution, and a promising Li2O2 storage matrix are successfully achieved simultaneously, leading to a significant improvement in the electrochemical performance of Li–O2 batteries. The intrinsic oxygen-affinity revealed by density functional theory calculations and superior bifunctional catalytic properties of Co9S8 electrode are found to play an important role in the remarkable enhancement in specific capacity and round-trip efficiency for Li–O2 batteries. As expected, the Co9S8 electrode can deliver a high discharge capacity of ≈6875 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and exhibit a low overpotential of 0.57 V under a cutoff capacity of 1000 mA h g−1, outperforming most of the current metal-oxide-based cathodes. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Polyanionic sodium orthosilicates [Na2M(SiO4)] are an interesting group of SIB cathode materials with high redox potentials via a two-electron redox process, and their three-dimensional framework. However, studies on these materials are limited due to difficulties in synthesizing them in stable and electrochemically desirable phase. Exhibiting rich polymorphism, orthosilicates undergo irreversible structural changes during processing and/or cycling. Here, we report a solvothermal process, which yields in situ carbon-coated Na2CoSiO4 with monoclinic structure. Besides physical characterization, we discuss its electrochemical performance in coin-cell configuration vs. Na anode. Na2CoSiO4 exhibits significantly lower polarization (0.15 V) than Na2FeSiO4 and Na2MnSiO4. As polyanionic compounds are poor electronic conductors with sluggish redox kinetics, we observe that these limitations could be overcome in Na2CoSiO4 by incorporating functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).

However, the unstable interfaces between lithium anode and electrolyte definitely induce the undesired and uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites, which results in the short-circuit and thermal runaway of the rechargeable batteries. Herein, a dual-layered film is built on a Li metal anode by the immersion of lithium plates into the fluoroethylene carbonate solvent. The ionic conductive film exhibits a compact dual-layered feature with organic components (ROCO2Li and ROLi) on the top and abundant inorganic components (Li2CO3 and LiF) in the bottom. The dual-layered interface can protect the Li metal anode from the corrosion of electrolytes and regulate the uniform deposition of Li to achieve a dendrite-free Li metal anode. This work demonstrates the concept of rational construction of dual-layered structured interfaces for safe rechargeable batteries through facile surface modification of Li metal anodes.

Due to its advantages such as compactness, easy integrity, intelligent operation, rapid heat storage and dissipation rates, and higher overall utilization efficiency, it may has extensive applications in near future in green heating of residential or commercial buildings, agricultural greenhouse heating, drying and other temperature control system. The solar radiation intensity, elevation angle of the equipment, ambient air temperature and flow-rate were considered experimentally as operating parameters. And the characteristics of the temperature distribution in different sections of the PCM in the HSUs were analyzed. The heat storage performance was studied at different solar radiation flux and elevation angle and the heat dissipation performance was conducted by changing ambient air temperatures and convective velocities. Experimental results showed that the optimum elevation angle of the apparatus was 60° (when used in July/August in the western part of Inner Mongolia). The more extensive the solar radiation, the higher heat storage capacity and rate of the STHSE were achieved.

A cost-effective thermal energy storage system is employed as a thermal coupling and a heat dispatcher to coordinate both nuclear heat and solar heat with power demands. The overall configuration and operation strategy of the hybrid system are elaborated. A numerical model of the hybrid system is developed based on the circulation of molten-salt. Using the model, a 7-day performance analysis of the hybrid system with different considerations are conducted. Effects of key design parameters on system performances are investigated by a parametric study. A customized evaluation parameter, named as “design score” is defined to assess the suitability of the designed configurations. The performance analysis shows that the integration of nuclear power with concentrating solar power allows the system to be less dependent on heat dispatch to achieve required power regulations, comparing to a standalone CSP plant with an equivalent power capacity. The parametric study indicates that a higher heat generation utilization of the hybrid system requires a larger TES and a smaller heliostats field, while a higher power supply efficiency of the hybrid system is accompanied with a larger TES, a larger heliostats field, and a higher nuclear power capacity proportion. The optimum design configuration of a 200 MWe HNSPS is estimated to have a nuclear power capacity proportion of 50%, a theoretical thermal energy storage duration of 14.8 h, and a heliostats field with a solar multiple of 1.27. This configuration can completely satisfy the power demand without any heat generation curtailment during the 7-day operation. The obtained results allow the HNSPS to be considered as a promising non-carbon-emitting power generation system for on-demand power supply. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrating solar power; Hybrid power system; Molten-salt; Packed-bed thermal energy storage; Performance analysis; Small modular reactor","Conceptual design; Cost effectiveness; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power utilization; Energy policy; Fused salts; Heat generation; Heat storage; Hybrid systems; Molten salt reactor; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Packed beds; Small nuclear reactors; Small power plants; Solar energy; Concentrating solar power; Hybrid power systems; Molten salt; Performance analysis; Small modular reactors; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045124953

Here, we report the first examples of Manganese dioxide nanowires and nanotubes based PCM nanocomposites (named as MnO2 NWs/PCM and MnO2 NTs/PCM) with enhanced thermal conductivity by simply using MnO2 nanowires and nanotubes as efficient nanofillers. The PCMs nanocomposites show high latent heat ranging from 140.1 J g−1 to 206.1 J g−1. The thermal conductivity of PCM nanocomposites were dramatically enhanced by incorporation of Manganese dioxide nanowires and nanotubes with a maximum value of 377.16% of that of pure PA achieved, which is nearly two times of that of control. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that the incorporation of nanofillers does not change the crystalline structure of OPCMs while lowering its crystalline size. The PCM nanocomposites also show excellent thermal stability of recyclability. Only a slight loss of 2.8% in latent heat was observed after 100 times of melting/cooling cycles. Based on their high heat storage performance, excellent thermal conductivity and thermal stability of recyclability, the as-prepared PCM nanocomposites may have great potentials for energy saving applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","MnO2 nanotubes; MnO2 nanowires; Phase change material","Crystalline materials; Energy conservation; Heat storage; Latent heat; Manganese; Manganese oxide; Nanocomposites; Nanotubes; Nanowires; Storage (materials); Thermal conductivity; Thermodynamic stability; X ray diffraction analysis; Yarn; Crystalline size; Crystalline structure; Enhanced thermal conductivity; Latent heat thermal storage; Manganese dioxide; Nano-fillers; Recyclability; Storage performance; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043308595

However, the heavier mass and larger radius of Na+ inevitably result in lower electrochemical kinetics and larger volume expansion of active materials than that of lighter and smaller Li+. To solve these problems, rational electrode design by integrating nanomaterials with graphene is an effective approach. In this review, the authors mainly focus on recent progress of graphene-based nanomaterials for SIBs, including their design principle, preparation, characterization, and electrochemical performance. The important roles of graphene in graphene-based inorganic and organic electrode materials are discussed in depth. In such composites, graphene can effectively enhance the electrical conductivity and mitigate volume change due to the robust and highly conductive networks formed by graphene. Moreover, the nanosized materials can enhance the reaction kinetics.

This is achieved with single-atomic iron active sites in porous nitrogen-doped carbon, prepared by polymerizing and carbonizing diphenylamine in the presence of iron phthalocyanine and a hard template. The Fe-PNC/S composite electrode exhibited a high discharge capacity (427 mAh g-1) at a 0.1C rate after 300 cycles with the Columbic efficiency of above 95.6%. Besides, the electrode delivers much higher capacity of 557.4 mAh g-1 at 0.5C over 300 cycles. Importantly, the Fe-PCN/S has a smaller phase nucleation overpotential of polysulfides than nitrogen-doped carbon alone for the formation of nanoscale of Li2S as revealed by ex situ SEM, which enhance lithium-ion diffusion in Li2S, and therefore a high rate performance and remarkable cycle life of Li-sulfur batteries were achieved. Our strategy paves a new way for polysulfide conversion with atomic iron catalysis to exploit high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","iron- and nitrogen-doped carbon; Li2S; lithium-sulfur batteries; polysulfide conversion; single-atomic catalysis","Atoms; Carbon; Catalysis; Doping (additives); Electric discharges; Electrodes; Iron compounds; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Nitrogen; Polysulfides; Columbic efficiency; Discharge capacities; High energy densities; High-rate performance; Iron phthalocyanines; Lithium ion diffusion; Nitrogen-doped carbons; Reversible transformation; Lithium sulfur batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047771307

However, excessive growth of a solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) caused by the severe volume change during the (de)lithiation processes leads to dramatic capacity fading. Here, we report a super-concentrated electrolyte composed of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) and propylene carbonate (PC) with a molar ratio of 1:2 to improve the cycling performance of silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs). The SiNP electrode shows a remarkably improved cycling performance with an initial delithiation capacity of approximately 3000 mAh g−1 and a capacity of approximately 2000 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, exhibiting about 6.8 times higher capacity than the cells with dilute electrolyte LiFSI-(PC)8. Raman spectra reveal that most of the PC solvent and FSI anions are complexed by Li+ to form a specific solution structure like a fluid polymeric network. The reduction of FSI anions starts to play an important role owing to the increased concentration of contact ion pairs (CIPs) or aggregates (AGGs), which contribute to the formation of a more mechanically robust and chemically stable complex SEI layer. The complex SEI layer can effectively suppress the morphology evolution of silicon particles and self-limit the excessive growth, which mitigates the crack propagation of the silicon electrode and the deterioration of the kinetics. This study will provide a new direction for screening cycling-stable electrolytes for silicon-based electrodes. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Integrating the extraordinary redox stability and lattice deformability of POMs with the excellent volume accommodation, the as-prepared CoW-POM presents an extraordinary better electrochemical performance (specific capacity, rate capability, and cycle life) than that of CoW-Salt. In detail, the CoW-POM can deliver a reversible capacity of 737.8 mA h g-1 at the current density of 0.1 A g-1 and provide a capacity retention of 90.1% even after 100 cycles.

Hourly-based operation optimisation over 20 years using the modelling software energyPRO showed that the largest investment incentive in Finland, Norway and Sweden was for combined heat and power with an electric boiler. This is largely driven by subsidies. Conversely, the less-subsidised Danish case incentivised investment in wood chip boilers. Untaxed biomass is the major energy source in all scenarios, while electricity use is limited. Capacity component-based tariffs can eliminate operation of electric boilers, while less costly energy component-based tariffs can increase the operation of electric boilers.

Sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON) structure materials, known for high conductivity and chemical diffusion coefficient of Na+ (≈10−14 cm2 s−1), are promising electrode materials for NIBs. However, NASICON structure materials often suffer from low electrical conductivity (&lt;10−4 S cm−1), which hinders their electrochemical performance. Here high performance sodium storage performance in Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is realized by optimizing nanostructure and rational surface engineering. A N, B codoped carbon coated three-dimensional (3D) flower-like Na3V2(PO4)3 composite (NVP@C-BN) is designed to enable fast ions/electrons transport, high-surface controlled energy storage, long-term structural integrity, and high-rate cycling. The conductive 3D interconnected porous structure of NVP@C-BN greatly releases mechanical stress from Na+ extraction/insertion. In addition, extrinsic defects and active sites introduced by the codoping heteroatoms (N, B) both enhance Na+ and e− diffusion. The NVP@C-BN displays excellent electrochemical performance as the cathode, delivering reversible capacity of 70% theoretical capacity at 100 C after 2000 cycles.

However, it is urgent to develop new anode materials with superior ultralong cycle life performance at high current rates. Herein, a low-cost and large-scalable sulfur-doped carbon anode material that exhibits the best high-rate cycle performance and the longest cycle life ever reported for carbon anodes is developed. The material delivers a reversible capacity of 142 mA h g−1 at a current rate up to 10 A g−1. After 10 000 cycles the capacity is remained at 126.5 mA h g−1; 89.1% of the initial value. Density functional theory computations demonstrate that the sulfur-doped carbon has a strong binding affinity for sodium which promotes sodium storage. Meanwhile, the kinetics analysis identifies the capacitive charge storage as a large contributor to sodium storage, which favors ultrafast storage of sodium ions. These results demonstrate a new way to design carbon-based SIBs anodes for next-generation large-scale electricity storage. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, appropriate anode materials with high capacity for ARSIBs are limited, and their cycling stability is generally unsatisfactory. Here we report high-performance ARSIBs with polyacrylamide hydrogel as electrolyte and alloxazine (ALO) encapsulated in CMK-3 as anode. The hydrogel with solid content of 60% could effectively mitigate the dissolution issue of sodiated ALO because its cross-linked structure is helpful to reserve H2O. The ALO/CMK-3 anode based on a two-electron transfer reaction could deliver a high capacity of 160 mA h g-1. The introduction of CMK-3 could improve the electrical conductivity of ALO and further reduce the dissolution of sodiated ALO because of its high conductivity and nanochannel structure. The full ARSIBs exhibit an energy density of 50 W h kg-1 (based on the total mass of active electrode materials) with good capacity retention of 90% after 100 cycles at 2 C and high rate capability of 146 mA h g-1 at 10 C (1 C = 250 mA g-1).

A case study is performed for this purpose in the Ma'an area in southern Jordan. Due to water scarcity in most MENA region, contrasting analogy between hot and dry cooling is performed. The performance of CSP plant is simulated using SAM software. The simulation results predict that solar field size and thermal energy storage systems play major role in determining the energy cost. Moreover, it is found that larger plant size has lower values of levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Furthermore, LOCE for 50 MW using dry cooling ranges between 12.88 and 13.40 c$/kW, while it ranges between 11.23 c$/kW and 13.56 23 c$/kW for wet cooling. Finally, it is found that dry cooling option has a great economical potential for generating energy in water scare regions.

The proposed two-stage recompression Brayton cycle is used as power block to make full use of high-level solar energy and reduce power consumption. The thermodynamic performances and economic assessments are investigated to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed system, and the comparison between halide salt and nitrate salt is conducted.

However, the low electrical conductivity of sulfur and its discharge product, and also the high dissolution of polysulfides restrict the Li-S battery practical applications. To improve their performances, in this work, we fabricate a novel free-standing, curled and partially reduced graphene oxide (CPrGO for short) network and combine it with sulfur to form a CPrGO-S composite as a cathode for Li-S battery. With sulfur content of 60 wt%, the free-standing CPrGO-S composite network delievers an initial capacity of 988.9 mAh•g-1. After 200 cycles, it shows a stable capacity of 841.4 mAh•g-1 at 0.2 C, retaining about 85% of the initial value. The high electrochemical performance demonstrates that the CPrGO-S network has great potential applications in energy storage system. Such improved properties can be ascribed to the unique free-standing and continous CPrGO-S network which has high specific surface area and good electrical conductivity.

Currently, Li-air batteries are facing main challenges at stability, efficiency, applicability and safety. In particular, from a practical view of point, the Li-air batteries should be operated directly in ambient air. Solid-state battery system is the best avenue to eventually solve these main issues. At the heart of the solid state, Li-air technology is the solid-state Li+-conducting ceramic material. Developing solid-state lithium-air batteries (SSLAB) can solve the problem of applicability fundamentally and circumvent the safety issues completely, and it is also an important avenue to improve the stability of the battery system.

This is partly due to the low cost and abundancy of sodium and the possibility to use cheaper parts on cell level such as current collector and electrolyte. As an important electrode in a safe rechargeable sodium-ion battery, the electrochemical activity on the anode involves a series of complex electrochemical processes. Therefore, new strategies for material design are required to promote each pivotal step in the optimization of battery performance. Herein, we present a multiscale design of a mesoporous MoS2 foam with a coating of graphene layers as a highly efficient anode for sodium-ion batteries. The resulting composite material delivers impressive electrochemical performance in a half-cell versus metallic sodium with a high specific capacity for sodium ions and a stable performance during cycling for more than 1000 cycles. The strategy introduced in this study opens new opportunities, not only for the development of MoS2 composite anode materials through a multiscale design to maintain high capacity and stability, but also for the development of other sodium-ion battery anode materials. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Anodes; Electrolytes; Graphene; Layered semiconductors; Metal ions; Molybdenum compounds; Sulfur compounds; Battery performance; Electrochemical activities; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical process; High specific capacity; High-performance anodes; Molybdenum disulfide; Multi-scale design; Sodium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045472636

However, the inherent deficiency of low electrical conductivity results in a low reversible capacity and poor cycling stability. Here, we achieved the superior sodium storage performance of Nb2O5 by rational design self-supported 3D porous reticular Nb2O5@Carbon (Nb2O5@3D PRS) thin film with interpenetrating network. The film was prepared by a facial electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) technique. The Nb2O5@3D PRS displays outstanding electrochemical performance, especially long cycle life: it can still deliver a specific capacity of 130 mAh g-1 after 7500 times chare/discharge at high rate of 10 C. Furthermore, Na3V2(PO4)3//Nb2O5 full cells were assembled, the full cell displays a remarkable capacity retention of 105 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 10 C. The excellent sodium storage performance of the Nb2O5@3D PRS is ascribed to the synergistic effect of the unique porous structure, the nanosized Nb2O5 particles encapsulated in the carbonaceous matrix, which facilitates the electrochemical kinetics between the Nb2O5 and electrolyte. In addition, the key problems of Na ion insertion in Nb2O5, such as the low degree of reversibility are mitigated. Notably, this method is a general process and can be extended to prepare other electrode materials with 3D porous interpenetrating structure for energy storage application. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Electrostatic spray deposition (ESD); Niobium pentoxide; Porous reticular carbon networks; Sodium-ion battery","Anodes; Carbon; Deposits; Electrolytes; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatics; Metal ions; Sodium-ion batteries; Storage (materials); Thin films; Carbon network; Electrical conductivity; Electrochemical kinetics; Electrochemical performance; Electrostatic spray deposition; Electrostatic spray deposition techniques; Energy storage applications; Niobium pentoxide; Niobium oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045038221

However, the practical application of metallic sodium anode is impeded by its low stripping/plating efficiency and poor cycling performance due to the poor reversibility of sodium anode caused by the formation of inhomogeneous solid electrolyte interphase, the growth of dendritic sodium, and relatively infinite volume change. Here, Na-C composite anode was fabricated by depositing nanoscale metallic sodium in graphitized carbon microspheres which were assembled from graphitized carbon nanosheets. The carbon microspheres function as a mini-nanoreservoir with high-surface-area, conductivity, and mechanical stability, which lower the local current density, ensure a homogeneous Na nucleation and high electrochemical active of Na, and restrict the volume change. As a result, metallic sodium can be reversibly nondendritic stripped/plated with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.3% up to 4 mA cm−2 for 4 mA h cm−2. Building upon this dendrite-free anode, we demonstrate a full cell using O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.2Ti0.3O2 cathode to achieve a superior long lifespan of ~100 cycles at high current density of 0.5 C. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dendrite-free; High stability; Metallic Na anode; O3-Type Cathode; Sodium battery","Anodes; Carbon; Cathodes; Graphitization; Mechanical stability; Microspheres; Secondary batteries; Sodium compounds; Solid electrolytes; Carbon microspheres; Coulombic efficiency; Energy storage systems; High current densities; High energy densities; Local current density; Sodium battery; Solid electrolyte interphase; Sodium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044956850

However, the low initial Coulombic efficiency limits their further commercialization. Herein, a new carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material as anodes for sodium-ion batteries by pyrolyzing the interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) made from the mixture of biomass-derivative lignin and epoxy resin. By adjusting heat-treatment temperatures and the lignin/epoxy resin mass ratios, we can adjust the interlayer distance of carbon crystallites and defect sites for Sodium-ion storage, and thus obtain a hard carbon with a high capacity of 316 mAh g−1, a high ICE of 82%, and good rate capability (e.g., 161 mAh g−1 at 300 mA g−1), all of which are superior to or comparable to those state-of-the-art carbons reported in literatures, by the help of a large interlayer distance of 3.95 Å. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further demonstrated, while it presents a high ICE of 80% and an energy density of 247 Wh kganode−1 (vs. hard carbon) with good cycle performance.

The triple concentric-tube storage systems incorporating PCM are connected with a flat-plate solar collector. Water acting as heat transfer fluid (HTF) flows in the solar collector and receives solar thermal energy. The latter is then transferred by forced convection to the PCM and stored as latent heat in the storage unit. The finite volume method is used to model and numerically investigate the melting and heat transfer processes. The effect of natural convection on the melting heat transfer is taken into consideration through an effective thermal conductivity of the liquid phase of PCM.

The ORC unit was added to conventional ground source heat pumps to solve the cold accumulation problem, which can lead to performance degradation of heat pumps. The existing types and novel types of the combisystem were then modeled with the Transient System Simulation Program (TRNSYS). During the heating season, the ORC unit and heat pump unit were combined for space heating, and during the non-heating season, the ORC unit was connected to ground heat exchangers for seasonal storage. System performance was simulated over periods of one year and twenty years. The twenty-year simulation results showed that the proposed combisystem could maintain a higher annual average coefficient of performance (COP) of approximately 3.8 because of the steady soil temperature, whereas the annual average COP of the conventional ground source heat pump system decreased from 3.7 to 3.2. Additionally, the total power consumption per unit heating area of the heating system decreased from 2.2 × 103 kW·h/m2 to 3.3 × 102 kW·h/m2 when the ORC unit was added to the conventional ground source heat pump. This translates to electricity cost savings of ¥ 908/m2 over twenty years. Moreover, in the combisystem, the ORC unit provides 55.6% of the total heating capacity; compensates for 78.5% of the heat pump unit's power consumption. And 94.1% of the thermal energy storage from the non-heating season can be used during the heating season by the heat pump unit. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cold region; Ground source heat pump; Organic Rankine Cycle; Seasonal storage","Electric energy storage; Electric power utilization; Geothermal energy; Heat storage; Heating; Pumps; Rankine cycle; Space heating; Thermography (temperature measurement); Coefficient of Performance; Cold regions; Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC); Organic Rankine cycles; Performance degradation; Seasonal storage; Shallow geothermal energies; Total power consumption; Geothermal heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044471509

Therefore, a favorable correlation between the collector and storage size should be generated based on the dynamic characteristics of the system. This study focuses on the optimal matching of solar collector area with storage volume for an SWH system (with short-term heat storage capability) for a space heating application. A simplified model of an SWH system based on hourly energy flow is established. System control strategy is integrated into the model in a simple manner without sacrificing computing speed. Based on this model, the combined effect of collector area and storage volume on system thermal performance and economy is analyzed, and a simple procedure for determining the optimal system size is illustrated. A case study showed that for an SWH system utilized for space heating application, the optimized ratio between storage volume and collector area is dependent on the total collector area of the system, and is dominated by the requirement of overheating prevention. The minimum storage volume for a specific collector area that can prevent the storage tank from being overheated can be adopted as the optimum storage volume for that collector area. The optimum ratio between storage volume and collector area increases as the collector area increases. Therefore, a trade-off between heat collection and heat loss has to be made while attempting to increase solar fraction by improving collector area. © 2018, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","optimization; renewable energy; solar water heating; space heating; thermal storage","Economic and social effects; Heat storage; Optimization; Solar water heaters; Space heating; Dynamic characteristics; Heating applications; Renewable energies; Solar collector areas; Solar water heating; Solar water heating systems; Temporal distribution; Thermal storage; Solar heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044448687

The potential of using a natural phase change material of Moroccan provenance for energy storage was studied by experimental analysis. The enhanced heat transfer surface of the compact finned-tube heat exchanger presents geometric complications. Therefore, a new method based on equivalent circular fin efficiency for the calculation of the effective heat transfer surface area was developed and applied to the system under study. In order to carry out the performance analysis for this innovative system, charging and discharging experiments were conducted for different heat transfer fluid flow rates. It was found that increasing the flow rate from 0.2 to 1 l/min divides melting time by 2.5 and solidification time by four. The average effectiveness was calculated for each flow rate and was proven to decrease during charging from 0.95 for a flow rate of 0.2 l/min to 0.63 for 1 l/min. Likewise, increasing flow rate from 0.2 to 1 l/min for discharging process decreases heat exchanger effectiveness from 0.99 to 0.7. The combination of the effectiveness-number of transfer units method with the procedure that was developed to compute the effective heat transfer area lead to derive an empirical correlation. This equation was used to compare the finned-tube compact storage system with other heat and cold storage units. The comparison showed that the present system displayed satisfactory results. The second use of the correlation was to design, through a case study, a heat storage system suitable for solar domestic hot water production in a residential building. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Effectiveness-number of transfer units (ɛ-NTU); Fin efficiency; Phase change material (PCM); Solar domestic hot water (SDHW); Thermal energy storage (TES)","Cold storage; Fins (heat exchange); Flow rate; Heat affected zone; Heat storage; Hot water distribution systems; Phase change materials; Thermal energy; Tubes (components); Water; Comparative performance analysis; Effectiveness number of transfer units; Experimental investigations; Fin efficiency; Finned tube heat exchangers; Heat transfer surface area; Solar domestic hot water productions; Solar domestic hot waters; Heat transfer performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044130797

However, the sodium metal anode suffers from unstable plating and stripping cycling and thus low Coulombic efficiency. One of the important reasons for the situation is the high overpotential for sodium nucleation and thus non-uniform deposition and even dendrites growth. Herein we report a facile method by introducing a “sodiophilic” layer of Au-Na alloy onto the Cu substrate that acts as the current collector to significantly reduce the nucleation overpotential. Thus, the sodium metal can be plated on and stripped from the modified current collector with good reversibility. The average Coulombic efficiency maintains 99.8% at the current of 2.0 mA cm−2 for 300 cycles. As a proof of concept, an anode-free full cell consisting of Cu@Au and presodiated FeS2 was assembled. Our work demonstrates the great importance of sodiophilic modification of substrate to the deposition process for sodium metal battery. © 2018","Anode-free full cells; Good reversibility; Sodiophilic; Sodium metal anodes","Anodes; Battery storage; Binary alloys; Deposition; Electric batteries; Electric current collectors; Electrodes; Gold; Gold alloys; Lithium-ion batteries; Metals; Nucleation; Pyrites; Secondary batteries; Sulfur compounds; Coulombic efficiency; Current collector; Deposition process; Energy storage and conversions; Good reversibility; Metal anodes; Proof of concept; Sodiophilic; Sodium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044102511

Various crystallization inhibitors were adopted to improve the stability of the supercooled sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) solution, and the supercooling time, cycling stability, and thermal properties were investigated. The supercooling time of the SAT solution was prolonged from 6 h to more than 9 days by acetic acid, ethanol, and glycerin. The supercooled SAT with acetic acid was stable for a long period (>14 days) during the cycling test, indicating the significant effect of acetic acid in maintaining the cycling stability. Acetic acid acts through inhibiting the crystal growth, limiting the crystal size, and/or reducing the water activity of the supercooled solution. The influence of acetic acid on the heat of fusion, onset temperature, and peak temperature of the SAT system was negligible. The system thermal conductivity was slightly reduced from 0.3698 to 0.2764 W/(m·K) by acetic acid, requiring further enhancement strategies.

However, to reach high solar thermal fractions and to overcome the mismatch between supply and demand of solar heat, long term heat storage is necessary. A promising method for long term heat storage is to use thermochemical materials, TCMs. The reversible adsorption–desorption reactions, which are exothermic in the hydration direction and endothermic in the reverse dehydration direction, can be used to store heat. A 250 L setup based on a gas–solid reaction between water–zeolite 13X is designed and tested. Humid air is introduced into a packed bed reactor filled with dehydrated material, and due to the adsorption of water vapour on TCM, heat is released. The reactor consists of four segments of 62.5 L each, which can be operated in different modes. The temperature is measured at several locations to gain insight into the effect of segmentation. Experiments are performeignore.txtd for hydration–dehydration cycles in different modes. Using the temperatures measured at different locations in the system, a complete thermal picture of the system is calculated, including thermal powers of the segments. A maximum power of around 4 kW is obtained by running the segments in parallel mode. Compactness and robustness are two important factors for the successful introduction of heat storage systems in the built environment, and both can be met by reactor segmentation. With the segmented reactor concept, a high flexibility can be achieved in the performance of a heat storage system, while still being compact. The system is also able to produce domestic hot tap water with the required temperature of 60 °C. This can be done by implementing a recuperating unit to preheat the inflow by recovering the residual heat in the outflow. In this work, the recuperator is simulated by a heater, and applicability of the system for domestic purposes is assessed. An energy density of 198 kWh/m3 is calculated on material level, and the energy density calculated on reactor level is around 108 kWh/m3 and 61 kWh/m3 for experiment without and with preheating, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","250 L pilot; Hot tap water production; Open sorption system; Segmented packed bed reactor; Thermochemical heat storage; Water–zeolite","Chemical reactors; Dehydration; Economics; Fossil fuels; Heat storage; Hydration; Packed beds; Solar energy; Solar heating; Storage (materials); Zeolites; Heat storage systems; Packed bed reactor; Reversible adsorption; Seasonal heat storages; Sorption system; Sustainable energy sources; Tap water; Thermo-chemical heat storages; Driers (materials)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042939414

The use of hybrid materials composed of organic and inorganic materials constitutes a promising way to improve chemical and thermal properties of microencapsulated phase change materials. The prepared composites were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetric analyses. The obtained results show that the synthesized hybrid-MEPCMs are in spherical and irregular forms, and present a rougher surface due to the presence of metal oxide nanoparticles which are scattered onto the surface of microcapsules or wrapped by UF shell material.

But the effects of oxygen positional parameter on different properties of oxide thin films are not completely understood and scarcely reported. Using DC electro-deposition, FeAl2O4 thin films were deposited on copper substrates by in-situ oxidation of intermetallic Fe3Al at 2 V. Deposition time for each intermetallic film was a 30 min while oxidation time was varied from 0 min to 30 min with the interval of 5 min. All the thin films were annealed for 1 h at 300 °C in the 500 Oe magnetic field. XRD patterns confirmed the formation of spinel structure for the FeAl2O4 thin films with no preferred orientation. Variations in lattice parameters and crystallite size might be due to surface activation energy and in cooperation of oxygen atoms at the tetrahedral sites for charge compensation. Cation distribution and lowest stacking fault probability confirmed the formation of defect free pure phase of FeAl2O4 for the thin film with the 30 min oxidation.

Energy storage technologies: batteries, pumped hydro storage (PHS), adiabatic compressed air energy storage, thermal energy storage and power-to-gas technology are used in the modelling to provide flexibility to the system and balance demand. The optimisation for each time period (transition is modeled in 5 year steps) is carried out on an assumed costs and technological status of all energy technologies involved. Results indicate that a 100% renewable based energy system is achievable in 2050 with the levelised cost of electricity falling from a current level of 58 €/MWhe to 52 €/MWhe in 2050 in the power scenario. With large scale intermittent renewable energy sources in the system, the demand for storage technologies increases from the current level to 2050. Batteries provide 2596 TWh, PHS provides 12 TWh and gas storage provides 197 TWh of electricity to the total electricity demand. Most of the storage demand will be based on batteries, which provide as much as 42% of the total electricity demand. The synchronised discharging of batteries in the night time and charging of power-to-gas in the early summer and summer months reduces curtailment on the following day, and thus is a part of a least cost solution. The combination of solar photovoltaics (PV) and battery storage evolves as the low-cost backbone of Indian energy supply, resulting in 3.2–4.3 TWp of installed PV capacities, depending on the applied scenario in 2050. During the monsoon period, complementarity of storage technologies and the transmission grid help to achieve uninterrupted power supply. The above results clearly prove that renewable energy options are the most competitive and a least-cost solution for achieving a net zero emission energy system.

The influence of MgCl2 content on a metal corrosion behavior is not clear. The corrosion behavior of a Fe based alloy (GH1140) in molten NaCl-MgCl2 (at 1123 K) with different content of MgCl2 (wt%：0.0，48.9，61.0，93.6) were studied by the submergence corrosion experience. Results show that: after corrosion for 5 h, there is a negative correlation between the weight loss of samples and the content of MgCl2. In the molten salt without MgCl2, the sample was corroded according to the mechanism of “dissolution as anode- oxidizing- peeling off of oxide film”. After adding a little MgCl2 in the molten salt, an unprotected MgO shell was formed on the sample surface. The samples weight decreased and obeyed a line law. The elements of Fe and Cr deplete in the corrosion layer. Corrosion mechanism is “dissolution as anode- oxidizing- reduction- chlorination”.

To access the potential of β12 borophene (□) and χ3 borophene monolayer (◇) as anode materials for lithium ion batteries, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) are performed. Lithium atom is preferentially absorbed over the center of the hexagonal B atom hollow of β12 and χ3 borophene monolayer. The fully lithium storage phase of β12 and χ3 borophene monolayer corresponds to Li8B10 and Li8B16 with a theoretical specific capacity of 1983 and 1240 mA h g−1, respectively, much larger than other two-dimension materials.

Meanwhile, lithiated-borophene monolayer shows enhanced metallic conductivity during the whole lithiation process.

Box 54224, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","Recently, thermosiphon has been considered as an economically competitive approach for the withdrawal of thermal energy from molten salt. This feature of thermosiphon is particularly attractive for concentrated solar power (CSP) technology because molten salt can be used both as the direct receiver and thermal energy storage material, and pumping requirements can be minimized. However, the thermosiphon loop must be properly designed; otherwise the heated molten salt can flow in the reverse direction or solidify before heat exchange is fully carried out. In this paper, the dependence of important molten salt flow characteristics such as temperature, velocity and friction factor on the thermosiphon loop dimensions is theoretically investigated. The model is carried out for the withdrawal of 1 MW of thermal energy from the molten salt. The economic assessment of the conversion of this energy to electricity for reverse osmosis desalination is also carried out. It is observed that by using the minimum possible value of leg length and maximum possible values of diameter and pressure head, the lowest decline of temperature and highest velocity of flow can be achieved along the loop. Fresh water production is more valuable than electricity and steam production by 460% and 480%, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Concentrated solar energy; Desalination; Renewable energy; Reverse osmosis; Thermal energy; Thermosiphon","Desalination; Electric energy storage; Fused salts; Heat storage; Reverse osmosis; Solar energy; Thermal energy; Water; Concentrated solar energy; Concentrated solar power; Flow charac-teristics; Fresh water production; Pumping requirements; Renewable energies; Reverse osmosis desalination; Techno-economic model; Thermosyphons; alternative energy; desalination; flow velocity; freshwater; reverse osmosis; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033779289

The reactive cores (Fe3O4) are protected by carbon shells and linked by carbon filaments, constituting an integrated conductance network. Thus, once the reaction starts, the electrons released from every Fe3O4 cores are capable of being transferred rapidly through the whole network directly to the external circuit, endowing the nanocomposite with tremendous rate performance and ultralong cycle life.

However, fabricating graphene/metal nanoparticle nanohybrids with superior electrochemical performance remains a great challenge to date. In this work, we, for the first time, demonstrate a novel and ingenious approach to fabricate holey reduced graphene oxide hollow nanospheres sandwiched by interior and exterior Pt nanoparticles (denoted as Pt@holey r-GO@Pt hollow nanospheres), using uniform SiO2 nanospheres as the templates. The Pt@holey r-GO@Pt hollow nanospheres represent a new type of metal/graphene heteroarchitecture due to their rich porosity, abundant active sites, facilitated reaction kinetics, and outstanding structural stability. Thanks to these distinguished merits, the as-prepared Pt@holey r-GO@Pt hollow nanospheres exhibit greatly enhanced electrocatalytic performances toward the oxygen reduction reaction and methanol oxidation reaction as compared with the intact counterparts and commercial Pt/C catalyst, showing great potential in fuel cell devices.

In this work, a shape-stabilized light-to-thermal conversion composite PCM containing 72.5 wt% CH3COONa·3H2O (SAT), 0.4 wt% Na2HPO4, 17.1 wt% expanded graphite (EG) and 10 wt% CuS was prepared using a physical blending and impregnation method. Experimental results showed that Na2HPO4 was an effective nucleating agent, greatly promoting SAT crystallization.

HCs are composed of misaligned graphene sheets with plentiful nanopores and defects, imparting a complex correlation between its structure and sodium-storage behavior. The currently debated mechanism of Na+-ion insertion in HCs hinders the development of high-performance NIBs. In this article, ingenious and reliable strategies are used to elaborate the correlation between the structure and electrochemical performance and further illuminate the sodium-storage mechanism in HCs. First, filling sulfur into the micropores of HCs can remove the low-voltage plateau, providing solid evidence for its association with the pore-filling mechanism. Along with the decreased concentration of defects/heteroatoms at higher treatment temperature, the reduced sloping capacity confirms the adsorption mechanism in the sloping region. Finally, the similar sodium-insertion behaviors of HCs with ether-based and ester-based electrolytes indicate that no Na+ ions intercalate between the graphene layers.

High-temperature calcination of these MOFs accompanied by the loss of coordinated water molecules and other components enables the formation of orderly slit-like 2D pores in vanadium oxide/porous carbon nanorods (VOx/PCs). This unique combination leads to an increase of the reactive surface area. In addition, optimized VOx/PCs demonstrate high-rate capability and ultralong cycling life for sodium storage.

The years have witnessed the development of several types of solar air heating systems (SAHS). This chapter aims to present a review of the literature involving improvement methods, design configurations, test methods of thermal performance, and applications of SAHS. Firstly, this chapter makes an introduction to five new SAHS, namely, fin type flat-plate solar air collector (FTSAC), baffle-type vacuum tube solar air collector (VTSAC), novel straight through VTSAC, inserted VTSAC, and traditional straight through VTSAC. Meanwhile, the chapter states the advantages of these five types of SAHS and describes its working principles. The similarities and differences between the designed air collector and other air collectors are presented. In terms of structure and cost, the advantages of the new SAHS designed in this chapter are pointed out, which will provide the direction for the optimization and improvement in the future. Secondly, design and test methods of thermal performance of SAHS system are introduced in this chapter. The design parameters cover the determination of heat load and collector area of SAHS, air flow rate of SAHS, the resistance of SAHS, and the power of the fan. Besides, a test method of thermal performance for SAHS is also presented, which mainly includes its testing procedures, test conditions, test period (steady-state), as well as computation of collector efficiency. Finally, SAHS are widely used for many applications such as drying applications and space heating and cooling of buildings. This chapter reviews selected studies concerning these applications and presents a solar dryer and solar assisted heat pump dryer system (SAHPDS). According to the work conducted to date on solar drying and SAHPDS of fruits and vegetables, it can be concluded that the solar dryers can be adopted to a great extent. The solar drying of agricultural products serves as one of the most important potential applications of solar energy. It has been established that solar drying and SAHPDS of fruits and vegetables is technically feasible and economically viable. Heating and cooling of agricultural greenhouses are the paramount activities to extend its application throughout the year for crop production. In the meantime, SAHS are very popular for space heating applications relying on their simple design and cost. Major disadvantages of SAHS are relatively low thermal efficiency as well as little thermal storage capacity of the system itself. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Applications; Solar air heating systems; Solar assisted heat pump drying system; Solar dryer; Space heating and conditioning","Applications; Climate change; Collector efficiency; Cultivation; Drying; Electron tubes; Fruits; Heat pump systems; Heat resistance; Heat storage; Heating; Heating equipment; Solar dryers; Solar energy; Space heating; Vegetables; Agricultural greenhouse; Design configurations; Economically viable; Fruits and vegetables; Heating and cooling of buildings; Heating applications; Solar air heating system; Solar assisted heat pump; Thermal processing (foods)",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053986783

This system is suitable to supply space heating and hot water for buildings by storing solar energy or other low-grade heat. The working cycle of this system is divided into two modes, which are listed as follows. During the charging process, the input heat is stored in the form of chemical potential by breaking the binders between the sorbate and the sorbent. Then, the sorbate and the sorbent are kept separated during the sorption period. The discharging process is motivated by the connection between the sorbent and the sorbate, which release sorption heat for heating supply when needed. Generally, the sorption materials are composed of solid adsorbent, liquid absorbent, chemical reactor, and composite sorbents. The STES system is classified as closed system and open system according to its configuration. Besides, it can also be divided into long-term storage system and short-term storage system based on the designed storage time span. Thermochemical characterizations of sorption materials, system design, and proposal of system cycles serve as the main aspects of the investigation of STES technology.

Its most outstanding feature is the use of ground resources, which distinguishes GSHPs from other heat pump systems. A GSHP may be considered as a ""green"" system, mainly because of its use of geothermal energy that, as a type of renewable energy, has enormous potential for reducing CO 2 emissions and fossil fuel consumption. In general, a higher system performance may be achieved by using a GSHP system compared with an air source heat pump system because of the relatively small temperature variation of the ground compared with the ambient air. In a typical GSHP system there are several main components, including indoor distribution systems and ground source heat exchangers using the ground as a heat sink/source. The role of indoor distribution systems is to handle building cooling and heating loads by absorbing room heat gains or providing heat to rooms through indoor heat pump units. The thermal energy carried by heat pumps is distributed to the ground through ground source heat exchangers buried underground or to the building through pipes/ducts. In this chapter, in-depth discussions regarding GSHP systems are presented, including the topics of geothermal resources, ground source heat exchangers, indoor distribution systems, heat storage technologies of GSHP systems, and the associated economics and environmental impacts.

Because the electrodes with 3D structure are generally easily destroyed under mechanical deformation in practical applications, we fabricated a self-healable 3D MSC consisting of MXene (Ti3C2Tx)-graphene (reduced graphene oxide, rGO) composite aerogel electrode by wrapping it with a self-healing polyurethane as an outer shell. The MXene-rGO composite aerogel combining large specific surface area of rGO and high conductivity of the MXene can not only prevent the self-restacking of the lamella structure but also resist the poor oxidization of MXene to a degree. The MSC based on a 3D MXene-rGO aerogel delivers a large area specific capacitance of 34.6 mF cm-2 at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1 and an outstanding cycling performance with a capacitance retention up to 91% over 15000 cycles. The 3D MSC presents an excellent self-healing ability with specific capacitance retention of 81.7% after the fifth healing. The preparation of this self-healable 3D MSC can provide a method for designing and manufacturing next-generation long-life multifunctional electronic devices further to meet the requirements of sustainable development. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","aerogel; microsupercapacitor; MXene; self-healable; three-dimensional","Capacitance; Electrodes; Graphene; Three dimensional computer graphics; Large specific surface areas; Mechanical deformation; Micro supercapacitors; MXene; Reduced graphene oxides; self-healable; Self-healing abilities; Three dimensional (3D) structures; Aerogels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046621532

However, the stability of the Li metal anode is still a major concern. This is due to the formation of lithium dendrites and severe side reactions with polysulfide intermediates. We herein develop an anode protection method by coating a Nafion/TiO2 composite layer on the Li anode to solve these problems. In this architecture, Nafion suppresses the growth of Li dendrites, protects the Li anode, and prevents side reactions between polysulfides and the Li anode. Moreover, doped TiO2 further improves the ionic conductivity and mechanical properties of the Nafion membrane. Li–S batteries with a Nafion/TiO2-coated Li anode exhibit better cycling stability (776 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, 1 C=1672 mA g−1) and higher rate performance (787 mA h g−1 at 2 C) than those with a pristine Li anode.

In this study, we explore the half-metallic nature and thermoelectric response in both LiV2O4 and LiCr2O4 spinel oxides using ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) based computations. The ground-state energies of these compounds have been studied at the optimized structural parameters in the ferromagnetic phase. In order to obtain a correct picture of the electronic structure and magnetic properties, the modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) potential is applied to compute the electronic structures. The half-metallic behavior is confirmed by the spin-polarized electronic band structures and density of state plots. The magnetic nature is elucidated by computing the John-Teller energy, direct and indirect exchange and crystal field splitting energies. Our computations indicate strong hybridization decreasing the V/Cr site magnetic moments and increasing magnetic momenta at the nonmagnetic atomic sites. We also present the computed parameters significant for expressing the thermoelectric response, which are electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, See-beck coefficient and power factor.

The model was validated with in-situ experiments. The influence of latent heat storage on the thermal response of a green roof was studied for different climatic conditions. The results of numerical analyses showed that the process of water freezing further improves the energy efficiency of green roofs, because the peak heat flux at the inner surface of the roof is up to 30% lower in comparison to the non-vegetated roof. It is shown that latent heat storage significantly contributes to decreasing heat losses during wintertime, which are approximately 5% to 20% lower in comparison to non-vegetated roofs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate response; Green roof's thermal response; Heat load; Heat losses; Latent heat storage; Water freezing","Energy efficiency; Freezing; Heat flux; Heat losses; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Latent heat; Mass transfer; Mineral wool; Specific heat; Thermal load; Wool; Yarn; Apparent heat capacity methods; Climate response; Climatic conditions; Extensive green roofs; Heat and mass transfer; In-situ experiments; Thermal response; Water freezing; Roofs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043366022

Adopting the established coupled kinetic, thermal and mass model of TC-Trombe wall system, in terms of the seasonal performance of space heating and formaldehyde degradation in heating seasons in Hefei, the effect of the thermal storage by the massive wall and the comparisons with conventional Trombe wall system are investigated. The results indicate to some degree, the thermal storage by the massive wall decreases the performance of formaldehyde degradation and space heating for TC-Trombe wall system.

Lithium-ion batteries, as green energy storage devices, are widely used in mobile phones, laptops, cameras and other portable electronic devices. In recent years, lithium-ion batteries have begun to be applied in the field of power batteries such as electric vehicles. However, the electric vehicles suffer from inferior cruise-ability, frequent charging and high cost because of their relatively low energy density. The energy density (2 600 Wh•kg-1) of lithium-sulfur batteries, composed of lithium metal as anode and sulfur as cathode, is much higher than that of state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. Additionally, the sulfur cathode material is abundant, nontoxic, cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness. Hence, lithium-sulfur batteries are considered as one of the most promising secondary batteries. However, the poor CE and limited cycle life, caused by the fundamental defects of sulfur cathode such as low ionic/electronic conductivities, large volumetric expansion and shuttle effect, hamper the widespread application of Li-S battery. So far, considerable studies have focused on enhancing the conductivity, inhibiting or eliminating the shuttle effect and stabilizing the microstructure of electrode material during repeated cycles. It has been demonstrated that the S/C composite cathode materials with special microstructure, prepared by compositing sulfur and carbon with different morphology, exhibit significantly improved conductivity, decreased shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide and less volume change during lithium intercalation/deintercalation. These improvements lead to better rate performance, cycling stability and charge-discharge efficiency. Moreover, the introduction of heterogeneous element-doped carbon materials, metal oxides and conductive polymers in the sulfur cathode material can achieve effective chemical adsorption of lithium polysulfide. Excellent electrochemical lithium storage performance of sulfur cathode can also be achieved by the combination of these various modification me-thods. In this review, the main problems and recent research progress in sulfur cathode materials are summarized and commented upon based on the principle of lithium-sulfur batteries. Meanwhile, it also gives brief suggestions and outlooks on the future research directions in lithium-sulfur batteries. © 2018, Materials Review Magazine.

However, the lack of high-performance anode materials becomes a main obstacle for the development of SIBs. Here, we identify an ideal anode material, a metallic TiC3 monolayer with not only remarkably high storage capacity of 1278 mA h g-1 but also low barrier energy and open-circuit voltage, through first-principles swarm-intelligence structure calculations. TiC3 still keeps metallic after adsorbing two-layer Na atoms, ensuring good electrical conductivity during the battery cycle. Besides, high melting point and superior dynamical stability are in favor of practical application. Its excellent performance can be mainly attributed to the presence of an unusual n-biphenyl unit in the TiC3 monolayer. High cohesive energy, originating from multibonding coexistence (e.g., covalent, ionic, and metal bonds) in the TiC3 monolayer, provides strong feasibility for experimental synthesis. In comparison with TiC3, functionalized TiC3 with oxygen shows a higher storage capacity; meanwhile, it keeps nearly the same barrier energy. This is in sharp contrast with metal-rich MXenes. These intriguing properties make the TiC3 monolayer a promising anode material for SIBs. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Anodes; Calculations; Metal ions; Metals; Monolayers; Open circuit voltage; Sodium-ion batteries; Stability; Cohesive energies; Dynamical stability; Electrical conductivity; High melting point; High specific capacity; High-performance anode materials; Storage capacity; Structure calculation; Titanium compounds; oxygen; sodium ion; titanium carbide; Article; atom; battery capacity; chemical bond; chemical structure; controlled study; electric conductivity; physical phenomena; sodium ion battery; storage; synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046884782

Thereinto, hollow structures with sufficient void space could buffer the volume expansion, whereas dual carbon-confined strategy could not only elastically prevent the aggregation of nanoparticle and ensure the structural integrity but also immensely improve the conductivity and endow high rate properties. Benefiting from the effective strategy and specific structure, the dual carbon-confined SnO2 hollow nanosphere (denoted as G@C@SnO2) can serve as the universal host material for alkali metal ions and enable their rapid and reversible storage.

Aiming at these drawbacks, the Na2HPO4·12H2O-alumina/expanded vermiculite (EVM) form-stable composite phase change materials (NEA fs-CPCMs) with supercooling suppression and heat transfer enhancement were prepared. The favorable wettability of NEA fs-CPCMs was beneficial to their form-stabilization (encapsulation mass fractions above 59.7 wt %). The supercooling degree of NE5.3 was reduced to 1.4 °C after adding 5.3 wt % alumina as the nucleating agent (decreased by 90%). The surface effects of EVM and alumina and high wettability of PCM-alumina were responsible for the supercooling suppression of PCM. Large specific surface area of EVM could provide nucleation sites for crystallization of PCM. The surface electronegativity of alumina increased the affinity ability and diffusion rate of ions, thus effectively increasing the probability of nucleation. The heat transfer of NEA fs-CPCMs was significantly enhanced by the alumina as the thermal conductivity enhancement filler. The thermal conductivity of NE5.3 reached 0.418 W/(m K). Thermal energy storage behavior analysis indicated that the NEA fs-CPCMs showed large heat storage capacity (melting process: 97-151 J/g; solidification process: 60-89 J/g).

Here we propose a novel application of oxalic acid leaching to regenerate Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 (NCM) cathodes from spent LIBs. With lithium dissolving into the solution, the transition metals transform into oxalate precipitates and deposit on the surface of spent NCM cathodes, separating lithium and transition metals in one simple step. After mixing with certain amount of Li2CO3, the oxalate precipitates together with unreacted NCM are directly calcined into new NCM cathodes. The regenerated NCM after 10 min leaching exhibits the best electrochemical performances, delivering the highest initial specific discharge capacity of 168 mA h g-1 at 0.2C and 153.7 mA h g-1 after 150 cycles with a high capacity retention of 91.5%. The excellent electrochemical performances are attributed to the submicrometer particles and voids after calcination, as well as the optimal proportion of elements. This process can make the most of valuable metals in the spent cathodes, with &gt;98.5% Ni, Co, and Mn recycled. It is simple and effective, and provides a novel perspective of recycling cathodes from spent LIBs. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","cathode material; leaching; oxalic acid; regeneration; spent lithium-ion batteries","Calcination; Cathodes; Electric discharges; Ions; Leaching; Lithium compounds; Oxalic acid; Recycling; Transition metals; Cath-ode materials; Electrochemical performance; Energy storage systems; Novel applications; regeneration; Specific discharge capacity; Spent lithium-ion batteries; Submicrometer particle; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046799921

Nevertheless, it is still a significant challenge to realize superior electrode materials with high capacity and good cyclability. To address these problems, herein, a rational microstructure of the SnS2-carbon composite has been designed for superior performance, which consists of MWNTs as a carbon matrix, the SnS2 nanosheet (NS) as an active material, the outer carbon coating as a protection layer, as well as the interior void space for volume accommodation. As an anode material for SIBs, the so-produced MWNT@SnS2 NS@C electrode delivered a high initial capacity of 910 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and a good retention of 78% after 100 cycles. The sodium storage mechanism of SnS2 was systematically studied through CV, ex situ XPS, and ex situ HRTEM characterization studies, disclosing the reversible conversion and alloying reactions of SnS2 during sodiation/desodiation processes. Moreover, ex situ TEM was further applied to clarify the relationships between the SnS2-C microstructure and sodium storage performance.

However, these additives are usually denounced for their low lithium-ion capacity. Moreover, emergence of vacant defect and heteroatom incorporation would open a sizable energy gap accompanied by reduced conductance. Here, by selecting MoS2 as a prototype system, we proclaim the utilization of emerging borophene as the conductive additive in terms of its low ion-transport barrier and robust metallic conductivity against defects and external doping in addition to its high Li-storage capacity. We found that substantial electrons transfer from MoS2 to borophene, producing strong electronic coupling that conduces to favorable interface bonding in combination with improved Li affinity. Incorporation of borophene also compensates the poor mechanical property of MoS2 with increased elastic modulus, ensuring the electrode integrity against pulverization. Furthermore, B/MoS2 can achieve a maximum Li-storage capacity of 539 mAh/g along with low ion-hopping barriers inherited from its counterparts.

Herein, a universal method is reported for making hierarchical hollow carbon nanospheres (HCSs) with intimately coupled ultrathin carbon nanosheets and Mo-based nanocrystals. The in situ and confined reaction of the synthetic strategy can not only allow the aggregation of the nanocrystals to be impeded, but also endows extremely intimate coupled interaction between the conductive carbon nanosheets and the nanocrystals MoM (M = P, S, C and O). As a proof of concept, the as-prepared MoP/C HCSs exhibit extraordinary hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity with small overpotential and robust durability in both acidic and alkaline solutions. In addition, the unique sheet-on-sheet MoS2/C HCSs as an anode demonstrate high capacity, great rate capabilities, and long-term cycles for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The capacity can be maintained at 410 mA h g−1 even after 1000 cycles even at a high current density of 4 A g−1, one of the best reported values for MoS2-based electrode materials for SIBs.

Metal selenide possesses good conductivity and capacity but still suffers from the stacked problem and volume expansion. Significantly, CoSe2/C is successfully prepared with the assistance of citric acid as both a chelating agent and carbon precursor, displaying that cobblestone-like nanospheres with the radii (&lt;25 nm) distribute uniformly in the carbon matrix. It is expected that the established Co-O-C bonds enhance the stability of the structure with faster ion shuttling. With the available electrolyte (NaCF3SO3/diethylene glycol dimethyl ether) in a potential window range from 0.5 to 3.0 V, the as-obtained sample shows the ultralong lifespan at 4.5 A g-1, retaining a capacity of 345 mA h g-1 after 10 000 cycles. From the detailed kinetic analysis, it is clear that the surface-controlled electrochemical behavior mainly contributes to the excellent large-current cycling stability and Na storage capacity. The ex situ results support that the crystal and morphological structure remains stable.

Further, the porous CNT sponge can be easily compacted via an intense densification of the active material MoSe2 to produce an electrode with a high mass loading for a significantly improved areal capacity. In this work, we present a tunable coating of MoSe2 on a CNT sponge to fabricate a core-shell MoSe2@CNT anode. The three-dimensional nanotubular sponge is synthesized via a solvothermal process, followed by thermal annealing to improve crystallization. Structural and morphological studies revealed that MoSe2 grew as a layered structure (d = 0.66 nm), where numbers of layers can be controlled to yield optimized results for Li+ storage. We showed that the 10-layer core-shell CNT@MoSe2 hybrid sponge delivered a discharge capacity of 820.5 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1 with a high cyclic stability and rate capability. Further, an ex situ structural and morphological analysis revealed that ionic storage causes a phase change in MoSe2 from a crystalline to a partial amorphous state for a continuous increase in the capacity with extended cycling. We believe that the strategy developed here will assist users to tune the electrode materials for future energy-storage devices, especially how the materials are changing with the passage of time and their effects on the device performance. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","core-shell structures; free-standing electrodes; LIBs; MoSe2; nanotubular structures","Anodes; Carbon nanotubes; Electric discharges; Lithium; Nanocrystalline materials; Shells (structures); Storage (materials); Core shell structure; Free-standing electrode; LIBs; MoSe2; Nano-tubular structure; Selenium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046488201

The effects of nano-silica, nano-magnesia and nano-zirconia on the evolution of the mechanical and thermal properties of calcium aluminate cement (CAC) pastes at three temperatures (105, 350 and 900°C) were investigated. At 105°C, the addition of nano-zirconia resulted in better residual compressive strength than those of the pastes with the other nanoparticles. The improvement in thermal properties of the pastes with added nanoparticles was mainly at temperatures of 350°C and 900°C. The main reason for the difference of properties is that the incorporation of nanoparticles accelerates the forming process of the solid phase according to calorimetric analysis. The microstructure of the pastes was also found to be affected by the nanoparticles.

The low-cost binary salt Ca(NO3)2-NaNO3 was chosen as the PCM and expanded graphite (EG) was as the structural supporting material and thermal conductivity enhancer. The results showed that the binary eutectic nitrate and EG have good chemical compatibility, and the composite with 7 wt% EG can overcome the problems of cracks or liquid leakage during the phase change. Benefiting from the established better conductive passageway within the composites, the thermal conductivity of the composite with 7 wt% EG can be significantly increased by about 7.3 times in comparison with the binary eutectic nitrate. However, the measured phase change latent heats of the shape-stable phase change materials (SSPCMs) are markedly lower than the theoretical ones, meaning some losses of the latent heat during the material fabrication process. The developed SSPCM also showed little change of the phase change properties after 500 thermal cycles, indicating it has good thermal reliability for a long term period. Compared with other PCMs for mid- to high-temperature applications, this novel cost-effective composite SSPCM is very promising due to the wide operating temperature range and high thermal conductivity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Expanded graphite; Nitrate salt; Shape-stable PCM; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy storage","Cost effectiveness; Eutectics; Graphite; Heat storage; High temperature applications; Latent heat; Nitrates; Sintering; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Chemical compatibility; Expanded graphite; High temperature thermal energy storages; High thermal conductivity; Nitrate salts; Operating temperature ranges; Phase change latent heat; Phase change property; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044672053

A particularly promising solution to power these vehicles is the retrieval of energy from the ocean temperature gradient. This paper investigates the use of thermoelectric generators (TEGs) for that purpose, by presenting a complete model of thermoelectric generators embedded in the hull of an underwater glider. The model includes not only the thermoelectric generators but also the heat transfer process and the behaviour of different heat storage materials. Several simulations are performed, for each storage material, to determine the adequate design parameters leading to sufficient energy generation for a thermal glider. It is shown that the use of Phase Change Materials (PCM) as an energy storage material is highly advantageous over the use of sea water or stainless steel. Furthermore, it is shown that this approach, although leading to a high number of TEGs and mass of PCM, is compatible with current existing glider dimensions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Renewable energy; Thermoelectric generators; Underwater gliders","Autonomous underwater vehicles; Electronic equipment; Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Seawater; Storage (materials); Thermoelectric equipment; Design parameters; Energy generations; Heat transfer process; Model and simulation; Renewable energies; Thermo-electric generators; Underwater gliders; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044665066

However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) lower their energy conversion efficiencies. Herein, we in situ grow amorphous NiSx-FeOy particles on sulfur doped carbon fiber paper (termed as NiSx-FeOy/SCFP) as practical self-supported oxygen electrode through a simple and economic synthesis route. Benefiting from the synergetic effects of amorphous NiSx-FeOy and SCFP, NiSx-FeOy/SCFP possesses massively accessible active sites, enhanced electrons and reactants transfer, and stable integrated structure, exhibiting a low overpotential (0.37 V) at 10 mA cm−2 for OER, a positive half-wave potential for ORR and a small potential gap (0.82 V). Zinc air flow battery assembled with newly developed NiSx-FeOy/SCFP shows a coulombic efficiency of 100% and a voltage efficiency of 50% at the charge-discharge current of 10 mA cm−2, and vigorously operates 110 h without performance decay, showing highly catalytic activity and super cycling stability, which are among the best performance ever reported.

This is owed to advantages such as economic viability and eco-friendliness. In this context, the family of conjugated dicarboxylates has emerged as an interesting candidate for the application as negative electrodes in advanced Li-ion batteries due to the revealed thermal stability, rate capability, high capacity and high cyclability. This work aims to rationalize the effects of small molecular modifications on the electrochemical properties of the terephthalate anode by means of first principles calculations. The crystal structure prediction of the investigated host compounds dilithium terephthalate (Li2TP) and diethyl terephthalate (Et2Li0TP) together with their crystal modification upon battery cycling enable us to calculate the potential profile of these materials. Distinct underlying mechanisms of the redox reactions were obtained where Li2TP comes with a disproportionation reaction while Et2Li0TP displays sequential redox reactions. This effect proved to be strongly correlated to the Li coordination number evolution upon the Li insertion into the host structures. Finally, the calculations of sublimation enthalpy inferred that polymerization techniques could easily be employed in Et2Li0TP as compared to Li2TP. Similar results are observed with methyl, propyl, and vinyl capped groups. That could be a strategy to enhance the properties of this compound placing it into the gallery of the new anode materials for state of art Li-batteries. © 2018","Disproportionation; Li-ion organic battery; Lithium terephthalate; Redox potential","Anodes; Calculations; Carboxylation; Crystal structure; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Lithium; Lithium-ion batteries; Secondary batteries; Crystal structure prediction; Diethyl terephthalates; Disproportionation reactions; Disproportionations; First-principles calculation; Molecular modification; Redox potentials; Terephthalate; Redox reactions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043510810

Direct steam generation systems, in particular, eliminate the usage of heat transfer fluids allowing for the power block to be run at greater operating temperatures and therefore further increasing the thermal efficiency of the power cycle. On the other hand, the current state of the art of these systems does not comprise thermal energy storage. The lack of storage adds to the already existing variability of operating conditions that all concentrating power plants endure due to the fluctuating nature of the solar supply. One way of improving this situation is increasing the operating flexibility of power block components to better adapt to the varying levels of solar irradiance. In particular, it is desirable for the plant to achieve fast start-up times in order to be available to harness as much solar energy as possible. However, the start-up speed of the whole plant is limited by the thermal inertia of certain key components, one of which is the steam turbine. This paper studies the potential for power plant performance improvement through the increase of steam turbine flexibility at the time of start-up. This has been quantified by carrying out power plant techno-economic studies in connection with steam turbine thermo-mechanic behavior analysis. Different turbine flexibility investigations involving the use of retrofitting measures to keep the turbine warmer during offline periods or changing the operating map of the turbine have been tested through multi-objective optimization considering annual power performance and operating costs. Results show that reductions of up to 11% on the levelized cost of electricity are possible through the implementation of these measures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Flexibility; Optimization; Start-up; Steam turbine; Techno-economic analysis","Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Multiobjective optimization; Operating costs; Optimization; Reactor startup; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Steam; Steam turbines; Concentrating solar power; Concentrating solar power plant; Direct steam generation; Flexibility; Levelized cost of electricities; Power plant performance; Solar tower power plants; Techno- economic analysis; Steam power plants; energy efficiency; heat transfer; operations technology; optimization; performance assessment; power plant; solar power; solar radiation; technical efficiency; thermal power; turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043241123

Building a highly compatible flexibility evaluation method that incorporates a clear relation between flexibility indices and RE curtailment is crucial to addressing this issue. A novel flexibility evaluation methodology is proposed based on the probabilistic distribution of flexibility adequacy. The novel indices can reflect the direction, amount, frequency, and consequence of lack of flexibility and also have a linear relationship with RE curtailment, features that are beneficial for planners aiming to determine the type of flexible resources needed and to quantify their capacity. The conditional probability distribution functions of different types of flexible resources are first built. Then, a unified form of flexibility on different time-scales is proposed to represent and calculate their contributions to flexible indices using conditional probability convolution. The evaluation method is validated in a combined heat-and-electricity supply system. Four types of flexible resources are studied to demonstrate the quantitative capability of the proposed method in planning, including conventional units, electricity storage devices, heat storage devices, and electric boilers. © 2017 IEEE.","curtailment; Flexibility evaluation; power system planning; renewable power","Distribution functions; Electric energy storage; Energy policy; Heat storage; Planning; Probabilistic logics; Probability distributions; Random variables; Renewable energy resources; Standby power systems; Virtual storage; Cogeneration; Curtailment; Flexibility Evaluation; Indexes; Power system planning; Renewable Power; Resistance-heating; Electric power system planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042856232

Owing to containing seven moles butyl sulfonate sodium, hyperbranched SMEs PNSO3Na CIL can form interfacial dipoles, tune the interfacial energy alignment, realize environment-friendly water/alcohol processing, induce the upper active layer to form order morphology and enhance the PCE of PSCs. Based on P3HT–PC61BM active layer, the PCE of the device based on PNSO3Na CIL was dramatically enhanced from 0.8 to 3.7% compared to the bare ITO device. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Cathodes; Cell engineering; Electric energy storage; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Molecules; Polymer solar cells; Cathode interfacial layers; Environment friendly; Interfacial dipoles; One-step reactions; Organic photovoltaics; Polymer solar cell (PSCs); Power conversion efficiencies; Well-defined structures; Solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042558814

Herein, PPy/GO–COOH composite electrodes are fabricated via a facile one-pot electrochemical polymerization in aqueous dispersion containing pyrrole monomers and GO–COOH, in which GO–COOH is obtained from GO through treatment with carboxylation. Electrochemical measurements indicate that PPy/GO–COOH composite electrodes possess markedly enhanced electrochemical capacitive properties as compared to PPy/GO composite electrodes. It is because that the GO–COOH, all-round carboxyl-covered nanosheets with edged and basal oxygen-containing sites, provides more active sites for PPy heterogeneous nucleation. In contrast, the nanosheets of GO only use the edged carboxyl groups. The as-prepared PPy/GO–COOH composite electrodes exhibit electrochemical capacitive properties with a high areal specific capacitance of 170.9 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2, superior rate capability, as well as cycling stability (retaining 96.9% of initial capacitance for 5000 cycles).

Nonetheless, due to differences in definition and quantification methodologies for energy flexibility, comparing results between such studies is difficult. With a review and applied evaluation of existing definitions and quantification methodologies this paper aims at assessing the applicability, benefits and drawbacks of each quantification methodology. The conducted review shows that energy flexibility definitions found in the literature have their particularities despite sharing the same principle that energy flexibility is the ability to adapt the energy profile without jeopardizing technical and comfort constraints. The survey of quantification methodologies reveals two main approaches to quantify energy flexibility. A first approach quantifies energy flexibility indirectly using past data and assuming a specific energy system and/or energy market context. The second approach directly predicts the energy flexibility that a building can offer to the energy system in a bottom-up manner. While applications for both approaches were identified, this paper focuses on the latter. By applying methodologies that follow this second approach to a common case study, three common properties of energy flexibility were observed: i) the temporal flexibility; ii) the amplitude of power modulation; iii) and the associated cost. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Demand response; Demand side management; Energy flexible buildings; Load control; Smart grid","Commerce; Demand side management; Digital storage; Electric utilities; Heat storage; Power markets; Press load control; Renewable energy resources; Bottom-up manner; Demand response; Energy flexibility; Flexible building; Potential impacts; Power modulation; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; Smart power grids",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042448190

By tuning the potential of the positive and negative electrodes, both electrodes achieve the equal capacity, which allows the electrochemical performance of the assembled sodium-ion capacitor to be greatly improved and optimized. The assembled sodium-ion capacitor has a maximum energy density of 84 Wh kg−1, while maintaining 42 Wh kg−1 at a high power of 9053 W kg−1. The optimized sodium-ion capacitor can retain 67% of its capacity after 5000 cycles. This work gives a general strategy for designing high-performance sodium-ion capacitors for low-cost and large-scale production. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Electrodes; Ions; Metal ions; Porous materials; Surface defects; Electrochemical performance; Hierarchical porosity; Hierarchical porous carbons; High specific surface area; Large scale productions; Negative electrode; Power performance; Sodium ion batteries; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040219972

Direct carbonization of conjugated polymers with a specific morphology is an eco-friendly and low-cost technique for the synthesis of dual atom-doped carbon nanomaterials for application in energy devices.

Herein, an efficiently conductive framework of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and graphene (G) is rationally constructed to wrap LiFePO4 (LFP) into a binder-free dense electrode by a coupling technique of spray deposition and vacuum filtration. The spray ensures a uniform mixing of LFP, G and GNRs, meanwhile the vacuum filtration leads to a dense packing of the mixture. With only 2 wt% of G and GNRs, the LFP/GNR/G electrode delivers a high rate capability and a stable (dis)charge cycling performance under high LFP loading conditions. Moreover, the dense LFP/GNR/G electrode exhibits superior volumetric properties among all the reported LFP electrodes on the basis of the entire electrode volume, including a Li storage capacity of 318 A h L-1, an energy density of 1020 W h L-1 and a power density of 5.1 kW L-1 at 5C rate.

Low-cost cathodes with high performance are crucial for KIBs. Herein, K4Fe(CN)6 is shown to be a low-cost and high-voltage cathode for KIBs. It can deliver a high voltage of approximately 3.6 V and a discharge capacity of 65.5 mAh g−1 with a lifespan of 400 cycles of discharge and charge. This is attributed to the strong σ bonds between C atoms and Fe and to the reduced particle size and good contact with conductive carbon brought about by ball milling, which benefit both the K+ ion and the electronic conduction. The [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− redox couple is found to be responsible for charge compensation upon reversible extraction/insertion of K+ from/into K4Fe(CN)6.

But there are still some obstacles retarding the wide application of Mg batteries, including poor kinetics of Mg-ion transport in lattices and low theoretical capacity in inorganic frameworks. A Mg-Li dual-salt electrolyte enables kinetic activation by dominant intercalation of Li-ions instead of Mg-ions in cathode lattices without the compromise of a stable Mg anode process. Here we propose a Mg-organic battery based on a renewable rhodizonate salt (e.g., Na2C6O6) activated by a Mg-Li dual-salt electrolyte. The nanostructured organic system can achieve a high reversible capacity of 350-400 mAh/g due to the existence of high-density carbonyl groups (CO) as redox sites. Nanocrystalline Na2C6O6 wired by reduced graphene oxide enables a high-rate performance of 200 and 175 mAh/g at 2.5 (5 C) and 5 A/g (10 C), respectively, which also benefits from a high intrinsic diffusion coefficient (10-12-10-11 cm2/s) and pesudocapacitance contribution (&gt;60%) of Na2C6O6 for Li-Mg co-intercalation. The suppressed exfoliation of C6O6 layers by a firmer non-Li pinning via Na-O-C or Mg-O-C and a dendrite-resistive Mg anode lead to a long-term cycling for at least 600 cycles. Such an extraordinary capacity/rate performance endows the Mg-Na2C6O6 system with high energy and power densities up to 525 Wh/kg and 4490 W/kg (based on active cathode material), respectively, exceeding the level of high-voltage insertion cathodes with typical inorganic structures. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","Mg-Li dual-salt electrolyte; Mg-organic batteries; multielectron transfer reaction; nanostructured rhodizonate salts; pseudocapacitance effect","Anodes; Binary alloys; Cathodes; Electrolytes; Graphene; Ions; Nanocrystals; Salts; Secondary batteries; High reversible capacities; Large-scale transportation; Multielectron transfer; Nano-structured; Pseudocapacitance; Salt electrolytes; Stationary energy storages; Volumetric energy densities; Magnesium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045836906

In this work, four kinds of CoCO3 micrometer particles stabilized in the network of CNFs are designed and synthesized by using solvothermal method. The composite electrodes of cubic-CoCO3/CNF, spherical-CoCO3/CNF, spindle-CoCO3/CNF and dumbbell-CoCO3/CNF deliver the initial specific capacities of 1190, 987, 1193 and 1108 mAh g−1, respectively, and remain 503, 584, 666, 551 mAh g−1 at the 100th cycle. Bare spindle CoCO3 delivers the highest capacity of 1588 mAh g−1, but CoCO3 without the support of CNFs only remains 140 mAh g−1 at the 100th cycle. Spindle-CoCO3/CNF composite electrode exhibits the best rate performance, delivering 507 mAh g−1 at the current density of 1.0 A g−1. The ex-situ field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images show that CNFs elastically buffer the volume change of CoCO3 during lithiation/delithiation cycles. CNFs as substrate play the important roles in providing excellent conductive channel to improve the rate capability and effective matrix buffering the volume change to promote the cyclic performance.

The effects of alkali (NaOH), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and complex salts (CS) on the pore size of the WF were investigated. The results showed that the CS-treated WF (CS-WF) achieved the maximum pore size and impregnation ratio. The characterization by Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, and X-ray diffractometer illustrated that the combination of the LA-MA eutectic mixture and the CS-WF was a physical combination. The differential scanning calorimetry results suggested that the optimum melting temperature and the latent heat of the CS-WF/LA-MA FSPCM were 33.1 °C and 98.2 kJ kg-1, respectively. The maximum impregnation ratio of the LA-MA eutectic mixture into the CS-WF was 60.3%. In addition, the thermogravimetric analysis indicated that the CS-WF/LA-MA FSPCM had better thermal durability than the pure LA-MA. Moreover, the CS-WF/LA-MA FSPCM had excellent thermal reliability after 500 thermal cycles. Thus, the CS-treatment of the WF was considered an excellent modification method.

A partial cation exchange reaction based on the solubility difference between Sb2S3 and ZnS can transform mesoporous ZnS to Sb2S3/ZnS heterostructure. To get a stable structure, a thin contiguous resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) layer is introduced on the surface of Sb2S3/ZnS heterostructure. The effectively protective carbon layer from RF can be designed as the reducing agent to convert Sb2S3 to metallic Sb to obtain core–shell Sb/ZnS@C hybrid heterostructures. Simultaneously, the carbon outer shell is beneficial to the charge transfer kinetics, and can maintain the structure stability during the repeated sodiation/desodiation process. Owing to its unique stable architecture and synergistic effects between the components, the core–shell porous Sb/ZnS@C hybrid heterostructure SIB anode shows a high reversible capacity, good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability by turning the optimized voltage range.

However, PBAs suffer poor cyclability due to irreversible phase transition in deep charge/discharge states. PBAs also suffer low crystallinity, with considerable [Fe(CN)6] vacancies, and coordinated water in crystal frameworks. Presently, a new chelating agent/surfactant coassisted crystallization method is developed to prepare high-quality (HQ) ternary-metal NixCo1−x[Fe(CN)6] PBAs. By introducing inactive metal Ni to suppress capacity fading caused by excessive lattice distortion, these PBAs have tunable limits on depth of charge/discharge. HQ-NixCo1−x[Fe(CN)6] (x = 0.3) demonstrates the best reversible Na-storage behavior with a specific capacity of ≈145 mA h g−1 and a remarkably improved cycle performance, with ≈90% capacity retention over 600 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, a dual-insertion full cell on the cathode and NaTi2(PO4)3 anode delivers reversible capacity of ≈110 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 1.0 C without capacity fading over 300 cycles, showing promise as a high-performance SIB for large-scale energy-storage systems.

Field-emission scanning electron microscope images illustrated that the MES component was well dispersed and encapsulated into the three-dimension porous network structure of the PET supporting matrices during the electrospinning process. Maximum weight percentage of the MES combined in composite nanofibres was found as 50 wt.% without the leakage of MES in liquid state even when it was heated over the melting temperature of MES powder. FTIR analysis revealed no chemical reactions between the MES molecules and the PET molecules. From differential scanning calorimetry analysis, electrospun MES/PET phase change composite nanofibres with different mass ratios processed appropriate phase transition temperatures of about 19–47 °C, and the maximum melting and freezing enthalpies could reach up to 90.43 and 88.03 kJ/kg, respectively. Thermogravimetric analyses’ results suggested that electrospun MES/PET phase change composite nanofibres exhibited good thermal stability during the phase change temperature range, and their thermal stability was improved due to the introduction of PET supporting matrices having the better thermal stability. In addition, the results of tensile testing indicated that electrospun MES/PET phase change composite nanofibres gradually lost ductile and exhibited smaller elongations with the increase in MES content, whereas their tensile strength showed an increased tendency from 6.0 to 7.8 MPa. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","electrospinning; Methyl stearate; morphological structures; phase change composite nanofibres; thermal energy storage","Chemical analysis; Differential scanning calorimetry; Electrospinning; Heat storage; Melting; Molecules; Nanofibers; Scanning electron microscopy; Spinning (fibers); Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Thermal energy; Thermodynamic stability; Thermogravimetric analysis; Field emission scanning electron microscopes; Form stable phase change material; Methyl stearate; Morphological structures; Phase Change; Phase change temperature; Porous network structures; Thermal and mechanical properties; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007410877

The peak shaving (or load cycling) operation of conventional thermal power plants is an effective means to mitigate the mismatch between electricity demands and supplies. Therefore, determining how thermal power plants can operate in a flexible and effective mode is an urgent issue that should be addressed. For thermal power plants, new methods and strategies need to be proposed to face the challenge of the integrating flexibility and energy saving into transient processes. Dynamic performances of thermal power plants during load cycling processes are affected by the coupling of the thermal system and the control system. Feasible approaches from optimizing the coordinated control system (CCS) may radically enhance the peak shaving capacity of thermal power plants. The heat storage in a coal-fired power plant, including heating surface metals and work media, varies with the load rate of the plant. During cycling load operations, the real-time heat storage value of one unit differs from that of the corresponding steady state load command rate. This difference hinders the flexibility of one unit and affects its economic performances during cycling processes. In this paper, a revised water fuel ratio (WFR) control strategy based on heat storage difference was proposed and tested on established coal-fired power plant models. Results show that the accumulation deviations of load rate command and real-time load rate are considerably reduced during load cycling processes when the proposed WFR control strategy is introduced. The revised WFR control strategy diminishes the difference between the target and the actual total power output. When the load cycling rate varies from 10 to 30 MW min−1 between 50% and 100% THA, the standard coal consumption variation rate (Δbs) decreases by 0.31–1.01 g kW−1 h−1 during loading up processes, and decreases by 0.26–1.69 g kW−1 h−1 during loading down processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coal-fired power plant; Heat storage; Operational optimization; Transient processes; Water fuel ratio","Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal storage; Control systems; Energy conservation; Fire tube boilers; Fuel storage; Fuels; Heat storage; Mining; Renewable energy resources; Thermoelectric power plants; Coal-fired power plant; Coordinated control system; Economic performance; Fuel ratio; Operational optimization; Peak-shaving capacity; Renewable energy source; Transient process; Fossil fuel power plants; alternative energy; coal-fired power plant; control system; demand analysis; electricity generation; heat budget; operations technology; optimization; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042333591

In this study, dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D2) was used to explore the charge/discharge process of polyimide, which is an organic polymer electrode material that could be used in Li-ion batteries. The calculated potentials of PI-1 (polyimide-1) and PI-2 (polyimide-2) are 2.03 and 2.07 V, respectively, and they significantly agree with experimental values, which implies that DFT-D2 is a powerful method to investigate polymer electrodes for use in lithium ion batteries. The calculated potential of pyromellitimide (DPI) is 1.79 V, and DPI is a novel electrode material that has not been reported to date. For each of the three polyimides, lithium ions do not diffuse along the polymer chains but diffuse in the vertical direction, and the migration barriers of PI-1, PI-2, and DPI are 0.47, 0.84, and 0.088 eV, respectively; thus, they have good ionic conductivities (beyond PI-2). Although the calculated band gaps of the three polyimides are all approximately 1.0 eV, the effective electron (or hole) masses are too large, which may limit their electronic conductivities and rate performances. The calculated results show that polyimides are potential Li-ion electrode materials, and this theoretical method could be applied to design novel polymer electrode materials. © 2018","Li-ion battery; Polyimide electrode materials; Theoretical method; vdW correction","Density functional theory; Design for testability; Dispersions; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Energy gap; Ions; Lithium; Organic polymers; Polyimides; Secondary batteries; Van der Waals forces; Dispersion-corrected density functional; Effective electrons; Electrode material; Electronic conductivity; Experimental values; Organic electrodes; Small organic molecules; Theoretical methods; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041410308

To enhance the thermal conductivity without compromising the latent heat of fusion of PCMs, high-quality graphene aerogels (HGAs) with both a highly conductive network and high porosity are fabricated on the basis of highly processable graphene oxide (GO) pastes. Freeze-drying of the GO pastes fixes their shapes and endows the resultant GO aerogels with high porosity, and high-temperature annealing of the GO aerogels at 2800 °C efficiently removes the oxygen-containing groups of the GO component and heals its defects to get HGAs with high thermally conductive capacity. Due to the interconnecting network with high porosity constructed by the high-quality graphene sheets, the resulting HGAs are highly efficient in improving the thermal conductivity of PCMs at a low graphene loading. After impregnating the porous HGA with 1-octadecanol, the obtained composite with only ∼5.0 wt% of graphene exhibits a satisfactory shape stability, an exceptional thermal conductivity of ∼4.28 W m-1 K-1 that is 18-fold higher than that of neat 1-octadecanol, and a high latent heat of fusion of ∼225.3 J g-1.

Among all anodes for SIBs, antimony (Sb) is one of the most attractive ones, but it suffers from a rapid capacity fading because of about 290% volume change upon sodiation/desodiation. Here a facile bottom-up strategy has been developed to prepare nanoporous Sb/C with high Sb content and dispersity via a ball-milling assisted solid state reaction between Sb2O3 and CaC2. The simultaneous and stoichiometric generation of Sb and C facilitates a high dispersion of Sb in, theoretically, 23 wt% carbon. Feeding excess CaC2 can adjust the porosity of the composite, and tailor Sb particles from crystalline (10-20 nm in size) to amorphous (at the subnanometer scale). The synthesized amorphous Sb/C composite exhibits an unprecedented performance for sodium storage. It delivers a high reversible capacity of 480 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, 403 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1, and 283 mA h g-1 after 3000 cycles at 5.0 A g-1.

In the present work, the electrochemical oxidation of AA is performed with Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) anodes which have controlled oxygen content, modulated by acid reflux treatment. Furthermore, a total oxygen content increase of just 2% on MWCNTs surface was sufficient to achieve an enhanced AA electrocatalytic oxidation. The oxygen content was notoriously lower than other nanocarbon materials like unzipped carbon nanotubes and reduced graphene oxide which normally are considered as optimal materials. The surface chemical composition on MWCNTs was analyzed by XPS. The anodes were prepared as carbon film electrodes (CFE) by dropping cast procedure on GC surface (current collector). Cyclic voltammetry was used to evaluate the electrochemical responses of these electrode materials varying the concentration of AA (10, 50 and 100 mM). At a fixed concentration, the electrochemical responses show an increase in current and a shift of peak potential that facilitate oxidation as the acid treatment time increases. It was found that the COO− groups are responsible for the enhanced catalytic behavior of these modified MWCNTs. The simple change of functional groups by the same acid treatment procedure at different times has a notorious effect on AA oxidation. These findings provide straightforward selection criteria for anodes devoted to AA fuel cell design. Also, it is demonstrated that MWCNTs can still provide new alternatives for enhanced electrocatalytic processes. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Ascorbic acid electrocatalysis; Ascorbic acid fuel cells; Low oxygen content; MWCNT anodes","Anodes; Carbon films; Carbon nanotubes; Chemical analysis; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrocatalysis; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemical oxidation; Electrodes; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Gas fuel purification; Graphene; Graphene oxide; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanotubes; Organic acids; Oxidation; Oxygen; Yarn; Electro-catalytic oxidation; Electrocatalytic process; Electrochemical response; Energy storage applications; Low oxygen contents; Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs); Reduced graphene oxides; Surface chemical composition; Ascorbic acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044327224

Experimental results are presented in terms of the discharging energy rates (power) and the discharging exergy rates for low (~4 ml/s) and high discharging flow rates (~8 ml/s). Water heating energy rates, which are respectively maximized at approximately 600 W and 1200 W at low and high flow-rate discharging, are found to be higher than the discharging energy rates, which are respectively maximized at 450 W and 900 W. These results indicate that the energy rates do not accurately evaluate the thermal performance of the discharging heat exchanger since the energy heating rate of the water is greater than that for the oil that heats it, which is thermodynamically inconsistent. The energy rates should thus be used with caution when the thermal performance of the heat exchanger is evaluated. Water heating exergy rates, which are respectively maximized at approximately 45 W and 130 W at low and high flow-rate discharging, are generally smaller than the discharging exergy rates, which are respectively maximized at 65 W and 170 W. Exergy rate results are thus more consistent in the physical process of water heating, and an exergy factor is suggested as a proper measure for evaluating the performance of the discharging heat exchanger. The maximum value of the exergy factor is found to increase from 0.15 at low flow rates to a maximum value of approximately 0.19 at high flow rates. This implies that to extract more energy from a storage tank to a discharging heat exchanger, the flow rate has to be high, which is consistent with the physical process of heating water faster to higher temperatures. The exergy factor can thus be used as a design parameter for discharging heat exchangers. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Discharging heat exchanger; energy; exergy; thermal energy storage","Flow rate; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Heating; Tanks (containers); Thermal energy; Design parameters; Domestic storage tanks; energy; Energy and exergy analysis; High-flow rate; Physical process; Thermal Performance; Water heating; Exergy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042945320

Less attention is given to Li–S batteries with high volume energy density, which is crucial for applications in compact space. Here, a series of elastic sandwich-structured cathode materials consisting of alternating VS2-attached reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets and active sulfur layers are reported. Due to the high polarity and conductivity of VS2, a small amount of VS2 can suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides and improve the redox kinetics of sulfur species in the whole sulfur layer. Sandwich-structured rGO–VS2/S composites exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performance, with high discharge capacities, low polarization, and excellent cycling stability compared with their bare rGO/S counterparts. Impressively, the tap density of rGO–VS2/S with 89 wt% sulfur loading is 1.84 g cm−3, which is almost three times higher than that of rGO/S with the same sulfur content (0.63 g cm−3), and the volumetric specific capacity of the whole cell is as high as 1182.1 mA h cm−3, comparable with the state-of-the-art reported for energy storage devices, demonstrating the potential for application of these composites in long-life and high-energy-density Li–S batteries. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, they exhibit poor discharge capacity and capacity retention during long-term cycling because of their inherent drawbacks including the poor conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and the large volume expansion of sulfur to lithium sulfide. An effective approach that can solve these problems is to use an interlayer inserted between the separator and the cathode. Nevertheless, the underlying adsorption mechanism of LiPSs on the interlayer has not yet been widely investigated. Herein, the effect of lithium bond chemistry on the adsorption of LiPSs on the functionalized carbon fiber paper (CFP) interlayer containing hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amide functional groups is investigated by a density functional theory approach. It is found that the functionalized CFP exhibits a strong lithium bond interaction between the Li electron acceptor of LiPSs and the N or O electron donor of the functionalized CFP interlayer. In addition, the correlation between the adsorption energy of LiPSs on the interlayer and the electrochemical performance of LSBs is investigated. The results provide the fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationship for the adsorption of LiPSs on the functional groups of the interlayer, which will be beneficial for the further development of advanced LSBs. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Carbon fibers; Composite films; Density functional theory; Functional groups; Lithium batteries; Lithium sulfur batteries; Polysulfides; Sulfur compounds; Adsorption energies; Adsorption mechanism; Amide functional group; Discharge capacities; Effective approaches; Electrochemical performance; Structure property relationships; Theoretical capacity; Lithium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045105608

However, the serious capacity fading resulting from the shuttle effect hinders its commercial application. Encapsulating small S2-4 molecules into the pores of ultramicroporous carbon (UMC) can eliminate the dissolved polysulfides, thus completely inhibiting the shuttle effect. Nevertheless, the sulfur loading of S2-4/UMC is usually not higher than 1 mg cm-2 because of the limited pore volume of UMC, which is a great challenge for small sulfur cathode. In this paper, by applying ultralight 3D melamine formaldehyde-based carbon foam (MFC) as a current collector, we dramatically enhanced the areal sulfur loading of the S2-4 electrode with good electrochemical performances. The 3D skeleton of MFC can hold massive S2-4/UMC composites and act as a conductive network for the fast transfer of electrons and Li+ ions. Furthermore, it can serve as an electrolyte reservoir to make a sufficient contact between S2-4 and electrolyte, enhancing the utilization of S2-4. With the MFC current collector, the S2-4 electrode reaches an areal sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm-2 and performs a capacity of 839.8 mA h g-1 as well as a capacity retention of 82.5% after 100 cycles. The 3D MFC current collector provides a new insight for the application of Li-S batteries with high areal small sulfur loading and excellent cycle stability. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","3D current collector; carbon foam; high areal sulfur loading; lithium sulfur batteries; small sulfur molecules; ultramicroporous carbon","Carbon; Cathodes; Electric current collectors; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Foams; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Lithium sulfur batteries; Melamine formaldehyde resins; Microbial fuel cells; Molecules; Carbon foam; Commercial applications; Current collector; Electrochemical performance; Electrolyte reservoirs; Energy storage systems; Sulfur loading; Sulfur molecule; Loading",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044971961

Unlike the passive equalization technology using a resistor or active equalization with expensive DC-DC converter for the balancing among the cells, this equalization circuit consists of the fly-back transformer and RCD circuit, which can easily and cheaply realize the energy transfer between the whole battery module and the cells, and thus achieving bidirectional equalization. In this system, both the primary side and the secondary side of multi-winding transformer are connected to a MOSFET. All MOSFETs are controlled by the PWM signal. The control timing and duty ratio of the PWM control signal are determined through the simulation analysis. Meanwhile, an RCD circuit is applied at the primary side of multi-winding transformer for buffering the peak voltage caused by leakage inductance. In the control process, the equalization strategy is proposed by considering the voltage, SOC and capacity difference simultaneously, and in order to avoid the equalization control logic chaos, only one battery cell is balanced at the same time. The equalization strategy is verified by MATLAB/Simulink and has a satisfactory performance. To verify the effectivity of the proposed circuit, a prototype for six series-connected 18650 NCM lithium battery cells is implemented, and the experimental results show that the equalization system has good circuit performance and the efficiency is more than 80%.

However, the undesirable Li dendrite growth usually leads to low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and safety hazards. Here, we employ reduced graphene oxide (rGO) infiltrated Ni foam (rGO@Ni) as a three-dimensional (3D) current collector to suppress Li dendrites. After Ni foam is soaked up with rGO, the enlarged working area conduces to a low local effective current density and a homogeneous Li deposition, therefore rendering a dendrite-free morphology. Compared with the Cu foil and Ni foam electrodes, the rGO@Ni electrode achieves enhanced CE and longer cycle life. Even for an extreme areal capacity of 20 mAh cm-2, so far the highest areal capacity has been reported in the literatures, the rGO@Ni current collector not only merely still functions after 50 cycles, but also delivers an enhanced CE of above 95%. Moreover, the symmetrical cell runs for 1100 h without fluctuation. The exceptional electrochemical performance of the rGO@Ni current collector indicates a rosy prospect for the remedy of the dendrite problem.

The heat storage characteristics of phase change materials in solar energy storage tanks directly affect the performance of the system and its future promotion and utilization. Based on the knowledge of heat transfer, fluid mechanics and engineering thermodynamics, this paper uses MATLAB software to compile the dynamic heat storage characteristics calculation program of phase change materials in energy storage tanks, and verify the results. This paper analyzes the phase change heat storage process with three PCM initial temperatures and three HTF speeds. The results show that when the initial temperature of the PCM changes from 185°C to 210°C, the latent heat storage heat increases by 21.8%, and the total heat storage decreases. Increasing the HTF speed from 1.8 m/s to 2.2 m/s, the melting time was reduced from 414 minutes to 390 minutes, and the total heat storage and sensible heat storage were also increased. The results also show that changing the initial temperature of the PCM and the flow rate of the HTF will change the thermal storage performance of the system.

A novel capric-stearic acid eutectic (CA-SA)/OEV FS-PCM with high thermal storage capacity was then developed. OEV and CA-SA/OEV were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetry (TG), and thermal cycling test. Results showed that OEV has obvious hydrophobicity and a higher adsorption capacity for fatty acid. Its adsorption ratio has increased by 48.71% compared with that of EV. CA-SA/OEV possesses high thermal storage density (112.52 J/g), suitable melting temperature (20.49 °C), good chemical compatibility, excellent thermal stability and reliability, indicating great application potential for building energy efficiency.

In present work, a numerical model was developed to provide a tool to simulate the heat and light transfer process in a multi-layer glazed roof filled with PCM for developing engineering analyses, which was validated by experimental method. The influences of refractive index and extinction coefficients in solid and liquid states on thermal and optical performance of the glazed roof were investigated. The results show that the influences of solid and liquid refractive index on the interior temperature are smaller than that of solid and liquid extinction coefficients. Due to the convection process of air layer, the influences of the optical parameters of PCM in solid and liquid states on the temperature difference are both completely opposite. The liquid extinction coefficients on temperature decrement factor is bigger than other optical parameters, even the bigger liquid extinction coefficients may make the insulation effect of PCM invalid.

Both the heat storage and release processes of building envelope have coupling influences on the indoor thermal environment during intermittent heating process. In order to make the best of the heat storage and release process to adjust the indoor thermal environment, this paper integrated phase change material (PCM) with the building envelope and experimentally studied the thermal performance improvement under four typical intermittent heating conditions summarized by questionnaires in China. The results show that the inner surface temperature of the PCM wall increased faster after heating, which was more favorable to ensure that the indoor thermal environment recovers to the thermal comfort state quickly. The inner surface temperature of the PCM wall was higher than the reference wall after heating was off, which can maintain a constant indoor air temperature. In the heating process of the four conditions, the inner surface heat flux value was 18.48% lower than the reference wall. Integrating PCM with the building envelope can not only improve the indoor thermal environment, but also reduce the heating time and heating energy consumption. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Experimental study; Intermittent heating; Phase change material; Questionnaire; Thermal performance","Atmospheric temperature; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Heat flux; Heat storage; Phase change materials; Solar buildings; Surface properties; Surveys; Thermal comfort; Walls (structural partitions); Building envelopes; Experimental study; Heating energy consumption; Indoor air temperature; Indoor thermal environments; Intermittent heating; Questionnaire; Thermal Performance; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041449808

As a result, when employed as anodes in Li/Na-ion batteries, the Na0.23TiO2/Ti3C2 electrodes exhibit superior long cycling stability (up to 4000 cycles at the high rates with respective capacity retention of over or nearly 100%), and remarkable rate capability.

In this work, the feasibility of the thermodynamics of powder formation is discussed for explaining such a reaction mechanism, as well as the recent progress of conventional and supercritical hydro/solvothermal syntheses, are summarized. The association among synthesis conditions, structure, morphology and electrochemical properties, especially for rate capability and tap density under hydro/solvothermal condition, are highlighted. Notably, this work primarily concentrates on the processes in which additives participate in the hydrothermal synthesis of LMP and considers less the subsequent treatments of synthesized LMP with extra additives. In other words, the modifications during the synthesis process with additives are the primary topic. Recently, supercritical hydro/solvothermal synthesis has been demonstrated to be a promising approach for generating high-crystalline micro-nanoparticles with short reaction times (less than 2 min) and high crystallization rates affected by the specific characteristics in supercritical fluids. Additionally, the smallest powders among the reported LFP nanoparticles (less than 15 nm) had been synthesized via SHS (supercritical hydrothermal synthesis).

The influences of alcohols on the morphology, microstructure, and electrochemical behaviors of PANI nanofibers were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, as well as electrical and electrochemical measurements. It is found that the growth and migration of PANI nanofibers were obviously suppressed due to the hydrogen bonding between polymer chains and alcohol molecules. An improvement on the electrochemical performances could be achieved by adding alcohol molecules especially ethanol into aqueous medium. The specific capacitance was 1017, 1031, and 1042 F g−1 at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and 444, 463, and 489 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 for the PANI nanofibers prepared without alcohol as well as with methanol and ethanol, respectively. The increase in specific capacitance could be contributed to the formation of the nanofibers with larger length to diameter ratio and higher orientation of polymer chains, which could provide shorter ion diffusion path, enhance the electroactive regions, and increase the electrode/electrolyte contact area. This study therefore provides an efficient modified interfacial polymerization for fabricating PANI nanofibers with more desirable morphology and better energy storage performance.

First, the analysis of cyclic thermal performance of SLPBTT shows the performance can be enhanced by reducing the retention thermocline thickness. Second, this is the first time for a detailed investigation of the expanding and the shortening effects on thermocline thickness at the interface between two kinds of filler. In addition, a novel MLPBTT is designed utilizing the above interface effects for improving the performance by controlling thermocline expansion.

An optimized MLPBTT shows a significant improvement in the useful energy of 10.5% and a small drop in thermal efficiency of 2.1% in discharging process compared with those of SLPBTT using the quartzite rock.

The as-produced CP/SnO x @C film has excellent flexibility and mechanical stability to be directly served as electrode for LIBs. Carbon shell prevents the detachment and agglomeration of the active particles during lithiation/delithiation processes and maintains the stability of the conductive network. After 100th cycles, CP/SnO x @C electrode delivers 0.8 mAh cm −2 , much higher than the capacity 0.37 mAh cm −2 of CP/Sn electrode operated at the current density of 0.1 mA cm −2 . These features enable the flexible film of CP/SnO x @C to be attractive applications in energy storage devices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anode materials; Lithium-ion batteries; Passivation layer; Tin-based materials","Anodes; Carbonization; Film preparation; Ions; Mechanical stability; Paper; Passivation; Tin compounds; Anode material; Conductive networks; Core-shell composites; Crystal morphologies; High-performance anodes; High-performance lithium-ion batteries; Lithiation/delithiation; Passivation layer; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036454366

The most fascinating performance of Mn0.33Co0.67N is the rate capability, in which 91% of capacity is maintained when the current density increases ten-fold from 0.2 A g-1 to 2.0 A g-1. This enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to the fact that Mn doping makes it faster to regenerate Co-N bonds, as evidenced by a calculated apparent ammoniation activation energy (Ea) decrease from 113 kJ mol-1 to 96 kJ mol-1. This fast regeneration of Co-N bonds upon conversion reactions is believed to prevent the nitride electrode from a partial loss of charge capacity upon high rate cycling, in turn facilitating the extrinsic pseudocapacitive contribution. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anodes; Battery storage; Chemical activation; Cobalt compounds; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Lithium-ion batteries; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Nitrides; Secondary batteries; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Activation energies (Ea); Charge capacities; Conversion reactions; Electrochemical performance; High reversible capacities; Pseudocapacitive; Rate capabilities; Storage performance; Activation energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044260053

However, the insulating nature of sulfur and the dissolution of the polysulfides Li2Sn (4 ≤ n ≤ 8) seriously restrict its practical application. The metastable small sulfur molecules (S2-4) stored in microporous carbon (pore size of &lt;0.6 nm) as the active materials can avoid the production of the soluble polysulfide and solve the shuttle effect thoroughly. In addition, the conductivity of sulfur can be also improved. However, the preparation of microporous carbon materials with reasonable pore size and unique morphology for efficiently encapsulating S2-4 is still challenging. Herein, three flowerlike microporous nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets with the pore size of &lt;0.6 nm (namely, FMNCN-800, -900, and -1000) as the cathode materials in Li-S batteries were obtained from temperature-dependent carbonization of the metal-organic framework (MOF), Zn-TDPAT, which was from the simply reflux reaction of N-rich ligand H6TDPAT with Zn(II) salt. Our study showed that the FMNCN-900 from carbonization of Zn-TDPAT at 900 °C has suitable pore volume and nitrogen content, accommodating small S2-4 molecules in its micropores with the mass uptake of about 45%. Meanwhile, the appropriate amount of the nitrogen doping and the unique nanostructure of the flowerlike carbon nanosheet in the FMNCN-900 can effectively support its fast electronic transmission and lithium-ion conduction. The resulting S@FMNCN-900 composite cathode material presents the excellent electrochemical property in the Li-S battery (here the carbonate as electrolytes) with a reversible capacity of about 1220 mAh/g at 0.1C after 200 cycles and even 727 mAh/g at 2C after the long-term cycle of 1000 with only around 0.02% capacity loss per cycle. Obviously, the results indicate that the delicate construction of MOF-derived nitrogen-doped microporous carbon nanosheet is a promising strategy to develop novel electrode material for high-performing Li-S batteries. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","lithium-sulfur battery; metal-organic frameworks; microporous carbon; nanosheet; small sulfur molecules","Battery storage; Binary alloys; Carbonization; Cathodes; Crystalline materials; Doping (additives); Electric batteries; Electrodes; Lithium; Lithium-ion batteries; Microporosity; Microporous materials; Molecules; Nanosheets; Nitrogen; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Polysulfides; Pore size; Sulfur; Tin alloys; Zinc; Composite cathode material; Energy storage systems; Environmental benignity; Lithium ion conduction; Metal organic framework; Micro-porous carbons; Nitrogen-doped carbons; Sulfur molecule; Lithium sulfur batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044190066

A ternary fatty acid eutectic composed of laurie acid, myristic acid and palmitic acid was used as PCM, and diatomite and ceramsite based thermal energy storage aggregates were manufactured by using a direct impregnation treatment. The results show that the PCM has a melting temperature of 31.1 °C and latent heat of 166.6 J/g. The PCM adsorption volume in pore system reaches 28.1% and 89.8% of the total porosity for ceramsite and diatomite respectively. The addition of thermal energy storage aggregates decreases the slump at fresh status, compressive strength and thermal conductivity of concrete. Concrete incorporating 80% of thermal energy storage aggregate by volume has a compressive strength of higher than 18 MPa. Diatomite based thermal energy storage aggregate presents a better effect on controlling the early age hydration temperature rise than ceramsite based one. The incorporation of thermal energy storage aggregate significantly improves the temperature fluctuation in the testing room when exposed to a heating-cooling environment.

Compared to bare SnO2 and corresponding binary composites including SnO2/CNTs and SnO2/Gr, SnO2/CNTs/Gr shows significantly improved cycling stability and rate performance. The initial discharge specific capacity of SnO2/CNTs/Gr is 1391 mAh g−1 and remains 522 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Meanwhile, the composite shows excellent rate reversibility. For example, 120 mAh g−1 can be retained at a high current density of up to 1600 mA g−1, and 582 mAh g−1 can still be retrieved once the current density is switched back to 50 mA g−1.

This hybrid system includes a wind farm, a concentrated solar power plant with thermal energy storage, and an electric heater. The major role of the electric heater is to convert the redundant wind power into thermal energy, and the thermal energy is stored in the thermal energy storage of the concentrated solar power plant. The optimal scheduling of this hybrid system is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem to maximize the profit subjected to technical constraints. The effects of the electric heater on the system are studied under different weather conditions. The test results show that the electric heater is helpful for reduction of the both deviation from generation plan and wind curtailment. The maximum relative deviation falls from 5.15% to 0% during the clear sky day, and 47.49% to 31.74% during the partial cloudy day. The wind curtailment rate decreases by 52.59% and 100% for clear and partial cloudy days, respectively.

Firstly, thermal performances of the PCM heat sink under different thermal shocks (from 200 W to 1000 W) were experimentally evaluated, in comparison with that of an organic PCM which has similar melting point. It was found that, the former one can prolong the working duration 1.4–2.4 times that of the latter one. Then, the performance of the heat sink was improved through reducing the contact thermal resistance and by increasing the fin number. Furtherly, an air cooling radiator was configured to accelerate the solidification process of the PCM module, which makes it capable of maintaining its highest temperature below 85 °C under 1000 W periodic thermal shock (10 min on and 15 min off). Moreover, energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis was conducted to verify the compatibility of the LMPM PCM and the structural materials. Finally, a simplified numerical model was developed and validated for the currently constructed finned heat pipe assisted LMPM PCM heat sink, which can be much helpful for future practical thermal design and optimization of this kind of thermal buffering module. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Electronics cooling; Extremely high thermal shock; Heat pipe; Low melting point metal; Phase change material; Thermal energy storage","Electronic cooling; Electronics packaging; Heat pipes; Heat sinks; Heat storage; Melting point; Phase change materials; Spectrometers; Thermal energy; Thermal shock; Air cooling radiator; Contact thermal resistance; Electronics cooling; Energy dispersive spectrometers; Heat generation rate; High power electronics; Low melting point; Solidification process; Heat resistance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044352792

However, a fan is required in conventional EAHEs for air circulation, and BV normally serves as a passive cooling measure in temperate transitional seasons. This paper proposes the coupling of EAHEs and the buoyancy generated inside a building to achieve passive and autonomous ventilation without requiring any mechanical system. A model is developed to investigate the effects of the coupled system, with a primary focus on the dynamics of the airflow temperature, flow rate, and cooling/heating capacity provision. The model results are in good agreement with those of the computational fluid dynamics simulation. The model is applied in a hypothetical building located in a hot-summer/cold-winter region (Chongqing, China). The proposed coupled scheme is superior to the BV in hot and cold seasons. The indoor air temperature, ventilation flow rate, and cooling/heating capacity are found to fluctuate asynchronously. The cooling capacity is 56.3 kWh for the hottest day, and the heating capacity is 111.1 kWh for the coldest day. The maximum cooling or heating capacity is nearly achieved at the hottest or coldest times with the help of ventilation flow rate fluctuation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Buoyancy coupling; Earth-to-air heat exchanger; Energy-efficient ventilation; Heat storage; Thermal dynamics; Ventilation flow fluctuation","Buoyancy; Computational fluid dynamics; Cooling; Dynamics; Earth (planet); Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Ventilation; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Earth-to-air heat exchanger; Energy efficient; Energy efficient technology; Indoor air temperature; Natural ventilation; Thermal dynamics; Ventilation flow; Energy efficiency; airflow; building; buoyancy; computational fluid dynamics; cooling; energy efficiency; heat transfer; heating; indoor air; thermodynamics; ventilation; China; Chongqing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041649530

Herein, we report the facile synthesis of MoO3 nanoplates within foam-like carbon nanoflakes (CNFs) via the pyrolysis of molybdenum 2-ethtlhexanoate (C48H90MoO12) at a low temperature of 300 °C under ambient atmosphere. Mixing C48H90MoO12 with the highly porous foam-like CNFs allows the sufficient pyrolysis of Mo precursor, which can readily crystallize into MoO3 with plate morphology. The loading amount of MoO3 within CNFs can be easily and precisely controlled by adjusting the relative amount of C48H90MoO12/CNFs, while the plate morphology of MoO3 can be well preserved. The structural characteristics as well as the formation mechanism are investigated. When used as anode material for LIBs, optimized MoO3/CNFs displays superior lithium storage performance, delivering a high discharge capacity of 791 mA h/g after 100 cycles at 500 mA/g and even ∼600 mA h/g at a high rate of 2000 mA/g.

However, the practical applications of Li-S batteries are restricted by the low conductivity of sulfur, serious dissolution of intermediate polysulfides and fast capacity degradation. Herein, we design a titanium nitride (TiN) modified separator to improve the long-term cycle stability and discharge capacity of Li-S batteries. Strong interaction between the TiN particles and polysulfides can greatly restrain the “shuttle effect” and benefit the cycle stability. With this modified separator, cathodes with a sulfur loading of 78.1% could deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1296 mAh/g and demonstrate a decay rate of 0.17% per cycle under a high current density of 0.5C. Such superior electrochemical performances ascribe to the high conductivity of TiN and strong affinity between TiN particles and polysulfides. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","High content sulfur; Lithium-sulfur batteries; Modified separator; Titanium nitride particles","Electric batteries; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Lithium sulfur batteries; Nitrides; Polysulfides; Potential energy; Secondary batteries; Separators; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Titanium; Titanium compounds; Titanium nitride; Capacity degradation; Discharge capacities; Electrochemical performance; Environmental friendliness; High current densities; High-content; Initial discharge capacities; Nitride particles; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038823862

Amorphous carbon with high electronic conductivity and high surface area is likely to be the most promising anode material for SIBs. However, the rate capability of amorphous carbon in SIBs is still a big challenge because of the sluggish kinetics of Na+ ions. Herein, a three-dimensional amorphous carbon (3DAC) with controlled porous and disordered structures is synthesized via a facile NaCl template-assisted method. Combination of open porous structures of 3DAC, the increased disordered structures can not only facilitate the diffusion of Na+ ions but also enhance the reversible capacity of Na storage. When applied as anode materials for SIBs, 3DAC exhibits excellent rate capability (66 mA h g−1 at 9.6 A g−1) and high reversible capacity (280 mA h g−1 at a low current density of 0.03 A g−1). Moreover, the controlled porous structures by the NaCl template method provide an appropriate specific surface area, which contributes to a relatively high initial Coulombic efficiency of 75%.

In this work, a novel form-stable phase change material (FSPCM) has been prepared via ligand replacement followed by the embedment of acetylene black conductive network. The addition of 20 wt% acetylene black reduces the resistivity of the polyethylene glycol-based PCM from 107−1012 Ω·m to 0.3 Ω·m, while its thermal conductivity is increased by 300%. The resulting conductive composite possesses the ability to store heat at voltage as low as 1.8 V and high electro-to-heat conversion efficiency. The composite compressive strength reaches 105 Pa at an ambient temperature of 110 °C, while the temperature is 60 °C more than that of phase transition temperature of PCM. Further, the magnitude of the temperature change in the electrothermal conversion curves recorded after 50 solid-liquid phase transition cycles does not exceed 2.0%.

Immobilization of Sn-M alloys within carbon matrices has proven to be effective to improve their cycling stability, but the traditional pyrolysis of separate Sn, M, and C precursors often leads to uneven distribution of the three components in Sn-M-C ternary anodes. Herein, we report a facile and general aerogel-derived pyrolysis route to realize homogeneous embedding of uniformly-sized Sn-M alloy nanocrystals, within a nanoporous carbon matrix, using cyano-bridged hetero-metallic (Sn-M) aerogels hybridized with carbon sources as precursors. Using the optimized citric acid (CA) as a carbon source, the formations of nanoporous Sn-Fe@C and Sn-Ni@C networks have been illustrated as examples through pyrolyzing CA/Sn-Fe and CA/Sn-Ni aerogels, respectively. By virtue of their compositional/structural superiorities toward lithium storage, the as-prepared Sn-Fe@C and Sn-Ni@C networks manifest higher capacities, enhanced cycling stability, and improved rate capability compared to the Sn-M-C composites and carbon samples derived from bare aerogels and CA precursors, respectively.

However, the critical environmental sensitivity and limited conductivity of this kind of sulfate-based (SO42-) polyanionic material has led to its poor crystal stability and inferior intercalation ability. Herein, we report the design of nitrogen-doped graphene under low temperature conditions as an evolutionary modification approach to prepare the Na2+2xFe2-x(SO4)3; namely, an alluaudite sulfate Na2+2xFe2-x(SO4)3@N-rGO composite was prepared by a facile co-precipitation method assisted by the nitrogen-doped graphene. It is therefore surprising that the three-dimensional graphene-based network provides continuous electron pathways; thus, the Na2+2xFe2-x(SO4)3@N-rGO composite exhibits improved electronic conductivity and excellent sodium insertion capability, as well as the electrochemical performance. As a result, it delivers a reversible capacity of 93.2 mA h g-1 with average redox potential of 3.8 V (vs. Na+/Na) at 0.05C; when the discharge rate increased to 10C, it delivers 56.3 mA h g-1 and an amazing capacity retention of 83% is achieved after 400 cycles. On the other hand, the doped nitrogen species plays a huge role on improving the electron-donating ability of the graphene layer, which effectively protects the easily oxidized host material from deterioration, giving the material longer stability in a normal oxygen-containing atmosphere. We believe that this work may lead to a promising, low cost, suitable sodium ion battery material for next-generation large-scale energy storage devices. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Battery storage; Cathodes; Doping (additives); Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Metal ions; Nitrogen; Redox reactions; Secondary batteries; Sodium-ion batteries; Sulfur compounds; Surge protection; Temperature; Electrochemical performance; Electron-donating ability; Environmental sensitivities; Evolutionary modification; Low temperature conditions; Nitrogen doped graphene; Oxygen containing atmosphere; Three-dimensional graphene; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043389568

The obtained MnO@NC-Z nanospheres are composed of numerous MnO nanoparticles that are uniformly coated by an ultrathin (∼5 nm) and nitrogen-rich (∼3.7 wt%) carbon layer derived from the in-situ grown ZIF-8 layer, which could not only restrict the volume expansion of MnO during the charge-discharge process but also substantially improve the electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the synthesized MnO@NC-Z also possesses a high porosity and large specific surface area due to the porous structure of the ZIF-8 precursor and the evaporation of nano-sized Zn reduced from the ZIF-8 during the carbonization process, which could facilitate the fast transport of Li ions. As the anode in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the prepared MnO@NC-Z nanospheres deliver excellent performance with a high reversible capacity of 1261 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, brilliant rate performance of 305 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 5 A g−1, and excellent cycling stability for 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 with a 96.5% capacity retention.

Unfortunately, the undesirable electrical conductivities and huge volume variations during cycling processes coupled with Li+ intercalation and de-intercalation will lead to severe capacity fading and poor cycling stability. To address these problems, nitrogen-doped carbon-coated SnO2/SnS (SnO2/SnS@N-C) composite was in situ synthesized by virtue of a simple solvothermal reaction and subsequent post-treatment. Herein, the heterostructures between SnO2 and SnS were designed to accelerate charge transfer by using the effect of internal electric field and improve the dispersion among particles. While coating the nitrogen-doped carbon on heterostructures aimed to improve electrical conductivities and relieve huge volume alterations during the processes of Li+ insertion and de-insertion. To our satisfactory, the as-prepared SnO2/SnS@N-C composite as anodes for lithium-ion batteries can display a high specific capacity (1050 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1), enhanced rate capability, and long cycle life (550 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles), which outperforms both SnO2@N-C and SnS@N-C.

However, a lack of appropriate high-performance anode materials has prevented further improvements. Here, a hierarchical porous hybrid nanosheet composed of interconnected uniform TiO2 nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped graphene layer networks (TiO2@NFG HPHNSs) that are synthesized using dual-functional C3N4 nanosheets as both the self-sacrificing template and hybrid carbon source is reported. These HPHNSs deliver high reversible capacities of 146 mA h g−1 at 5 C for 8000 cycles, 129 mA h g−1 at 10 C for 20 000 cycles, and 116 mA h g−1 at 20 C for 10 000 cycles, as well as an ultrahigh rate capability up to 60 C with a capacity of 101 mA h g−1. These results demonstrate the longest cyclabilities and best rate capability ever reported for TiO2-based anode materials for SIBs. The unprecedented sodium storage performance of the TiO2@NFG HPHNSs is due to their unique composition and hierarchical porous 2D structure. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this work, high-performance NIBs are demonstrated by designing a 3D interconnected porous structure that consists of N, S co-doped 3D porous graphene frameworks (3DPGFs-NS). The most typical electrode materials (i.e., Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP), MoS2, and TiO2) are anchored onto the 3DPGFs-NS matrix (denoted as NVP@C@3DPGFs-NS; MoS2@C@3DPGFs-NS and TiO2@C@3DPGFs-NS) to demonstrate its general process to boost the energy density of NIBs. The N, S co-doped porous graphene structure with a large surface area offers fast ionic transport within the electrode and facilitates efficient electron transport, and thus endows the 3DPGFs-NS-based composite electrodes with excellent sodium storage performance. The resulting NVP@C@3DPGFs-NS displays excellent electrochemical performance as both cathode and anode for NIBs. The MoS2@C@3DPGFs-NS and TiO2@C@3DPGFs-NS deliver capacities of 317 mAhg−1 at 5 Ag−1 after 1000 cycles and 185 mAhg−1 at 1 Ag−1 after 2000 cycles, respectively. The excellent long cycle life is attributed to the 3D porous structure that could greatly release mechanical stress from repeated Na+ extraction/insertion. The novel structure 3D PGFs-NS provides a general approach to modify electrodes of NIBs and holds great potential applications in other energy storage fields. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Metal sulfides are deemed to be promising anode materials for SIBs due to their low-cost and eco-friendliness. Herein, for the first time, series of copper sulfides (Cu2S, Cu7S4, and Cu7KS4) are controllably synthesized via a facile electrochemical route in KCl-NaCl-Na2S molten salts. The as-prepared Cu2S with micron-sized flakes structure is first investigated as anode of SIBs, which delivers a capacity of 430 mAh g-1 with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 84.9% at a current density of 100 mA g-1. Moreover, the Cu2S anode demonstrates superior capability (337 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1, corresponding to 50 C) and ultralong cycle performance (88.2% of capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g-1, corresponding to 0.0024% of fade rate per cycle). Meanwhile, the pseudocapacitance contribution and robust porous structure in situ formed during cycling endow the Cu2S anodes with outstanding rate capability and enhanced cyclic performance, which are revealed by kinetics analysis and ex situ characterization. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Anodes; Battery storage; Chlorine compounds; Copper; Copper compounds; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Ions; Lithium-ion batteries; Metal ions; Secondary batteries; Sodium chloride; Sodium sulfide; Sodium-ion batteries; Sulfur compounds; Abundant resources; Capacity retention; Cyclic performance; Electrochemical routes; Electrochemical synthesis; Energy storage applications; Initial Coulombic efficiency; Pseudocapacitance; Potassium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043313764

Here, self-thermal-reduction method is successfully applied to prepare antimony/carbon rods (Sb/C rods) utilizing potassium antimony(III)-tartrate (C8H10O15Sb2K2) as a dual source of carbon matrix and metallic antimony. According to theory calculations and experiment results, the formation process is explicitly explored as follows: C8H10O15Sb2K2 → Sb2O3/C → Sb2O3/Sb/C → Sb/C rods. Notably, organic ligands in C8H10O15Sb2K2 can be gradually turned into amorphous carbon with simultaneous reduction of Sb3+ to metal Sb. Moreover, potassium chloride acts as an activator and a template during the course of carbonization, and synchronous reduction is introduced. Consequently, an antimony/carbon electrode material denoted as SbOC/C is formed, exhibiting a unique dual-carbon-modified structure and extensive SbOC bridge bonds that give rise to outstanding cycling performance and rate capacity. Specifically, the capacity is maintained at 404 mA h g−1 with 89% retention after 700 cycles at 500 mA g−1.

Most current strategies adopt chemical modifications or chemical binders to improve the interface interaction between flexible components, which inevitably lowers the cyclic lifetime and increases the production cost. Here, we report an in situ, scalable sol-gel method to fabricate free-standing TiO2/superaligned carbon nanotube (SACNT) hybrid films as flexible anodes in Li-ion batteries. The natural and desirable wettability between TiO2 and SACNTs makes any chemical modifications or chemical binders unnecessary in the fabrication process, delivering a clean TiO2-SACNT interface. The as-prepared TiO2/SACNT anodes not only inherit the high flexibility of the SACNT framework but also enhance rate capability and charge/discharge reversibility with its pseudocapacitive storage mechanism. These anodes exhibit a high capability and a long cyclic lifetime (over 1000 cycles at 60 C) in half cells. They are further assembled to make flexible full cells, where binders, conductive agents, and current collectors are all unnecessary. The capacity decay of a full-cell test is almost negligible over 500 cycles of bending with a fast charging rate within 50 s, suggesting TiO2/SACNT films to be a promising material for flexible storage devices. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.","carbon nanotube; Flexible Li-ion batteries; free-standing; sol-gel; TiO2","Anodes; Binders; Bins; Carbon films; Carbon nanotubes; Charging (batteries); Chemical modification; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Flexible electronics; Ions; Lithium; Nanotubes; Secondary batteries; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Storage (materials); Titanium dioxide; Yarn; Current collector; Electrode material; Fabrication process; Flexible components; free-standing; High capabilities; Interface interaction; TiO2; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043263699

Here, we facilely prepare a series of novel multiple solid-solid PCMs (SSPCMs, EPPa-X systems) by blending paraffin, epoxy resin with crystalline side chains (D18), and poly(propylene oxide)diamine together followed by a one-pot curing process. Strong intermolecular forces between paraffin and D18 (based on their good compatibility) and a reliable three-dimensional (3-D) cross-linking network of epoxy resin form a unique encapsulation mechanism, which provides the EPPa-X SSPCMs with excellent shape-stable properties and superior thermal stability (remain stable below 180 °C) without sacrificing too much latent heat of paraffin (only 1.6% latent heat loss). Due to the combination of two melting processes at 36 and 60 °C derived from D18 and paraffin, respectively, the latent heat of the EPPa-50 system is high, up to 152.6 J/g. Besides, the supercooling extent of D18 decreased from 13.6 to 10.5 °C with the addition of paraffin due to the heterogeneous nucleation effect. The novel EPPa-X SSPCMs possess tremendous potential for a wide range of applications due to their facile preparation, low cost, high reliability, and excellent phase change properties, while the unique encapsulation mechanism may open a new door for preparing other novel types of PCMs. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.","Encapsulation mechanism; Epoxy resin; Paraffin; Phase change materials; Supercooling","Blending; C (programming language); Chemical bonds; Epoxy resins; Heat storage; Latent heat; Nucleation; Paraffins; Supercooling; Facile preparation; Good compatibility; Heterogeneous nucleation; High reliability; Inter-molecular forces; Melting process; Phase change property; Threedimensional (3-d); Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043254428

Large amounts of waste PBs were generated because of its short serving life. Recovery technology of waste PBs is a pressing need. However, there is little published information about the recovery technology of waste PBs. The recovery technology of spent lithium battery might be suitable for treating waste PBs. But the current method of recovering spent lithium battery is combination technologies of crushing and hydrometallurgical leaching, providing inefficient and incomplete recovery of full materials. Additionally, some wastewater was produced. In this study, the materials from waste PBs and its structures were characterized, and an environmentally friendly technology of recovering copper foil, diaphragm, cobalt, nickel, and lithium aluminum oxide from waste PBs is proposed. The technology is a combination of manual dismantling, crushing, vacuum roasting, and magnetic separation. Intact polymer diaphragms and copper foils were recovered by manual dismantling. Cathode materials (LiNix/3Mny/3Coz/3O2, aluminum foil, and carbon) and anode graphite powder were transferred to Co, Ni, MnO, and Li2O by vacuum roasting. Chemical conversion in the recovery process was discussed in detail. The recovery rate of nickel and cobalt was estimated to be about 94.59 wt %. About 23.92 wt % of the mixed cathode and anode materials was transformed to CO2. No additional reagent was employed in the process, and no toxic gases, hazardous solid waste, and wastewater were produced.

The performance of a PCM for thermal energy storage could be altered by chemical dopants added directly to the PCM in order to form a stable suspension. We described in this paper the role of chemical dopants in the variation of thermophysical parameters for CaCl2 • 6H2O inorganic PCM with 1 wt% and 2 wt% dopant concentration and BaSO4 (1 wt%) as a nucleator using the T-history method. The dopant consists graphite and CuO nanoparticles. The data analysis follows the original method proposed by (Zhang et al 1999 Meas. Sci. Technol. 10 201-205) and its modification by (Hong et al 2004 Int. J. Refrig. 27 360-366). In addition, the enthalpy-temperature curve is obtained by adopting a method proposed by (Marín et al 2003 Meas. Sci. Technol. 14 184-189). We found that the solid specific heat tends to increase non-linearly with increased dopant concentration for all dopants. The increased liquid specific heat, however, indicates the optimum value for 1 wt% graphite dopant. In contrast, the CuO dopant shows a smaller increase in dopant concentration. The specific heat data are analyzed based on the interacting mesolayer model for a nanofluid. The heat of fusion show strong variation with dopant type, in agreement with other experimental data for various PCMs and dopant particles. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","chemical dopant; phase change material; T-history; thermophysical parameters","Barium sulfate; Chlorine compounds; Copper oxides; Data handling; Digital storage; Enthalpy; Graphite; Heat storage; Information analysis; Nanofluidics; Phase change materials; Semiconductor doping; Specific heat; CuO nanoparticles; Dopant concentrations; Dopant type; Heat of fusion; History data; Optimum value; Temperature curves; Thermo-physical parameters; Sulfur compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045639804

Thermal energy storage (TES) devices involve successive melting and crystallization processes, which result in high complexity materials where the morphology, composition, and porosity could be highly non-homogeneous. In these cases, contact techniques for determining the thermal properties are highly susceptible and do not provide reliable measurements. It is under these conditions that non-contact photothermal techniques can provide superior performance, because in this case, the heat inducing source is a laser beam and the detector is usually a photodiode or a thermographic camera which are in non-contact with samples. The materials applied as storage medium in a TES unit can be divided into four groups: metals and alloys, ceramics and glasses, polymers and elastomers, and composites that include natural materials. Soda lime silicate glass recyclable waste is a very promising material for storage medium due to its inexpensive and wide availability. In this paper, we examined soda lime silicate glass-graphite composites for use as storage medium in a TES unit. A simple one-dimensional model for thermal conductivity was developed based on equivalent thermal circuits for series-parallel composite walls, and we found that thermal conductivity values depend on the amount of graphite dispersed into the samples, the porous media, and their structure. © 2018 Author(s).",,"Characterization; Glass; Graphite; Heat storage; Laser beams; Lime; Metallurgy; Natural polymers; Porous materials; Silicates; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Equivalent thermal circuits; Melting and crystallization; One-dimensional model; Optical and thermal properties; Photo-thermal techniques; Soda lime silicate glass; Thermal characterization; Thermographic cameras; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045093256

Experimental results reveal that the fabricated PCFs are randomly arranged and show a good cylindrical structure with fiber diameters ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers. Most of the HPCMEs are well encapsulated by PMIA sheaths and appear as isolated segments or elongated channels inside the fiber.

However, it is still challenging to achieve high performance anode composites with high specific capacity, excellent rate performance, high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and long cycle life. Based on these requirements, we design and fabricate activated carbon-coated carbon nanotubes (AC@CNT) with hierarchical structures containing micro- and meso-pores. A new structure of phosphorus/carbon composite (P@AC@CNT) is prepared by confining red P in porous carbon through a vaporization-condensation-conversion method. The micro-pores are filled with P, while the meso-pores remain unoccupied, and the pore openings on the particle surface are sealed by P. Due to the unique structure of P@AC@CNT, it displays a high specific capacity of 1674 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C, ultrahigh ICE of 92.2%, excellent rate performance of 1116 mA h g−1 at 6 C, and significantly enhanced cycle stability for LIBs. The application of P@AC@CNT in NIBs is further explored.

Compared to Li–Se batteries, Na–Se batteries show many advantages, including the low cost of sodium resources and high volumetric capacity. However, Na–Se batteries still suffer from the shuttle effect of polyselenides and high volumetric expansion, resulting in the poor electrochemical performance. Herein, Se is impregnated into microporous multichannel carbon nanofibers (Se@MCNFs) thin film with high flexibility as a binder-free cathode material for Na–Se batteries. The fibrous unique structure of the Se@MCNFs is beneficial to alleviate the volume change of Se during cycling, improve the utilization of active material, and suppress the dissolution of polyselenides into electrolyte. The freestanding Se@MCNF thin-film electrode exhibits high discharge capacity (596 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle at 0.1 A g−1) and excellent rate capability (379 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1) for Na–Se batteries. In addition, it also shows long cycle life with a negligible capacity decay of 0.067% per cycle over 300 cycles at 0.5 A g−1.

The morphology, microstructure, and composite of 3D Co3O4-HPND/CNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, micropore and chemisorption analyzer, and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical characterizations indicated that 3D Co3O4-HPND/CNTs present considerably catalytic activity toward glucose oxidation and could be promising for constructing high-performance electrochemical non-enzymatic glucose sensors and glucose/O2 biofuel cell. When used for non-enzymatic glucose detection, the 3D Co3O4-HPND/CNTs modified glassy carbon electrode (3D Co3O4-HPND/CNTs/GCE) exhibited excellent analytical performance with high sensitivity (22.21 mA mM−1 cm−2), low detection limit of 0.35 μM (S/N = 3), fast response (less than 5 s) and good stability.

Poor rate capability and insufficient cycle stability are two main scientific issues urgently needing to be solved for sodium titanate (NaxTiyOz) anodes. In this paper, protonated titanate nanowire arrays are designed rationally as novel additive-free anodes for SIBs. Results reveal that the protonated strategy can controllablly regulate the lattice interlayer spacing of the titanate, which can not only effectively facilitate the Na-ion migration but also suppress the side reaction and inhibit the irreversible trapping of Na-ions in the crystal framework, leading to fast Na-ion diffusion kinetics. Moreover, the protonated titanate material experiences smaller changes in lattice parameters and unit-cell volume during long-term cycling than those of non-protonated material, resulting in less mechanical stresses and capacity loss in an anode. As expected, the protonated titanate material exhibits superior rate performance and ultralong lifespan when utilized as free-standing anode for SIB, remaining 85% capacity retention after 8000 cycles at 5.0 A g−1 (~ 23 C). When assembled as full cell with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, high energy density (262.3 Wh kg−1) and power density (1748.9 W kg−1), excellent rate capability and superior cycle stability (260 cycles, 86%) can be achieved. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Free-standing electrode; Lattice spacing; Sodium-ion battery; Titanate nanowire arrays","Anodes; Electrodes; Ions; Metal ions; Nanowires; Protonation; Reaction kinetics; Titanium compounds; Free-standing electrode; High energy densities; High-performance anode materials; Interlayer spacings; Lattice spacing; Long term stability; Sodium ion batteries; Titanate nanowires; Sodium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041480009

Herein, three-dimensional (3D) mushroom-like NiCo/NiCo2S4@NiCo arrays grown directly on Ni foam (NF) have been constructed via hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods. Owing to the unique mushroom-like structure and the beneficial effect of the composite catalyst, the NiCo/NiCo2S4@NiCo/NF electrode exhibits excellent activity and stability for both OER and HER. When serving as an anode electrocatalyst, the composite catalyst only requires a overpotential of 294 mV to achieve a high current density of 100 mA/cm2 for the OER in 1 M KOH. Moreover, in chronopotentiometric and chronoamperometric measurements, the NiCo/NiCo2S4@NiCo/NF electrode displays distinguished electrochemical and structural stability for at least 100,000 s.

Nanocarbons act as a good template for the growth of metal nanoparticles on it and their hybrid combinations enhance the charge transport and rate capability of electrochemical materials without sacrificing the specific capacity. In this study, titanium dioxide nanotubes (TNT) are synthesized hydrothermally in the presence of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) where the latter acts as base template material for the metal oxide nanotube growth. The MWCNT–TNT hybrid material possesses very high dielectric strength and this is used to enhance the dielectric property of the polymer polyvinyledene fluoride (PVDF). Solution mixing was used to prepare the PVDF/MWCNT–TNT nanocomposites by varying the filler concentrations from 0.5 to 2.5 wt%. Excellent vapor sensing was noticed for the PVDF nanocomposites with different rate of response towards commonly used laboratory solvents. The composites and the fillers were characterized for its morphology and structural properties using scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction studies and infrared spectroscopy. Vapor sensing was measured as relative resistance variations against the solvent vapors, and the dielectric properties of the composites were measured at room temperature during the frequency 102–107 Hz. Experimental results revealed the influence of filler synergy on the properties of PVDF and the enhancement in the solvent vapor detectability and dielectric properties reflects the ability of these composite films in flexible vapor sensors and in energy storage. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Composite films; Dielectric properties; Dielectric properties of solids; Fillers; Fluorine compounds; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hybrid materials; Infrared spectroscopy; Metal nanoparticles; Metals; Nanocomposites; Nanotubes; Oxides; Scanning electron microscopy; Solvents; Titanium; Titanium dioxide; Titanium oxides; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Yarn; Electrochemical materials; Electrochemical performance; Filler concentration; Relative resistance; Scanning and transmission electron microscopy; Specific capacitance; Titanium dioxide nanotubes; X-ray diffraction studies; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037642153

The main challenge for developing long-life and high-performance Li-S batteries is to simultaneously restrain the shuttle of soluble polysulfides while accelerating the redox kinetics of sulfur-related species during cell operation. Herein, a sandwich-type sulfur@Co/N-doped carbon (S@Co-NC) ternary composite is synthesized, combining in a simple way the advantages of synergetic physical and chemical confinement on sulfur-related species. A further electrochemical redox kinetic study confirms that the incorporated conductive Co mediators and doped N species serve as dual electrocatalysts, substantially accelerating the kinetics of the polysulfide redox reactions. By relieving the sluggishness of polysulfide redox reactions, the as-obtained sandwich-type S@Co-NC composite has significantly promoted electrochemical performance including enhanced rate capability, lower polarization and higher Coulombic efficiency. It delivers extremely high discharge capacity of 1401 mAh g−1 at 0.05 C with an area sulfur loading of 1.3 mg cm−2. More importantly, the ternary electrode retains a high rate capability of 694 mAh g−1 over extensive 600 cycles at 1 C, with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency maintenance. These results suggest that the S@Co-NC ternary composite provides possibility of realizing the industrially practical Li-S batteries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Cost effectiveness; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrocatalysts; Kinetics; Lithium; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Polysulfides; Redox reactions; Sulfur; Coulombic efficiency; Discharge capacities; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical redox; Energy storage systems; High rate capability; Rate capabilities; Ternary composites; Lithium sulfur batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035753973

However, the construction of nanostructures always involves with expensive surfactants and complicated synthetic processes, which restrict these methods from large-scale production. In this paper, we develop a simple synthetic route to prepare hierarchical porous Li2FeSiO4/C. XRD, SEM, TEM, Raman, and N2 adsorption-desorption are employed to investigate its physical properties. Electrochemical tests reveal that the composite delivers a high specific capacity of 243.5 mAh g−1, superior rate capability, and excellent cycling performance with capacity retention of 95.2% after 200 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance should be attributed to the unique structure in which hierarchical pores provides fast transport channels for lithium ions and interconnected carbon coating builds up conductive networks to enhance the conductivity of Li2FeSiO4. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, ex situ SEM, and TEM are conducted to demonstrate its structural stability upon long-term cycling. In addition, the route described in this work is facile, cheap, and easily scaled-up, which allows for extension to the fabrication of other energy storage materials. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon network; Cathode material; Cycling stability; Hierarchical porous; Lithium-ion battery","Cathodes; Electric batteries; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrodes; Ions; Lithium; Secondary batteries; Silicates; Stability; Carbon network; Cath-ode materials; Cycling stability; Electrochemical performance; Environmental friendliness; Fast transport channels; Hierarchical porous; Large scale productions; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034249494

Our results indicate that, in case of MoO 3 bulk, Li diffusion barriers in the interlayer and intralayer spaces are 0.55 eV and 0.58 eV respectively, which are too high to warrant fast Lithium-ion charge/discharge processes. While on MoO 3 (010) surface, Li exhibits a diffusion barrier as low as 0.07 eV which guarantees an extremely fast Li diffusion rate during charge/discharge cycling. However, in MoO 3 /graphene monolayer, Li diffusion barrier is at the same level as that on MoO 3 (010) surface, which also ensures a very rapid Li charge/discharge rate. The rapid Li charge/discharge rate in this system originates from the removal of the upper dangling O1 atoms which hinder the Li diffusion on the lower MoO 3 layer. Besides this, due to the interaction between Li and graphene, the Li average binding energy increases to 0.14 eV compared to its value on MoO 3 (010) surface which contributes to a higher voltage. Additionally, the increased ratio of surface area provides more space for Li storage and the capacity of MoO 3 /graphene composite increases up to 279.2 mAhg −1 . The last but not the least, due to the high conductivity of graphene, the conductivity of MoO 3 /graphene composite enhances greatly which is beneficial for electrode materials.

By adjusting the concentration of tetrabutyl titanate, the size of the TiO2 nanocrystals and particles could be controlled, resulting in pore evolution. Pores for the random aggregation of secondary particles gradually transformed to nanopores originating from the oriented attachment of the primary nanocrystals, resulting in an excellent micro/nanostructure that increased the performance of a sodium-ion battery. The mesoporous TiO2 microparticle anode, with its unique combination of nanocrystals and uniform nanopores, displays super durability (95 mAh/g after 11,000 cycles at 1 C), high initial efficiency (61.4%), and excellent rate performance (265 and 77 mAh/g at 0.1 and 20 C, respectively). In particular, at slow discharge (0.1 C) and fast charge (5, 50, and 100 C) rates, the anatase TiO2 shows remarkable initial charge capacities of 200, 119, and 56 mAh/g, corresponding to 172, 127, and 56 mAh/g, after 150 cycles, respectively, thus meeting the requirements for fast energy storage. This excellent performance can be attributed to the stability of the material and its high ionic conductivity, resulting from the stable architecture with a mesoporous microstructure and without the random aggregation of secondary particles. A fundamental understanding of the pore structure and controllable pore construction has been proven to be effective in increasing the rate capability and durability of nanostructured electrode materials.

The coupling of the processes in a compact solar reforming–thermochemical heat storage system is conducted in terms of a lumped dynamic model; for the determination of the syngas composition in the reforming unit, thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed, while the required heat to facilitate the endothermic reforming reactions is provided by either solar heat (on-sun operation), or a combination of stored energy and an optimal linear profile of external heat provision (off-sun operation). The optimal heat management policy for the reduction or the oxidation step (during the solar heat storage and release process) ensures a steady H2 molar fraction for most of the operating time. It is revealed that the coupled scheme suggested is an in-principle viable option for sustainable H2 production, since reforming needs are entirely complemented by solar heat also supplying the required energy input for the storage unit, which in turn may provide almost 25% of the overall reforming energy needs under off-sun operation. © 2017","Coupled processes; Dynamic optimization; Solar reforming; Solar thermochemical storage","Heat storage; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Reforming reactions; Solar energy; Solar heating; Storage management; Concentrated solar energy; Coupled process; Dynamic optimization; Endothermic reforming reaction; Solar reforming; Thermo-chemical heat storages; Thermochemical energy storage; Thermochemical storage; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021754202

Especially, exploring nonprecious metal alternatives to replace traditional noble metal catalysts with high cost and poor durability is the paramount mission. In this paper, we utilize property-flexible ZIF-67 and sulfur-functionalized graphene oxide to obtain a cobalt, nitrogen, and sulfur codoped nanomaterial with 3D hierarchical porous structures, owing to their rich dopant species and good conductivity. The crosslinked structures of polyhedron particles throughout the whole carbon framework speeds up the mass transportation and charge-delivery processes during oxygen-evolving reactions. Also, by exploring the location and coordination type of sulfur dopants, we emphasize the effects of sulfone and sulfide functional groups anchored into the graphitic structure on enhancing the catalytic abilities for ORR and OER. To note, compared to the noble metal electrocatalysts, the best-performing CoO@Co3O4/NSG-650 (0.79 V) is 40 mV less active than the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.83 V) for ORR and merely 10 mV behind IrO2 (1.68 V) for OER. Besides, the metric between ORR and OER difference for CoO@Co3O4/NSG-650 to evaluate its overall electrocatalytic activity is 0.90 V, surpassing 290 and 430 mV over Pt/C (1.19 V) and IrO2 (1.33 V). Comprehensively, the as-prepared CoO@Co3O4/NSG-650 indicates excellent bifunctional catalytic activities for ORR and OER, which shows great potential for replacing noble metal catalysts in the application of fuel cells and metal-air batteries. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","3D hierarchical porous structure; bicatalyst; carbon nanomaterials; oxygen electrode reactions; ZIF-67","Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Cobalt; Doping (additives); Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Energy conversion; Fuel cells; Geometry; Graphene; Graphene oxide; Iridium compounds; Mass transportation; Metals; Nanostructured materials; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Platinum; Platinum compounds; Porosity; Precious metals; Secondary batteries; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Virtual storage; bicatalyst; Carbon nano-materials; Hierarchical porous structures; Oxygen electrode; ZIF-67; Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042762504

However, wittingly introducing oxygen vacancies in anatase TiO2 for sodium-ion anodes by a facile and effective method is still a challenge. In this work, we report an innovative method to introduce oxygen vacancies into the urchin-like N-doped carbon coated anatase TiO2 (NC-DTO) by a facile plasma treatment. The superiorities of the oxygen vacancies combined with the conductive N-doped carbon coating enable the obtained NC-DTO of greatly improved sodium storage performance. When served as the anode for sodium-ion batteries, the NC-DTO electrode shows superior electrochemical performance (capacity: 272 mA h g-1 at 0.25 C, capacity retention: 98.8% after 5000 cycles at 10 C, as well as ultrahigh capacity: 150 mA h g-1 at 15 C). Density functional theory calculations combined with experimental results suggest that considerably improved sodium storage performance of NC-DTO is due to the enhanced electronic conductivity from the N-doped carbon layer as well as narrowed band gap and lowered sodiation energy barrier from the introduction of oxygen vacancies. This work highlights that introducing oxygen vacancies into TiO2 by plasma is a promising method to enhance the electrochemical property of TiO2, which also can be applied to different metal oxides for energy storage devices. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","anatase TiO2; carbon; oxygen vacancies; plasma; sodium-ion batteries","Anodes; Carbon; Density functional theory; Doping (additives); Electric batteries; Electrochemical properties; Electrodes; Energy gap; Ions; Metal ions; Oxygen; Plasma applications; Plasmas; Secondary batteries; Sodium-ion batteries; Titanium dioxide; Anatase TiO2; Anatase titania; Capacity retention; Electrochemical performance; Electronic conductivity; Innovative method; Plasma treatment; Storage performance; Oxygen vacancies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041827694

F-doping can restrain the structural degradation from Na3V2(PO4)3 to V2(PO4)3 and enhance the structural stability. Meanwhile, it can decrease the particle size to diminish the pathway of Na+ diffusion, which can increase ionic conductivity efficiently. The kinetic behavior is significantly improved and it is beneficial to reinforcing the electrochemical performance of F-doping composites. Compared with Undoped-NVP/C sample, F-0.07-NVP/C composite delivers a 113 mAh g−1 discharge capacity at 10 mA g−1, which is very close to the theoretical capacity (117 mAh g−1). As for cycle performance, a reversible capacity of 97.8 mAh g−1 can be obtained and it retains 86% capacity after 1000 cycles at 200 mA g−1. F-0.07-NVP/C composite presents the highest DNa+ (2.62 × 10−15 cm2s−1), two orders of magnitude higher than the undoped sample (4.8 × 10−17 cm2s−1). This outstanding electrochemical performance is ascribed to the synergetic effect from improved kinetic behavior and enhanced structural stability due to F-doping. Hence, the F-doped composite would be a promising cathode material in SIB for energy storage and conversion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fluorine-doping; Sodium ion battery; Sodium vanadium phosphate; Stable lifetime; Structural degradation","Cathodes; Electric discharges; Metal ions; Particle size; Sodium-ion batteries; Solid state reactions; Stability; Vanadium compounds; Electrochemical performance; Energy storage and conversions; Fluorine doping; Solid state reaction method; Stable lifetime; Structural degradation; Structural stabilities; Vanadium phosphates; Sodium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039929722

The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the 3D porous structures, in which the few-layer MoS2 nanosheets with expanded interlayers can provide shortened ion diffusion paths and improved Li+/Na+ diffusion mobility, and the hollow porous carbon spheres and the outside graphene network are able to improve the conductivity and maintain the structural integrity. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","anode; few-layer MoS2; hybrid nanocarbon; lithium/sodium ion batteries; three-dimensional network","Anodes; Battery storage; Composite films; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Graphene; Graphene oxide; Ions; Lithium; Lithium-ion batteries; Metal ions; Molybdenum compounds; Nanosheets; Network architecture; Porous materials; Secondary batteries; Sodium-ion batteries; Electrochemical performance; few-layer MoS2; Ion batteries; Nano-carbon; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Technological challenges; Three-dimensional (3D) networks; Three-dimensional networks; Layered semiconductors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042696278

Three different anode materials are investigated: an anthraquinone monomer and two different anthraquinone based oligomers. All batteries are rechargeable, and almost 100% of the theoretical capacity can be accessed in the first cycle, after which significant capacity loss occurs. The capacity loss is attributed mainly to swelling of the electrodes and solubility of anthraquinones in their charged (reduced) state because reduced anthraquinone is deprotonated and ionized in alkaline solutions. Nonetheless, batteries based on one of the oligomerized anthraquinones (oligo[benzene-1,4-dithiol-alt-(1,5- dichloroanthraquinone)] anode) show the best performance and retain almost 50% of the discharge capacity after 100 cycles. The better performance is attributed to the reduced solubility caused by the oligomerization. It is anticipated that measures to decrease the solubility further could lead to much improved capacity retention. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","anthraquinone; chemical storage; electrical energy storage; grid storage; nickel batteries; oligomer batteries; organic batteries; rechargeable batteries","Alkalinity; Anodes; Aromatic compounds; Electrolytes; Ketones; Nickel compounds; Oligomers; Potassium hydroxide; Redox reactions; Solubility; Storage (materials); Swelling; 1 ,5-Dichloroanthraquinone; Anode active materials; anthraquinone; Chemical storage; Discharge capacities; Electrical energy storages; Grid Storage; Theoretical capacity; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064749420

Here, a three-dimensional foam-like composite composed of Mo2C nanorods decorated by different amounts of N-doped carbon (Mo2C-NR@xNC (x = 5, 11, and 16 wt %)) was directly employed as the O2 electrode without applications of any binders and current collectors. Mo2C-NR@xNC presents a network microstructure with interconnected macropore and mesoporous channels, which is beneficial to achieving fast Li+ migration and O2 diffusion, facilitating the electrolyte impregnation, and providing enough space for Li2O2 storage. Additionally, the coated N-doped carbon layer can largely improve the electrochemical stability and conductivity of Mo2C. The cell with Mo2C-NR@11NC shows a considerable cyclability of 200 cycles with an overpotential of 0.28 V in the first cycle at a constant current density of 100 mA g-1, a superior reversibility associated with the formation and decomposition of Li2O2 as desired, and a high electrochemical stability. On the basis of the experimental results, the electrochemical mechanism for the cell using Mo2C-NR@11NC is proposed.

Using first-principle calculations, we investigate the effect of vacancies on the Li adsorption and diffusion on Ti2C and Ti2CT2 (where T denotes surface terminations, F or OH) monolayers. Interestingly, we find that the carbon vacancies (VC) tend to enhance the adsorption of Li in Ti2C monolayer, whereas the titanium vacancies (VTi) play a similar role in Ti2CT2 when functional groups present. The presence of vacancies further leads to a change in the diffusion behavior of Li atoms. In this context, we propose an idea to mitigate the adverse effects on Li diffusion performance by regulating the functional groups. In the presence of VC, the surface of Ti2C monolayer is suggested to be modified with OH- groups due to its relatively low diffusion barrier in the range of 0.025-0.037 eV when Li diffuses around VC, whereas in the presence of VTi, the surface is suggested to remove the functional groups, resulting in a decrease of energy barrier by about 1 eV when Li atom diffuses around VTi. The present study may provide a guideline to improve the Li-ion storage performance of Ti2C monolayers as electrode materials in LIBs, with atomic vacancies being taken into consideration. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","adsorption and diffusion; first-principles calculation; functional groups; Li-ion batteries; Ti2C monolayer; vacancy","Adsorption; Anodes; Atoms; Binary alloys; Calculations; Carbides; Carbon; Diffusion; Diffusion barriers; Electrodes; Functional groups; Ions; Lithium-ion batteries; Monolayers; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Vacancies; Adsorption of li; Diffusion behavior; Electrode material; First principle calculations; First-principle study; First-principles calculation; Surface termination; Transition metal carbide; Lithium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042356802

In most ISCC projects, concentrating solar fields (e.g., parabolic trough solar fields with heat transfer (HTF) technology or direct steam generation (DSG) technology) are integrated for solar heat production with a temperature up to 400 °C to substitute for water preheating, evaporation or steam superheating in heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) for conventional combined cycle (CC) power systems. Although the ISCC scheme is effective for solar thermal energy utilization, the intermittent nature of solar energy usually causes this kind of systems to run inefficiently at part-load conditions when no or low solar radiation is available because most of the state-of-art ISCC systems are not equipped with costly thermal storage. To improve ISCC system performance, a new solution is proposed and investigated. This paper presents a novel cascade integrated solar combined cycle system, in which parabolic troughs solar collectors with DSG technology and non-concentrating solar collectors (e.g. evacuated tubes) are simultaneously integrated into the combined cycle power system. Thermodynamic and preliminary economic analysis for the new system are conducted to look into its feasibility and advantages. The results show that higher solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency and lower levelized electricity cost for the proposed system are achieved than for a reference ISCC system coupled with only DSG technology. Integration of both concentrating and non-concentrating solar collectors into an ISCC system in a temperature cascade way is viable and more efficient than the use of parabolic trough solar collectors alone. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cascade integrated solar combined cycle; Direct steam generation technology; Non-concentrating solar collector; Thermodynamic analysis","Conversion efficiency; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Steam; Steam generators; Thermoanalysis; Waste heat; Concentrating solar; Direct steam generation; Heat conversion efficiencies; Heat recovery steam generators; Integrated solar combined cycles; Levelized electricity cost; Parabolic trough solar collectors; Thermo dynamic analysis; Economic analysis; economic analysis; efficiency measurement; energy efficiency; feasibility study; heat transfer; integrated approach; power generation; solar power; technological change; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039838035

In present work, a numerical model was developed to provide a tool to determine thermal and optical performance of a multi-layer glazed roof filled with phase change material for developing engineering analyses. The model was validated by the experimental results measured in a multi-layer glazed roof test facility. The influences of air convection and PCM design parameters on thermal and optical performance of the multi-layer glazed roof filled with PCM were also investigated by the model. The results show that a good agreement was obtained between experimental data and simulations. The influence of air convection on the thermal and optical performance of multi-layer glazed roof is weak for different PCM melting temperatures and thicknesses, except for its effect on the interior temperature. Considering that the maximum and minimum interior temperatures are key parameters to analyze the thermal performance of multi-layer glazed roof, the air convection process should be considered. The influences of PCM thickness and melting temperature on optical performance are big. The PCM thickness has also serious influences on the thermal performance, which include interior temperature, temperature time lag, temperature difference of the interior surface and the upper surface of air layer, and total transmitted energy.

However, the soluble polysulfides Li2Sx (4 ≤ x ≤ 8) produced during the discharge process can cause the so-called ""shuttle effect"" and lead to low coulombic efficiency and rapid capacity fading of the batteries, which seriously restrict their practical application. Using porous materials as hosts to immobilize the polysulfides is proved to be an effective strategy. In this article, a dual functional cage-like metal-organic framework (Cu-MOF), Cu-TDPAT, combining the Lewis basic sites from the nitrogen atoms of the ligand H6TDPAT with the Lewis acidic sites from Cu(ii) open metal sites (OMSs), was employed as the sulfur host in a Li-S battery for lithium ions and polysulfide anions (Sx2-). In addition, the size of nano-Cu-TDPAT was also optimized by microwave synthesis to reduce the internal resistance of the batteries. The electrochemical test results showed that the optimized Cu-TDPAT material can efficiently confine the polysulfides within the MOF, and the resultant porous S@Cu-TDPAT composite cathode material with the size of 100 nm shows good cycling performance with a reversible capacity of about 745 mA h g-1 at 1C (1C = 1675 mA g-1) after 500 cycles, to the best of our knowledge, which is higher than those of all reported S@MOF cathode materials. The DFT calculation and XPS data indicate that the good cycling performance mainly results from the dual functional binding sites (that is, Lewis acid and base sites) in nanoporous Cu-TDPAT, providing the comprehensive and robust interaction with the polysulfides to overcome their dissolution and diffusion into the electrolyte. Clearly, our work provides a good example of designing MOFs with suitable interaction sites for the polysulfides to achieve S@MOF cathode materials with excellent cycling performance by multiple synergistic effects between nanoporous host MOFs and the polysulfides. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Binding sites; Cathodes; Crystalline materials; Design for testability; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Polysulfides; Porous materials; Reaction kinetics; Secondary batteries; Sulfur; Tungsten; Composite cathode material; Coulombic efficiency; Electrochemical test; Energy storage systems; Environmental benignity; Internal resistance; Metal organic framework; Microwave synthesis; Lithium sulfur batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041796724

The morphology and microstructure of the electrode materials were characterized by SEM and TEM, respectively. The energy storage mechanism of aluminum ion batteries was confirmed by ex-situ XPS. It is found that not only AlCl4− but also Al3+ could also be intercalated and deintercalated into the prelithium graphite electrode material. The CV result clearly shows that the Graphite-Li electrode material has two pairs of redox peaks, which can be attributed to the AlCl4− and Al3+ intercalation and deintercalation into the electrode materials, respectively.

The discharge capacity of Graphite-Li can still reach 64 mAh g−1 even after 500 cycles with a coulombic efficiency close to 100%.

However, improving the energy density remains a grand challenge due to the quite limited capacities of traditional Li-intercalation cathodes. To circumvent this limitation, a new type of conversion cathode for hybrid Mg2+/Li+ batteries, microflower-like Cu9S5, is reported herein. The Cu9S5 cathode is compatible with the dual-salt Mg2+/Li+ electrolyte, and delivers a high reversible capacity of 300 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 via electrochemical conversion reaction, with 94% capacity retention over 100 cycles in hybrid Mg2+/Li+ batteries. The electrode also shows an outstanding rate capability providing 155 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 and a superior long-term cycleability over 1000 cycles. This excellent performance is attributed to the hierarchical architecture of Cu9S5 which facilitates the reversible conversion reactions and stabilizes the electrode structure during discharge/charge process.

The unique features of MnO@Mn3O4/NPCF are derived from the distinct interfacial structure of the Mn8 clusters, implying a new methodological strategy for hybrids. The characteristics of MnO@Mn3O4 are determined by conducting high angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) valence-state analyses.

Quantitative analysis reveals that capacitance and diffusion mechanisms account for Li+ storage, wherein the former dominates.

However, the practical application of sodium-ion batteries is restricted by unsatisfying capacity and poor rate capability. Herein, a novel mechanism of improving both interfacial and surface charge transfer is proposed by fabricating a graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 nanocomposite through a simple hydrothermal method. The formation of heterostructures between ultrafine SnO2 and Co3O4 could enhance the charge transfer of interfaces owing to the internal electric field. The pseudocapacitive effect, which is led by the high specific area and the existence of ultrafine nanoparticles, takes on a feature of fast faradaic surface charge-transfer. Benefiting from the synergistic advantages of the heterostructures and the pseudocapacitive effect, the as-prepared graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 anode achieved a high reversible capacity of 461 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g-1.

However, as another representative nanocarbon, fullerenes, such as C60, have been scarcely utilized in LIBs because of their poor electrochemical reversibility. Herein, we designed a novel C60-embedded nitrogen-doped microporous carbon material (denoted as C60@N-MPC), which was derived from a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) precursor, demonstrating its promising application as a superior anode material for LIB. We first embedded C60in situ into a ZIF-8 matrix via a facile solid-state mechanochemical route, which acted as a precursor and was transformed to C60@N-MPC after carbonization. The C60@N-MPC was applied as a novel anode for LIBs, showing an improved reversible specific capacity of ≈1351 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and a better rate capacity (≈1077 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 400 cycles) relative to those based on the unmodified N-MPC anode. The role of C60 in the superior lithium storage performance of C60@N-MPC was elucidated, revealing that C60 functioned as a pore expander for N-MPC with 3-20 nm mesopores (versus sub-1 nm micropores for the unmodified N-MPC), which facilitated the rapid diffusion of the organic electrolyte. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anodes; Carbonization; Doping (additives); Electric batteries; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Lithium; Microporosity; Nitrogen; Pore size; Porous materials; Anode performance; Electrochemical reversibility; High energy densities; Mechano-chemical routes; Micro-porous carbons; Organic electrolyte; Reversible specific capacity; Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041456297

However, the formation process and mechanism of the hollow carbon spheres are still unclear. Herein, we chose glucose as a carbon precursor and double surfactants poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) triblock copolymers and sodium oleate as the soft template. The synthesis process of hollow carbon spheres was investigated in the coupling of a soft templating method and hydrothermal carbonization system by regulating the reaction time. A dynamic formation process of the hollow carbon spheres was identified based on the results from scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images, in which three evolution stages were seen including hollow carbon bowls, capsules, and spheres. In addition, the formation mechanism was also presumed: During the synthesis process, the double surfactants interacted with each other to act as the soft template, and the glucose underwent hydration, polymerization, and aromatization stages. When the concentration of aromatic compounds reached the critical supersaturation, the nucleation took place from a point and extended outward gradually along the interface to widen and thicken the carbon shell, resulting in different hollow structured carbon particles being formed successively by controlling the reaction time. Furthermore, the resultant hollow structured carbon particles were stable and uniform, and we made preliminary explorations on their biochemical and electrochemical performance. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Glucose; Hollow carbon spheres; Hydrothermal carbonization; Soft templating method","Carbonization; Controlled drug delivery; Drug delivery; Dynamics; Electron microscopy; Ethylene glycol; Glucose; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrothermal synthesis; Polyethylene glycols; Polyols; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface active agents; Thermochemistry; Transmission electron microscopy; Critical supersaturation; Electrochemical performance; Formation mechanism; Hollow carbon spheres; Hydrothermal carbonization; Poly(propylene glycol); Soft-templating; Transmission electron microscopy images; Spheres",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041457992

However, this method has a high level of energy consumption. Conversely, reverse-cycle defrosting (RCD) cannot be used in refrigerators because frequent reversal of the four-way valve may cause mass leakage of the refrigerant, which is unsafe. Hence, we develop a bypass cycle defrosting system using compressor casing thermal storage (BCD-CCTS). Experiments utilizing the EHD and BCD-CCTS methods are conducted on a refrigerator with a 50 W compressor. Experimental results reveal that in the BCD-CCTS method, defrosting time decreased by 65–77% compared with 180–419 W EHD. Whereas defrost energy consumption decreased by 89–92% compared with 180–419 W EHD method. After 60 h of normal operation, the temperature of the compressor casing exposed to air was maintained at approximately 60 °C, whereas that of the compressor casing exposed to the heat storage phase change material (PCM) was maintained at about 54 °C. The presence of heat storage PCM can effectively reduce the temperature of the compressor casing. It can also reduce the operating noise of the compressor by 18.5% compared with the same type of compressor without heat storage PCM. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bypass cycle; Compressor casing; Defrosting; Household refrigerator; Phase change material; Waste heat storage","Defrosting; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Heating; Phase change materials; Refrigerators; Storage (materials); Waste heat; Bypass cycle; Compressor casing; Defrosting systems; Electric heater; Household refrigerators; Normal operations; Operating noise; Thermal storage; Compressors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034948859

This system uses a soil thermal storage for greenhouse to supply heat in the absence of sunlight, ensuring the safety of the growth of crops. The structure and working principle of the device are introduced in this paper. The underground soil temperature was tested, compared with the indoor and outdoor temperature. The experimental testing result is given. A research shows that when the heating pipe buried 1.65 m underground, the time of heat transfer to the ground is about 5 days. The overall temperature rise of the soil is about 4 °C. In the condition of the coldest weather without additional energy supplement, the greenhouse's temperature is guaranteed above 8 °C, which can ensure the minimum temperature requirements of crop growth. According to the structural parameters of the existing system, the simulation of underground soil heat transfer and heat storage performance was carried out. Then, the temperature curves of different buried depths of the tube are given. The soil temperature steady time in different pipe-buried depths of heat storage temperature is theoretically calculated. It is proved that, to achieve the seasonal thermal storage in this system, the buried depth of the pipe should be over 2.5 m.

The model NePCM samples were prepared by dispersing graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) into 1-tetradecanol (C14H30O) at loadings up to 3.0 wt %. The transient phase change, energy retrieval, and heat transfer rates during solidification of the various NePCM samples were measured quantitatively using a volume-shrinkage-based indirect method. The data reduction and analysis were carried out under single-component, homogeneous assumption of the NePCM samples without considering the microscale transport phenomena of GNPs. It was shown that the total solidification time becomes monotonously shorter with increasing the loading of GNPs, in accordance with the increased effective thermal conductivity. The maximum relative acceleration of solidification was found to be more than 50% for the most concentrated sample, which seems to be appreciable for practical applications. In addition to enhanced heat conduction, the possible effects due to the elimination of supercooling and viscosity growth were elucidated. The heat retrieval rate was also shown to be increased monotonously with raising the loading of GNPs, although the heat storage capacity is sacrificed. Despite the remarkable acceleration of the solidification time, the use of a high loading (e.g., 3.0 wt %) was demonstrated to be possibly uneconomical because of the marginal gain in heat retrieval rate. Finally, correlations for the transient variations of the melt fraction and surface-averaged Nusselt number were proposed.

The PCM candidates were tested experimentally through DSC and T-history method. The results showed that esters of vegetable oils played very important role on the solubility of the vegetable oil in water. The esters made the investigated vegetable oil (soya oil or corn oil) mix well in water solutions and they worked as nucleating agents that could lower freezing point and reduce super-cooling of the water. It was found that addition of vegetable oils by 5% to 10% in water solution could decrease the freezing temperature from 0 °C down to respectively −3.5 °C to −6.5 °C and could also minimize degree of super-cooling of the PCM candidates. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Medium temperature refrigeration; Phase change materials; Vegetable oil","Esters; Freezing; Heat storage; Refrigeration; Thermal processing (foods); Vegetable oils; Cold thermal energy storage; Freezing point; Freezing temperatures; Medium temperature; Nucleating agents; Oil-in-water; Temperature range; Water solutions; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039754182

Although many studies have investigated the thermal behavior of solar ponds, few researches have investigated how heat lost to the ground beneath a pond can be recovered. Here, a one-dimensional transient model is used to study the thermal interaction between a solar pond with constant heat demand and the ground beneath it. The ground thermal properties were dependent on temperature and moisture. As groundwater depth affects soil moisture distribution, higher thermal conductivities are observed when the groundwater table is shallow. Further, the mean temperatures at the bottom of the pond decrease exponentially as the groundwater depth is shallower. For deep groundwater tables, marginal variations in the groundwater table depth do not have a considerable impact on the pond's bottom temperatures. The addition of an insulation layer is only beneficial when the water table is shallow. When the water table is deep instead, the ground below the pond acts as an additional heat storage volume, permitting more stable temperatures in the pond throughout the year, making it more suitable for a constant heat demand. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ground heat storage; Heat extraction; Solar energy; Solar pond","Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Heat storage; Lakes; Moisture; Soil moisture; Solar energy; Thermal conductivity; Ground heat storage; Ground water depths; Ground water table; Groundwater table depth; Heat extraction; Salt gradient solar pond; Soil moisture distribution; Thermal interaction; Solar ponds; equipment; extraction method; groundwater; heat budget; one-dimensional modeling; salt; shallow water; soil moisture; solar power; temperature effect; water depth; water table",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038912931

The experimental results showed that the total melting time of the CPCM was 20.5% shorter than that of pure paraffin, and the CPCM heated at the top melted slowest and reached the biggest temperature difference in the three heating conditions, so the effect of natural convection on the melting process of the CPCM could not be neglected.

Generally, surface modification is an effective method to improve the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. Herein, in order to revise the LiCoPO4 cathode with desirable properties, uniform AlF3-modified LiCoPO4 (LiCoPO4@AlF3) cathode materials in nano-sized distribution are synthesized. XRD result indicates that there is no structural transformation observed after AlF3 coating. TEM characterization and XPS analysis reveal that the surface of LiCoPO4 particle is coated by a nano-sized uniform AlF3 layer. Further, the electrochemical results indicate that AlF3 layer significantly improves the cycling and rate performances of LiCoPO4 cathode within the voltage range of 3.0–5.0 V. After a series of optimization, 4 mol% AlF3-coated LiCoPO4 material exhibits the best properties including an initial discharge capacity of 159 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C with 91% capacity retention after 50 cycles, especially a discharge capacity of 90 mA h g−1 can be obtained at 1 C rate. CV curves indicate that the polarization of cathode is reduced by AlF3 layer and EIS curves reveal that AlF3 layer relieves the increase of resistance to facilitate Li-ion transfer at the interface between electrode and electrolyte during the cycling process. The enhanced electrochemical performances are attributed to that the AlF3 layer can stabilize the interface between the cathode and electrolyte, form steady SEI film and suppress the electrolyte continuous decomposition at 5 V high voltages. This feasible strategy and novel characteristics of LiCoPO4@AlF3 could promise the prospective applications in the stat-art of special lithium-ion battery with high energy and/or power density. © 2017","AlF3 coating; High voltage; Li-ion battery; LiCoPO4; Surface modification","Cathodes; Characterization; Coatings; Cobalt compounds; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Interfaces (materials); Ions; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Nickel compounds; Secondary batteries; Surface reactions; Surface treatment; Discharge capacities; Electrochemical performance; High voltage; Initial discharge capacities; LiCoPO4; Lithium ion storages; Prospective applications; Structural transformation; Aluminum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036498382

However, to truly utilize the thermal inertia of the DHN, the supply and return temperatures at the heat source are both necessary to regulate the district heating system (DHS) for wind power integration, whereas the heat output of CHP is not able to do that. Therefore, a new IHPD model that considers the thermal inertia of the DHN was formulated to improve the flexibility of CHP units for wind power integration, in which the first proposed integration model was used to completely simulate the dynamic temperature distribution of the DHS. The optimised supply and return temperatures at the heat source were then obtained to guide the operation regulation of DHS for wind power integration in actual engineering applications. Moreover, the stored thermal energy and the thermal storage rate of the DHN were quantitatively calculated to determine the thermal state of DHN. To analyse the effects of the proposed IHPD model, the approach was compared with a conventional heat and power dispatch model through a case study based on a real DHS.

Yet the technology faces some key technical challenges that need to be overcome in order for its potential to be realised. As documented in prior literature reviews, these challenges have attracted substantial research attention in a variety of disciplines. However, literature specifically concerned with the performance modelling of OVR plants and their constituent systems has not been comprehensively reviewed in a standalone body of work. The objective of this study, therefore, is to provide a resource that catalogues modelling studies associated with overall plant performance, as well as the performance of those elements of the technology that are still undergoing technical maturation. Based on the classification and dissemination of these studies, the state of OVR plant technology and the developmental challenges that remain have been reported. In addition, future avenues of research that have yet to be properly addressed in the literature have been identified. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrating solar power; Open volumetric receiver; Packed bed thermal storage","Air; Heat storage; Packed beds; Solar energy; Concentrating solar power; Literature reviews; Performance modelling; Plant performance; Plant technologies; Technical challenges; Thermal storage; Volumetric receivers; Heat transfer",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035099343

Typically, the operation of packed beds in such systems is modelled by accounting for a finite rate of heat transfer between the fluid and solid media. This approach requires the coupled solution of the fluid- and solid-phase energy equations, which is computationally-costly, especially for year-long performance simulations. The local thermal equilibrium assumption, which assumes an infinite inter-phase heat transfer rate, can be applied to reduce the complexity and thus computational cost of packed bed models. However, the implications of making such an assumption in the context of CSP thermal energy storage system performance modelling is poorly understood. In fact, the application of the approach in long-term simulations has not been investigated before. This work addresses the topic by comparatively evaluating the performance of local thermal equilibrium and local thermal non-equilibrium models in the annual simulation of an air-rock packed bed, hypothetically operating in an open volumetric receiver CSP plant. The level of inter-model agreement is assessed in terms of annual bed exergy yield, bed blowing work, and plant power generation time. In addition, solution times are compared to establish the extent of computational cost savings. A parametric study examining the effect of variations in key bed design parameters on inter-model agreement is also conducted. The results obtained provide a clear indication of the strengths and weaknesses of either modelling approach, as well as of the suitability of the local thermal equilibrium assumption in general. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrating solar power; Rock bed; Thermal energy storage","Biofuels; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Gas plants; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Solar energy; Thermal energy; Concentrating solar power; Local thermal equilibrium; Local thermal non-equilibrium; Long term simulation; Performance modelling; Performance simulation; Thermal energy storage systems; Volumetric receivers; Packed beds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034856088

However, to develop feasible anode materials still remains a great challenge for the practical application of SIBs. Here, we report hard carbons derived from a plentiful and deserted biomass of rice husk through a facile acid treatment and subsequent pyrolysis. The investigation illustrates that the electrochemical properties of the rice husk-derived hard carbons (RHHCs) are significantly influenced by the pyrolysis temperature because of the discrepancy in their microstructure. The RHHC pyrolyzed at 1300 °C (RHHC-1300) shows the highest reversible capacity of 372 mAh g−1 and good cycling stability and rate performance due to its large interlayer distance and suitable oxygen content. Moreover, full sodium-ion batteries are assembled to examine the application prospect using Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C and RHHC-1300 as cathode and anode materials, respectively, delivering a high-energy density of 185 Wh kg−1 and stable cycling performance.

However, the impact of enhanced bioremediation on ATES is not yet clear. Of main concern is the potential for biological clogging which might be enhanced and hamper the proper functioning of ATES. On the other hand, more reduced conditions in the subsurface by enhanced bioremediation might lower the chance of chemical clogging, which is normally caused by Fe(III) precipitate. To investigate the possible effects of enhanced bioremediation on clogging with ATES, we conducted two recirculating column experiments with differing flow rates (10 and 50 mL/min), where enhanced biological activity and chemically promoted Fe(III) precipitation were studied by addition of lactate and nitrate respectively. The pressure drop between the influent and effluent side of the column was used as a measure of the (change in) hydraulic conductivity, as indication of clogging in these model ATES systems. The results showed no increase in upstream pressure during the period of enhanced biological activity (after lactate addition) under both flow rates, while the addition of nitrate lead to significant buildup of the pressure drop. However, at the flow rate of 10 mL/min, high pressure buildup caused by nitrate addition could be alleviated by lactate addition. This indicates that the risk of biological clogging is relatively small in the investigated areas of the mimicked ATES system that combines enhanced bioremediation with lactate as substrate, and furthermore that lactate may counter chemical clogging. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES); Clogging; Enhanced bioremediation; Fe(III) precipitate; Lactate; Pressure drop","Aquifers; Bioactivity; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Drops; Groundwater resources; Heat storage; Nitrates; Pressure drop; Thermal energy; Water management; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Biological clogging; Clogging; Column experiments; Enhanced bioremediation; Lactate; Renewable energy technologies; Sustainable groundwater management; Iron compounds; iron; lactic acid; nitrate; aquifer; bioremediation; hydraulic conductivity; iron; nitrate; precipitation (chemistry); pressure drop; aquifer; aquifer thermal energy storage; Article; biological activity; bioremediation; biotechnological procedures; chemical clogging; effluent; flow rate; geothermal energy; hydraulic conductivity; precipitation; priority journal; risk factor; waste and waste related phenomena",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029482651

However, the complicated synthesis process may hinder their practical applications. Their mechanical and electrochemical properties shall be further improved. Herein, a facile scalable dip-coating process is developed to synthesize a flexible composite cathode with a high sulfur loading. Via the process, a hybrid composed of carbon nanotubes, carbon black, sulfur, and titania nanoparticles is successfully conformally coated on the carbonized textile (c-textile). The formed flexible c-textile@S/TiO2 cathodes with sulfur loadings of 1.5 and 3.0 mg cm-2 can deliver reversible discharge capacities of 860 and 659 mA h g-1 at 2 C, respectively. For the latter one, it can retain 94% of the initial capacity after 400 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency (∼96%). When its sulfur loading is further increased to 7.0 mg cm-2, its areal capacity reaches 5.2 mA h cm-2. Such excellent performance is ascribed to the synergy effect of the three-dimension conductive hierarchical pore structure and TiO2 additive.

However, the poor ion transport of MXene film electrodes causes a great loss of surface reactivity, which significantly inhibits the full exploitation of the potential of MXene-based materials. To solve this issue, we report a facile electrolyte-induced self-assembly method to construct a 3D porous structure in the MXene-rGO hybrid film, which effectively facilitates rapid diffusion and transport of electrolyte ions in the film electrode while still maintaining high electrical conductivity. When the hybrid film is employed as electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries, it exhibits high specific capacity of 335.5 mA h g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and good rate capability of 30% capacitance retention at 4 A g-1. Additionally, the film electrode exhibits excellent cycling stability without capacity decay after 1000 cycles under high rates (1 A g-1) owing to its stable structure. Furthermore, the electrochemical analysis also demonstrates that the novel 3D porous microstructure plays an important role in the fast reaction kinetics and high capacity of the MXene-rGO hybrid film electrode.

The hydroxide anions, while transported from the cathode to the anode, attack the positively charged functional groups in the polymer membrane, neutralizing it and suppressing its anion-conducting capability. In recent years, several new quaternary ammonium salts have been proposed to address this challenge, but while they perform well in ex-situ chemical studies, their performance is very limited in real fuel cell studies. Here, we use experimental work, corroborated by molecular dynamics modeling to show that water concentration in the environment of the hydroxide anion, as well as temperature, significantly impact its reactivity. We compare different quaternary ammonium salts that have been previously studied and test their stabilities in the presence of relatively low hydroxide concentration in the presence of different amounts of solvating water molecules, as well as different temperatures.

The storage technology is the wave of the future in solar utilization field. A lot of scholars focus on studying of heat transfer performance by the experimental or simulating method. In this paper, a novel heat transfer model of three-dimensional unsteady state heat conduction in cylindrical coordinate has been proposed based on the theoretical analysis. The most difficulty problem during the solution is the materials, which is molten salt based on some real cases, that is a phase change material (PCM) with the melting point of 494 K. The computer code of this model is written by C language in MATLAB software. The results show that the charge time is 25200 s (about 7 h).

However, the electrocatalyst active sites and the underlying mechanisms occurring in zinc–air batteries remain confusing due to the lack of in situ analytical techniques. In this work, the in situ observations, including X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, of a heteroatom-doped carbon air cathode are reported, in which the chemisorption of oxygen molecules and oxygen-containing intermediates on the carbon material can be facilitated by the electron deficiency caused by heteroatom doping, thus improving the oxygen reaction activity for zinc–air batteries. As expected, solid-state zinc–air batteries equipped with such air cathodes exhibit superior reversibility and durability.

Here, a series of cyclooctatetraene-based (C8H8) organic molecules were demonstrated to have electrochemical activity of high-capacity and high-voltage from carbon rings by means of first-principles calculations and electronic structure analysis. Fused molecules of C8-C4-C8 (C16H12) and C8-C4-C8-C4-C8 (C24H16) contain, respectively, four and eight electron-deficient carbons, generating high-capacity by their multiple redox reactions. Our sodiation calculations predict that C16H12 and C24H16 exhibit discharge capacities of 525.3 and 357.2 mA h g-1 at the voltage change from 3.5 to 1.0 V and 3.7 to 1.3 V versus Na+/Na, respectively. Electronic structure analysis reveals that the high voltages are attributed to superposed electron stabilization mechanisms, including double-bond reformation and aromatization from carbon rings. High thermodynamic stability of these C24H16-based systems strongly suggests feasibility of experimental realization. The present work provides evidence that cyclooctatetraene-based organic molecules fused with the C4 ring are promising in designing high-capacity and high-voltage organic rechargeable cathodes. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","aromatization; COT-based molecules; DFT; double bond reformation; high-voltage; Na+-ion battery","Aromatization; Calculations; Chemical bonds; Electrodes; Electronic structure; Molecules; O rings; Redox reactions; Thermodynamic stability; Double bonds; Electrochemical activities; Experimental realizations; First-principles calculation; High capacity cathodes; High voltage; Ion batteries; Stabilization mechanisms; Cathodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041215866

MO@PG paper electrodes have special structures in which hollow metal-oxide nanoparticles are embedded in the pores of porous graphene films and connected with the edges of the graphene to produce a strong interfacial interaction. Benefiting from this unique structure, the MO@PG paper electrodes for LIBs exhibit higher specific capacities and better cyclic stability and rate performance. In particular, the MO@PG electrodes show an interestingly abnormal rate performance in that the specific capacity increases with the current density from 50 to 500 mA g-1, which should be attributed to Li-ion storage in graphene films being mainly controlled by diffusion, while electrochemical reactions of Fe2O3 are mainly controlled by Faradaic capacitance. At a higher current density, the Li-ion diffusion in the graphene layers is largely suppressed, so the graphene films can play well the role of a conductive network, and the activity of the Fe2O3 will be clearly enhanced. In addition, the MO@PG paper electrodes also show higher specific capacity and superior long-term cyclic ability at very high rates: for Fe2O3@PG, 741, 249, and 141 mA h g-1 at the rates of 10, 30, and 50 A g-1 after 10000 cycles, respectively; and for CuO@PG, 980, 314, and 168 mA h g-1 at the rates of 10, 50, and 100 A g-1 after 10000 cycles, respectively). The strategy for embedded-type MO@PG paper electrodes provides a direction for the design of flexible electrode materials with both high power density and energy density.

The discharge capacities of the as-cast Mg0 and Mg0.01 alloys are 12.6 and 8.8 mAh g−1, which increase to 52.6 and 80.4 mAh g−1 after 5 h of mechanical milling. By milling the as-cast alloy powders with carbonyl nickel powders, they are greatly enhanced to 191.6 mAh g−1 for the Mg0+7.5 wt% Ni alloy and 205.9 mAh g−1 for the Mg0.01+5 wt% Ni alloy at the current density of 60 mA g−1, respectively. The values of dehydrogenation enthalpy (ΔHdes) and dehydrogenation activation energy (Edes(a)) are very small, meaning that the thermal stability and the desorption kinetics of the hydrides are not the key influence factors for the discharge capacity. The reduction of the particle size and the generation of the new surfaces without oxide layers have slight improvements on the discharge capacity, while the enhancement of the charge transfer ability of the surfaces of the alloy particles can significantly promote the electrochemical reaction of the alloy electrodes. © 2017","AB-type alloy; Discharge capacity; Gaseous thermodynamics and kinetics; Mechanical milling; Substituting Ti with Mg","Activation energy; Binary alloys; Charge transfer; Dehydrogenation; Electric discharges; Hydrogen storage; Kinetics; Magnesium; Mechanical alloying; Milling (machining); Nickel alloys; Particle size; Powders; Ternary alloys; Thermodynamics; Titanium; Vacuum applications; Desorption kinetics; Discharge capacities; Electrochemical hydrogen storage performance; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical reactions; Mechanical milling; Thermodynamics and kinetics; Vacuum induction melting; Iron alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038858603

Conventional microbatteries adopt planar thin-film electrodes that display limited areal energy and power due to their undesired coupling. To achieve high energy and power simultaneously, employment of 3D array electrodes has proven indispensable. Adoption of 3D electrodes has become a fashionable trend in lithium microbatteries during the last decade. This trend also occurs in sodium batteries, which are an important alternative to the current lithium system owing to the potentially high power and wide availability of sodium. In this perspective, state-of-the-art progress in design and application of 3D arrays for sodium microbatteries are summarized. Specifically, emphasis is placed on material strategies to efficiently address the intrinsic limitations of pristine arrays such as transportation, activity, and stability.

Once complexed with sodium ions, solvent molecules show a reduced LUMO, which facilitates the electrolyte decomposition and gas evolution.

Increasing specific heat capacity of molten salt can help enhance its thermal storage capacity. In this paper, the effect of nano-MgO on specific heat capacity of NaNO3-KNO3 is investigated. MgO nanoparticles are synthesized by using in-situ method based on the high temperature decomposition reaction of Mg(OH)2 in solar salt. Materials characteristic analyses using field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) show that modified salt induces to form needle-like structure. Field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM) was used to obtain the microstructure images of nano-MgO. The diameter of spherical MgO nanoparticlesare about 50–200 nm. The length and width of needle-like nano-MgO are 50–200 nm and 5–30 nm, respectively. In addition, the specific heat capacity of molten salt was measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Results show that the specific heat capacity of the modified salt is significantly enhanced while the latent heat is slightly decreased. After the samples calcined at 600°C for 1 h, the specific heat capacity is increased by 118.6% in solid state when adding 14.8 wt.% Mg (OH)2, and increased by 168.1% in liquid state when adding 10.4 wt.% Mg (OH)2, respectively.

Herein, with an intercalation pseudocapacitance effect, an in situ polymerization-carbonization process for novel carbon-sealed vertical MoS2-SnO2 anchored on graphene aerogel (C@MoS2-SnO2@Gr) has enabled excellent rate performance and durability of the anode of lithium ion batteries to be achieved. The integrated carbon layer and graphene matrix provide a bicontinuous conductive network for efficient electron/ion diffusion pathways. The charge transfer kinetics could be enhanced by the synergistic effects between vertical MoS2 nanosheets and well-dispersed SnO2 particles. Based on the crystal surface matching, the ameliorated electric contact between MoS2 and SnO2 can promote the extraction of Li+ from Li2O and restrain the serious aggregation of LixSn. As a result, the improved reversibility leads to a higher initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 80% (0.1 A g-1 current density) compared to that of other materials. In particular, with the dominating surface capacitive process, the C@MoS2-SnO2@Gr electrode delivers a stable capacity of 680 mA h g-1 at 2.5 A g-1 for 2000 cycles.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop appropriate Na storage electrode materials with the capability to host larger Na+ and fast ion diffusion kinetics. 1D materials such as nanofibers, nanotubes, nanorods, and nanowires, are generally considered to be high-capacity and stable electrode materials, due to their uniform structure, orientated electronic and ionic transport, and strong tolerance to stress change. Here, the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and their applications in SIBs are reviewed. In addition, the prospects of 1D nanomaterials on energy conversion and storage as well as the development and application orientation of SIBs are presented. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To address the interfacial issue and achieve higher energy density, herein, a novel solid-like electrolyte (SLE) based on ionic-liquid-impregnated metal–organic framework nanocrystals (Li-IL@MOF) is reported, which demonstrates excellent electrochemical properties, including a high room-temperature ionic conductivity of 3.0 × 10-4 S cm-1, an improved Li+ transference number of 0.36, and good compatibilities against both Li metal and active electrodes with low interfacial resistances. The Li-IL@MOF SLE is further integrated into a rechargeable Li|LiFePO4 SSB with an unprecedented active loading of 25 mg cm-2, and the battery exhibits remarkable performance over a wide temperature range from −20 up to 150 °C. Besides the intrinsically high ionic conductivity of Li-IL@MOF, the unique interfacial contact between the SLE and the active electrodes owing to an interfacial wettability effect of the nanoconfined Li-IL guests, which creates an effective 3D Li+ conductive network throughout the whole battery, is considered to be the key factor for the excellent performance of the SSB. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here, we developed acid-assisted exfoliation for the first time, to successfully exfoliate TaS2 into very large-sized conductive monolayers with controllable in-plane sub-nanopores. By inducing both interlayer lattice expansion and basal in-plane etching, hydrogen ion, previously regarded disastrous in charged system, was creatively utilized as an efficient and easily accessible assistant in simultaneous exfoliation and controllable structural modification. Benefiting from pore size (∼0.95 nm) matching well with electrolyte ion size, coexistence of ultrahigh conductivity and fast ion transport was achieved in metallic large-sized monolayers. Notably, the as-produced TaS2-based electrode delivers large volumetric capacitance (508 F/cm3 at scan rate of 10 mV/s) and high energy density (58.5 Wh/L) when fabricated into a micro-supercapacitor.

In this paper we compare their grade of amorphicity by Raman and their electrochemical properties. For the latter purpose, it was evaluated the potential window, the presence of electrochemically reducible and oxidizable functional groups, the capacitive properties and the electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen and peroxide reduction reaction in the neutral medium. It was also used Fe(CN)63−/4−, Ru(NH3)63+/2+and Fe3+/2+ redox probes to measure the heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) rate. It was found that a-EHC material is the less amorphous material, demonstrating a higher capacitance (120 μF cm−2), higher amount of reducible and oxidizable functional groups, higher ability for the H2O2 reduction (180.7 and 4.3 μA cm−2 mM−1 sensitivity at −1.1 V and at −0.50 V, respectively) and superior catalytic activity for the ORR (17 A g−1 at −0.30 V). Both EHC materials possess a wide potential window and exhibit a HET rate consistent with the surface charge and the different amount/nature of oxygen functionalities on the surface electrode material.

However, elusive challenges, including the limited charge storage capacity, low Coulombic efficiency, and short cycle life, have been encountered due to the sluggish electrochemical kinetics and severe shuttles of ploysulfides (polyselenide). Taking selenium as model paradigm, a new and reliable Mg-Se chemistry is proposed through designing binary selenium-copper (Se-Cu) cathodes. An intriguing effect of Cu powders on the electrochemical reaction pathways of the active Se microparticles is revealed in a way of forming Cu3Se2 intermediates, which induces an unconventional yet reversible two-stage magnesiation mechanism: Mg-ions first insert into Cu3Se2 phases; in a second step Cu-ions in the Mg2xCu3Se2 lattice exchange with Mg-ions. As expected, binary Se-Cu electrodes show significantly improved reversibility and elongated cycle life. More bracingly, Se/C nano-structures fabricated by facile blade coating Se nanorodes onto copper foils exhibit high output power and capacity (696.0 mAh g−1 at 67.9 mA g−1), which outperforms all previously reported Mg/Se batteries.

Here, we utilized copper (Cu) weaving mesh to in situ fabricate earth-abundant elements-based integrated electrodes for high performance water splitting, where NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) ultrathin nanoarrys for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and Cu3P nanowires for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were successfully constructed on the Cu mesh. Notably, large stable current densities are obtained for both OER (600 mA cm-2) and HER (200 mA cm-2) electrodes under low overpotential, which is superior to most of the nanoparticle-based electrodes. The large current density is mainly because of the excellent conductivity and clean surface (binder-free) of the Cu mesh-based electrode, and which is extremely important for industrial application. The prepared integrated electrodes are coupled with a macroscopic porous sieve and microscopic nanostructures. The assembled NiFe-LDH∥Cu3P electrolyzer exhibits a small cell working voltage of 1.72 V under the current density of 10 mA cm-2 at room temperature, as well as long-term stabilities (&gt;10 h) in 1 M KOH.

Many redox chemistries have been proposed for flow batteries, possessing various attractive features such as low-cost reactants, fast electrochemical reaction kinetics without precious metal catalysts, negligible thermal runaway risk, and low toxicity. While all flow batteries rely on heterogeneous electrochemical reactions occurring at electrode surfaces, in a subset of chemistries homogeneous chemical reactions occur in the electrolyte. A prominent example are batteries employing halogen-based catholytes, where halogen molecules complex with halide ions in the catholyte, forming redox-active polyhalide ions. However, state-of-the-art models capturing flow battery performance for halogen systems typically neglect the presence of such homogeneous reactions and polyhalide ions. The latter assumption allows for simpler models, but at the cost of accurately predicting battery chemical state and performance. We here present a generalized flow battery theory extended to include fast homogeneous reactions, which employs a technique known as the method of families to simplify the governing equations. We then apply and solve the model for the specific case of a membraneless hydrogen-bromine flow battery, illustrating the predicted effect of the homogeneous complexation reaction in the catholyte on flow battery performance. © 2018 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Catalysts; Complexation; Cost effectiveness; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Ions; Reaction kinetics; Redox reactions; Surface reactions; Battery performance; Complexation reaction; Cost-effective storages; Electrochemical reactions; Electrode surfaces; Governing equations; Homogeneous reaction; Precious metal catalysts; Flow batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066126197

However, many of these electrodes suffer from irreversible degradation, for example, irreversible sulfation in the negative electrode of lead acid battery (LAB) and lithium dendrite on the anode surface of lithium ion battery (LIB). We here report a facile synthesis approach of graphitized mesoporous carbons (GMCs), which derived from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8 (ZIF-8) via controlling the annealing parameters, as porous media in the electrodes for suppressing the irreversible sulfation and the dendritic lithium formation. GMC additive in the negative electrode of LAB effectively retards the irreversible sulfation by controlling the growing size of PbSO4 crystal particles. The cycle life of LAB extends 8.5 times after being added GMC additive. Dendrite growth in LIBs is suppressed obviously because GMCs control the lithium growth along the mesoporous structure and the particle voids of GMCs, resulting in the significant extension of operation time of the LIB without a short circuit. The capacity retention of Li and Li/GMC anodes are 42.3% and 90.1%, respectively, at 0.5 C after 200 cycles.

It is found that the crystallinity of RuO2 plays a critical role in determining the electrochemical performance. The sample synthesized by annealing the amorphous-like RuO2 at 500◦C presents the best performance in terms of initial coulumbic efficiency, capacity, cycling stability and rate capability. It is worthy emphasizing that the optimized RuO2 sample presents initial coulumbic efficiency of 80% and delivers a capacity of 255 mAh g−1 at extremely large current density of 4030 mA g−1, which are leading the performance in metal oxide anodes for SIBs. In addition, the electrochemical reaction mechanism of RuO2 with Na is investigated by ex-situ XRD technique. We propose that, for the first time, crystalline RuO2 react with Na to generate amorphous Ru/Na2O mixture during initial discharge process. Upon charging, the Ru/Na2O mixture converts to amorphous RuO2. As for the subsequent cycles, the conversion reaction between amorphous RuO2 and Ru/Na2O sustains the RuO2/Na cell working. The findings in this study provides a new valuable anode for high-performance SIBs and an insightful point of optimizing electrochemical performance by controlling the material’s crystallinity. © 2018 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Anodes; Crystallinity; Electric discharges; Lithium-ion batteries; Metal ions; Metals; Mixtures; Sodium-ion batteries; Conversion reactions; Crystallinity effect; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical reactions; Energy storage technologies; Large current density; Metal oxide anodes; Research interests; Ruthenium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064591283

Phase change materials (PCMs) use latent heat storage, offering great energy density over a limited temperature range. Organic materials, such as paraffins, fatty acids, polymers, sugar alcohols and their eutectic mixtures can be used as PCMs for applications near room temperature, due to their high liquid-solid enthalpy. Inorganic salts and salts hydrates can also function as PCMs, although most of them suffer from incongruent crystallization. Pure PCMs exhibit some disadvantages, such as leakage, decreased thermal transfer and storage capacity during use, arising from their large change in molar volume upon phase transition. These drawbacks can be alleviated by impregnation in high porosity matrices. A promising class of porous matrices is represented by Mesoporous Silica Nanomaterials (MSN). MSN offer high pore volume and surface area, often in excess of 1 cm 3 /g and 1000 m 2 /g, respectively, monodisperse pores, high chemical and thermal stability and ease of tailoring their textural, morphological and surface properties through chemical synthesis. To date, the studies on nanocomposites phase change materials using mesoporous silica matrices have not been reviewed. The current review focuses on the various strategies for obtaining the MSN matrices and PCMs, their properties and the fundamental aspects pertaining to the difference in thermal properties between nanoconfinement in MSN and bulk. The monodisperse pores in the 2 – 50 nm range give rise to nanoconfinement effects, such as decreased melting and crystallization points with respect to bulk phases, hysteresis between melting and crystallization and existence of an interface, liquid-like layer between the silica surface and PCM molecules. The nanoconfinement effects on the PCM properties are discussed and insight into the materials and their applications is provided. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.","Form stable; Heat storage; Mesoporous silica; Nanocomposites; Nanoconfinement; Phase change; Shape-stabilized",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062103890

This paper focuses on the development of an optimal real-time thermal energy management system (TEMS) for smart homes to respond to DRP for peak-load shifting. The proposed TEMS combines two model predictive controllers to manage two thermal energy storage systems, a water storage tank (WST) and the building thermal mass, to schedule residential heat pump loads to off-peak periods. The intention is to manage the operation of a ground source heat pump (GSHP) to produce the desired amount of thermal energy by controlling the volume and temperature of the stored water in the WST while optimizing the operation of the heat distributors to control indoor temperature. The primary contributions are the development of a new control strategy for GSHPs coupled with WST based on building identification to minimize total energy consumption and cost. This paper also proposes a real-time indoor dynamic temperature set-point strategy based on real-time pricing tariffs for enhancing peak-load shifting of heat pump loads with an acceptable variation in thermal comfort. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TEMS has significant potential for real-time peak-load shifting.

To address this issue, the fabrication of the 3D rational nanoarchitecture of anatase TiO2 nanowires (NWs) with desired size and microstructure on a reduced graphene oxide (RGO) host is an efficient and promising approach to meet the demand of high Li/Na storage and rate capability. However, to date, most of the reported anatase TiO2 NWs/RGO composites have been synthesized via the hydrothermal method and rarely investigated for Li+/Na+ batteries. Thus, herein, an innovative supercritical CO2 fluid-assisted strategy (SCFAS) is proposed for the synthesis of ultrafine TiO2 NWs/RGO composites. With the aid of the high permeability and superior solvability of supercritical CO2 fluid, the diameter of the ultrafine TiO2 NWs was well controlled at around 4.2 nm. Even at a high TiO2 loading (79.4 wt%), the TiO2 NWs still showed good dispersion and tight contact with the RGO host. As an anode material for Li-ion batteries, the reversible capacity of the as-formed composite remained 666 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 and 460 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles at 2 A g-1, which is nearly twice of that synthesized from the hydrothermal method. When cycled against Na, the reversible capacity was 113 mA h g-1 with 81.8% retention even at 5 A g-1 after 5000 cycles, which is better than other TiO2/RGO composites reported thus far.

However, it still remains great challenges to realize an applicable FeS2 electrode with both high reversible capacity and long cycle life. In this study, micron-sized FeS2@C composed of FeS2 nanoparticles uniformly embedded in carbon matrix was investigated as a conversion-type anode for sodium ion batteries by coupling with various electrolytes. It is demonstrated that the electrolyte formulations, i.e., both solvents and Na salts, play vital roles in the Na storage performance of FeS2. The combination of NaPF6 and DME was highly advantageous for constructing robust SEI films with high Na+ conductivity, guaranteeing fast and reversible conversion reactions in the wide electrochemical window of 0.005-3 V (vs. Na/Na+). Owing to the fast charge transfer kinetics and high chemical compatibility between the electrolyte and electrode, the as-prepared FeS2@C could deliver a high reversible capacity of 853 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and 459 mA h g-1 at 40 A g-1, a remarkable initial coulombic efficiency of 84.7% and excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 83.2% over 1000 cycles.

This paper proposes a retail pricing strategy to assist a DISCO and end-users in achieving optimal price-based DR for HVAC systems, while considering operational aspects of distribution network (DN). The pricing strategy is developed using a bi-level decision model. In the upper level, the DISCO optimizes the retail price to maximize its profit, and in the lower level, the end-users schedule HVAC loads to minimize their electricity bills. The nonlinear thermal response model of an experimental building room is integrated with a data-driven model of an HVAC system and incorporated into the pricing strategy using piecewise linear approximation. The proposed strategy also employs time-of-use (TOU) rates as retail price caps, leading to low-level price volatility. Case studies are presented for various ranges of bus voltage deviation and penetration levels of HVAC systems. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is effective for determining the optimal balancing point between the DISCO&#x2019;s profit and end-users&#x2019; electricity bills while enabling the DISCO to reliably regulate the network voltages via the price-sensitive HVAC units.

To address these issues, three types of porous ceramic membranes (garnet type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12, Y0.16Zr0.84O2−δ, and Al2O3) are presented as separators for Li-S batteries. It is found that the mechanically stiff separators not only have strong affinity for polysulfides but also have high mechanical strength to block lithium dendrite penetration, resulting in a significantly improved electrochemical performance and dramatically enhanced safety of Li-S batteries. Specifically, by employing the Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 separator, the Li-S battery can achieve an extended cycle life (over 500 cycles at 0.5C with a capacity decay of 0.034% per cycle on average) and high rate performance up to 2C, outperforming the reported Li-S batteries based on dense ceramic membranes.

In addition, the intercalation reaction in graphitized carbon coupled with electrodeposition reaction in the porous framework can further enhance the Li storage capacity of Co/Co4N-NC. Moreover, we have also demonstrated the formation of a stable SEI layer on the Co/Co4N-NC electrode during the Li plating process. Hence, the Co/Co4N-NC electrode can significantly suppress dendritic Li and shows a high coulombic efficiency of 98.5% over 300 cycles.

Among various solid electrolytes, polymer electrolytes have received more attention due to their potential advantages, including wide electrochemical windows, ease of processing, low interface impedance and low cost. Polymeric electrolytes based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as a well-known polymer matrix have been extensively studied because of their highly flexible EO segments in the amorphous phase that can provide channels for lithium ion transport. However, obtaining a PEO-based solid electrolyte with high Li ion conductivity and without sacrificing mechanical strength is still a huge challenge. In this study, polymethylhydrogen-siloxane (PMHS) with low glass transition temperature and good flexibility was blended into the PEO to optimize ion transportation by the solution casting technique. The hybrid electrolyte membrane with 40% PMHS exhibited high ionic conductivity (2.0 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 80 °C), large electrochemical windows (5.2 V), a high degree of flexibility, and thermal stability. When assembling a Li/LiFePO4 battery, a reversible capacity close to 140 mA h g−1 (0.1 C) at 60 °C was delivered. In addition, a cell with this polymer electrolyte exhibits excellent stability.

Herein, ultrafine Ti4O7 nanoparticle-embedded porous carbon (PC@Ti4O7) as an efficient sulfur host was facilely prepared using commercial TiO2 nanoparticles and phenolic resin. In this strategy, the highly conductive ultrafine Ti4O7 nanoparticles with abundant active adsorption sites can efficiently trap polysulfides and accelerate their conversion.

The rational design of using the redox reaction of lychee exocarp (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, etc.) and KMnO4 to generate a large number of MnOx nanoparticles on the surface of the lychee exocarp and then pyrolysis with the supplemented nitrogen source melamine can successfully realize the preparation of three-dimensional MnO@NLEFC.

However, their conventional batteries are required to be frequently charged or replaced, greatly limiting the development of wearable electronics. Thus, a wearable power source that can in situ harvest biomechanical energy to continuously power wearable electronics is extremely desirable. In this work, we report for the first time a washable textile-structured single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator (TS-TENG) based on a nanofibrous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymer with high hydrophobicity. A stained TS-TENG can be easily and quickly cleaned by washing in water. The TS-TENG can be sewed on clothes, and then it can effectively convert mechanical energy to electricity by the friction with the material of clothes. When operated by swinging arms while people are walking or running, the output voltage and current of the TS-TENG obtained were 1050 V and 22 μA, respectively. This generated electric energy could directly power a night running light and a digital watch without any energy storage process. The development of this TS-TENG could provide great opportunities for developing self-powered wearable electronics due to its flexibility, breathability, washability, and capability to harvest biomechanical energy from human motions. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Biomechanics; Electric energy storage; Electrodes; Nanogenerators; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Textiles; Triboelectricity; Conventional batteries; Digital watches; Electric energies; Mechanical energies; Output voltages; Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE); Single electrodes; Storage process; Wearable technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054844225

Herein, we adopted the flexible carbon microtube skeleton (FCMS) as a lightweight and easily obtained 3D current collector to accommodate metallic Li. The stable intercalation and electrodeposition behavior on the FCMS greatly improves the Li storage capacity and cycling stability, accompanying reduced Li deposition overpotential. Moreover, Li metal was found to predominantly grow inside the upper layer of the FCMS owing to the faster electron transport than Li+ diffusion, whereas the lower layer of the FCMS without metallic Li serves as a soft and conductive ""air cushion"", which can significantly suppress the Li dendrite growth based on the stress relief mechanism. Benefiting from such favorable Li deposition behaviors, the FCMS electrode maintains a steady and high CE (∼98%) for nearly 1400 h with an ultrahigh areal capacity (10 mA h cm-2). With the existence of FCMS, the composite Li anode presents a tiny and stable voltage hysteresis of ∼50 mV even at 5 mA cm-2 for 5 mA h cm-2. The FCMS@Li based full cell with LiFePO4 as cathode (9.4 mg cm-2) delivers enhanced cycling stability, coulombic efficiencies and rate capability (∼120 mA h g-1 at 5 C with ultralow overpotential).

However, several issues, including substrate material selectivity, hard control on precise coatings and a limited enhancement of electronic conductivity, hinder the conventional strategies from further practical application. Here, we develop a general, facile and programmable strategy to precisely construct carbon-confined functional nanostructures with high conductivity via metal-phenolic network (MPN) assembly and subsequent controlled pyrolysis. The instantaneous MPN assembly is realized via the coordination reaction between metal ions and phenolic ligands, and the thickness of the MPN shell can be well controlled by simply repeating the rapid assembly procedure. This strategy is further successfully extended to versatile electrode materials with diverse nanostructures and rich compositions. As a proof of concept, the as-synthesized carbon-confined SnO2 hollow spheres with Fe2O3 nanodots embedded in a carbon shell (SnO2@C-Fe2O3) exhibit a high reversible discharge capacity of 1203 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g-1, an excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 86% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1, and a high capacity of 830 mA h g-1 at a higher rate of 5 A g-1.

Consuming abandoned wind power heating facilitates degrading the abandoned wind power amount of northern China, developing consuming wind power ability and reducing the pollution. Whilst the economical efficiency of wind power heating is relatively poor due to the high construction costs, the pollutant discharge amount is low. The environmental costs are calculated, shifted into monetary costs, and then added with economic costs. The costs of consuming abandoned wind power heating include the decrement of the generation cost of wind power plant and the economic and environmental costs of thermal storage type electric heating. Taking the Environmental conservation of wind power and the decrement of the generation cost of wind power plant into consideration, not only the comparison between consuming abandoned wind power heating and cogeneration heating is more comprehensive and reasonable, but also the joint programming of wind power heating and traditional modes of heating. © 2018.

Enhancing the sulfur utilization, decreasing the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and improving the electrical conductivity of the cathodes have become the main challenges for the successful commercialization of Li-S batteries. In this paper, use of novel ""pea-pod-like"" nitrogen-doped hollow porous carbon cathode hosts decorated with polar titanium dioxide nanocrystals (rod-TiO2@C) as high-efficiency polysulfide immobilizers for advanced Li-S batteries are reported. In this ingenious nanostructure, the hollow porous carbon can not only enhance the conductivity of the cathodes, but also effectively reserve sulfur species in its internal void space and the volume expansion upon lithiation can also be alleviated. More importantly, the well-dispersed polar TiO2 nanocrystals can significantly suppress the dissolution of LiPSs and accelerate the redox reaction by strong chemical interactions.

For SIBs, a high capacity of 438 mA h g-1 is obtained after 200 cycles for apple carbon and 451 mA h g-1 for celery carbon. It is noteworthy that celery carbon shows a capacity retention of 94% between the 50th to 200th cycling. Further analysis on the structure characterization and charging curves reveal that celery carbon has a high N content, dilated intergraphene spacing, and an intrinsically hierarchical porous structure, which are capable of reversibly accumulating sodium ions through surface adsorption and sodium intercalation.

However, the ""heat-led"" operation mode limits the adjustability of combined heat and power (CHP) plants, decreases the exibility of the power systems, and reduces the accommodation of RESs, consequently. This paper studies an integrated thermal and power system with a wind power plant, and introduces a phase-change heat storage (HS) facility into the CHP plant to improve the adjustability. Based on the entransy dissipation-based thermal resistance theory, the thermal part of the system is modeled as a thermal resistance network to analyze the integrated system in a unified model, and optimize the scheduling of the integrated system. The results show that: 1) the HS facility increases the exibility of power system by decoupling the heat supply and the heat load of the CHP plant, and 2) when the heat-to-electric generation ratio remains constant, the HS facility should releases heat in daytime (when the wind energy source is insufficient), and stores heat in night (when the wind energy source is sufficient) to enlarge the wind energy accommodation. © 2018, Science Press.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses confirmed that n-octadecane was successfully encapsulated into the PMMA shell and that the NanoPCMs exhibited a regular spherical profile. The phase change properties, thermal reliability, thermal stability, and flame-retardant properties of NanoPCMs were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), cone calorimeter tests, and limiting oxygen index (LOI) measurements. The DSC results showed that the NanoPCMs possessed a relatively high encapsulation efficiency in the range of 86.5-94.0% for n-octadecane. The thermal properties and durability of the NanoPCMs were almost unchanged after the introduction of DEAMP into the NanoPCMs. The combustion test results showed that the introduction of phosphorus-based flame retardant DEAMP into the NanoPCMs significantly suppressed the heat and smoke releases and, increased the residual weight and LOI value of the EP/NanoPCM composites. In addition, a computer-aided thermal measurement system was created to investigate the thermoregulation properties of the NanoPCMs and the results showed that the addition of NanoPCMs into a gypsum board significantly improved the thermoregulation properties.

In this work, the electronic structures, stabilities, and the Li adsorption preferences of lithiated WS2 and NbSe2 monolayers as well as a lithiated WS2/NbSe2 heterostructure were systematically investigated using first principles calculations. It was found that compared with the metallic NbSe2 monolayer, the WS2/NbSe2 heterostructure appears to have a new state occupation where there was no state occupation in the sole NbSe2 monolayer. The metallic character ensures good electrical conductivity for lithium-ion batteries. Additionally, the diffusion barrier of the WS2/NbSe2 heterostructure is lower than that of WS2 and NbSe2 monolayers. A lower diffusion barrier guarantees better charge and discharge performances of the WS2/NbSe2 heterostructure as a battery electrode. Most importantly, the heterostructure was predicted to have quite a high theoretical specific capacity.

Herein, by loading 70 wt% sulfur into a pyrene-based 2D COF (Py-COF), we succeeded in the construction of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high-rate capacity and long-term stability. The Py-COF/S cathode can deliver a reversible capacity of 481.2 mA h g-1 for up to 550 cycles at 5.0C (1C = 1680 mA g-1), which is 73.8% of the initial capacity with a decay rate of 0.048% per cycle. This is a benchmark among all reported COF-based Li-S batteries, and more impressively, even beyond the performances of some porous carbon-based sulfur host electrodes. Specifically, by using commercially available porous carbon BP2000 as the sulfur host under the same conditions, the thus-prepared electrode can only exhibit a reversible capacity of 265 mA h g-1 after 220 cycles at 5.0C, much lower than that of the Py-COF/S electrode. According to cyclic voltammetry analysis, this high performance could be attributed to the fast lithium ion transport in the pores of Py-COF, especially at a high rate. These results clearly demonstrate that it is reasonable to design a 2D COF sulfur host for high performance Li-S batteries. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Cyclic voltammetry; Decay (organic); Electrodes; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Porous materials; Pyrene; Covalent organic frameworks; Decay rate; High-rate capacities; Lithium sulfurs; Lithium-ion transport; Long term stability; Porous carbons; Reversible capacity; Lithium sulfur batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053490233

Time-varying dimensionless entropy generation rates and the cumulative entropy generation in SSTES were determined from finite volume computations. The aspect ratios (AR), Peclet numbers (PeD), and Richardson numbers (Ri), for the stores considered were within the ranges 1 ≤ AR ≤ 4, 5 × 103 ≤ PeD ≤ 100 × 103, and 10 ≤ Ri ≤ 104, respectively. Using the Bejan number (Be), the total entropy generation was shown to be almost entirely due to thermal effects in the SSTES. The Be is practically unity for most of the SSTES' charging duration. The contributions of radial thermal gradients to the thermal entropy generation were further shown to be largely negligible in comparison to the contributions of axial thermal gradients, except at low Ri. Entropy generation numbers, Ns, in the SSTES were also computed and found to increase with decreasing AR and PeD and with increasing Ri. PeD was found to have the most significant influence on Ns.

Great challenges like high cost and complex fabrication process still exist for the fabrication of silicon micro/nanostructures, especially for the fabrication of uniformly distributed silicon micro/nanostructures. In this study, the generally unwelcome failure of materials, nanopitting, was introduced and demonstrated to be effective in micro/nanofabrication for the first time. Together with wet chemical etching, uniformly distributed silicon micro/nanostructures were obtained. Ag islands were formed by the nanopitting of chloridion, which will be used as mask and catalyser in the chemical etching process. The silicon micro/nanostructures, especially, uniformly distributed p-type silicon micro/nanostructures were fabricated with the low-cost and facile fabrication approach. In addition, the application of the silicon micro/nanostructures was demonstrated as microsupercapacitive electrodes with the integration of MnO2 nanostructures. The results show that the electrochemical performance of silicon micro/nanostructures was much better than that of silicon microstructures.

Sectors such as transportation and industry are the biggest consumers, corresponding to a consumption of 57 % and 20 % respectively. Apart from the environmental impact from the use of fossil fuels, fuel cost has a direct impact on the country's economy as well. Based on these facts and having as a goal to reach the EU 2020 energy efficiency target, an effective way to reduce the use of fossil fuels and energy consumption, is the use of renewable energy systems. Moreover, it was revealed that the biggest energy consumer from the industrial sector is the food and beverage industry. Solar energy systems that could support the thermal energy needs of these industries are small-scaled middle temperature parabolic trough collectors (PTC) with thermal storage and auxiliary systems. The purpose of this study is to present the first pilot PTC system installed to serve 40 kWth of the thermal needs of a soft drink factory named 'KEAN', located in Limassol, Cyprus. A dynamic simulation modelling is also developed to predict the performance of the system and study its potential to be further utilized in a higher thermal load. For the dynamic modelling of the system, TRNSYS software is used, with weather data from typical meteorological year (TMY) files for Cyprus. It was concluded that KEAN solar system could produce 125 kWth heat from which the 40 kWth are utilized by the industry whereas the rest are stored and used when needed. For a bigger application, for a dairy factory, a year period, and a thermal load of 190 kWth the system with 42 collectors could cover 68% of the load and the auxiliary covers the rest. To examine the potential of this system a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) has been done. It was concluded that the total investment would have a payback period of 5 y.

However, BTMMOs are rarely utilized as electrode materials for lithium ion batteries. Herein, we report the synthesis of nearly uniform monodisperse bicomponent iron manganese oxide, (FeO)x(MnO)1-x nanocrystals encapsulated in amorphous carbon, via liquid-solid solution and Baeyer's reagent routes and used them as a high-performance anode material for lithium ion batteries. The (FeO)x(MnO)1-x nanocrystals can be obtained by using inexpensive simple iron salt, oleic acid and manganese metal salts as reactants. The interaction of the Mn salt via the Baeyer's reagent route induces metal cations in the form of low oxidation states. In the presence of low valence states in the BTMMO electrode, the formation of irreversible Li2O and high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) can be suppressed for enhancing the electrochemical properties of the electrodes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to study the electron density redistribution in the BTMMO samples. The optimized bicomponent (FeO)0.198(MnO)0.802 electrode displayed excellent lithium storage performance which is superior to those of (FeO)0.331(MnO)0.669 and MTMO electrodes.

With the polymer thermal energy storage materials as the form-stable matrix and phase change materials for thermal energy storage as research object, this paper conducts an in-depth study on heat storage mechanism and application of polymer thermal energy storage materials. The results show that the thermal conductivity and phase change energy storage rate determine the performance and efficiency of thermal storage materials, and the thermal conductivity of polymer thermal energy storage material depends mainly on lattice vibration. The latent heat value of the larger thermal energy storage board has a more pronounced adjustment effect on the indoor air temperature, thus can improve the living comfort of the building. The surface temperature increases gradually with the increase of the thickness of the thermal energy storage board, and the total amount of sensible thermal energy and latent thermal energy increase. The greater the thickness of the thermal energy storage board, the higher the indoor temperature at the same time.

Here, a rationally designed 3D MoS2/dual-channel graphene framework (MoS2/GA-GF) hybrid has been constructed through a two-step method. This dual-channel graphene framework (GA-GF) consists of two types of channels with different graphene types, graphene foam channels improving electron transport and graphene aerogel channels facilitating Li ion diffusion.

However, the nucleation mechanism of NiO on graphene is incompletely understood. Here, highly dispersed NiO nanodots with a size of 1.48nm anchored on reduced graphene oxide (NiO NDs@rGO) were synthesized by a solvothermal method. Density functional theory (DFT) results show that NiO NDs are more easily trapped by the defects on graphene through strong adsorption, which greatly reduces the possibility of diffusion and prevents agglomeration of NiO NDs. As a result, NiO NDs are mainly connected to defects on graphene, which explain the uniform dispersion of NiO NDs on the graphene surface. This unique structure serves to promote ion accessibility and shorten the electron transfer path from redox sites to the graphene backbone. Electrochemical evaluation shows that utilizing the composite as an electrode material for aqueous electrolytes can greatly improve the overall electrochemical performance.

However, controlled synthesis of advanced electrode materials with high capacity, high reaction activity, and structural stability is still a considerable challenge in practical applications. Herein, we develop a simple and efficient method to replace the traditional wet chemical deposition route for the synthesis of CexSn1-xO2-σ hybrid coated Li-rich Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 (denoted as LNCM@CexSn1-xO2-σ, 0 &lt; x ≤ 1) materials as cathodes by a versatile solvothermal method. The obtained LNCM@CexSn1-xO2-σ materials are further characterized by XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM, and TEM. It is revealed that the synthesized Ce0.8Sn0.2O2-σ material possesses abundant oxygen vacancies and exists in the form of nanoparticles with a size of about 10 nm on the surface of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 (CS3). Meanwhile, a spinel-phase layer is formed between the nanoparticles and host material. As anticipated, a sample modified with CS3 exhibited good rate capability and enhanced cycling stability. More importantly, this modification strategy dramatically reduces the irreversible capacity loss (ICR) of the first cycle for active materials; the ICR lowered to 48.1 mA h g-1 in comparison with the pristine material at a current density of 12.5 mA g-1 (0.05C). Furthermore, an enhanced initial discharge capacity of 315.1 mA h g-1 (0.05C) compared to 285.3 mA h g-1 and an excellent initial coulombic efficiency of 92.77% compared to 79.71% for the pristine one in the potential range of 2.0-4.8 V (vs. Li/Li+) were obtained. Such improvements are mainly ascribed to the fact that the Ce0.2Sn0.8O2-σ material has a good synergistic effect with the pristine LNCM material, which may be the spillover caused by the migration of lattice oxygen from the LNCM phase to the Ce0.2Sn0.8O2-σ phase. In addition, the formation of the spinel structure is beneficial for stabilizing the crystal lattice of the host material and facilitating Li+ diffusion through unique 3D diffusion paths in the surface regions. This newly developed Ce0.8Sn0.2O2-σ hybrid layer can provide a new strategy for the design and synthesis of advanced electrode materials for energy storage devices. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cathodes; Cerium compounds; Chemical modification; Coated materials; Crystal structure; Electric discharges; Hybrid materials; Lithium compounds; Manganese compounds; Nanoparticles; Nickel compounds; Oxygen vacancies; Sound insulating materials; Stability; Synthesis (chemical); Tin compounds; Advanced electrodes; Chemical treatments; Controlled synthesis; Initial Coulombic efficiency; Initial discharge capacities; Irreversible capacity loss; Layered cathode materials; Structural stabilities; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050651159

Developing high performance anode materials is one of the major challenges for SIBs. Red phosphorus (RP) is considered as one of the most promising anodes for SIBs with a high theoretical specific capacity of about 2600 mA h g-1, tackling serious challenges, such as large volume change and low electrical conductivity during the charge-discharge process. Herein, we have demonstrated a novel hollow nanoporous red phosphorus (HNPRP) with a small amount of iodine doping as an advanced anode for SIBs via combining a typical redox reaction and boiling process. The HNPRP exhibits a high capacity of 1658.2 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.26 A g-1, superior rate capability (759.6 mA h g-1 at 5.2 A g-1) and ultralong cycle-life (857.3 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at 2.6 A g-1) as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The excellent electrochemical performance is due to its innovative electrode design, which ensures high sodium ion accessibility, strong structural integrity and fast electrode transport.

The annular space between tubes is filled with two paraffin wax phase change materials (PCMs), named PCM1 and PCM2. A heat transfer fluid (HTF: saturated water) flows through the inner tube and transfers the heat to the PCMs. Several numerical investigations were conducted in order to examine the effects of the HTF inlet temperatures on the variation of the temperature of PCM1 and PCM2, melting fraction, melting and solidification time, HTF outlet temperature, heat transfer rate, and total energy stored. Numerical results show that charging and discharging processes have three distinct periods for the change of PCMtemperature and melting fraction. When the temperature difference between the HTF inlet temperature and PCM increase, the variation of the temperature and melting fraction in different locations in the PCM increases considerably, and then the charging and discharging process is rapidly reached. The melting times of PCM1 and PCM2 decrease with an increase in the HTF inlet temperature. Moreover, the decreasing degree of their melting times is different. The present analysis provides theoretical guidance for designing optimization of a concentric double pipe LTES unit filled with two PCMs. © 2018 by Begell House, Inc.","Charging process; Concentric double pipe; Discharging process; Solar water heating system; Thermal energy storage","Heat storage; Melting; Solar heating; Solar water heaters; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Charging process; Discharging process; Double pipes; Latent thermal energy storage unit; Latent thermal energy storages; Melting and solidification; Numerical investigations; Solar water heating systems; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049524003

On the micro level, the cyclic cooling-heating process caused the repeated displacement of interstitial atoms, resulting in the interstitial atoms returning to the original defect location and the restoration of internal defects. On the macro level, a blocking layer with high resistivity was generated between the Al top electrode and the SrTiO3 thin film, which could effectively prevent the charge carriers at the interface. After micro and macro modification, electrode damage caused by the edge effect was effectively restrained and the space charge limited conductance (SCLC) mechanism was almost eliminated. Thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) spectra provided powerful evidence to testify that the number of traps sharply decreased after cyclic cooling-heating. As a result of the defect restoration as well as the interfacial blocking effect, the leakage current was decreased by one order magnitude and the breakdown strength was enhanced from 142.8 MV m-1 to 607.1 MV m-1.

However, they suffer from rapid capacity fading and poor cyclic stability, which is far from the practical application. Developing an effective sulfur impregnation method is of great importance, especially meeting the demand for large-scale commercial application. In this work, we have prepared reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via microwave method as the host for high-performance sulfur cathode and three methods (melt-diffusion method, chemical precipitation method and chemical precipitation-melt diffusion method) have been explored to synthesize rGO@S composites for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. Method: Graphene oxides (GO) were prepared from natural graphite by modified Hummer’s method. Then reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized by microwave method. rGO@S composites were prepared by melt-diffusion method, chemical precipitation method and chemical precipitation- melt diffusion method. The galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were analyzed to obtained the overall performance of lithiumsulfur batteries. Result: The chemical precipitation-melt diffusion method is an effective strategy to achieve appropriate sulfur encapsulation, where smaller sulfur is impregnated uniformly into abundant pores of rGO matrix. As a result, the CM-rGO@S composite delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1108.8 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.2 C, and maintains a stable capacity of 751.3 mAh g-1 after 80 cycles. Furthermore, the CM-rGO@S composite exhibits enhanced cyclic stability and excellent rate capability, delivering a capacity of 598.4 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at a high current density of 0.5 C with a capacity retention of 65.8%. Conclusion: In summary, the rGO@S composite prepared by chemical precipitation-melt diffusion method shows outstanding electrochemical performance, such as superior cycle stability and excellent rate capability. It demonstrated that the chemical precipitation-melt diffusion method is an effective strategy to achieve appropriate sulfur encapsulation, where smaller sulfur is impregnated uniformly into abundant pores of rGO matrix. We believe that this attempt can give insights on the other cathode preparation for achieving high performance lithium-sulfur batteries. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.","Chemical precipitation method; Graphene; Lithium-sulfur batteries; Melt-diffusion method; Sulfur encapsulation; Synthetic method","Cathodes; Chemical stability; Diffusion; Electric discharges; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Graphene; Lithium batteries; Precipitation (chemical); Chemical precipitation method; Commercial applications; Diffusion method; Electrochemical performance; Galvanostatic charge/discharge; Initial discharge capacities; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Synthetic methods; Lithium sulfur batteries; graphene oxide; graphite; lithium; nanocomposite; sulfur; Article; current density; diffusion; impedance spectroscopy; nanoencapsulation; nanofabrication; precipitation; priority journal; synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049311239

The generated heat can be converted into electrical energy through the thermoelectric Seebeck effect. However, the key challenge in enhancing solar-thermal-electric conversion is to achieve efficient photo-thermal conversion and temperature difference control. Herein, new composite materials are prepared using abundant and cheap raw materials to simultaneously realise photo-thermal conversion, heat storage, and heat supply for a thermoelectric device. The composites consist of carbonised waste cotton and stearic acid (SA), where carbonised waste cotton can achieve efficient full spectrum photo-thermal conversion and SA can store the generated heat to maintain a stable temperature for a thermoelectric device. The best content of SA is found to be 85 wt-% in the composites due to uniform dispersion and ideal combination. The 3D netlike structure of carbonised waste cotton provides increased heat transfer paths and also prevents leakage of SA during phase change. The maximum phase change enthalpy is 203.6 J g-1 for the composite with 85 wt-% SA, which is almost the same as pure SA, assuring high density heat storage. A light-thermal-electric conversion device is further constructed based on as-prepared composites and a thermoelectric system. The generated electricity can light up a light-emitting diode with strong intensity. © CSIRO 2018.",,"Cotton; Dispersions; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Net-like structures; Photo-thermal conversions; Solar thermal electric; Temperature differences; Thermal-electric conversion; Thermoelectric devices; Thermoelectric systems; Uniform dispersions; Image enhancement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049218942

However, a decrease in the reversible H storage capacity on cycling at high temperatures takes place and is a major obstacle for its use in hydrogen and heat storage applications. Reversible hydrogen absorption/desorption cycling of the materials requires use of the working temperature ≥330 °C and results in a partial step-by-step loss of the recoverable hydrogen storage capacity, with less significant changes in the rates of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation. After hydrogen desorption at 330-350 °C, hydrogen absorption can proceed at much lower temperatures, down to 24 °C. However, a significant decay in the reversible hydrogen capacity takes place with increasing number of cycles. The observed deterioration is caused by cycling-induced drastic morphological changes in the studied composite material leading to a segregation of TiH2 particles in the cycled samples instead of their initial homogeneous distribution. However, the introduction of 5 wt% of graphite into the MgH2-TiH2 composite system prepared by HRBM leads to an outstanding improvement of the hydrogen storage performance. Indeed, hydrogen absorption and desorption characteristics remain stable through 100 hydrogen absorption/desorption cycles and are related to an effect of the added graphite. The TEM study showed that carbon is uniformly distributed between the MgH2 grains covering segregated TiH2, preventing the grain growth and thus keeping the reversible storage capacity and the rates of hydrogen charge and discharge unchanged. Modelling of the kinetics of hydrogen absorption and desorption in the Mg-Ti and Mg-Ti-C composites showed that the reaction mechanisms significantly change depending on the presence or absence of graphite, the number of absorption-desorption cycles and the operating temperature.

AM methods have some advantages over other production processes, such as great freedom of form, shape complexity, scale, and material use. These characteristics are relevant for façade applications, which demand the integration of several functions. Given the established capacity of AM to generate complex geometries, most existing research focuses on mechanical material properties and mainly in relation to the load-bearing capacity and the construction system. The integration of additional aspects is often achieved with post processing and the use of multiple materials. Research is needed to investigate properties for insulation, thermal storage, and energy harvesting, combined in one component and one production technology. To this end. the research project ""SPONG3D' aimed at developing a 3D-printed façade panel that integrates insulating properties with heat storage in a complex, mono-material geometry. This paper gives an overview of the panel development process, including aspects of material selection, printing process, structural properties, energy performance, and thermal heat storage. The development process was guided by experiments and simulations and resulted in the design and manufacturing of a full-scale façade element prototype using FDM printing with PETG. The project proved the possibility of the integration of functions in 3D-printed façades, but also highlighted the limitations and the need for further developments. © 2018 TU Delft.

In this work, the effect of interstitial and surface Li on the electronic properties of porous Si is studied using the first-principles density functional theory approach and the generalised gradient approximation. The pores are modeled by removing columns of atoms of an otherwise perfect Si crystal, dangling bonds of all surfaces are passivated with H atoms, and then Li is inserted on interstitial positions on the pore wall and compared with the replacement of H atoms with Li. The results show that the interstitial Li creates effects similar to n-type doping where the Fermi level is shifted towards the conduction band with band crossings of the said level thus acquiring metallic characteristics. The surface Li introduces trap-like states in the electronic band structures which increase as the number of Li atom increases with a tendency to become metallic. These results could be important for the application of porous Si nanostructures in Li-ion batteries technology. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Atoms; Crystal atomic structure; Dangling bonds; Density functional theory; Electronic properties; Lithium-ion batteries; Bulk silicon; Electronic band structure; Energy storage applications; First-principles density functional theory; Gradient approximation; Interstitial positions; n-Type doping; Theoretical study; Porous silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048147879

In addition to the constant values of these parameters, for materials that do not have a clearly-defined phase transition, the enthalpy-temperature curve hT is very useful. An analysis of hT revealed the effective thermal capacity as a function of the temperature cp,eff T . Its constant values at the low and high temperature regions correspond to the cp,s and cp,l values, respectively.

In this study, rechargeable metal-iodine batteries, particularly aluminum/iodine batteries, were fabricated with novel active carbon cloth/polyvinylpyrrolidone (ACC/PVPI) composite cathodes prepared via a facile solution-adsorption method combined with freeze-drying. The use of active carbon cloth (ACC) endows the composites superior electronic conductivity, and significantly decreases the weight of the electrode due to its function as a current collector. Hydrogen bonding interaction between PVP and iodine in PVPI guarantees the depression of the shuttle effect of polyiodide, thus lengthening the cycle life. The density functional theory (DFT) analysis shows that such shuttle depression occurs due to the hydrogen-bonded iodine species, and the relatively large formation energy hints at higher conversion reaction efficiency of Al ion batteries. These characteristics make the composites an ideal electrode in various metal ion batteries. To be specific, the Al/I2 battery with a distinct working potential window achieves a high capacity of 180.1 mA h g-1 at 0.2C and can remain stable after 500 cycles with a stable capacity of 127 mA h g-1 at 0.6C. Moreover, at higher current density of 1C, the battery delivers a capacity of 102.7 mA h g-1 for up to 1050 cycles.

The electrochemical performance of Li2S can be remarkably improved by introducing carbon to form Li2S-carbon composites. However, the complex preparation process of Li2S-carbon composites limits their large-scale applications. Herein, we present a green and facile strategy to synthesize porous carbon-coated Li2S-carbon nanotube composites (Li2S@PC-CNT) by heating carbon disulfide (CS2) and the lithium hydride-CNT mixture at a temperature below 250 °C, which is the lowest temperature for in situ synthesis of Li2S-carbon composites reported till date. For the Li2S@PC-CNT composites, Li2S@PC particles are connected with neighboring particles through the 3D CNTs network skeleton. This unique nanoarchitecture not only prevents the loss of active materials and diffusion of polysulfides, but also significantly facilitates fast electron and ion transport. As a result, a high specific capacity (820 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 10 cycles) and a remarkable cycle life (502 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 300 cycles) are achieved.

Potassium is cheap and abundant contrary to Li. Prussian blue and analogues PBAs are promising cathodes materials for K-ion batteries, because of facile synthesis and low cost. However, PB and close analogues (Prussian green and Prussian white) suffer from low coulombic efficiency and low cyclability owing to structure deficiency.

Sulfated ultrathin mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays are fabricated based on a convenient galvanic displacement process, exhibiting stimulated chemical reactivity and boosted supercapacitive performance. This method not only realizes synchronization of synthesis and surface functionalization but also readily tailors the functionalizing degree of the sulfate-ion and surface reactivity of NiCo2O4 through adjusting the addition amount of the sulfur source. Moderately sulfated NiCo2O4 exhibits a capacitance activation in the first 2100 cycles and achieves the highest specific capacitance of up to 1113 F g-1, an increase of 57% over that of pristine NiCo2O4 during 5000 cycling tests at a high current density of 5 A g-1.

Electrochemical tests show that electrochemical performance and electronic conductivity of the composite are significantly improved due to the polytetrahydrofuran coating, and a reversible capacity of 123.6 mAh g–1 at a moderate 2 C rate is obtained with a high capacity retention of 98.5% after 250 cycles.

In this work, we show that the Janus MSXs possess diverse electronic and magnetic properties, and can be semiconducting or metallic, and nonmagnetic or magnetic, depending on their composition. We find that a TiSC monolayer with a 1H phase (TiSC-1H) is suitable as a cathode for Li ion batteries and anode materials for Na and Mg ion batteries due to its high open circuit voltage (OCV) (2.121 eV) for Li, and low OCVs upon Na (0.676 eV) and Mg (1.044 eV) intercalation, respectively. Importantly, TiSC-1H shows fast charge/discharge rates, good cycling stability, and high storage density as electrode materials for rechargeable batteries because of low ion diffusion barriers, small volume expansion and high specific capacity. We further show that TiSP-1H has the best performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction due to both its catalytic activities on the surfaces and relatively low overpotentials upon hydrogenation.

However, CoS2-based nanomaterials are still suffering from their volume expansion, agglomeration and poor cycling stability. Here, we demonstrated an intriguing and effective strategy to confine CoS2 nanodots (&lt;10 nm) within the graphitic carbon walls of porous N-doped carbon spheres (CoS2-in-wall-NCSs), which both avoids the volume change and facilitates the promotion of reaction kinetics in lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Moreover, N-doped carbon spheres (NCSs) with nest-like architectures and graphitic carbon nanoribbons offer an ideal diffusion pathway for electrolyte ions and a highly rapid electron transfer pathway. As a result, the CoS2-in-wall-NCSs still exhibit an excellent performance in LIBs with a high specific capacity of 1080.6 mA h g-1 at a current density of 200 mA g-1 even after 500 cycles, which is much better than those of CoS2 nanoparticles (NPs) in the pores of N-doped carbon spheres (CoS2-in-pore-NCSs), metallic Co NPs embedded in N-doped carbon spheres (Co/NCSs), and NCSs.

Here we propose a universal strategy for the in situ synthesis of TiO2(B) nanosheets on pristine carbon nanomaterials, e.g., pristine graphene nanosheets (PGNSs) and pristine carbon nanotubes (PCNTs), with the help of a multifunctional linker (SDBS). The resulting TiO2(B)@PGNS and TiO2(B)@PCNT nanohybrids energetically integrate the appealing merits of the two building blocks. Pristine carbon nanomaterials play three vital roles: first, they serve as high-efficiency conductive dopants to provide sufficient pathways for electrons and Li+ ions. Second, they act as flexible matrices to immobilize TiO2(B) nanosheets and thus prevent them from aggregation. Last but not least, they can make a substantial capacity contribution. TiO2(B) nanosheets, on the other hand, function not only as a major active material to achieve high structural stability and excellent cyclability, but also as spacers to isolate the pristine carbon nanomaterials from agglomeration. Benefiting from a remarkable synergistic effect, these two nanohybrids exhibit superior electrochemical lithium storage performance, particularly high-rate performance, delivering reversible capacities of 573 and 536 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1, and 371 and 349 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1, respectively.

The composite, consisting of three-dimensional interconnected carbon foam anchored with two-dimensional ZnO NMs, was directly used as an anode of a lithium-ion battery without additional additives. The large surface area and high porosity of the carbon foam lead to a high ZnO loading of 3-4 mg cm-2. The flexibility of the ZnO NMs, effective electronic and ionic transport throughout the three-dimensional composite structure, and capacity from the carbon foam enhance the areal capacity and stability of the composite.

The main principle of PCMs facilities to reduce significantly the energy consumption in the building industry of the future is based on the ability of thermo-active heat exchangers to absorb and later to dissipate into the surroundings excessive heat which can be easily obtained from renewable sources (e.g. solar energy, geothermal heat, etc.) directly in a building or in its immediate vicinity. Smart interior tiling and furnishing systems can provide high energy efficiency by stabilizing the room temperature at a level ensuring sufficient thermal comfort basically governed by the thermal conductivity and heat exchange area between ceiling (respectively also wall and floor if necessary) heat exchangers (radiators) and the heat storage medium in the form of PCMs. Unfortunately, most conventional building materials, e.g. aerated concrete, bricks, gypsum, ceramic tiles, etc. are particularly characterized by very low thermal conductivity, which disadvantages them to be used for these purposes. However, highly porous metallic material such as aluminium foam prepared by powder metallurgy [10, 11] is on the contrary excellently heat conductive, which predisposes it to be used for lightweight design of supporting structure of very energy efficient indoor as well as outdoor thermo-active heat exchangers for building industry of the future.

Here we synthesize open helmet-like carbon skeletons, carbon nanohelmets (CNHs), which preserve all advantages of hollow structures but also fully utilize the inner walls of carbon. As an example, the as-fabricated NiO/CNH anode exhibits high reversible capacity, excellent cycling stability and superior rate properties in lithium-ion batteries. These remarkable performances are attributed to the ingenious helmet-like structures, which provide a large amount of active sites for Li+ insertion/extraction from the inner walls of carbon; buffer the large volume change of NiO during charging/discharging effectively with the open structure; and reduce the internal resistance significantly due to excellent contact between NiO nanoparticles and carbon.

However, mechanistic exploration of metal ion doping in Na3V2(PO4)3, which is essential for the design and optimization of metal ion doping, is indistinct. To achieve an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of metal ion doping, Li ion doped Na3-xLixV2(PO4)3/C (x = 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0) compounds are synthesized. By utilizing DFT, NMR and Rietveld methods, the mechanism of Li/Na ion doping and rearrangement in the Na sites and Na ion insertion/extraction during electrochemical cycles are explored and identified. It is found that during the synthesis process, Li ions are inclined to enter mainly the Na2 sites in Na3V2(PO4)3 when the x value is low, but they will occupy the Na1 and Na2 sites simultaneously when x is high. Meanwhile, Li ions in the as-prepared Na3-xLixV2(PO4)3 compounds are reversibly replaced by Na ions during the idle state, due to the very small energy difference of the exchange between Li and Na ions. Furthermore, it is confirmed that there are more than two Na ions inserted/extracted during the charge-discharge process, resulting in the final extra specific capacity. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Battery storage; Design for testability; Electric batteries; Ion exchange; Lithium; Lithium-ion batteries; Metal ions; Metals; Secondary batteries; Sodium-ion batteries; Charge-discharge process; Design and optimization; Electrochemical cycle; In-depth understanding; Intrinsic property; Rearrangement mechanisms; Specific capacities; Synthesis process; Sodium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042688041

The addition of metal nanoparticles with high catalytic activities can accelerate the reaction between Li2CO3 and carbon during the charge process, but more work is required to accurately describe how metal nanoparticles work in Li-CO2 batteries. In this study, a gel-like film synthesis mechanism method is presented for the preparation of a composite of Cu nanoparticles that are highly dispersed on N-doped graphene (Cu-NG), which acts as an efficient cathode for Li-CO2 batteries. Additionally, Cu-NG can achieve a low overpotential of 0.77 V and has excellent cyclability (50 cycles). It is speculated that superoxide radicals generated from the self-decomposition of Li2CO3 unavoidably corrode electrodes during the charge process. Nevertheless, the surface of the Cu nanoparticles forms a 3-5 nm thick CuO film that protects and stabilizes the cathode during later cycles.

However, the practical applications of these batteries are hindered by their low electronic conductivity and short cycling lifetime. Herein, we present a simple and efficient strategy for improving the performance of Li-S batteries, utilizing excimer ultraviolet radiation to produce a functional C nanofiber (EUV-CNF) interlayer. In the presence of water and oxygen, the above irradiation results in the formation of oxygenated functional groups (e.g., OH and CO) and nanopores on the interlayer surface. Compared to the sulfur cathode with a pristine C nanofiber (CNF) interlayer, that with the EUV-CNF interlayer exhibits a higher capacity of 917 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.2C and a lower average capacity fading per cycle (0.16%). This excellent cycling performance is attributed to the functionalization of the CNF interlayer, which not only improves cathode conductivity but also allows effective trapping of polysulfides within the cathode without hampering Li-ion conductivity. Thus, this work presents a simple, efficient, and environmentally friendly approach to improving the performance of Li-S batteries and thus paves the way to expanding their application scope. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cathodes; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Lithium sulfur batteries; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanofibers; Secondary batteries; Cycling performance; Efficient strategy; Electronic conductivity; Energy storage applications; Functionalizations; Interlayer surface; Li ion conductivities; Theoretical capacity; Sulfur compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041948120

However, some drawbacks of most M-N materials, particularly the existence of unactivated materials caused by low electronic conductivity, poor redox kinetics and insufficient electrolyte penetration, hamper their widespread application to some extent. In this work, these issues were addressed by the rational design of an M-N structure containing hollow carbon nanofibers (HCNFs). Perfectly shaped and hierarchical MnO spheres were grown in situ on the HCNFs (MnO/HCNFs), forming a cherry-like morphology. Of particular note is the role of the HCNFs, which act as electrical ""highways"" through which electrons can travel very quickly to the inside of the hierarchical MnO microspheres without obstruction. As a result, electrochemical tests demonstrated that the MnO/HCNFs exhibited much improved Li-storage properties in terms of high reversible capacity with long-term cycle life (1093.4/987.6 mA h g-1 after 300/800 cycles at 200/2000 mA g-1) and superior rate capability (206.3 mA h g-1 at 6.4 A g-1) in comparison to conventional M-N MnO spheres without HCNFs. Moreover, the realization of good electrochemical performance without nanostructuring in complex metal oxides expands the scope of the HCNF-inserted M-N structure for other materials used in energy storage. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anodes; Carbon; Carbon nanofibers; Electrolytes; Lithium-ion batteries; Manganese oxide; Nanostructures; Complex metal oxides; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical test; Electrolyte penetration; Electronic conductivity; High reversible capacities; Li-storage properties; Micro-nano structures; Manganese compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041185076

Herein, for the first time, a sulfur (S) doped multilayered Ti3C2Tx MXene was prepared by a simple sulfidation treatment of Ti3C2Tx using thiourea as the S source, which shows an increased interlayer spacing and enhanced electrical conductivity. When used as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the S-doped Ti3C2Tx exhibits a high reversible capacity of 183.2 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1, excellent rate capability (121.3 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 and 113.9 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1) and robust long-term cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 138.2 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles at 0.5 A g-1. Notably, the superior sodium storage performance should be attributed to the multilayered morphology, expanded interlayer spacing and enhanced electrical conductivity as well as the high contribution of surface-induced capacitive behavior after S doping, and it outperforms those of reported Ti3C2Tx based electrodes, highlighting the feasibility of the S doping strategy. Most importantly, this work offers a novel approach for smart design and rational fabrication of heteroatom-doped MXenes for energy storage and conversion applications. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Electric conductivity; Electrodes; Sulfur; Capacitive behavior; Electrical conductivity; Energy storage and conversions; High reversible capacities; Reversible capacity; Sodium ion batteries; Specific capacities; Sulfidation treatment; Metal ions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040926695

However, VFG shows limited capacitance owing to poor wettability with electrolytes, which has been a bottleneck for further applications. Herein, we designed and developed an effective strategy, based on rotary plasma etching, to create defects on the side surfaces while simultaneously maintaining the structural integrity of VFG. Rotary plasma etching decreased the contact angle (CA) of VFG from 123° to 34°, compared with conventional vertical etching, which only reduced the CA to 71°. Electrochemical studies demonstrated that VFG samples with a high density of surface defects, introduced by rotary plasma etching, exhibited a high areal capacitance of 1367 μF cm-2 (a volumetric specific capacitance of 137 F cm-3), which was approximately 4 times as large as for pristine VFG-based materials.

However, the practical applications of lithium-sulfur batteries are challenged by several obstacles, including the low sulfur utilization and poor lifespan, which are partly attributed to the shuttle of lithium polysulfides and lithium dendrite growth in working lithium-sulfur batteries. Suppressing lithium dendrite growth is a necessary step not only for a safe and efficient Li metal anode, but also for a high capacity cell with a high Coulombic efficiency. Herein we review the lithium metal anode protection in a polysulfide-rich environment, relative to most reviews on lithium metal anode without considering the effect of lithium polysulfides in lithium metal batteries. Firstly, the importance and dilemma of Li metal anode issues in lithium-sulfur batteries are underscored, aiming to arouse the attentions to Li metal anode protection. Specific attentions are paid to the surface chemistry of Li metal anode in a polysulfide-rich lithium-sulfur battery.

The crystallization behavior, microstructure and thermal stability of nanofiber membranes were analyzed. The HNT/PEI composite nanofiber membranes showed the sufficient porosity and good affinity between the nanofibers and the electrolyte as well as the electrode, which led to a superb saturated electrolyte uptake and conservation rate. Thus, the GPEs involving the HNT/PEI composite nanofiber membranes displayed excellent electrochemical performances, such as high ionic conductivity, adequate lithium-ion transference number, good interfacial stability and cycle performance. In particular, the GPEs based on 1 wt% HNT/PEI nanofiber membranes demonstrated high ionic conductivity of 5.30 × 10− 3 S cm− 1 and low interfacial resistance of 180 Ω.

However, poor electrochemical performance, mainly attributed to polysulfide diffusion, obstructs their practical application. Herein, a simple graphite-modified separator with a preformed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is first fabricated to suppress the polysulfide shuttle. Particularly, the formed SEI film on the graphite surface inhibits the graphite exfoliation caused by co-intercalation of solvents. Thus, the stable graphite layer with a preformed SEI can function as an effective physical barrier to suppress the polysulfide shuttle and enhance the utilization of the trapped active material. As a result, the cell using the graphite-modified separator exhibits a high capacity of 698 mAh g−1 (0.2 C) after 100 cycles with a low capacity decay of 0.13 % per cycle.

Finally, three water storage tanks with different contents of phase change materials, respectively equipped with a circulating water system were established; the time of storing and releasing heat as well as the total amount of heat release were measured at releasing heat temperature of 40 and 45 °C. Results show that the presence of the phase change materials with different melting points can significantly shorten the time of storing heat. An increase in the contents of phase change materials in the tank leads to evident growth of heat release. At 40 °C, the amount of heat release are 21.35, 27.01 and 29.78 MJ at the contents of 0, 11.12% and 19.17% respectively, which are larger than those at 45 °C. The storage tank can reduce the use of electric heating devices and can be used in solar hot water systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Computational fluid dynamics; Phase change materials; Thermal stratification; Water storage tank","Computational fluid dynamics; Heat storage; Melting; Melting point; Phase transitions; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Tanks (containers); Thermal stratification; Water tanks; Waterworks; Circulating water system; Heat performance; Heat release capacities; Phase change process; Simulation calculation; Solar hot water systems; Storage efficiency; Water storage tanks; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035087457

BPC based on potatoes and white radishes are obtained by the carbonization method. The thermal conductivity of the BPC increases with the rising of the carbonization temperature due to the higher graphitization degree. Especially, BPC calcined at 1300 °C for 2 h resulted in the optimum PEG supporting matrix candidate, showing an attractive honeycomb-like microstructure. Calcination above 1300 °C results in the destruction of the shape. BPC/PEG c-PCMs are synthesized via a vacuum impregnation approach. PEG equally distributed in the matrix material with a mass fraction of 85.36% approximately and it could keep its morphological stability after heating at 80 °C for 40 h. Moreover, the highest thermal conductivity is 4.5 W/m K, which is about 10 times higher than the pristine PEG. Furthermore, no chemical interaction is found between the PEG and BPC. The melting and solidifying temperature, and enthalpy not vary upon a 200 thermal cycles test. This confirms the excellent chemical and structure stability for c-PCMs, which are within the most promising materials in the area of building heat preservation by being clean, energy-saving and recycled materials. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biological porous carbon; Honeycomb-like structure; PEG; Shape stabilization; Thermal conductivity reinforcement","Biological materials; Calcination; Carbonization; Chemical stability; Energy conservation; Heat storage; Historic preservation; Honeycomb structures; Phase change materials; Polyethylene glycols; Porous materials; Carbonization methods; Carbonization temperatures; Enhanced thermal conductivity; Graphitization degree; High thermal conductivity; Honeycomblike structures; Morphological stability; Porous carbons; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034117064

In this paper, novel composites structure of carbon coated MnO anchored on reduced graphene oxides sheets (C@MRGO) are fabricated by a two-step hydrothermal and following heat treatment process. The prepared C@MRGO exhibits a superior performance of 1178, and 665 mAh g−1 at 100 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. Comparison study finds that this novel structure greatly improved the conversion reaction and adsorption capacity of MnO particles. Further study shows that two different carbons both promote the lithium storage process from a different perspective. Typically, graphene greatly improves conductivity and controls the crystallization and growth of MnO particles, while carbon coating could provide a good elastic restricted body to effectively keep the integrity of the SEI film, inhibited volume expansion and make the conversion reaction reversible. In addition, carbon coating adsorbs much Li+ to achieve higher capacity, due to the nature adsorption properties of carbon materials. The design of using different carbon to enhance MnO electrode is believed to bring inspiration to the structural construction in other transitional metal oxide systems for superior performance of energy storage. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Carbon composites; Li-ion batteries; MnO; Structural design","Adsorption; Anodes; Carbon carbon composites; Coatings; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Film growth; Graphene; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Manganese compounds; Manganese oxide; Metals; Structural design; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption properties; Carbon composites; Composites structures; Crystallization and growths; Heat treatment process; Reduced graphene oxides; Transitional metal oxide; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034072117

This method results in corrosion of the road infrastructures and damage to surrounding vegetation. A renewable alternative method for anti-icing the road surface is to use a Hydronic Heating Pavement (HHP). The HHP consists of embedded pipes in the road. A fluid as thermal energy carrier circulates through the pipe. The energy is harvested in summer and saved in seasonal thermal energy storages. The harvested energy, as the only source of energy, is released in winter for snow/ice melting. The aim of this study is to investigate the anti-icing performance of the HHP system during cold periods. A two-dimensional numerical model was developed to investigate how different design options, such as distance between the pipes, affect the efficiency of the HHP systems. The annual required energy for anti-icing and remaining hours of the slippery conditions on the road surface were numerically calculated using a finite element model. The numerical model was validated for two cases: (i) for a road without pipes using a one year measured data of an existing road and (ii) for a road with embedded pipes using an analytical solution. The validation results for a road without pipes showed that the mean annual temperature difference of the road surface is 0.28 °C with standard deviation of 3.53 °C between the measured data and numerical calculation. The validation results for the road with embedded pipes showed that the maximum relative error associated with the thermal resistance between the pipes and surface is less than 1% between the numerical model and the analytical solution. In order to investigate the anti-icing performance of the HHP system, the climate data from Östersund, an area in middle of Sweden, were selected. The results revealed that the anti-icing performance of the HHP system improves when the pipes are placed closer, the depth of embedded pipes is reduced, large pipe sizes are used and when the road surface has a lower emissivity value. Among all options, the distance between pipes has the most significant effect on improving the anti-icing performance, so changing the pipe distances from 400 mm to 50 mm results in approximately four times shorter hours of the slippery conditions on the road surface. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-icing; Asphalt concrete; Embedded pipes; Heating pavement; Required energy","Analytical models; Asphalt concrete; Finite element method; Heat storage; Hot water heating; Numerical models; Pavements; Temperature; Thermal energy; Transportation; Anti-icing; Maximum relative errors; Mean annual temperatures; Numerical calculation; Required energy; Road infrastructures; Standard deviation; Two dimensional numerical models; Roads and streets; asphalt; concrete structure; heating; low temperature; numerical model; pavement; pipe; road construction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034038269

Because of environmental issues, utilizing a gasoline-powered internal combustion engine in a PHEV is not an optimal solution. This paper provides a better solution by replacing the internal combustion engine with a small-size photovoltaic (PV) module mounted horizontally on the roof of the PHEV, and so this study proposes a novel battery/PV hybrid power source to be utilized in PHEVs.

A prototype of the battery/PV hybrid power source has been constructed, and experimental verifications are presented that explicitly demonstrate utilizing the PV module adds 13.4 km to the cruising range of a PHEV with the weight of 1880 kg in a normal operation of the PHEV during two sunny days, and provides higher power efficiency (91.1%) and speed (121 km/h).

The fast electrons transfer from YD to GO and the low binding energy occurred in GO@YD nanohybrid suggest that the nanohybrid possesses remarkable electrochemical properties. However, the inner electroactivity of insoluble YD on GO could be aroused only by combining cationic surfactant of tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB). Therefore, the GO@YD nanohybrid encapsulated by TOAB was firstly modified on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to fabricate the TOAB/GO@YD/GCE, which was then electrochemically reduced to obtain the fabricated sensor (TOAB/ERGO@YD/GCE). The sensor was employed to sense ascorbic acid (AA) and it showed a high sensitivity of 13.58 μA mM−1, a wide linear concentration from 1.33 μM to 1.46 mM (R = 0.998), and a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.28 μM. The sensor not only showed high selectivity but also exhibited excellent operational and storage stability due to the hydrophobicity of TOAB. The great potential of the TOAB/ERGO@YD/GCE for practical and reliable AA analysis in the fields of food analysis, clinical tests, and the pharmaceutical industry suggests that the electron mediator of YD combined with the electron accelerator of ERGO and the electron rouser of TOAB possesses special advantages for fabricating non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ascorbic acid; Electrochemical sensor; Graphene; Porphyrin","Ascorbic acid; Binding energy; Carbon; Cationic surfactants; Chemical bonds; Density functional theory; Dyes; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Electrons; Glass membrane electrodes; Graphene; Hydrogen bonds; Nanostructured materials; Organic acids; Porphyrins; Fabricated sensors; Functionalized graphene; Glassy carbon electrodes; Limit of detection; Linear concentration; Pharmaceutical industry; Spectroscopic technique; Tetraoctylammonium bromide; Electrochemical sensors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032802674

For the siligraphenes studied here, Li2O is the final discharge product. Among them, the single-layered SiC (SL-SiC) exhibits potential as a suitable cathode catalyst due to the considerably low overpotential values during discharge and charge process. That is, 0.73 V for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and 1.87 V for oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

On the upper-level a plant MPC takes care of the slow dynamics of a plant. On the lower-level a MILP-MPC based on a MILP optimization model of an HVAC system optimizes the HVAC operation. The MILP-MPC considers the first few samples of the control trajectory of the plant MPC as its reference trajectory. It minimizes power consumption and switching of the HVAC. Thereby it has to obey constraints, consider component characteristics by nonlinearity approximation, and solve a unit commitment problem. The fact that the plant MPC can be based on an almost arbitrary plant model and the MILP model of the MILP-MPC can represent a variety of different HVAC systems unifies HVAC control. Features and results are presented in case studies: The first case study shows that state of the art HVAC operation is outperformed even if the predictive capability is not used. The second case study demonstrates that temperature, CO2 level, and humidity can be controlled simultaneously in a decoupled fashion. The third case study reveals that if also the lower-level MILP-MPC oversees the latency periods of HVAC components optimal switching is achieved. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","AC; air condition; CHP; coefficient of performance; combined heat and power; COP; degrees of freedom; DOF; finite state machine; FSM; HB; heat exchanger network; heat pump; heater battery; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; HEN; HP; HVAC; IDA; indoor air; linear programming; LP; MILP; MIMO; MINLP; mixed-integer linear programming; mixed-integer nonlinear programming; model predictive control; MPC; multi-input multi-output; NLP; nonlinear programming; ODA; outdoor air; PID; proportional integral derivative; pulse width modulation; PWM; QP; quadratic program; radial basis function; RBF; RCA; recirculation air; refrigeration machine; RM; SAF; SOS-2; special ordered set of type 2; SUP; supply air; supply air fan; TES; thermal energy storage; ULF; Ultra Low Floor; vapor compression plant; VCP","Actinium; Air conditioning; Coefficient of performance; Cogeneration plants; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Finite automata; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Humidity control; HVAC; Linear programming; MIMO systems; Model predictive control; Nonlinear programming; Optical pumping; Power generation; Predictive control systems; Proportional control systems; Pulse width modulation; Quadratic programming; Tellurium; Thermal energy; Two term control systems; Vapor compression refrigeration; Voltage control; Combined heat and power; Heat exchanger network; Heat pumps; heater battery; Indoor air; Low-floor; MILP; MINLP; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Multi input multi output; Ordered set; Outdoor air; Proportional integral derivatives; Quadratic programs; Radial basis functions; Recirculations; SOS-2; Vapor compression plant; Integer programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030867245

The composites were prepared by the infiltration method, and different zeolites were tested. Water sorption of composites in a constant temperature &amp; humidity chamber was carried out first, and then the hydration of composites in a macro-scale reactor was performed. Special efforts were devoted to reveal the effects of various reaction conditions including temperature, relative humidity (RH) and air flow rate on the hydration performance of composites. The results showed that the prepared zeolite-MgSO4 composites had larger hydration ability than pure zeolites, and zeolite 13X-MgSO4 showed the best performance. Both the saturation adsorption amount and the hydration rate could be effectively increased by increasing the RH or the air temperature. However, the hydration ability of composites decreased significantly when the air temperature was above 50 °C. The air temperature lift during the reactor heat discharge was found to increase with the flow rate or RH of fed moist air.

This interest was initiated when the adverse effects of fossil fuel on the environment such as greenhouse gas emission and global warming were unfolded. Multidisciplinary researches are being carried out in the research laboratories to provide effective clean energy solutions. Nanofluid, a colloidal mixture of nanoparticles in the base fluid, e.g., water, ethylene glycol, oil, offers efficiency improvements in many clean energy applications due to the improvement in its thermophysical property. In this chapter, use of nanofluid in various clean energy and energy efficiency applications is reviewed. Solar energy, the dominant clean energy source, is a potential field of application where nanofluid can be employed. Solar thermal collectors and solar water heaters are the ideal candidates for utilization of nanofluid for improving solar to thermal energy conversion. Thermal storage system employs phase change material (PCM) for storing thermal energy, and nanofluid may be added to the PCM for enhanced performance. Nanofluid can be used in carefully designed heat exchangers for extracting energy from geothermal resources. This mixture can also be used in waste heat collector to improve efficiency for its thermophysical property causing a heat transfer enhancement. Adding nanoparticles to the refrigerants improves the heat transfer characteristics of refrigerants and improves the performance of the refrigeration system from an energy efficiency perspective. However, there are challenges associated with nanofluid which are needed to overcome for optimal performance of the working fluid. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.",,"Collector efficiency; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Fossil fuels; Geothermal fields; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Heat transfer performance; Mixtures; Nanoparticles; Phase change materials; Refrigerants; Refrigeration; Research laboratories; Solar energy; Sols; Thermal energy; Thermodynamic properties; Waste heat; Clean energy technology; Efficiency improvement; Energy efficiency and utilizations; Heat transfer characteristics; Heat Transfer enhancement; Multi-disciplinary research; Solar thermal collector; Thermal storage system; Nanofluidics",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030658788

In reservoir evaluating processes, it is very hard to precise the unknown reservoir parameters. This paper, through reviewing the disadvantages of EGS reservoir evaluation methods and parameters estimation methods in previous studies, found that the reservoir evaluation based on probability model is inaccurate. It is also found that there is less previous studies on resources evaluation by solving inverse problem of heat conduction, while the used methods for solving inverse heat conduction problem (including Tikhonov regularization, Gradient Optimization and Decentralized Fuzzy Inference) have their drawbacks. Then, we proposed a novel fuzzy inversion model for reservoir evaluation. This three-dimensional fuzzy inverting model, including three main strategies of heat transfer direct problem modeling, inverse problem modeling and experimental validation, is built in terms of thermal physical parameters of reservoir. The fuzzy inversion model is able to compute the entire geothermal field temperature, establish the quantitative relationship between heat storage quantity and reservoir thermal property, and evaluate EGS heat reservoir. The proposed framework in this study can be used as a guidance for geothermal researchers and companies to build an evaluation tool of energy resources of EGS. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Enhanced geothermal system (EGS); Evaluation method; Fuzzy inference methods; Inverse heat conduction problem","Energy policy; Energy resources; Fuzzy inference; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Heat conduction; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Natural resources exploration; Problem solving; Thermal pollution; Enhanced geothermal systems; Environmental pollutions; Evaluation method; Experimental validations; Fuzzy inference method; Inverse heat conduction problem; Thermal physical parameters; Tikhonov regularization; Inverse problems",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029836464

Mn0.8Co0.2CO3/graphene delivers high initial charge capacities of 1033 mAh g−1. And after 120 cycles, charge/discharge capacities of 737/735 mAh g−1 are maintained at 0.2 A g−1. Even at 2 A g−1, the composite can still deliver high charge/discharge capacities of 500/501 mAh g−1. It is promising to obtain carbonate/graphene anode materials rapidly through such ultrafast solvothermal process assisted by microwave for application. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon materials; Composite materials; Energy storage and conversion; Lithium-ion battery; Solvothermal; Ultrafast synthesis","Anodes; Carbon; Composite materials; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Graphene; Impurities; Ions; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Secondary batteries; Anode material for lithium ion batteries; Carbon material; Charge/discharge capacities; Energy storage and conversions; Li-storage properties; Solvothermal; Solvothermal process; Ultrafast synthesis; Microwave materials processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029440577

The developed methodology models the implementation of solar thermal systems to replace non-renewable systems for the domestic hot water supply, and a demand response strategy to manage the electric backup required from the grid, in days of low solar radiation. The implementation of this system is compared between 10 isolated islands with different scales and energy systems in order to identify the potential energy savings introduced by solar thermal systems with demand response capabilities under different conditions. The results show larger savings for small islands, where the load pattern is essentially residential, especially for those with more than 25% share of renewable electricity. Regarding bigger islands, where the services and industry sectors dominate the load pattern, this implementation shows little technical and economic impact. In terms of environmental impact, this methodology shows that the combination of solar thermal systems with demand response programs may result, on average, in less 88% CO2 emissions than using non-renewable DHW systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Islands; Isolated systems; Renewable energy; Thermal storage","Energy conservation; Heat storage; Potential energy; Renewable energy resources; Solar heating; Water supply; Demand response; Islands; Isolated systems; Renewable energies; Thermal storage; Environmental impact; assessment method; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cost analysis; demand analysis; economic impact; electricity; energy budget; energy conservation; environmental impact; equipment; nonrenewable resource; numerical model; potential energy; renewable resource; small island state; solar power; solar radiation; thermal power; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029426046

Recently, the entransy theory has been successfully used to optimize various steady-state heat transfer processes. Nevertheless, it is still an open question whether this theory can be utilized in transient cases. Here, we examined the applicability of the entransy analyses on the one-dimensional transient heat conduction process. It was found that the entransy dissipation rate can neither derive the transient governing equation nor correspond to the optimal result in the transient optimization problem. Therefore, an extended entransy dissipation rate was defined as the convolution integral of heat flux and negative temperature gradient. The total extended entransy dissipation rate over the time and space domain can correspond to the optimal result of the transient optimization problem. Additionally, Fourier transform was used to convert the transient problem from the time domain into the frequency domain, and the total entransy dissipation rate in the frequency domain will give a convenient optimization criterion that the temperature gradient field should be spatially uniform to reach the shortest characteristic time. Also, the inverse Fourier transform of the entransy dissipation rate in the frequency will be the extended entransy dissipation rate in the time domain. Finally, these findings were used to optimize a practical transient heat conduction problem for a solid thermal energy storage unit. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Entransy dissipation; Entropy generation; Monte Carlo method; Optimization; Transient heat conduction","Entropy; Frequency domain analysis; Heat conduction; Heat flux; Heat storage; Heat transfer coefficients; Inverse problems; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Temperature; Thermal gradients; Time domain analysis; Entransy dissipation; Entropy generation; Heat transfer optimizations; Negative temperature gradients; Steady-state heat transfer; Temperature gradient fields; Transient governing equations; Transient heat conduction; Heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029283918

A serial of LiNi x Co 1-2x Mn x O 2 samples were prepared via a solid state reaction and subsequently characterized by XRD in conjunction with structural refinement, XPS depth profiling, and AC impedance spectroscopy. Slightly different expansion rates are observed for lattice parameters (a and c/3) with varying of Ni content, which is attributed to the increase of average metal-ion radius and an increase of e g electron that enhances the columbic repulsion between transition metal and oxygen atoms. XPS depth profiling results show that surface composition is significantly deviated from bulk, in which Ni and Mn atoms tend to enrich in the surface region, while Co element is relatively deficient. Further, surface element segregation is alleviated by the increase of Ni/Mn content.
