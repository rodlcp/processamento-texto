However, the adoption of such platforms in many high-volume markets (e.g, wireless handhelds) is limited by concerns about their performance and energy-efficiency. This paper addresses the problem of enabling the use of configurable platforms in domains where custom approaches have traditionally been used. We introduce Dynamic Platform Management, a methodology for customizing a configurable general-purpose platform at run-time, to help bridge the performance and energy efficiency gap with custom approaches. The proposed technique uses a software layer that detects time-varying processing requirements imposed by a set of applications, and dynamically optimizes architectural parameters and platform components. Dynamic platform management enables superior application performance, more efficient utilization of platform resources, and improved energy efficiency, as compared to a statically optimized platform, without requiring any modifications to the underlying hardware. We illustrate dynamic platform management by applying it to the design of a dual-access UMTS/WLAN security processing system, implemented on a general-purpose configurable platform. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to a statically optimized design (on the same platform), the proposed techniques enable upto 33% improvements in security processing throughput, while achieving 59% savings in energy consumption (on average).",,"Dynamic voltage scaling (DVC); System on a chip (SOc); Algorithms; Buffer storage; Computer software; Data storage equipment; Energy efficiency; Hand held computers; Marketing; Microprocessor chips; Optimization; Throughput; Application specific integrated circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347409177

In deep sub-micron technology, the subthreshold leakage power is becoming the dominant fraction of the total power consumption of those caches. In this paper, we present optimization techniques to reduce the leakage power of on-chip caches assuming that there are multiple threshold voltages, VTH's, available. First, we show a cache leakage optimization technique that examines the trade-off between access time and leakage power by assigning distinct VTH's to each of the four main cache components - address bus drivers, data bus drivers, decoders, and SRAM cell arrays with sense-amps. Second, we show optimization techniques to reduce the leakage power of L1 and L2 on-chip caches without affecting the average memory access time. The key results are: 1) 2 VTH's are enough to minimize leakage in a single cache; 2) if L1 size is fixed, increasing the L2 size can result in much lower leakage without reducing average memory access time; 3) if L2 size is fixed, reducing L1 size can result in lower leakage without loss of the average memory access time; and 4) smaller L1 and larger L2 caches than are typical in today's processors result in significant leakage and dynamic power reduction without affecting the average memory access time.",,"Average memory access time (AMAT); Microarchitectural simulation; Benchmarking; CMOS integrated circuits; Computer simulation; Energy dissipation; Leakage currents; Microprocessor chips; Optimization; Performance; Process control; Static random access storage; Transistors; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346778725

The first is that the energy well depth of the storage states needs to be large enough so that thermal agitation will not disturb the stored information in the memory's lifetime. Secondly, the signal level from the memory cell must be large enough so that thermal noise and other disturbances do not corrupt the output signal. This chapter focuses the limits in regard to magnetic memories; they apply to all other memories. Ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt, and nickel are ferromagnetic because the lattice spacing is just right so that a quantum effect termed ''exchange"" makes it favorable for the spins of the outer shell electrons from one atom to align with the outer electrons spins from neighboring atoms giving rise to a region called a domain in which all of the net magnetization points in one direction. In a typical bulk material, there are many random domains and the magnetization in all of the domains only gets aligned when a large field is applied.

The document also provides methods to estimate upper-bound values of the through thickness residual stress distribution for a range of common weld joint configurations. The present paper presents results of analyses where approaches to modify the R6 Option 1 or 2 failure assessment diagrams (FADs) for loss of crack tip constraint pertaining to primary and non-uniform residual stress have been applied. The modified FAD were formulated for probabilistic fracture mechanics analyses of semi-elliptical surface cracks located at transverse deck welds of Floating Production, Storage and Off-loading (FPSO) vessels designed to operate in the North Sea. The objective was to study the influence on the failure probability of modifying the FAD for constraint and allowing for non-uniform residual stress. Another objective was to study the influence of constraint correction on the combined fatigue and fracture failure probability for the vessels subjected to wave loading.Material and weld tensile properties and fracture toughness distributions for input to the probabilistic fracture mechanics analyses were obtained from testing of welded panels prepared using welding procedures for actual FPSO fabrication. The loading conditions were derived based on North Sea wave data pertaining to the offshore field where the FPSO is operating. The stresses were obtained from global FE analysis and fitted Weibull long-term and extreme value distributions.The results of the analyses demonstrate clearly the importance of correcting for crack tip constraint pertaining to both primary and secondary stress and to allow for non-uniform residual stress for shallow surface flaws of known crack heights. However, in combination with fatigue crack growth the effects become less prominent as the failure probability is governed by the uncertainty in the parameters of the crack growth relationship and the long-term stress distribution.","Crack Tip Constraint; Fatigue Crack Growth; Floating Production Off-loading and Storage vessels; Probabilistic Fracture Mechanics; Residual Stress; Unstable Fracture; Welded Joints","Crack tip constraint; Crack propagation; Fatigue of materials; Finite element method; Fracture mechanics; Loading; Metallographic microstructure; Naval vessels; Probability; Residual stresses; Stress concentration; Structural analysis; Tensile testing; Weibull distribution; Welds; Production platforms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345170811

Up to six times before harvest, trees of 'Conference' pears were sprayed with boron, alone or in combination with calcium. Following harvest, fruit were stored at -0.5 °C, 5% CO2 + 2% O2 CA-conditions for 5 months. During this time, the pears were monitored for physiological disorders, fruit quality, respiration, and energy charge of fruit tissue. Results showed that control fruit were more affected by internal browning than those treated with boron.

Moreover, at harvest time, these fruit were greener, firmer and had less titratable acidity than control fruit. Boron-treated fruit respired at lower rates harvest and during the entire storage period. However, the energy status, expressed as ATP:ADP-ratio was higher in boron-treated fruit.

In this paper, we present a novel technique to reduce register requirements as well as their dynamic and static power dissipation that is based on delaying the dispatch of instructions while minimizing its impact on performance. The proposed technique outperforms previous schemes in both performance and power savings. With only 1.77% IPC loss, the mechanism achieves more than 13% dynamic and 15% static extra power savings in the integer rename buffers and more than 9% dynamic and 10% static extra power savings in the FP rename buffers. Significant power savings are also achieved if the processor uses a physical register file for both committed and non-committed values instead of rename buffers. Additionally the register requirements are reduced by more than 18% and 13% for integer and FP programs respectively.",,"Computational complexity; Design for testability; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Microelectronic processing; Dynamic power dissipation; Multiple banked register files; Static power dissipation; Microprocessor chips",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344982159

In addition, its power density is high, due to its small area. Consequently, reducing power consumption of TLB is important for both high-end and low-end systems. While a large TLB might be preferable from the performance angle, it can also lead to excessive dynamic energy consumption. This paper focuses on data TLB (dTLB), and proposes an architectural solution to this problem which is based on dynamically resizing the dTLB considering application execution behavior.

At the academic level, it is possible to introduce students to issues related to renewable energy. This paper discusses the effort one student has put in, as part of a thesis, to develop an economically feasible, self-sufficient, renewable energy system for a residential home in the Great Lakes region. The design of the system sought to use both wind and solar energy to supply energy to the home. The student was able to consider effects such as the design and capability of the wind turbine and solar panels to determine whether the design would be viable economically. After deciding that the initial system design would be too expensive, the student then considered other options to reduce the cost of the renewable energy system while still providing the necessary electrical systems that are used in a modern home. This included the development of a survey that was distributed to faculty and staff. The survey was used to determine the critical electrical loads that families in the Great Lakes region would require throughout the year.

The guidance scheme presented is developed in two parts, the kappa guidance section and the touchdown trajectory section. The kappa guidance section begins at the TAEM interface and continues until 475m slant range before the desired touchdown point. The touchdown trajectory section begins at the 475m slant range interface and continues until the RLV reaches the desired touchdown point. The guidance algorithm for the kappa guidance section is an approximate analytic solution to the nonlinear optimization of minimizing the final velocity of the trajectory while meeting a constraint on the final flight path angle. The assumptions used to develop the approximate analytic solution begin to degrade this guidance algorithm's performance near the touchdown point; therefore, the touchdown trajectory section was incorporated into the guidance scheme. This guidance algorithm uses linear quadratic regulator control theory to find the change in angle of attack from the nominal that produces a desired touchdown rate at the touchdown point. Both guidance algorithms have ""trajectory shaping parameters"" which help meet the final constraints for each section. These parameters have a relationship with both velocity and flight path angle which is approximated by neural networks. The combination of these two guidance algorithms yield a wide range of allowable initial conditions that an RLV can have and still be able to land with a desirable touchdown rate at the touchdown point. © 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Active schemes which offer the prospect of greater performance can be complicated in implementation and knowledge required as well as being prone to stability issues. Use of sensoriactuators, single piezoelectrics operating simultaneously as sensors and actuators, for collocated feedback control eliminates the performance limiting effects of the patch capacitance and guarantees a minimum phase system.

The inherent difficulty of placing a spacecraft into orbit requires a payload mass as small as possible. The application of Micro Power Generation technology to space propulsion systems will provide increased orbit and stationkeeping capabilities at possible lower cost. Replacing a single large mass, high power satellite with a series of smaller platforms can lower the system cost. New generation spacecraft and satellites are getting smaller and require micro-propulsion systems for all aspects of their operations. A growing trend of miniaturization in electro and mechanical engineering devices (micro transmitters, embedded micro sensors/actuators, small robots, wrist communicators, indestructible jet engines, micro airborne sensor/communicators, micro thermal-chemical power systems etc.) has stimulated new prospects for thermal-fluid scientists in the field of micro-power generation in the watts range. The interest in chemical energy sources as alternatives to electrochemical batteries for MEMS applications lies in the potential to significantly increase energy storage densities. The development of micropropuls ion systems with associated combustors for micro electricity-generation that utilize liquid fuel, poses major challenges for fuel injection, mixing, combustion, and chemical reactor systems. A microspacecraft with high-accuracy station-keeping and attitude control capabilities needs to have a low mass and a small impulse. Liquid propellants with high energy density are capable of meeting these goals. © 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Heat leak or heat transfer in cryogenic storage tanks causes temperature stratification and a pressure build up in the vapor or ullage space. An axial-jet pump is used to mix sub-cooled fluid from the bottom of the tank with thermally stratified fluid, cooling the liquidvapor interface causing condensation. This has been successfully modeled using a commercial code with modification to user subroutines. The liquid phase is modeled using CFX-4 code with modified user routines to calculate transient boundary conditions and heat transfer. The vapor ullage space is modeled using a two-point model. This allows for heat transfer calculations across the ullage rather than using a single lumped model. At each time step the liquid solution is iterated until convergence. Then inter-phase mass transport is equated to the difference in heat transfer occurring at the liquid and vapor interface divided by the energy needed for phase change. Two geometries have been used. Both geometries used body fitted 2-D cylindrical grids. The first is a small cylindrical tank with hemispherical ends. Experimental data was used to initialize the temperature field and modeled ullage. At computational zero time flow from the mixer was initiated. The flow rises then impinges on the liquid-vapor interface and spreads outward. The mixer-jet flow entrains surrounding flow forming an upper vortex. With time this flow grows in size to take up the whole tank. Experimental temperature data at the bottom of the tank also showed low temperature until significant mixing had occurred. The second tank is a larger ellipsoidal tank tested at NASA Plumbrook. Predictions of pressure reduction were done using selfpressurized data and externally pressurized tanks. A run done using self-pressurized data produced the best predictions.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894723612

The lamination consists of a paraffin impregnated porous graphitic core (the energy storage volume) encapsulated between rigid graphite/epoxy composite skins. Heat storage is via solid-liquid phase transition of the paraffin. Stacked laminations form a sandwich structure. A thermal response model shows that the graphite foam is an effective thermal conductivity enhancer to the imbedded paraffin. It will effectively immobilize liquid paraffin so that the thermal storage process will be unaffected by up to a 10g load. Furthermore, the foam can accommodate the relatively large specific volume change that accompanies paraffin phase transition. However, it does so at the expense of reduced thermal performance. Structural analysis shows that graphitic foam has a low strength and elasticity modulus, and the material displays tension-compression asymmetry. The paraffin fill is shown to increase the compressive ultimate strength and elasticity modulus. The use of carbon fiber/epoxy skin greatly enhances the overall strength of the structure. © 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The hydrogen storage can simultaneously be used for power smoothing and provide clean fuel for vehicles. The method is based on optimization of an objective function that takes into account electricity market conditions and penalties for not providing hydrogen and oxygen to the loads. Three case studies where wind is the primary energy source have been analyzed. Simulation results show that the hydrogen storage makes it possible to reduce wind power fluctuations, and at the same time take advantage of hourly variations in the electricity price. In isolated operation mode, utilization of excess heat from the fuel cell leads to a significant reduction of the usage of back-up generator. The results indicate that it is valuable to use optimization techniques for operation of hydrogen storage in connection with stochastic energy sources. © 2003 IEEE.","Energy management; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage; Linear programming; Model predictive control; Operating strategies; Renewable energy; Wind energy","Back-up generators; Clean fuel; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Energy source; Hydrogen economy; Isolated operation; Objective functions; Operating strategy; Operation strategy; Optimal operation; Optimization techniques; Power fluctuations; Power smoothing; Primary energy source; Renewable energies; Stochastic inputs; Energy management; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Linear programming; Model predictive control; Optimization; Predictive control systems; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Hydrogen storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956224771

It is targeting a considerable reduction of CO2 emission by improvement of the solar energy system efficiency and the extended utilization of the solar energy using reversible chemical reactions as energy storage. Although solar energy is considered environmentally friendly, the whole life cycle of a solar energy production has to be evaluated. The production targets for the SOLARSTORE system are potentially thousands units. This makes it very important to explore the total environmental impacts caused during its whole life cycle. This work employs Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), an ISO 14040 based technique for evaluating the total environmental impacts associated with a product, to analyse the total environmental impacts of SOLARSTORE system during its whole life cycle. The standard LCA methodology has been extended and modified to cope successfully with this task. The LCA results show the total environmental impacts to achieve 1 GJ energy by using SOLARSTORE system: global warming potential ranging in 6.3-10 kg CO2, acidification potential in 46.6-70 g SO2, eutrophication in 2.1-3.1 g phosphate and photochemical oxidant in 0.99-1.5 g C2H4. The raw material acquisition processes contribute 99% to the total environmental impacts. A LCA based comparison has been made analysing the total environmental impacts of a traditional solar heating system, a traditional fossil fuel heating system and SOLARSTORE system. It shows that SOLARSTORE provides a better solution for reduction of negative environmental impacts by using solar energy. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The excellent properties of amorphous carbon films termed diamond-like carbon (DLC) have turned to be suitable for this application. The mechanical testing of these ultra-thin and super-hard films is a challenge for the available test methods. Efforts have been done to adapt the laser-acoustic method to the requirements of testing ultra-thin films. The laser-acoustic method yields the Young's modulus, revealing the effect of varying bonding structure of the material, porosity and other micro-defects, including insufficient adhesion. For diamond-like carbon material, Young's modulus correlates with the fraction of tetrahedral sp 3-bonds causing its high hardness and excellent wear behavior.

The electricity demand in Peninsular Malaysia experienced an average annual growth rate of about 13% to 14% in the early and mid-nineties prior to the outbreak of the financial crisis in 1997. Subsequent to the financial crisis, there was a substantial drop in the electricity demand for the years 1997/98 and 1998/99. The demand for electricity then rapidly increased by more than 11% in 1999/2000. However, a number of independent power producers (IPP) have already decided to defer the construction of their proposed power plants due to problems resulting from the financial crisis. This leads to the reduction in the reserve margin of generation capacity and constraint on the system operation. To ensure the system reliability, the decision was made to do cloud seeding to enhance rainfall over the Temengor's catchment as a short-term measure. The purpose is to fill up the Temengor reservoir with water and to raise its water level to as close to the full supply level as possible, so that there is readily available energy reserve from the incremental water storage.

Critical areas were identified near the bolt's holes and, although the simulated strength was considered safe under normal operation (about 3000 RPM), it was conceived that failure due to fracture under extreme conditions such as over-speed may occur. Crack growth at these critical locations near the disk's bolt's holes was considered in an elastic fracture analysis. For three crack positions the maximum stress intensity factor (Kmax) was calculated by conducting separate simulations for different crack lengths. The material fracture resistance was compared to the FE results using an R-curve procedure and the critical crack lengths to cause fracture were obtained.

The other part is heating and cooling system. It doesn't immediately store the heat after heating, but the cool is directly taken out of soil for cooling in summer by the exchangers. The process of the extracted cool is also that of the thermal storage. When cooling finished, the part also stores the solar heat into soil for heating. The two parts are used together for heating in winter by GSHP and the solar hot water system. Because a lot of heat is taken out of the underground soil for heating and the lost heat is complemented by the solar heat collected in three seasons of the year and by the stored heat for cooling in summer, the temperature of the underground soil is periodically changing in one year. So it can keep thermal balance and this system can operate for the long period (many years).

Future high energy (multi-GeV), high current (hundreds of milli-Amperes) beams would require gigaWatt-class RF systems in conventional linacs - a prohibitively expensive proposition. However, invoking energy recovery [1] alleviates extreme RF power demands; required RF power becomes nearly independent of beam current, which improves linac efficiency and increases cost effectiveness. Furthermore, energy recovering linacs promise efficiencies of storage rings, while maintaining beam quality of linacs: superior emittance and energy spread and short bunches (sub-pico sec.). Finally, energy recovery alleviates shielding, if the beam is dumped below the neutron production threshold. Jefferson Lab has demonstrated its expertise in the field of Energy Recovery Linacs (ERLs) with the successful operation of the Infrared FEL, where 5 mA of average beam current have been accelerated up to 50 MeV and the energy stored in the beam was recovered via deceleration and given back to the RF power source.

During the previous high energy run the RF system performance was not significantly affected by microphonic cavity detuning, since the cavities were operated under strong beam loading with a low loaded quality factor of 2 · 105. However, in low energy CESR-c operation With increased loaded Q-factor the RF system becomes less tolerant to microphonics, especially when two cavities are driven by one klystron. In order to address this potential problem we have studied microphonics in the CESR cavities in detail. Significant improvements have been achieved by reducing major contributions to the detuning.

High-energy (∼3MeV) and intense synchrotron radiation was produced from the wiggler, and scattered photons were generated by the interaction of synchrotron radiation with photon absorber materials. The intense radiation environment in the storage ring tunnel damages accelerator components, such as cable insulators and coils for electromagnets. To suppress such damage, it is necessary to understand the dose distribution and the spectrum of scattered photons near the wiggler. The dose distribution and the spectrum of scattered photons from the photon absorber was measured by thermoluminescent dosimeters (LiF TLD) with lead filters (0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6 mm in thickness). At the same time, alanine dosimeters and GafChromic film (made of polyethylene) were used to measure the dose of photons which exceeded the dynamic range of TLD dosimeters. The results of an experimental data analysis showed that, as expected, photons of energies of several hundred keV were scattered over a wide range.",,"Data reduction; Dosimetry; Electromagnets; Light scattering; Photons; Polyethylenes; Synchrotron radiation; Thermoluminescence; Power density; Radiation angle; Radiation measurement; Superconducting wiggler; Electron ring accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143143273

The beam with a current of up to 100 mA will excite significant higher-order-mode (HOM) power in the superconducting (s.c.) RF cavities with frequencies up to 100 GHz. Strong damping of the HOMs is essential for beam stability and to reduce the HOM losses to a few hundred Watts per meter. To achieve this demanding goal we plan to place RF absorbing material in the beam tubes between the cavities in the linac. However, this will require operating the HOM absorbers at temperatures below 80 K to simplify the thermal transition to the cavities at 2 K with low static losses to 2 K. One possible material candidate is ferrite, as it is used at room temperature in the HOM absorbers in the s.c. CESR cavities. In this paper we present experiments performed to study the RF absorption properties of ferrite at cryogenic temperatures in the frequency range from 1 GHz to 15 GHz.

Typical maximum field in the bending magnets of the modern Booster projects of 1.0-1.4 T results in the large circumference. For 0.27-1.2 GeV full energy Booster injector for the Duke FEL storage ring, recently under design and fabrication, there was an ultimate goal to fit it into existing storage ring room to avoid cost extensive building construction. Therefore, the Booster ring has to be compact, therefore the maximum field in the bending magnets was accepted 1.76 T. With a different level of saturation in the bending magnets, focusing and defocusing quadruples it was not possible to avoid a tune change with the energy rise. However, the ratio of saturation levels for the elements was optimized to avoid crossing of any significant resonance while ramping through the entire energy range. The lattice was simulated for different energies based on the results of 3D calculations of the magnetic elements with the use of MERMAID 3D code.

Top-up mode requires the dedicated use of the entire APS injector system, severely limiting time available for operator training. The APS injector test stand (ITS) is presently configured to operate a ballistic bunch compression (BBC) rf gun, which uses three independently powered and phased rf cavities, and either a thermionic cathode or a photocathode. Operation of the BBC gun requires cavity phasing and input rf power selection analogous to the operation of a high-energy linac. In conjunction with the ITS beamline components (quadrupoles, dipoles, diagnostics, correctors), this provides an effective analog to the APS linac.

IDs have been designed at the CLS and most will be built on site. Magnets and power supplies have been designed to maintain tight control over machine functions, orbit and transverse coupling. The vacuum chamber and the girder system for the ring incorporate modular designs best suited for a compact lattice. Front ends have been designed for all source points including the chicaned IDs. Development of the CLS subsystems has proceeded with a strong emphasis on a ""design-build"" project management style.

More than 30 FEL oscillators are presently operating around the world spanning a wavelength range from the mm region to the ultraviolet using DC and rf linear accelerators and storage rings as electron sources. The characteristics that have driven the development of these sources are the desire for high peak and average power, high micropulse energies, wavelength tunability, timing flexibility, and wavelengths that are unavailable from more conventional laser sources. Substantial user programs have been performed using such sources encompassing medicine, biology, solid state research, atomic and molecular physics, effects of nonlinear fields, surface science, polymer science, pulsed laser vapor deposition, to name just a few. Recently the incorporation of energy recovery systems has permitted extension of the average power capabilities to the kW level and beyond. Moreover the use of collective radiation and Thompson/Compton scattering has produced substantial fluxes of THz radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.

However, the so obtained coupling information often sinks into the noise floor. The signal-to-noise ratio of the coupling information can be greatly enhanced by fitting maps for larger turn numbers N, equal to half the beat period. With the so obtained N-turn map an automated global coupling correction is possible without the need for a tune change.

In the NLC, design constraints place the Main Damping Rings in a parameter regime where intrabeam scattering (IBS) is likely to be a limitation on the emittance, and hence on the final luminosity. It is possible to mitigate the effects of IBS by lengthening the bunch: this may be achieved by redesigning the lattice with higher momentum compaction, or by use of higher harmonic cavities. Here, we consider the latter approach. We estimate the required bunch lengthening that might be needed, outline some appropriate parameters for the harmonic cavities, and discuss some of the effects that might be introduced or exacerbated by the cavities, such as synchronous phase variation along the bunch train.",,"Approximation theory; Colliding beam accelerators; Computer simulation; Damping; Energy dissipation; Harmonic analysis; Particle beam bunching; Particle beams; Scattering; Damping rings; Emittances; Harmonic cavities; Intrabeam scattering (IBS); Storage rings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143127987

Its construction has just begun. The system is for one-turn fast extraction ejecting proton beam from the ring into the extraction septum gap and further deflecting into the ring-to-target beam transport line. The system consists of fourteen high-voltage modulators, their local control and auxiliary systems, and fourteen window frame magnet sections. High-voltage transmission cables will be used for pulse transmission from modulators to their corresponding magnet sections. The high-voltage and high-current pulse has a rise time about 200 ns, a pulse duration about 700 ns, and a current amplitude above 2500 Amp per modulator. The modulator design features a Blumlein Pulse-Forming-Network with ultra-low inductance high energy storage pulsed capacitors, an ultra-fast high-power hollow anode thyratron, a parallel resistor stack for low beam-impedance termination, and a saturable inductor stack for beam current isolation and pulse rise time sharpening. This design is driven by the considerations of low beam loss, high maintainability and reliability. All high voltage modulators will be placed outside the ring tunnel and the system is immune to one-kicker failure. In addition, the enlarged magnet aperture can accept all four working points. The design concept has been successfully proven by the prototype test.

Improved brightness, improved beam stability, higher single-bunch current, more beamlines, and shorter bunches are all of interest to certain user groups. In this paper, we outline some possibilities to meet some of these needs. Presently, the APS has an effective horizontal emittance of 3.0 nm-rad, achieved by allowing dispersion in the straight sections. Top-up allows us to go lower in spite of the poor lifetime, which we could do by adding pole-face windings to the dipoles to reduce the emittance to 1.8 nm-rad. A more dramatic effort would involve shortening the dipoles, which would have the added benefit of increasing the straight-section length from 5 m to 9 m. Beyond this, several much more speculative ideas have been explored. One of these is to use the APS ring as part of an energy recovery linac facility, with single- or multi-turn circulation of a high-brightness linac beam in the existing ring. We present some preliminary simulations of the performance of this option. Another possibility is replacement of the APS storage ring with a next-generation ring capable of ultra-low emittance and making full use of top-up. We present a concept for a facility that promises 75 pm-rad horizontal emittance and 10m-long straight sections.",,"Computer simulation; Dispersions; Electric coils; Electric conductors; Light sources; Natural frequencies; Problem solving; Synchrotron radiation; Thickness measurement; Advanced photon sources (APS); Beam stability; Dipoles; Xtreme photon source (XPS); Elementary particles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143125700

Some of the difficult technical challenges associated with synchrotron light source storage rings are sidestepped by the relatively low beam current and short beam lifetime requirements of a re-circulating linac. This minimal lifetime requirement leads directly to relatively high limits on the background gas pressure through much of the facility. The 10μA average beam current produces very little synchrotron radiation induced gas desorption and thus the need for an ""ante-chamber"" in the vacuum chamber is eliminated. In the arc bend magnets, and the insertion devices, the vacuum chamber dimensions can be selected to balance the coherent synchrotron radiation and resistive wall wakefield effects, while maintaining the modest limits on the gas pressure and minimal outgassing.",,"Degassing; Electric fields; Electron beams; Electron guns; Energy dissipation; Magnets; Scattering; Synchrotron radiation; Vacuum; Arc bend magnets; Elastic scattering; Gas desorption; Linac vacuum systems; Storage rings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143122371

This mode of operation is used to generate intense beams of γ-rays from 2 MeV to about 200 MeV (currently from 2 MeV to 58 MeV). Generation of γ-rays with energy exceeding 20 MeV causes the loss of electrons, which will be replaced by injection from the Booster operating in a top-off mode.

The wiggler magnets are chosen to achieve the necessary damping for optimum operation of CESR-c at a beam energy of 1.88 GeV. The wiggler cryostat units are designed to be modular, of fixed length flange-to-flange, so that they can be easily installed and exchanged. The cryostat incorporates several novel features including a suspension system with very low heat leak that prevents any significant motion during cool down, a custom triple cryogenic feedthrough, and a helium vessel made in two halves, each enclosing a half-magnet.

The digital control hardware consists out of a powerful VME processing board with a Xilinx FPGA, an Analog Devices digital signal processor (DSP) and memory. A daughter board is equipped with four fast analog-todigital converters (up to 65 MHz sampling rate) and two digital-toanalog converters (up to 50 MHz update rate).

The first challenge is the size and complexity of the facility. If the typical reliability of existing High Energy Physics accelerators is simply scaled to the size of a 500 GeV linear collider, the overall system availability will be too low. The final design must incorporate a more rigorous failure analysis as well as built-in overheads and redundancy. An additional challenge is the complexity of the tuning procedures required to preserve a very small beam emittance. These include beam-based alignment of magnets and rf structures, automated trajectory correction, feedback, emittance and luminosity optimization, and more. Another issue is the inherently large power densities in the beams, which can damage any beamline components they intercept.

The time width of the beam from the linac operated with 2856MHz rf is 1nsec for single-bunch beam operation. The beam is distributed not only in a single rf bucket of the booster synchrotron operated with 508.58MHz rf but also in other rf buckets. The energy of injected beam is increased from 1GeV to 8GeV. The RF-KO system is operated at minimum beam energy of 1GeV because the required knockout power is reduced. The bunched beam in the satellite rf buckets are coherently shaken by the electromagnetic field produced by four RF-KO electrodes in the vacuum chamber. As the amplitude of betatron oscillation increase, the beam soon begins to collide with a beam duct and is lost. The single-bunch beam injected into the targeted rf bucket is effectively kept alive on the zero-crossing point of RF-KO waveform with a precise timing system. The beam intensity of satellite rf buckets in the storage ring was measured with a photon counting method and determined to be 10-9 less than that of the main rf bucket.",,"Electrodes; Electromagnetic field effects; Electron guns; Particle accelerators; Satellites; Signal processing; Synchrotron radiation; Waveform analysis; Beam energy; Machine tuning; Quadrupole magnets; Waveform generators; Electron beams",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143104876

The technique mixes synchrotron light with light from a mode locked solid-state laser oscillator in a non-linear crystal and detects the up-converted radiation with a photo-multiplier. The laser is phase locked to the storage ring RF system. The laser choices available for repetition frequency, pulse length and phase modulation give a very wide range of options for matching the bunch configuration of particular storage rings. Progress in the technology of solid-state lasers ensures this system can be made robust for routine use in storage ring operations. A very large number of important applications are possible including measurement of the fraction of untrapped particles prior to acceleration, the population of particles in the nominally unfilled RF buckets in a bunch train (""ghost bunches""), longitudinal tails, the diffusion of particles into the beam abort gap and the normal bunch parameters of longitudinal shape and intensity. We are currently investigating application to two devices: (1) the 1.9 GeV ALS electron storage ring at LBNL with 328 RF buckets, 2ns bucket spacing, 276 nominally filled bunches, 15-30ps rms bunch length and (2) the 7 TeV LHC proton collider under construction at CERN with 35,640 RF buckets, 2.5 ns bucket spacing, 2,808 nominally filled bunches, 280-620 ps rms bunch length. A proof of principle experiment is being conducted on ALS.

With machines due to operate at or near the megawatt level under construction in the United States and Japan and expected to come on line within the next decade, advances in Europe have not progressed at the same rate. A positive decision on the European Spallation Source (ESS) looks unlikely and one is led to consider the feasibility of alternative options. An ISIS upgrade is one such possibility. The current installation of a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) in the linac and a dual harmonic RF system in the synchrotron should lead to an increase in intensity of up to 50%, but plans are also under way to increase the beam power to 1MW with the possibility of going to 4-5 MW in the longer term. The 1 MW option is based on an increase in energy to 3 GeV by means of a second synchrotron using ISIS as a booster. Details of the new ring and studies of the accelerating system are given in this paper. The ring also has the option of accelerating to 8 GeV at reduced frequency and this could be used as a test bed for the nanosecond bunch compression needed for the proton driver for a neutrino factory (NF). The cost of these proposals is relatively modest compared with a completely new facility. In the longer term, a combination of two such rings with a new synchrotron booster (replacing the existing ISIS) would give several options, for example: 4 MW for neutrons, or 2 MW for neutrons plus 2 MW for neutrino/muon studies, or 4 MW for a neutrino facility.",,"Computer simulation; Machine design; Magnetic fields; Neutron beams; Particle optics; Protons; Storage rings; Emittance; Neutrino factory (NF); Radio frequency quadrupoles (RFQ); Spallation neutron source (SNS); Synchrotrons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143102544

For this project, an existing non-commercial well (DP 23-1), to be stimulated by hydraulic fracturing, has been the subject of various recent investigations. One focus of this work has been an evaluation of the existing network of fractures in the well via acquisition of a wellbore-imaging log, which required cooling the wellbore (by water injection) to ensure good image quality. This cooling effort provided an opportunity to conduct an injection test of the well. A step-rate injection test and a pressure fall-off test, following the stoppage of injection, were conducted. The injection rate and pressure data were analyzed using transient pressure analysis techniques. This analysis confirmed that the reservoir around the well has very low flow capacity (4,000 md-ft) and a modest storage capacity (0.001 ft/psi), and the well does not intersect any major fracture. The well has very low injectivity (0.69 gpm/psi). The analysis indicates that injection for several days reduced the wellbore ""skin factor"" (from 1 to -0.2), and thereby, improved the injectivity somewhat. The positive skin factor of this well appears to be due to possible well damage and the fact that less than half of the open interval in the well accepts injection. The average porosity of the reservoir is very low (on the order of 2%). The radius of investigation of the test was estimated at 1,440 feet. The flow and storage capacities at this well are far lower than encountered within the known hydrothermal reservoir at Desert Peak. The results of this test provide a baseline against which any future permeability enhancements at this well can be assessed; a practical, low cost and approximate methodology for such assessment is proposed. The methodology consists of a short-term injection test followed by a long-term test (several weeks) that will yield the following measures of stimulation success: increase in injectivity, flow capacity and/or fracture length; reduction in skin factor; and stimulated reservoir volume.","Desert Peak; EGS; Enhanced Geothermal System; Flow capacity; Formation evaluation; HDR; Injection; Injectivity; Skin factor; Stimulation; Storage capacity; Vertical fracture; Well testing","Flow capacity; Formation evaluation; Skin factor; Vertical fracture; Cooling; Data reduction; Image quality; Impellers; Porosity; Power plants; Well testing; Geothermal fields",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143092425

The femtoslicing principle employs a femtosecond laser beam to interact resonantly (inverse FEL interaction) with the electron beam in the ALS. The induced energy spread over the femtosecond duration is converted to a transverse displacement by exploiting the dispersion of the storage ring. The displaced femtosecond electron pulse then radiates and produces femtosecond synchrotron radiation. To achieve the necessary spatial separation of the energy modulated slice from the rest of the bunch, a sizeable local vertical dispersion bump in the undulator used as radiator is required.

Boards containing MOSFET switches, trigger circuitry, and energy-storage capacitors plug into the core housings. A 50 kV prototype modulator that meets most of the facility requirements has been designed, fabricated, and tested at LLNL. More recent work has been concerned with designing and testing cores and boards with the full volt-second capability needed for 24-pulse operation.

We present two dynamic memory allocators which solve the bank assignment problem for shared multi-banked SDRAM memories.

The accelerator requires 15 converter-modulator stations each providing between 9 and 11 MW pulses with up to a 1.1 MW average power. The converter-modulator can be described as a resonant 20 kHz polyphase boost inverter. Each converter modulator derives its buss voltage from a standard substation cast-core transformer. Each substation is followed by an SCR pre-regulator to accommodate voltage changes from no load to full load, in addition to providing a soft-start function. Energy storage is provided by self-clearing metallized hazy polypropylene traction capacitors. These capacitors do not fail short, but clear any internal anomaly. Three ""H-Bridge"" IGBT transistor networks are used to generate the polyphase 20 kHz transformer primary drive waveforms. The 20 kHz drive waveforms are time-gated to generate the desired klystron pulse width. Pulse width modulation of the individual 20 kHz pulses is utilized to provide regulated output waveforms with DSP based adaptive feedforward and feedback techniques. The boost transformer design utilizes nanocrystalline alloy that provides low core loss at design flux levels and switching frequencies. Capacitors are used on the transformer secondary networks to resonate the leakage inductance. The transformers are wound for a specific leakage inductance, not turns ratio. This design technique generates multiple secondary volts per turn as compared to the primary. With the appropriate tuning conditions, switching losses are minimized. The resonant topology has the added benefit of being deQed in a klystron fault condition, with little energy deposited in the arc. This obviates the need of crowbars or other related networks. A review of these design parameters, operational performance, production status, and ORNL installation and performance to date will be presented.",,"Capacitors; Electric inverters; Electric network topology; Electric transformers; Energy storage; Inductance; Modulators; Neutron sources; Particle accelerators; Pulse modulation; Spalling; Waveform analysis; Design parameters; Modular design; Resonant rectification; Substation efficiency; Electric converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143054909

Despite reduced supply voltages, low-voltage sensing techniques are needed to avoid the time constants associated with large voltage swings on increasingly large capacitance. This paper describes two sensing techniques to overcome this problem: a current sense amplifier and a charge transfer sense amplifier and their implementation based on 90nm CMOS technology. The current sense amplifier senses the cell current directly and shows a speed improvement of 10-12% for 128 memory cells and 15-17% for 256 memory cells as compared to the conventional voltage mode sense amplifier, for iso-noise. The other technique is the charge transfer sense amplifier that takes advantage of large bit-line capacitance for its operation. CTSA shows an improvement of 12-15% less energy that the voltage mode sense amplifier. The energy consumed by bit-lines charging and discharging in CTSA is 30% less than the voltage mode sensing scheme. © 2003 IEEE.",,"Bitline capacitance; CMOS technology; Current sense amplifiers; Sense amplifier; Sensing schemes; Sensing techniques; Speed improvement; Supply voltages; Capacitance; Charge transfer; CMOS integrated circuits; Semiconductor storage; Sensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748529546

The building has several outstanding features - it is the largest facility in Canada dedicated to the treatment and rehabilitation of wild animals; it is the most energy efficient education and health care facility in Canada; and the use of concrete makes a significant contribution to its excellent energy performance. All floors and roofs in a 2-storey structure are structural concrete slabs, all of which have embedded polyethylene tubing providing 100% of the space cooling and heating. The floors and exposed concrete ceilings act as the heating and cooling elements of the mechanical system - there is no forced air heating or cooling and no perimeter radiation. In addition, the 3500 m 3 of concrete act as cool thermal storage during the cooling season, significantly reducing the peak afternoon cooling load, and allowing the cooling system to pre-cool the building at night for use the following day. Thermally activated slabs for cooling are new to North America; this is the largest known application in a humid climate in North America and the first installation in sloped cathedral roof slabs. Special coordination was required with the installation of reinforcing steel, electrical conduit, and mechanical slab penetrations. 15 km of tubing was installed and slabs poured at -10 to -25 deg C ambient air temperature in Jan-Mar 2003. The building is ventilated with 100% outside air and at a high rate as required by a health care facility. Normally, heating and cooling this outside air would constitute the single largest HVAC energy load. At the Wildlife Centre, 9400 L/s (20,000 cfm) of ventilation air is brought into the building through a grid of 9 buried 900 mm dia precast concrete pipes, connecting to a double foundation wall, which acts as the outside air plenum for the air handling units. The walls of the buried pipes and the foundation act as a large ground-to-air heat exchanger, pre-warming the outside air in winter and pre-cooling it in summer. At design heating and cooling conditions, this ground heat exchanger reduces the HVAC load by 30 kW and tempers the air by 3 degrees C. Concrete was chosen for the piping material because of its demonstrated success in several European installations in resisting mold growth in the buried ducts. Ground duct performance was modelled with FRAME, a finite element analysis heat transfer program developed by Enermodal. The building energy performance was modelled both with Carrier Hourly Analysis Program and with Natural Resources Canada's ""EE4"" program, used for all buildings applying to NRCAN's Commercial Building Incentive Program. The Wildlife Centre is predicted to use 65% less energy than a reference building designed to Canada's Model National Energy Code for Buildings. Application will be made to the US Green Building Council for LEED certification. The use of concrete in the radiant slabs and the ground heat exchanger ventilation tunnels will contribute several points to the LEED rating.",,"2-storey structure; Earth Rangers Wildlife Centre; Thermal storage; Treatment and rehabilitation; Education; Energy efficiency; Finite element method; Floors; Health care; Roofs; Ventilation; Concrete buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645715313

For the one-dimensional Gauss-Markov field, we investigate the relation between the system throughput and reconstruction distortion, for different types of MAC schemes. We show that at low throughput level, increasing system throughput decreases the reconstruction distortion considerably. But the improvement is much less when the throughput is relatively high.

Lately, it has been possible to unite these theories into a consistent pattern. Intensive discussions at meetings have been the key to the formation of this pattern of ecosystem theories. Another driving factor has been the reformulation of Odum's attributes [1] into three growth or development forms: growth of the biological structure (the biomass), growth of the network (more cycling, more linkages) and the growth of information. An analysis of the growth forms (Jørgensen et al. [2]) shows that through-flow (power), ascendency and exergy storage are all increasing as a consequence of all three types of growth. However, exergy dissipation, entropy production, specific exergy (exergy/biomass), retention time and the ratio indirect/direct effect only increases or decreases with one or two of the growth forms. Emergy expresses the formation cost in equivalent solar energy. Nature has the ability to obtain a high exergy storage for a given input of emergy, and there is therefore a correlation between exergy and emergy. We show with one example, out of the many recently published in various scientific journals, how to use the ecosystem theory to explain ecological observations. The example given in this paper is simply to illustrate how the ecosystem theory is applied to explain ecological observations by the use of models.",,"Biomass; Degradation; Ecology; Energy dissipation; Entropy; Mathematical models; Numerical methods; Solar energy; Ecosystem theory; Retention time; Specific exergy; Ecosystems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942696335

The system studied, supposed to be in a steady state, is the province of Siena (on a year 2000 database). It is represented by structural connectivity which describes in a synthetic way the interactions of each mass or energy flow with each sector of the society. The exergy accounting converts the total amount of resources entering in a system in exergetic form with the help of a table of ""raw exergy data"" available in the literature. After the conversion of each flow into a common exergetic basis it's possible to evaluate the efficiencies of each energy and mass transfer between the seven sectors and to find out where the main irreversible exergy losses are. The advantage of the EEA, compared to a classical exergy accounting, consists in the inclusion in the system balance of the exergetic equivalent of human Labour and of Capital. EEA also allows one to calculate the efficiency of the domestic sector which is otherwise impossible to evaluate, accounting the working hours as a product of this sector of the society. The results show that the Province of Siena has values of efficiency for the different sectors close to Italian average except for two sectors, tertiary and energy conversion, that are more efficient, in agreement with system's features. The largest inefficiency is due to the transportation sector which is lower then 30% in EEA and lower than 10% in classical accounting.",,"Economic and social effects; Energy absorption; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Environmental impact; Heat losses; Mass transfer; Natural resources; Personnel; Public policy; Remediation; Thermodynamics; Energy flow; Global policy planning; Raw exergy data; Structural connectivity; Exergy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942644516

The Office of Naval Research, a significant contributor to the technology developments necessary to achieve all-electric ship architectures, looked for ways to prioritize their investments in technologies that provide the best improvements in overall ship performance and affordability. To facilitate the associated decision-making process, a decision analysis methodology was developed that provides both the structure and guidance for thinking systematically about these difficult decisions. By employing both deterministic and probabilistic analysis techniques the methodology compares the net worth of a variety of electric ship technologies as they relate to ship performance and cost. It addresses technologies in the areas of propulsion, power generation, power conversion, distribution and control, and energy storage. For each assessed technology, input parameters are defined and translated into impacts on war-fighting capability metrics, efficiency, weight, volume, availability and life cycle cost. The impacts are assessed at the ship level and not merely at the component or subsystem level. This paper describes the application of a method, known as Technology Identification, Evaluation and Selection (TIES) 1, to the net value assessment of electric ship technologies. In this research, technology parameters are related to ship performance and technology comparison metrics over a full range of hullform types. From the example assessments performed for technologies ranging from super-conducting propulsion motors, high-speed generators, to fuel cells and motor drives, the reader will gain an appreciation for why this methodology is becoming an integral part in developing the US Navy's investment strategy for future electric ship technologies.

It is difficult to realize or very uneconomical to heating only by solar energy that is collected in winter. The article in detail presents the solar energy heating and cooling new technical experimental system that has been founded in the Energy Conservation Laboratory of HIT (Harbin Institute of Technology). It is experimented and studied by this system that the collected solar energy is stored up into the deep underground soil by the exchangers in three seasons of the year. The ground-source heat pump (GSHP) system and the solar hot water system are used together to heating in winter. The system is divided into two parts after the heating. One part directly stores solar energy up into soil. The other directly takes the cold out of soil for cooling in the summer. Because a lot of heat is taken out from the under ground soil in winter, the cold can be directly taken in summer by the circulating pump and not using the refrigerator. When cooling finished, this part also stores the solar energy in soil in order to heating in winter. And good results have been achieved that the heating coefficient of performance (COP) is above 3.0, and the cooling is above 15.0 through two years experiment. Not only the petrochemical energy is saved, but also the environment is protected.

In the succeeding50 years since the Atoms for Peace Initiative, nuclear materials were produced and used in global civilian reactors and fuel cycles intended for peaceful purposes. The Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1970 established a framework for appropriate applications of both defense and civilian nuclear activities by nuclear weapons states and non-nuclear weapons states. As global inventories of nuclear materials continue to grow, in a diverse and dynamically changing manner, it is time to evaluate current and future trends and needed actions: what are the current circumstances, what has been done to date, what has worked and what hasn't? The aim is to identify mutually reinforcing programmatic directions, leading to global partnerships that measurably enhance international security. Essential elements are material protection, control and accountability (MPC&A) of separated nuclear materials, interim storage, and geologic repositories for all nuclear materials destined for final disposal. Cooperation among key partners, such as the MPC&A program between the U.S. and Russia for nuclear materials from dismantled weapons, is necessary for interim storage and final disposal of nuclear materials. Such cooperative partnerships can lead to a new nuclear regime where a complete fuel cycle service with fuel leasing and spent fuel take-back can be offered to reactor users. The service can effectively minimize or even eliminate the incentive or rationale for the user-countries to develop their indigenous enrichment and reprocessing technologies. International cooperation, supported by governments of key countries can be best to facilitate the forum for formation of such cooperative partnerships.",,"Cooperative partnerships; Global nuclear materials; International security; Accident prevention; Civil defense; Disaster prevention; Information dissemination; International cooperation; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear reactors; Ordnance; Nuclear energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642569425

The power plants itself, were located close to the fuel, e.g. the coal mines, the transportation terminals for the coal or the oil, the water retaining basin, etc. The grid was, in a certain kind, innerving the country with electrical power from a broad, central line into ever thinning lines, when reaching the outer regions of the distribution authority. The grid owner was, at the same time, also the main generator for the grid. Therefore, he had a strong interest to have a generation mix allowing him to ensure a safe and reliable supply of electricity and follow the load variations at any time. The deregulation of the electricity market brought a paradigm change for the owner of the transmission and distribution grid. The price of electricity is not any more a bulk mix for all services, e.g. generation, transmission, power bridging, power reliability and quality. Much more, all these functions have to be paid separately. Additional players, like power producers out of renewable energy sources, add their toll on the existing grids as their location does not necessarily correspond to the grid structure. Furthermore, their stochastic character brings an increase in the volatility of this market and an additional uncertainty as well. Within this new environment, the value of ancillary services has to be defined appropriately to ensure an adequate mix of generation capacity and characteristics. Furthermore, energy storage becomes more and more an issue and the corresponding technologies are actually evaluated. One of these, based on decades of experience, is the ""Compressed Air Energy Storage"" (CAES). It is besides pumped hydropower, the other solution for large energy storage capacity. The present paper gives the actual status of that technology as applied for the actual option for projects in the United States.

Wind power is getting attention for prospective renewal energy sources, and introduction of wind farm generation will solve environmental matters and energy exhaust problem. However, the quality of power system frequency will be degraded as the capacity of wind power generator increases. Attenuation of mismatch between the served power and load demand is most important problem in order to increase number of wind generators. A wind firm is connected to the proposed rotary frequency converter as a buffer to connect the wind farm and the power system. This provides energy storage function of the output power associated with irregular wind power. The converter has a synchronous generator and a doubly-fed machine. The synchronous motor is connected to the wind farm to supply AC voltage for induction generators of wind power generation units. The shaft of the doubly-fed machine is mechanically jointed to the synchronous motor, and rotates together. Tuning the current of the secondary winding supplied by cycloconverter or self-commutated inverter controls the output power. At present, doubly-fed machine is commonly used in pumped storage hydraulic power plants recently constructed. The proposed scheme is an expansion from the present application. In order to evaluate the proposed scheme, firstly, load reference simulation test is carried out for discussion of the power exchange response to a power grid. Secondly, experimental study is discussed in order to identify the required capacity for the rotary frequency converter to improve the frequency quality. These studies show preferable characteristic for the viewpoint of power system quality improvement.","Flywheel; Rotary frequency converter; Wind generation","Computer simulation; Electric energy storage; Electric inverters; Electric power generation; Flywheels; Frequency converters; Synchronous generators; Wind power; Rotary frequency converters; Wind generation; Wind generators; Electric power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642554869

When the consumers need cold or thermal energy, the stored potential can easily be transformed into cold or thermal energy by means of refrigeration or heat pump.

When the energy of the incident electron beam is sufficiently high, it can produce high-energy photons, which subsequently interact with a nucleus, resulting in the emission of neutrons. This interaction is known as a photonuclear interaction. The Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory consists of a 7 GeV electron storage ring, which is high enough energy to produce photonuclear interactions. Neutron fluence estimates inside the APS storage ring during operation revealed non-trivial neutron fluences for stored beam loss as well as injection loss on accelerator components. A 93% enriched 235U fission detector was chosen for the purpose of measuring the neutron fluence within the APS storage ring. When a neutron interacts with the thin (16 mg) 235U foil, fission occurs, producing two fission fragments of approximately 80 MeV each, and a few neutrons. Due to their higher energy (80 MeV), fission fragments produce ionization within the detector, resulting in a large pulse, which allows for the essential discrimination between neutrons and photons in a high photon background. The detector provides valuable information on the photoneutron fluence within the APS accelerator tunnel as well as useful information on the beam loss scenarios at various locations. These detection systems also make it possible to monitor neutron doses in terms of neutron-induced damage of radiation-sensitive equipment within accelerators.",,"Beam loss; Electron storage ring; Photon sources; Photonuclear interaction; Copper; Dosimetry; Electron beams; Fission reactions; Ionization; Neutron detectors; Optical collimators; Particle accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642550113

Titanium and titanium alloys have a high affinity to hydrogen and a large storage capacity. In this study, hydrogen charging was performed electrochemically in a 2:1 glycerin-phosphoric acid electrolyte at high fugacities. The objective of our present research is to investigate in detail by means of X-ray diffraction, SEM as well as TEM and microhardness the influence of hydrogen at high fugacities on phase stability as well as on microhardness in Ti-Nb (20-45 wt.% Nb) alloys. Hydrogenation of Ti-Nb was found to exhibit a significant effect on the phase stability as well as the microhardness of Ti-Nb (20-45 wt.% Nb). Hydrogenation of the near α Ti-20wt.%Nb alloy at high fugacities led to precipitation of (Ti,Nb)H x in the metastable α″ matrix and to an increase of the lattice parameter of the β-phase. The microhardness of Ti-20wt.%Nb decreased with increasing hydrogen content up to 3000 ppm. For the investigated β Ti-Nb alloys, it was found that hydrogen stabilized the investigated bcc β-phase, but destabilized the hep ω-phase. With increasing hydrogen content an expansion of the lattice constant of the β-phase occurred, followed by the formation of (Ti,Nb)Hx. The microhardness measurements for Ti-40wt.%Nb nor for Ti-45wt.%Nb showed no significant change after hydrogenation. It is known that hydrogen strongly influences the slip mechanism in the bcc-phase and assists in lowering the deformation energy, so the influence of hydrogen on the mechanism of plastic deformation of Ti-Nb is of considerable interest. The observed microstructural investigations should provide significant insight as to the microstructural mechanism through which hydrogen enhances the plasticity of Ti-Nb alloys.",,"Alloying; Chemical modification; Electrolytes; Hydrogen; Lattice constants; Microhardness; Microstructure; Niobium alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction analysis; Fugacities; Hydrogen charging; Phase stability; Storage capacity; Titanium alloys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844504076

A planar-optics geometry is used so that the spectrometer optics are contained on a single piece of bulk fused silica. The object to be investigated is imaged onto a linear array of tilting MEMS mirrors that define the spectrometer slit. Each individual MEMS mirror tilts to send the light to one of three blazed gratings of differing dispersive powers. Depending on the wavelength and selected grating the spectral resolution is between 5 and 20 nm. The collimating and focusing mirrors of the spectrometer are fabricated in standard photoresist via grayscale photolithography with a custom high-energy beam-sensitive (HEBS) photomask. A reflow at 70 degrees Celsius for 40 hours is necessary to achieve near diffraction-limited performance. The blazed gratings are fabricated in SU-8 via direct-write electron-beam lithography.

The energy received in each array pixel is in the form of low levels of UV, IR, or visible light, X-Rays, microwaves or other electromagnetic energy and is converted in each array pixel into electrical signals. These sensor arrays are used in military imaging or detection or in medical or industrial diagnostic imagining. In all of these areas, the pixel density is being continually increased as fabrication photolithography attains finer resolution and the device performance is improved. This leads to arrays with ever decreasing levels of stored energy per pixel and ever-increasing number of pixels per device. These trends lead to lower pixel output signals that are more susceptible to interconnect signal losses, cross-talk and external noise, all of which are made worse by the increase in the number of pixels and in the pixel density. One approach to overcoming these issues is to move the signal processing closer to the array, minimizing the number of interconnects and the interconnect length the raw pixel signal outputs must travel prior to pre-processing, such as amplification, noise suppression, and digitization. One innovative approach to achieving this is to use 3-D stacking of the preprocessing electronics for each pixel directly behind the sensor array. This paper will describe the development of a high density, 3-D stacking technology that is being applied to an 8000 pixel array sensor.","Array Interconnections; Array Sensors; Chip-on-Flex; Thinned Electronics; Three-D Stacking","Array interconnections; Array sensors; Chip-on-flex; Thinned electronics; Three-D stacking; Analog to digital conversion; Arrays; Electric energy storage; Electromagnetism; Electron energy levels; Infrared imaging; Medical imaging; Microsensors; Microwaves; Noise abatement; Photolithography; Microelectronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342631356

Though ionic contamination of a semiconductor device is known to accelerate failure of the device, the diffusion of ions in device encapsulants has not been measured, perhaps due to the difficulty of measuring ion diffusion in these heavily filled glassy polymers. In this article, the measurement of ion diffusion in common encapsulants for electronic devices by Dynamic Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (DSIMS) is discussed. This technique is well suited for the measurement of ions in encapsulant materials due to its ability to measure all elements of the periodic table including elemental hydrogen and its detection limit in the ppb range for most elements. The diffusion of chloride ions and moisture in a common encapsulant material were measured. Ion diffusion was shown to be slower than moisture diffusion by approximately nine orders of magnitude, in the encapsulant.","Corrosion; Diffusion; Encapsulant; Ions; Moisture; Molding compounds; Reliability","Die attach; Electrostatic analyzers; Encapsulants; Ion diffusion; Chemical bonds; Corrosion; Diffusion; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Epoxy resins; Hydrogen; Metallizing; Moisture; Polymers; Reliability theory; Scanning electron microscopy; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Sheet molding compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342627382

This paper reports the status of plans for incorporating a UVB prediction module into an existing Urban Forest Effects (UFORE) model. UFORE currently has modules to quantify urban forest structure, urban tree volatile organic compound emissions, carbon storage and sequestration in urban vegetation, dry deposition of air pollutants on trees, tree influences on energy use for heating and cooling buildings, tree pollen allergenicity index, and replacement cost of trees. These modeled effects are based upon field sampling to characterize land use, vegetation cover, and building features. The field sampling includes recording of tree species, total height, height to base of live crown, and crown width on randomly selected 0.04-ha (0.1 acre) plots. Distance and direction from sampled trees to buildings are also measured. The input for UFORE modeling of effects includes hourly meteorological data and pollution-concentration data. UFORE has already been used in assessing the urban forest function of 13 cities in the United States and 5 cities in other countries. The objective of the present work is to enable UFORE to predict the effect of different urban tree densities on potential average human exposure to UVB. The current version of UFORE is written using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS); a new version will be a user-friendly Windows application and will be available for wide distribution. Progress to date on the UVB module consists primarily of examining available modeling and data collection tools. Two methods are proposed for the UVB module. In Method 1, we will derive predicted UVB irradiance 〈I b〉 at person height, that is, below the urban tree and building canopy, using gap fractions (sky view portions) measured from digitized fisheye photos taken from each of the UFORE plot centers during a UFORE field survey. A promising method for analyzing the photos is the use of Gap Light Analyzer (GLA). A human thermal comfort model will be used to determine the times when people would be comfortable outdoors in light attire, and UVB 〈I b〉 will be determined for those times. Method 2 will be applied in cases where hemispherical photos cannot be made available, and for making predictions for cities where surveys have already been done. Method 2 will use a 3D canopy UV radiation transfer model to derive 〈I b〉 based on tree canopy cover maps from GIS analysis of aerial color IR photographs or Landsat TM images. The UV module addition to UFORE will make it useful in epidemiology of UV-related human disease and assessment of UV benefits, such as in vitamin D production, and it will also facilitate consideration of UV exposure in urban forest management.","Computer modeling; Hemispherical photos; Human disease; Human thermal comfort; urban forest influences","Canopy exposure; Hemispherical photos; Human thermal comfort; Urban forest influences; UVB radiation; Air pollution; Antigen-antibody reactions; Computer aided analysis; Earth atmosphere; Ecosystems; Forestry; Health risks; Medicine; Meteorology; Tumors; Vegetation; Ultraviolet radiation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342616273

Compared with discrete packages, SIP & SOC can provide better solutions which cellular phone requires like power saving, EMI reduction, max frequency up-grade in spite of higher cost, low test yield, quality assurance, and complicated manufacturing processes. Although SIP [System in (a) Package] and SOC [System on (a) Chip] may be the solution for the limited size and space of the cellular phone, there are still so many arguments about which will be a winner. SIP has strong merits on cost, delivery, and manufacturing process, whereas it has demerits on power consumption, max frequency limitation, compared with SOC. 320FBGA_1717, 1.4mmt SIP in this paper accommodates 1 application processor silicon die, 1 Nand flash [256Mb (x8)] silicon die, 2 SDRAM [128Mb(x16)] silicon dies [256Mb(x32) SDRAM].

However, the flutter instability caused by fluid-structure interactions becomes apparent and leads to track misregistration as the rotating speed of the disk drive increases. The purpose of this research is to investigate the aerodynamic effect of the top cover of an optical disk drive on the disk stability using finite element method when the optical disk drive is rotating at high-speed. Three top covers with different cross sections of an optical disk drive have been chosen. Results show that the shape of disk top cover influences velocity fields of the rotating flow and then alters the characteristics of secondary recirculating vortex. Furthermore, coupling advection effects between streamlines affect the distribution of fluid pressure and leads to the disk self-excited vibration.

Their high strength to weight ratio makes them ideal for the high stress-level applications associated with advanced rotor systems. A natural next step in the evolution of such work is to develop flexible high-speed composite rotor designs that fully exploit the inherent advantages of such materials. To date, there have been quite a few studies that have examined the effects of internal damping in shafting on rotordynamic behavior. But there has been no systematic study of the effects of internal damping on the coupled disk-shaft dynamics of flexible composite disk rotor systems. It is important that such effects be well understood if flexible composite components are to be successfully used in high-speed rotor applications. In the present study, the objective was to develop an understanding of the impact of composite material damping on the dynamic behavior of high-speed rotating machinery that includes fiber reinforced and other composite materials. Analysis techniques, including the half-power method and the log decrement method, were used to identify the damping characteristics for material samples. The experimental setup and the resulting data is presented and discussed. The significance of nonlinear effects, the variation of internal dissipation levels with vibration amplitude and frequency and its effects on the dynamic behavior of high-speed rotating machinery are discussed.",,"Aerospace applications; Damping; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Energy dissipation; Rotating machinery; Shafts (machine components); Vibrations (mechanical); Disk-shaft dynamics; Dynamic stability; Energy storage systems; Graphite fiber reinforced epoxy composites (GFRP); Rotors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342428045

We used the cultivation of potato miniplants (cv Adreta) under influence of long-term horizontal clinorotation (2 rev/min), which imitated microgravity, as a model for the technology of potato food production in the CELSS. We manipulated some factors such as duration of day, irradiance and temperature to achieve the maximum yields of minitubers (to 100% their formation). It was found that the optimal conditions for minituber formation under clinorotation are the following: irradiance (4,000 lux of white-cool light) during 8 hours and darkness (night) - 16 hours; in the daytime temperature was +24°C and by night +18°C; and the relative humidity was 70% and the modificated Murashige and Skoog agar medium.

Flywheel is a common attitude control device on spacecraft that provides precise control at an easy rate. However, rapid response is hardly achieved since low reaction torque is available applying flywheel. The purpose in this paper is to improve the response of attitude control device with flywheel. Brake equipment is mounted on the flywheel in order to raise the maximum torque. Maximum torque is raised dramatically utilizing the braking torque to the attitude control. Twin drive system is applied to this attitude control device so that the braking torque works in both rotation directions. It also made possible to charge the momentum without any interference to attitude control. The prototype of the attitude control device is constructed in order to examine the performance of the proposed mechanism. Experimental results show that its response improved applying the suggested mechanism. The two actuators, an electric DC motor and a powder brake, were compared in detail.

With e.g. the rugged lead-acid batteries, the covered ranges are about 50 to 100 km, and this is usually not enough to cover a typical transfer distance between the location of e.g. maintenance and the location of operation. Hybrid vehicles have the opportunity of running by means of the combustion engine and can cover long ranges but have to transport all the time the excessive mass and are much more expensive than electrical vehicles. Mountable range extenders are a flexible solution to increase the transfer range of a pure electrical vehicle. A range extender is composed of a thermo-dynamical machine driving an AC generator and a power conversion circuit to transfer the power into the DC battery circuit. For cost reasons, existing range extenders use standard emergency power supplies delivering 50 Hz in single-phase or three-phase circuits (higher power output). For the conversion of AC into battery level DC various circuit topologies are feasible. These topologies are evaluated with respect to weight, cost, losses. An optimised circuit design is composed of a higher frequency power conversion system using power electronics.

As a consequence there is a requirement to demonstrate the 'passive safety' of waste packages in stores over a necessarily lengthy period (perhaps 150 years or more). 'Passive safety' is taken here to imply that the waste packages themselves would remain safe without intervention; it is assumed however, that the store building and associated infrastructure would need to be actively maintained and that the store may need to be ventilated. Importantly, methods for waste storage also need to ensure that possible future options for disposal are not foreclosed. An extended period of storage suggests that emphasis will need to be placed by waste producers on understanding a number of issues such as: the impact of corrosion on container integrity; the assessment of container vents and other features as a pathway for the release of radioactivity; the extent to which wastes are conditioned for storage and the selection of appropriate methods; the generation and behaviour of toxic or flammable gases in the storage facility; and the mitigating steps that might be needed to address adverse impacts (e.g. the type of ventilation that the store requires).

An optimizing compiler can modify a given input code to improve its bank locality. There are several practical advantages of enhancing bank locality, the most important of which is reduced memory energy consumption. Recent trends indicate that energy consumption is fast becoming a first-order design parameter as processor-based systems continue to become more complex and multi-functional. Off-chip memory energy consumption in particular can be a limiting factor in many embedded system designs. This paper presents a novel compiler-based strategy for maximizing the benefits of low-power operating modes available in some recent DRAM-based multi-bank memory systems. In this strategy, the compiler uses linear algebra to represent and optimize bank locality in a mathematical framework. We discuss that exploiting bank locality can be cast as loop (iteration space) and array layout (data space) transformations. We also present experimental data showing the effectiveness of our optimization strategy. Our results show that exploiting bank locality can result in large energy savings.

One of the main challenges in sensor networks is to process and aggregate data in the network rather than wasting energy by sending large amounts of raw data to reply to a query. Some efficient data dissemination methods, particularly data-centric storage and information aggregation, rely on efficient routing from one node to another. In this paper we introduce GEM (Graph EMbedding for sensor networks), an infrastructure for node-to-node routing and data-centric storage and information processing in sensor networks. Unlike previous approaches, it does not depend on geographic information, and it works well even in the face of physical obstacles. In GEM, we construct a labeled graph that can be embedded in the original network topology in an efficient and distributed fashion. In that graph, each node is given a label that encodes its position in the original network topology. This allows messages to be efficiently routed through the network, while each node only needs to know the labels of its neighbors. To demonstrate how GEM can be applied, we have developed a concrete graph embedding method, VPCS (Virtual Polar Coordinate Space). In VPCS, we embed a ringed tree into the network topology, and label the nodes in such a manner as to create a virtual polar coordinate space. We have also developed VPCR, an efficient routing algorithm that uses VPCS. VPCR is the first algorithm for node-to-node routing that guarantees reachability, requires each node to keep state only about its immediate neighbors, and requires no geographic information. Our simulation results show that VPCR is robust on dynamic networks, works well in the face of voids and obstacles, and scales well with network size and density.

By using the Voigt profile function and the gain-equal-loss approximation, a gain expression has been deduced from the rate equations of upper and lower level laser species. This gain expression is adapted to the conditions of very low gas pressure up to quite high pressure and can deal with the condition of lasing frequency being not equal to the central one of spectral profile. The expressions of output power and extraction efficiency in a flowing COIL can be obtained by solving the coupling equations of the deduced gain expression and the energy equation which expresses the complete transformation of the energy stored in singlet delta state oxygen into laser energy. By using these expressions, the RotoCOIL experiment is simulated, and obtained results agree well with experiment data.

ASHRAE 1120-TRP revised the concept of equivalent full-load hours (EFLHs) as an alternative to a more elaborate energy analysis. This paper applies results of this project to study the impact of the recommended values with over- and underestimated EFLHs in three climates for three different building types. Results indicate the required design length for a vertical GCHP system can be substantially affected by the annual imbalance of heat rejected to and absorbed from the ground in nonporous formations. The impact is reduced for porous formations. Overestimation of the annual cooling energy by 50% resulted in increases in required lengths of 4% to 15% for nonporous formations. Overestimation of the annual heating energy by 50% resulted in a 13% increase in required length in Minneapolis and minimal change in St. Louis and Atlanta. The impact of bore-to-bore separation in nonporous formations is significant, and designers should weigh the option of increasing this value beyond 20 ft (6 m) in warm climate, high cooling load applications. Finally, the accuracy of determining EFLHs using ASHRAE 1120-TRP results is sufficient to perform GCHP system design, since gross errors (±50% and +100%) result in much smaller errors in required ground loop lengths.",,"Energy analysis; Ground-coupled heat pumps (GCHP); Absorption; Air conditioning; Computer simulation; Cooling; Data reduction; Error analysis; Heat storage; Porous materials; Ventilation; Heat pump systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842484285

Also presented are discharge photographs taken under identical conditions with and without preionization. It is shown that SSVD characteristics and laser energy are scarcely affected by preionization if the discharge lasts more than 150ns and the cathode surface area is in excess of 300cm2. In HF lasers with the cathode surface area and discharge duration of less than 300cm2 and 150ns, respectively, preionization is essential for nothing but stabilization of the discharge voltage and breakdown delay and for improving discharge uniformity.

Our Mission is to provide the UK with safe, environmentally sound and publicly acceptable options for the long-term management of radioactive materials. The United Kingdom has a significant legacy of long-lived intermediate level radioactive waste. This has arisen from 50 years of investigation and exploitation of nuclear technology. Some of the waste is stored in old facilities that do not provide the standards of containment that would be incorporated in modern facilities. Also the risk to people and to the environment from the inventory in these facilities will increase with time as the structures age and degrade, increasing the chance of containment failure. There is, therefore, a need to retrieve this raw waste and process and package it to make it demonstrably safe for continued storage, pending a decision on disposal of radioactive waste. This packaging should, as far as is practicable, be compatible with the UK long-term waste management strategy. Nirex has developed its Phased Disposal Concept for intermediate and low-level radioactive waste. Based on that concept, Nirex has developed waste package specifications and carries out assessments of waste packaging proposals. For legacy wastes it may not always practicable to demonstrate full compliance with all Nirex disposal criteria. This paper describes an approach, agreed between Nirex and BNFL, for managing these wastes. The proposed approach takes account of long-term waste management issues whilst recognising the need for timely improvement of storage conditions.",,"Intermediate level wastes; Waste packages; Contamination; Environmental impact; Nuclear energy; Packaging; Radioactivity; Risks; Societies and institutions; Waste incineration; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16544387070

This paper describes the practical construction programme recently completed at a UK power reactor site under decommissioning. This site has a number of half height ISO containers filled with solid radioactive material that needed a temporary storage area before being consigned for final disposal. As a result, the site, Hunterston A Decommissioning Site, needed to construct some temporary radiation shield walls to contain the half height ISO containers (HHISO) and safeguard staff and public during the storage period. The chosen location of the temporary store was the Charge Machine Maintenance Building (CMMB), which was surplus to requirements during the decommissioning programme, providing a weatherproof environment. Following an in-depth study of the different forms of construction available, the commercially available, hollow, interlocking polyethylene block system was adopted. Because of its modular form, it has the advantage that it can to be dismantled and re-used at other locations, if required. Being hollow, the block could be filled with a variety of materials, such as water, sand, lead or iron shot, depending on the radioactive shielding needs. An important aspect of the modular plastic block was that it could be more easily installed, decontaminated and decommissioned than the cheaper concrete block system, which produces copious quantities of waste for disposal. This paper describes the choice of interlocking block shielding after comparisons with more conventional forms of construction, the features of the HHISO store design, the short duration building programme and the on-site experiences of the construction period.",,"Nuclear sites; Temporary stores; Concretes; Contamination; Costs; Decommissioning (nuclear reactors); Demolition; Environmental impact; Nuclear energy; Problem solving; Radiation shielding; Recycling; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16544385610

The LLRWMO has investigated and decontaminated structures and properties at many sites across the country. It has removed contaminated soil, debris and radioactive artifacts to interim storage or interim, in situ containment. It has worked with communities and regulatory agencies to develop locally acceptable waste management solutions for the short- and long-term.

Restoration of the SSA was linked to an opportunity to develop adjacent land for new residential housing. The SSA shared a boundary with Chilton County Primary School and the remediation project had high stakeholder interest. The RAF used the SSA as an ammunition store until 1945. UKAEA used the site from 1946 for radioactive waste handling and for the burial of chemical, radioactive and beryllium contaminated wastes. Planning, characterisation and decommissioning has been ongoing since the late 1980's. Over the last two years a final clean-up operation has been completed. The project was managed by UKAEA and implemented through competitive contract by RWE Nukem and VHE Construction. The clean-up utilised stakeholder management and consultation methods to inform regulators and the local community. This included a formal public consultation concerning remedial options and the potential for environmental impact. The clean-up was designed against site specific risk based radionuclide and chemical clean-up targets. The project involved the survey, assay and clearance of 250,000 m3 of soils resulting in the segregation of 18,000 m 3 of general, chemical and exempt radioactive wastes.

The intermediate level wastes arising as a result of these activities, exhibit a high level of physical and chemical diversity, and must be managed safely in a way that protects existing and future generations and the environment. Development work has been conducted since the early 1980s to identify suitable conditioning materials and techniques that are compatible with the needs of safe long-term management, including interim storage, transport and future deep geological disposal. From these studies cementation emerged as the one medium which could satisfy all the key waste management criteria. Other materials were not ruled out and may offer benefits in specific applications. The advantages of conditioning ILW with cement include: the extensive experience of its use in a wide variety of contexts; the raw materials are relatively cheap and have a long shelf life; cement is processed in relatively simple plant at room temperature, with safety and cost benefits for plant operators; the product is fire resistant and of relatively low toxicity; cement is capable of immobilising a wide range of wastes ranging from solids to aqueous slurries; cement provides desirable product properties. Desirable properties include: suitable strength, chemical control of radionuclide leading to enhanced retention, good corrosion protection for steels, low permeability, tolerance to radiation, durability over extended timescales and; good radiation self-shielding properties. Several waste packaging plants are now operational in the UK using cement-based encapsulants. These are currently conditioning ILW for interim storage, in a manner suitable for future transport and compatible with the Nirex phased deep disposal concept.

However, the absence of a clear and unequivocal policy regarding the storage and disposal of radioactive waste is seen by a significant section of the public as a threat to their rights and the non-existence of dedicated regulation of radioactive waste based on law has become an obstacle to the development of nuclear energy in Europe and the USA. A European survey of public opinion carried out at the request of the European Commission revealed that three-quarters of the respondents to sixteen thousand interviews believed that 'all radioactive waste is very dangerous'. The public perception of threat has been fostered by the general lack of appreciation of the cautious system of radiation protection that has evolved from scientific observation and prediction of the risk of cancer from exposure to low level radiation. The concept of collective dose based on the system of radiation protection and applied to accident scenarios with remote possibilities, but in the absence of scientific assessment of the balance afforded by the pragmatism that man applies to everyday risks including the risk of cancer from the ever-present background of natural radiation, has added a measure of dread to the public sense of threat. That dread has been exacerbated by the emergence since September 2001 of the possibility of the use of radioactive waste as a terrorist weapon and for radioactive waste storage facilities to be seen as terrorist targets. International policy has moved from the comprehensive coverage of nuclear regulation with radioactive waste as an integral, but minor player, in the nuclear energy process to particular consideration with radioactive waste requiring specific regulation. This paper identifies the vectors that determine the direction of the policy governing radioactive waste, the moves toward consolidation of international policy separate from the body of existing nuclear law and future direction that will clear the way for a sustained, appropriate use of nuclear energy.",,"Nuclear safety; Radioactive waste management; Accident prevention; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Health risks; Laws and legislation; Nuclear energy; Radiation protection; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive waste storage; Sustainable development; Waste management; Radioactive wastes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16544366452

The benefits range from reduced excess noise factor, increased abruptness in the breakdown probability, as well as an increase in the bandwidth. The key mechanism for the improved performance is the significant reduction of the first dead space in the ionization process. The dead space is the minimum distance a carrier must travel before acquiring sufficient kinetic energy enabling it to impact ionize. The reduction of the first dead space has the effect of localizing the first impact ionization and forcing it to occur quickly near the edge of the multiplication region. This, in turn, will have the effect of nearly inducing two avalanche processes which run in parallel and whose combination will yield the total gain. In this paper, a theoretical model for the avalanche multiplication is utilized to examine the fundamental limits of the gain-bandwidth product in light of the initial-energy effect in practical APD structures.","Dead space; Excess noise factor; Frequency response; Gain-bandwidth product; Heterostructure APDs; Impact ionization; Initial-energy effect; Ionization threshold energy; Thin avalanche photodiodes","Avalanche photodiodes (APD); Dead space; Excess noise factor; Gain-bandwidth product; Heterostructure APD; Initial-energy effect; Ionization threshold energy; Bandwidth; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Frequency response; Heterojunctions; Impact ionization; Ionization; Multilayers; Phonons; Photodiodes; Avalanche diodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642513780

Due to that 90% of its electricity is produced by hydropower plants. The Brazilian hydropower system has four major sub- systems, North, Northeast, Southeast and South, with 61,000 MW of installed capacity. The São Francisco river system is located in the Northeast area and has seven power plants with three storage and six run of river reservoirs. It has 10,229 MW of installed capacity and it is the biggest system in the Northeast, Brazil. The São Francisco drainage area is 640,000 square km and its water resources are used for energy, irrigation, water supply and navigation. During the rainy season the three storage reservoirs are used for flood control. Part of the São Francisco basin is located in a very dry and poor area. There are many irrigation projects designed for the dry areas, including a huge water transfer system from São Francisco River to the neighbor basins. Due to that the conflict between irrigation, flood control and energy is increasing. In order to analyze these conflicts a multi purpose non linear model for multi reservoir operation was developed. The multi objective model uses the constraint methodology. Considering different scenarios for irrigation demands and flood control volumes a set of trade-off curves were calculated. These graphs show the relationship between three purposes: energy, irrigation and flood control and can support the decision processes on the São Francisco system operation. This paper shows the multi purpose model, its methodology and its preliminary results.

Storage, memory, processing, and communications bandwidth are all relatively plentiful and inexpensive. What is the next frontier for communications networks and performance evaluation? I will argue that it is power management to achieve cost-effective operation. In the past few years, entirely new network protocols have been developed for battery-hungry sensor networks. But, what about the existing Internet? Estimates place the Internet as consuming from 2% to 8% of the total electricity produced in the USA - much of this power consumption is unnecessary. Do our ""always on"" desktop computers really need to be fully powered-up all the time? What can be done to achieve power-savings in these computers? The goal is to eliminate unnecessary energy usage by desktop computers in the near future and by networked embedded systems in the longer term. Traffic characterization is the first step towards this goal. Traffic characterization at inter-flow, intra-flow, and protocol levels is being done to investigate power management. The resulting savings achievable from relatively simple power management schemes are measured in TWh per year - or roughly equivalent to the electricity generated by one nuclear power plant.

Such applications include international border security, perimeter defense of military installations, nuclear and other critical facilities, as well as detection of chemical or bio-terrorism attacks.

The proposed method is based on the power aware scheduling algorithm that controls DRAM modules in coarse grain in which the scheduler assigns appropriate power modes to memory banks at context switching time. The method controls the transition of multiple power modes, which is currently available technology, based on the history of gaining processor and memory bank usage of each process.

And with the speed up of the machine system, the fusing of toner on the paper gets more difficult. So the toner which can be fused in lower energy is expected. There are still several ways for that problem. To use low Tg and low Tm resin for binder is the typical one for instance, but there is a barrier to improve more by just controlling the Tg and Tm of the resin. In NIP18 the effect of crystalline polyester for low energy fusing was reported; the properties of the toner that contains crystalline polyester, the quantitative effect of crystalline polyester for toner, the effect of the dispersion size of crystalline polyester in toner and the way to disperse the crystalline polyester. In this report, by controlling the kinds of monomers and the reaction hours, various kinds of crystalline polyester are prepared. And the effects of its melting point and molecular weight for the fusing ability and the storage stability of toner are investigated. Also the property of the toner which contains the crystalline polyester with small amount of the monomer which has a long chain is investigated. As the result, one type of crystalline polyester, which is better for toner, is reported.",,"Copying; Crystalline materials; Energy utilization; Melting; Molecular weight; Monomers; Polyesters; Printers (computer); Printing; Resins; Copiers; Fusing ability; Ink",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642365775

For example, when the size of compressed data is smaller than page size, internal fragmentation occurs, and this degrades the effectiveness of compression seriously. To reduce internal fragmentation, the compression unit should be sufficiently large. However, larger compression unit induces longer read and write latencies for random accessing. We, therefore, present a novel compressed page management scheme that stores several small compressed pages to one physical page by using a write buffer. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly expand storage capacity without having to delay read and write latencies.","Data compression; Flash memory; Latency reduction","Cameras; Computer simulation; Data compression; Data reduction; Data storage equipment; Energy utilization; Input output programs; Logic gates; Magnetic disk storage; Digital cameras; Latency reduction; Flash memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642339702

Predictive filter cache based instruction cache hierarchy is effective in reducing the access energy substantially at the cost of certain performance degradation. Here, the energy-delay product reduction heavily depends on the prediction accuracy of the predictor. In this paper, a simplified pattern prediction algorithm, which maximizes power savings in the novel filter cache prediction hierarchy, is proposed. The prediction mechanism relies on the static nature of the hit or miss pattern of the instruction access stream over the past filter cache line accesses. These static patterns are stored in a 32-entry single-bit Pattern Table (PT). The entries could be dynamically changed during run time to provide options for real-time adaptation in a complex application. The proposed prediction algorithm results in better prediction for all the benchmarks simulated. Energy delay product reduction of up to 8.19% over existing NFPT prediction scheme was reported for the benchmarks simulated.","Filter-Cache; Hit-Miss Pattern; NFPT; Static Pattern Prediction","Benchmarking; Computer simulation; Electric power utilization; Energy dissipation; Microprocessor chips; Real time systems; Filter-cache; Static pattern prediction; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642310639

In this paper we present investigations of light-induced kinetics of dye degradation. Magenta, black and cyan dyes are irradiated on typical glossy and matt media using a Xenon lamp and the decrease of remission intensity with irradiation time is recorded using UV-Vis spectroscopy. Most dye kinetics can be described as 1st order reaction at least in the beginning of the reaction. From temperature dependence of 1st order kinetics we are able to determine activation energies for the decay process allowing us a detailed media-dependent comparison of kinetic behaviour. Furthermore an analysis of UV-Vis spectra show that not only one single degradation channel is responsible for light fading processes. In order to define the contribution of oxidative nonlight induced processes UV-Vis data of dark storage under oxidative atmosphere are compared in shape and intensity allowing a separation of light and oxidative decay channels. For most ink-paper combinations a superposition of light-induced and oxidative mechanisms are likely. Using activation energies as parameter for dye-paper stability also the influence of room humidity on stability of inkjet prints can be estimated.",,"Activation energy; Atmospheric humidity; Catalysis; Degradation; Dyes; Environmental impact; Ink; Irradiation; Oxidation; Ozone; Paper; Pigments; Reaction kinetics; Xenon; Inkjet papers; Remission curves; Printing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642304025

To address the memory gap, computer designers implement caches to reduce the high memory latencies that are observed in the processor. Due to the ever increasing instruction window sizes and issue widths in new microprocessor designs, designers will need to implement multiported caches in order to be able service multiple memory requests per clock cycle. Several studies have been conducted in previous work dealing with the performance in terms of Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) for such cache designs. However, little is known about the access time, the energy consumption and the required chip area for multiported caches.

The mobile nature of these devices causes a new set of problems not seen in conventional wired networks. Mobile devices can go off-line, experience network outages, have batteries with limited power-life, and require energy efficient components. As users start to move their application to these devices, it becomes to have a middleware infrastructure that can integrate the different data held by mobiles users. Unfortunately, existing middleware technologies are ill-equipped to overcome these new set of problems since they are designed for application that reside in workstations and mainframes. To address these issues, we are developing NetTraveler, a database middleware system to integrate mobile devices reliably in a computer network. In this paper, we present the Registration Server for NetTraveler. Registration Servers are directory managers, located at cooperative local execution environments (e.g. LANs) that work together to keep track of moving data sources and route query request as appropriate. Registration Servers are implemented as Java Web Services. We describe the architecture of the Registration Server, define its tasks, operational modes, and discuss the current state of our prototype.","Database Middleware; Internet Architectures; NetTraveler; Web Services","Internet architecture; NetTraveler; Registration serversd; Computational methods; Java programming language; Mobile telecommunication systems; Query languages; Servers; Software prototyping; Systems analysis; World Wide Web; Middleware",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542642775

Two circuit topologies including a high-voltage device based multilevel and a hybrid approach that mixes with conventional transformer and solid-state circuitry are proposed. Simulation results are then showing how some of the key features can be achieved. Finally the cost of semiconductor is surveyed to project the cost of the entire solid-state distribution transformer.

The R&amp;D processes include the developments of superconducting material technologies and technologies for cooling the materials. By using a GERT (Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique) based method, we have analyzed the completion year of the superconducting power application technologies stochastically. All the evaluated application technology developments were expected to be completed until the year in the range between 2011 and 2014 with relatively high success probabilities of approximately 0.8, except for the 10MWh class SMES technology using 77 K level superconducting material of which completion year is 2020 with a low success probability of 0.39. The developments of superconducting material technologies are more important than those of the cooling technologies for accelerating the development processes of all the application technologies using 77 K level superconducting, except for the superconducting cable technology.

The main feature of this circuit is the bulk capacitance and using two control loops and multiplier in control circuit that assures its nonlinearity. In conventional power electronics, stability is interpreted as a condition in which the system operating in the expected periodic regime. Then, all those Subharmonic, quasi-periodic, period doubling, chaos considered undesirable and should be avoided. Therefore this is unstable regimes, even though perfectly predictable. In this paper, the boost PFC converter stability is discussed from the bifurcation point of view. Two nonlinear phenomena are counted in PFC circuit, period doubling bifurcation and chaos. This paper addresses a study for the most important phenomena in PFC converter, period doubling bifurcation. A new proposed technique for understanding and analysis this phenomenon is introduced depending on the capacitor storage energy. The storage energy on the output capacitor is a signal for the output voltage and the input current. Steady state operation means zero storage energy; charge and discharge energy are equal every one-line cycle. Zero storage energy is achieved in double-line cycles instead of one in period doubling bifurcation case. As the load lessens, a required extra storage power is needed to achieve the significant increase in the output voltage. If the PFC system can provide this extra energy, the operation will reach stability with new zero-storage energy else the system will have double-line zero energy that is period doubling bifurcation. The details of the proposed method are introduced and its validity is proved with simulation, experiment and mathematical analysis.",,"Bifurcation (mathematics); Capacitance; Capacitors; Chaos theory; Computer simulation; Electric current regulators; Electric loads; Electric potential; Electric power factor correction; Harmonic analysis; Power electronics; Control circuits; Feedback voltage; Electric converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542359978

These models are derived from previous analyses of residential and commercial building systems supported by data collected from the End-Use Load and Consumer Assessment Program (ELCAP) undertaken by the Bonneville Power Administration from 1983 to 1990. Preliminary results of using these models in distribution system simulations indicate that non-obvious, complex behavior patterns can emerge when consumers are confronted with varying price signals.","Adaptive systems; Complexity theory; Home appliances; Load modeling; Power distribution; Power system simulation","Computer simulation; Domestic appliances; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Mathematical models; Complexity theory; Load modeling; Power system simulation; Electric power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542359900

The large net on-die decoupling capacitance used to address this noise throughout the chip consumes substantial area and can cause a large leakage current. This paper proposes microarchitectural techniques to reduce high-frequency current variability, reducing the need for decoupling capacitors. We observe that we can control inductive noise by reducing current variability either in space (i.e., variability in usage of circuit blocks) or in time (i.e., variability within a circuit block across clock cycles). We propose pipeline muffling, a novel technique to reduce changes in the number of resources being utilized by controlling instruction issue, trading off some energy and performance to control di/dt in space. We also extend a previous technique, which incurs performance and energy degradation, and propose a priori current ramping to allow the current of a resource to ramp up ahead of usage, with virtually no performance loss, and ramp down immediately after usage, with little energy loss. Our techniques guarantee a worst-case bound on the di/dt, which is required to reduce the demand for decoupling capacitors, saving area and reducing leakage.","A Priori Current Ramping; Decoupling Capacitors; Inductive Noise; Leakage; Pipeline Muffling","A priori current ramping; Decoupling capacitors; Inductive noise; Pipline muffling; Circuit noise; Current variability; De-coupling capacitance; Decoupling capacitor; Frequency; High-frequency current; Micro architectures; Performance loss; Benchmarking; Buffer storage; Capacitance; Capacitors; Electric potential; Energy dissipation; Leakage currents; Noise abatement; Sensors; Capacitors; Clocks; Electric network analysis; Energy dissipation; Low power electronics; Microprocessor chips; Noise abatement; Packaging; Power electronics; Microprocessor chips; Pipelines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542359145

In order to generate a super high V T device, the 2-D halo doping profile was optimized considering different nanometer regime leakage mechanisms. The transition latency and energy overhead associated with FBB could be minimized by (i) waking up the SRAM cells ahead of the access and (ii) exploiting the cache access pattern.

Government analysis of this problem has shown that the existing energy infrastructure is fatally vulnerable to deliberate disruption, as well as accidents and inadvertent failures. However, these risks can be substantially mitigated with an energy system that costs less, works better and benefits the environment. The key is the efficient use of energy provided by diverse and dispersed distributed energy resources. This paper will describe a novel approach to applying distributed generation in critical information and communication facilities in order to provide primary power on a continuous basis with only a 1% chance of failure over its 20-year lifespan. While this approach uses any distributed power generation technology, it is unique in the way that it combines power sources and distributes the power to multiple loads.

At the same time, the data integrity of words coming out of the caches can have serious consequences on the ability of a program to execute correctly, or even to proceed. The integrity checks need to be performed in a time-sensitive manner to not slow down the execution when there are no errors as in the common case, and should not excessively increase the power budget of the caches which is already high. ECC and parity-based protection techniques in use today fall at either extremes in terms of compromising one criteria for another, i.e., reliability for performance or vice-versa. This paper proposes a novel solution to this problem by allowing in-cache replication, wherein reliability can be enhanced without excessively slowing down cache accesses or requiring significant area cost increases. The mechanism is fairly power efficient in comparison to other alternatives as well. In particular, the solution replicates data that is in active use within the cache itself while evicting those that may not be needed in the near future. Our experiments show that a large fraction of the data read from the cache have replicas available with this optimization.",,"Buffer storage; Computational methods; Computer simulation; Costs; Energy utilization; Error detection; Hardware; Optimization; Reliability; In-cache replication (ICR); Speculative loads; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542300175

The primary application that immediately comes to mind is that for standby or UPS use, but that is not the only application for stationary batteries. Currently, changes are underway where large stationary batteries are being used in grid-tied cycling applications for Distributed Energy Resource systems. The current IEEE standards developed for standby application do not apply to these new stationary applications, but many engineers are totally unaware of the not-so-subtle differences in standby battery and cycling battery O&M requirements. The purpose of this paper is to introduce engineers who will be using stationary batteries in cycling applications to the differences in battery system management standards currently in use in the IEEE to preclude the improper application of standards for standby applications with those intended for cycling applications.","Batteries; Battery storage plants; Emergency power supplies; Energy storage; Standards","Distributed parameter control systems; Electric charge; Electric energy storage; Electric power plants; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Failure analysis; Lead acid batteries; Maintainability; Standards; Battery storage plants; Cycling batteries; Emergency power supplies; Power engineering; Standby power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542299803

A methodology was developed to compute the steady-state heat-loss rate of a component based on the first-law of thermodynamics for flowing multi-component reactive mixtures and on gas temperature and exhaust-gas concentration measurements across the component. Most of the energy loss of the exhaust occurred in the turbocharger, as expected, followed by losses in the takedown section, the tailpipe, the closed-couple catalyst, and the underbody Lean-NOx-Trap (LNT), which had the least energy loss. The heat transfer for the takedown-pipe and tailpipe were very well correlated with standard equations of the form Nusselt No. = a(Reynolds No.)b. The augmentation in heat-loss rates at the takedown-pipe and tailpipe over that of a steady-state, fully developed, turbulent, pipe-flow was relatively modest in contrast to the findings of an earlier study. All the catalytic exothermic energy release came from the closed-coupled catalyst while the underfloor LNT relied solely on convective heating. The fuel step transient tests at constant speed indicated the importance of thermal storage of the metal walls during cold start. © IMechE 2003.","Correlations; Diesel; Exhaust-system; Experimental; Heat-transfer; Light-duty","Concentration (process); Correlation methods; Diesel engines; Energy dissipation; Heat transfer; Light weight vehicles; Nusselt number; Reynolds number; Thermodynamics; Correlations; Diesel; Exhaust-system; Experimental; Light-duty; Exhaust systems (engine)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14944363590

A simple topology modification, i.e. the addition of two input inductors, and appropriate control methods permit to control simultaneously and accurately the output voltage and the input current, performing a new single stage SMPS. The circuit behaviour is strongly dependent on the output power level, as occurs with almost all single stage converters with power factor correction. In light load conditions, the voltage in the storage capacitor remains uncontrollable, even if an highly distorted input current is acceptable. This fact limits the use of those converters to some few applications where the ratio ""nominal output power / minimum output power"" is small, or when the converter can be switched off when the capacitor voltage is excessive. A different solution is presented in this paper, that consists in the addition of a static input switch, obtained by the replacement of two diodes in the input bridge rectifier by a pair of thyristors.

To date, they have periodically been studied for a number of applications such as x-ray generators, high-power rf sources, and trigger generators. [2-6] In this current research effort, these devices have been revisited and studied for a variety of applications. In this work, we developed a theoretical description of the vector inversion generator, extracted design guidelines from the theory, established a relevant switch and materials database for various applications, and designed and constructed highly efficient devices using the developed methodology. These spiral-line VIGs that take electrostatically stored energy and convert it to high-power, high-frequency electromagnetic energy in essentially a one-component, one-step process have been built, characterized, and evaluated as a potential power source for several military and NASA applications. We concentrated on minimal size with maximum generated power in both single pulse and repetitive operation. In this paper, we will show that there is a functional relationship between the value of diameter to number of turns ratio (D/n) and the voltage efficiency. This is understandable in the context that for a given diameter, the diameter determines the characteristic ""speed"" of the ""slow"" part of the VIG while the length which is directly proportional to the number of turns determines the characteristic ""speed"" of the fast side. Thus, the D/n ratio is a measure of the ratio of the high/low frequency components of the generator. From a series of devices constructed here, the efficiency of the units doubled as the D/n ratio varied from 1 to approximately 6. Also, in this paper, we will talk about potential applications of this technology and will give point-designs that were used to construct and test devices for these applications.",,"Vector inversion generators (VIG); Voltage efficiency; Database systems; Electric discharges; Electric energy storage; Electromagnetism; Electrostatics; Ferromagnetic materials; Military applications; Space research; Switching; Voltage measurement; Electric power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442356521

To reduce the size and weight of high voltage components, increase in the energy density in dielectrics at high electric stress is required. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the hold-off voltage and breakdown properties of liquid dielectrics can lead to the optimization of energy storage. When breakdown is initiated in liquid dielectrics, vapor bubbles are generated, which first expand and later collapse. The total time of expansion and collapse of these bubbles determines the repetition rate, at which high voltage switches can be operated. In this paper, a Blumlein pulse forming network (PFN) and sphere-plane electrode configuration is used for studying a pulsed discharge in water. The diameter of the spherical electrode is 1.7mm and the gap distance between the electrodes is several hundred micrometers. The temporal development of the optical emission in the UV and visible after breakdown was measured by means of an imaging spectrograph. The radiation intensity reaches its maximum 5ns after breakdown. It remains at this level for about 100ns, and then the light intensity decreases to 30% of its peak value on a 10ns time scale. The current was found to be 800A during the pulse. The radiation spectrum of the plasma in the bubble during the 100ns after breakdown was also measured. No line radiation was observed. The measured spectrum was found to follow a blackbody radiation law. Therefore by comparing the measured spectrum with that of calculated blackbody radiation at different temperatures, the plasma temperature was determined. It was found to be in the 1-2 eV range.",,"Blackbody radiation; Pulse forming network (PFN); Computer simulation; Dielectric materials; Electric impedance; Electric power systems; Electric switches; Emission spectroscopy; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Photomultipliers; Plasmas; Pulse generators; Spectrographs; Switching; Electric discharges",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442355436

Since the prime energy is built into the MFCG in form of HE, the capacitor looses even more ground if the necessary prime energy source and the charging supply are included in the weight/ volume balance. However, simple MFCGs with a single helix produce high output energy only into low inductance loads, thus producing several 100 kA of current at a voltage level of only a few 10 kV. Many pulsed power devices require less current but a considerably higher voltage level. Two approaches for achieving a higher output voltage level, both utilizing two staged MFCGs, have been reported in the open literature. The first employs a more traditional transformer coupling, the second relies on a dynamic transformer or flux-trapping scheme. Although the traditional transformer coupling has theoretically the better efficiency, we chose the latter approach for our generator design, mostly since it requires a smaller number of components. Our generator has a total length of 250 mm, a helix inner diameter of 51 mm, and is wound with Teflon insulated stranded wire of different sizes in the range from AWG 12 to AWG 22.

The Marx is switched into two parallel 7 nF, intermediate storage capacitors, which are fired into a dummy load through a fast multi-channeling output switch. The Marx stores 100 kJ and can deliver a voltage of 2 MV at 500 kA into a 4 Ω load delivering 1 TW to the load.

The goal is to adapt an existing multichanneling switch to create a multichanneling output switch with significant operational advantages, including lower inductance, compared to existing multichannel switches. The target switch inductance is 100 nH or less. The facility and tank were assembled from January to June 2003, with testing to begin in July 2003.

The 2.4 MJ PPS consists of 8 modular capacitor banks (CB) with energy of 300 kJ each. The 300kJ CB modules are designed to operate independently and have a charging voltage of 22 kV and a current capability of 150kA. In the course of the application of the PPS, several modifications and improvement have been done in order to enhance safety and reliability. In this paper, we summarized some problems that take place during multiple modules operation and suggested the countermeasures against the problems.

Otherwise, there would be significant module-to-module variations and a loss of consistency at the central target region. Sandia has explored two solutions for operating the ZR Marx generators to meet this requirement. One method involves charging the ZR banks to about 72 kV along with the 90-kV charge for the Z banks, thus requiring two power supplies and charge busses plus a different SF6 pressure in the Marx switches. The other method is to short or bypass an appropriate number of ZR Marx stages so the remaining ""reduced"" Marx generator may be charged to the same 90-kV level. Some hardware, labor, and bank inductance tuning are needed to match output timing to the original pulsed power. This paper examines how to implement both solutions and compares their advantages and disadvantages with the goal of choosing only one of them. Models supporting this effort take into account measurements obtained from existing Marx generators that have been reconfigured in similar ways.",,"Capacitors; Computer simulation; Electric energy storage; Electric potential; Electric switches; Inductance; Waveform analysis; Power supplies; Pulsed power; Electric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442355338

The investigated devices are press-pack IGBT modules with a blocking voltage of 2.5 kV and a continuous current rating of 2 kA. Using capacitive energy storage systems the IGBT was investigated as closing switch with the objective of generating short current pulses with high amplitudes, as they are e. g. required for driving a High Power Microwave (HPM) source. Inductive energy storage systems have a higher energy density than capacitive systems. The drawback, however, is the need of opening switches in order to commutate the current into the load. For such a system we investigated the turn-off behaviour of the IGBT. The experiments show that the IGBT modules used are capable to generate 12 kA pulses with switching times below one microsecond. Investigating the IGBT as opening switch in an inductive storage circuit has proved its superiority over comparable switching configurations using power MOSFETs. Comparing IGBT and MOSFET configurations with the same total die size and same on-state resistance and therefore same price allows to gain advantage from a much higher commutation voltage in case of the IGBT, which in turn allows for a much shorter commutation time.",,"Capacitor storage; Capacitors; Electric loads; Electric resistance; Electric switches; Microwave devices; MOSFET devices; Pulse generators; Thyristors; Waveform analysis; Inductive storage circuits; Solid state switches; Insulated gate bipolar transistors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442331973

Eight years ago, it was designed for delivering to an ET load the energy of 500kJ in a shot. This paper gives an updated status of this facility. The IPS is battery-based. Originally, the battery had a peak power of 5MW and was able to charge a cylindrical coil to 700kJ. The batteries degradation during the years was observed and documented. Fringe fields of Brooks-type coils with and without screens were analyzed. A conclusion is drawn that a screen of reasonable weight cannot reduce the stray field below a susceptibility level of electronic devices that should be shielded individually. A major facility improvement was in the field of switching. A compact hybrid repetitive opening switch (HOS) rated 50kA, 7kV was developed. This HOS can be used in long-charge inductive storage systems that look promising for many applications, such as uninterruptible power supplies, driving ET loads, protection of DC circuits, etc. The HOS design and testing is given in detail. The design limitations and trade-offs are discussed. A commercial vacuum circuit breaker serves as the first stage. It provides the high-current carrying capability during the inductor charge. At a desired moment, it is opened, and the current is transferred to the second stage comprising two gate commutated thyristors (GCTs) connected in series; they break the current during several microseconds. A pause of 1-2ms is provided for the vacuum breaker recovery.

The project entails the extension of methods and techniques that have been developed for high performance control of relatively small and slow turning industrial machines, to the more demanding regime of AC-machines used for kinetic energy storage and fast AC-servos for military applications. One of these techniques is a rotational transformation, where the (sinusoidal) AC output voltage of an alternator is converted to a DC level representing the instantaneous amplitude. This transformation, also called 'Vector Rotation' can be used for very fast observation of the momentary amplitudes of all electrical machine quantities, since no averaging is necessary. Through the use of vector rotations, advanced sensors and real time signal processing it is possible to demonstrate fast real-time monitoring of the energy extraction from a high frequency AC-Alternator with a full-bridge SCR converter. A low-voltage DC machine was selected as the load for the system, which closely resembles the transient impedance of an electric launcher.",,"Electric launchers; Position encoder; Electric converters; Electric loads; Energy storage; Kinetic energy; Microcontrollers; Military applications; Sensors; Signal encoding; Signal processing; Thyristors; Transients; Synchronous generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442331907

For the Z upgrade, the desired capacitance value in each case is different than those built before, and double that of the existing units in Z. The cost and fundamental importance of the Marx capacitors in pulsers like Z prompted the decision to build a test facility that could evaluate sample units from capacitor manufacturers. The number of interested vendors and the expected lifetime indicated about 350 thousand capacitor-shots for the capacitors in a plus-minus configuration. The project schedule demanded that the initial testing be completed in a few months. These factors, and budget limitations, pointed to the need for a system that could test multiple pairs of capacitors at once, without a full-time attendant. The system described here tests up to ten pairs of 2.6 μF capacitors charged to 100 kV in 90 seconds, then discharged at 150 kA and 35 percent reversal.

To protect the HER and LER beam lines in the event of a ring component failure, each ring has an abort kicker system which directs the beam into a dump when a failure is detected. Due to the high current of the beams, the beam kick is tapered from 100% to 80% in 7.33 μS (the beam transit time around the ring). This taper distributes the energy evenly across the window which separates the ring from the beam dump such that the window is not damaged. The abort kicker trigger is synchronized with the ion clearing gap of the beam allowing for the kicker field to rise from 0-80% while there is no beam in the kicker magnet. Originally the kicker system was designed for a rise time of 370nS, but because the ion clearing gap was reduced in half, so was the rise time requirement for the kicker.

We also evaluate how these trade-offs can be propagated to the memory module level, so we can minimise the power consumption of the entire memory organisation (i.e., memories and connections between them). Our approach is that at future technology nodes the delay problem can be handled at the application level, so given any delay slack obtained at that level, we can exploit it to make the switching on the interconnect wires slower and thus less energy consuming. In this way, we have shown that for real-life applications the power consumption at future technology nodes can be reduced by about 34%, when compared to the option provided by the ITRS roadmap. This is achieved by, instead of using the very fast and power hungry wires, selectively using slower and thinner interconnect wires while still meeting the application real-time constraints.","Interconnect wire processing; Intra/inter-memory interconnect; Pareto-optimal energy/delay interconnect exploration","Capacitance; Constraint theory; Data storage equipment; Data transfer; Electric resistance; Logic design; Parallel processing systems; Systems analysis; Delay interconnect exploration; Interconnect wire processing; Intra/inter-memory interconnect; Pareto-optimal energy; Interconnection networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442327876

The proposed converter exhibits some advantages like; single-switch per phase, common return point of phase switches, snubberless operation, and four-quadrant operation simply by changing phase firing sequence and position.

The main application is presently rapid charging of the capacitors inside of compact Marx generators for rep-rated operation. Compact Marx generators produce output pulses with amplitudes above 300kV with ns or sub-ns rise-times. A typical application is the generation of High Power Microwaves. Initially all energy storage capacitors in a Marx generator are charged in parallel. During the so-called erection cycle, the capacitors are connected in series. The charging voltage in the parallel configuration is around 40-50kV. The input voltage of our charger is in the range of several hundred volts. Rapid charging of the capacitors in the parallel configuration will enable a high pulse repetition-rate of the compact Marx generator. The high power charger uses state-of-the-art IGBTs (Isolated Gate Bipolar Transistors) in an H-Bridge topology and a compact, high frequency transformer.

Each switch is capable of transferring approximately a quarter of the main bank charge flow without damage. Therefore, if a single switch pre-fires it is subject to much greater stress than it is able to tolerate.

For laboratory systems, capacitor banks have traditionally been used to provide this energy, but field applications require a system with significantly higher energy storage density. Rotating machines that store the energy in the form of rotational kinetic energy and can quickly convert it to high-current electrical energy have been designed and built. These low-impedance multi-phase, multi-pole synchronous generators are referred to as pulsed alternators. The AC output of the pulsed alternator is rectified to provide DC to power the railgun, and the design of the rectifier set and control circuitry is very dependent on the alternator characteristics. To facilitate the design and evaluation of the overall pulsed power system, a modeling tool which accurately represents the performance of the pulsed alternator while allowing easy changes to the external circuitry and controls is needed. This paper describes a manner in which these pulsed alternators can be accurately modeled. The validity of the model is established by comparing it to experimental data gathered from the ""Subscale"" alternator built by the Center for Electromechanics at The University of Texas under the Focused Technology Program (FTP).",,"Mutual inductance; Pulsed alternators; Rotational kinetic energy; Self-inductance; Computer simulation; Electric conductivity; Electric currents; Electric impedance; Electric inductors; Flywheels; Kinetic energy; Machine windings; Magnetic circuits; Magnetic cores; Mathematical models; Rotating machinery; Torque control; Synchronous generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442283048

Several kAs pulse current was supplied from 8.28 μF storage capacitor to the 50 μm thickness titanium foil which was sandwiched between the A1 2O3 tiles with various pressures. The temperature of the foil was rapidly increased owing to ohmic heating with the large current, and then the foil was liquefied and vaporized.

The bonding strength increases with increasing the energy input to the foil. However, the foil explosion cracked the tiles when the input energy exceeds a critical value. Increasing the circuit inductance from 1.13 μH to 64.8 μH, the critical energy of tile cracking increases from 160 J to 507 J. The maximum bonding strength of 3200 N was obtained when the circuit inductance was 21.8 μH. An investigation of the interfacial structure of the joints using electron probe microanalysis revealed that distinct reaction areas existed in the interlayer.",,"Alumina; Bond strength (materials); Capacitors; Ceramic materials; Crack initiation; Energy efficiency; Energy transfer; Inductance; Joining; Microstructure; Shear strength; Vaporization; Electron probe micro analysis (EPMA); Ignitron closing switch (IGS); Metal foil",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442281885

The proposed scheme uses dual voltage controllers, one of the voltage controller having low bandwidth operates only during steady condition, other voltage controller with high bandwidth operates during the transient condition. At any given instant only one voltage controller is in circuit. Lower bandwidth controller, operating during steady state condition, maintains the THD within the required limits and the dc-bus voltage at its reference value. High bandwidth controller improves the transient performance by having faster response to the disturbance. Faster response to disturbances necessitates less energy storage in the dc-bus capacitor, hence a smaller capacitance value is required which resulting in a compact and a light-weight circuit. The comparative study between the proposed scheme and the conventional PFC circuit is carried out. The experimental results for the proposed scheme are also presented.","Boost Topology; Dual voltage controller; Power factor correction (PFC)","Boost topology; Dual voltage controller; Power factor correction (PFC); Bandwidth; Capacitance; Electric network topology; Electric power factor correction; Harmonic distortion; Voltage control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442280384

In the formulation, the absorption of both the recording light and the sensitizing light is included. The results for optimizing the holographic recording are similar to those obtained by the previous steady-state solving. In this paper, therefore, a special attention is paid on the time-space evolution of the intensity and phase distributions of the induced space-charge fields and the exciting interference pattern of the two beams for recording or the readout and diffracted beams for coherent erasing. It is interesting to find that during the time development of hologram there is a spatially changed direction of energy transferring between the two-coupled beams, which depends spatially on the relative phase difference between the induced space-charge field and the exciting interference pattern. The energy transferring direction will be reversed as the relative phase difference becomes opposite in the sign. As a result, the spatial figures of the isophase and the recording or recorded holographic fringes are depicted, which gives a full understanding for the formation of photorefractive hologram in LiNbO3:Fe:Mn.","Band-transport model; Coupled-wave theory; LiNbO3:Fe:Mn; Photorefractive volume hologram","Crystals; Differential equations; Doping (additives); Electric space charge; Electromagnetic wave diffraction; Energy transfer; Light interference; Lithium niobate; Optical data storage; Optimization; Photorefractive materials; Coupled-wave theory; Space-charge fields; Holography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242263378

In these files, the basic unit of data is an event. Analysis is typically performed on a selected set of events. The files containing these events have to be located, copied from mass storage systems to disks before analysis, and removed when no longer needed. These file management tasks are tedious and time consuming. Typically, all events contained in the files are read into memory before a selection is made. Since the time to read the events dominate the overall execution time, reading the unwanted event needlessly increases the analysis time. The Grid Collector is a set of software modules that works together to address these two issues. It automates the file management tasks and provides ""direct"" access to the selected events for analyses. It is currently integrated with the STAR analysis framework. The users can select events based on tags, such as, ""production date between March 10 and 20, and the number of charged tracks > 100."" The Grid Collector locates the files containing relevant events, transfers the files across the Grid if necessary, and delivers the events to the analysis code through the familiar iterators.

The μM detector is sensitive to X-rays, originating from a conversion of axion to photon in a strong magnetic field (9T), in the range of a few hundred eV to 10keV. Good detection efficiency, energy resolution, spatial resolution and extremely low background are the characteristics of this type of detector. The Data Acquisition of the Micromegas detector is presented here. The Front End cards are using multiplexed analog integrated circuits. A set of VME modules performs the readout that is expandable to read up to 2×19×2048 (77824) channels. The system has the capability to apply online, per individual channel, a threshold and a subsequent pedestal subtraction. At the CAST experiment rates the dead time is negligible. A PCI - MXI2 - VME interface is used to read out the data to a PC, to perform monitoring and to Display Events. The system is based on the National Instruments' LabView software and is running both in Windows 2000 and Linux operating systems. The data are automatically archived on storage media at the central CERN computing facilities and the PC clock is synchronized periodically with the GPS time using the CERN time servers. This allows the precise event time stamping for the possibility to correlate them to astrophysical phenomena. The precision of the clock update is of the order of 50μs.

In order to adapt to the changing spatial locality, we propose a Variable Line size Cached DRAM (VL-CDRAM) that can buffer portions of an accessed DRAM row.

Yet, each of these approaches yields a different reservoir model, so it is imperative that cutoffs be fit-for-purpose, i.e. they are compatible with the reservoir mechanism and with a systematic methodology for the evaluation of hydrocarbons in place and for the estimation of reserves. These different requirements are accommodated by basing the quantification of cut-offs on reservoir-specific criteria that govern the storage and flow of hydrocarbons. In so doing, particular attention is paid to the relationships between the identification of cut-offs and key elements of the contemporary systemic practice of integrated reservoir studies. The outcome is a structured approach to the use of cut-offs in the estimation of reserves. The principal benefits of a properly conditioned set of petrophysical cut-offs are a more exact characterization of the reservoir with a better synergy between the static and dynamic reservoir models, so that an energy company can more fully realize the asset value.",,"Petrophysics; Silicislastics; Carbonates; Computer simulation; Industrial economics; Mechanical permeability; Porosity; Porous materials; Petroleum reservoir engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1142288727

The increase in current with voltage was recorded up to the breakdown voltage, including the transition phase to breakdown. Schlieren diagnostics, with a temporal resolution of 2 ns, was used to study the changes in the index of refraction of water when it was used as the switch medium, both before and during breakdown. The results of our measurements showed that the electrodes determine, to a large extent, the hold-off voltage. By polishing the stainless steel electrodes, the breakdown strength was increased from 1 MV/cm to 2.2 MV/cm for propylene carbonate as dielectric. Similar increases were found for water as dielectric between polished electrodes. The rate of current rise after breakdown was measured as 4.5-1011 A/s for distilled water, a value which is comparable to that measured in gas switches. The Schlieren photographs showed that, depending on the polarity, the breakdown is preceded by the treeing of streamers into the gap.",,"Carbonates; Computer simulation; Current voltage characteristics; Dielectric properties; Electric breakdown; Electric energy storage; Electric fields; Electric impedance; Electrodes; Switching; Dielectric strength; Gas switches; Pulse generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10744233915

It is concluded that both technologies, while still too costly for a wide marked introduction, may already be beneficial for selected pilot applications such as, for SMES, custom power enhancement or, for FCL, closing bus ties and connecting independent energy providers (IEPs) to the transmission grid.","Energy storage; Fault current limiter; Solid-state witch; Superconductor; Voltage source converter","Costs; Electric converters; Electric energy storage; Electric fault currents; Electric potential; Electric power transmission; Superconducting magnets; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Limiters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0842288395

The purpose of this paper is to clarify the confusion that surrounds the selection of this device. Along with all the normal arrester characteristics that need to be taken into consideration, extra consideration must be given to the energy handling capabilities of the unit.

The secondary of the proposed transformer is composed of two windings, one of them equipped with a power electronic ac-ac converter. With the choice of proper turns ratio and the design of the PWM ac-ac converter, the proposed transformer has the following capabilities: (a) can compensate for 50% voltage sag and swells (b) can continuously shape the output voltage to be sinusoidal (low THD) even when the input voltage is highly distorted (c) can disconnect the load rapidly under fault conditions. The proposed approach does not employ any energy storage devices, such as large capacitors or inductors. The PWM ac-ac converter consists of four switching devices (IGBT) and is controlled with a four-step switching technique to achieve snubber-less operation.

In this paper, a novel control approach based on the single neuron algorithm is employed to realize an adaptive controller for the SMES unit connected to a power system. Motivation of designing such controller is to improve both the stability and the voltage regulation quality in a relatively wide operation range. The design procedure takes the advantage of multi-objective features and the simple computing configuration so as to be apt to the practical use.

A significant drawback to this system, however, is that the very systems that provide these advantages to the soldier also demand high quantities of energy. In order to design an adequate energy delivery system to support the operation of the soldier's enhanced equipment, the problem is broken down and analyzed into three general areas: energy demand, energy management, and energy source design. The aim of this paper is to introduce the reader to each of these three general areas, thereby providing a potential catalyst for future research and exploration into the design solution of adequate energy delivery systems.","And energy management; Batteries; Energy demand; Energy source; Fuel cells; Microturbines; Military; Modeling; Photovoltaic; Soldier systems; Thermoelectricity","Energy delivery systems; Energy supply; Human powered devices; Energy resources; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Global positioning system; Hand held computers; Helmet mounted displays; Internal combustion engines; Internet; Local area networks; Microphones; Military applications; Military operations; Photovoltaic cells; Thermoelectricity; User interfaces; Wireless telecommunication systems; Energy management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347593616

Solar powered absorption chillers use water heated by an array of solar collectors to boil a solution of lithium bromide and water. The energy transfer process between pressurized water heated by the solar collectors and the LiBr/H2O solution is the focus of this study. A method of augmenting the heat transfer in the generator was developed, bench tested and implemented in an operating 70kW solar HVAC system. The augmented design involved installing twisted stainless steel inserts in the tubes where the LiBr/H2O solution boils and refrigerant vapor is generated. The inserts increased the overall heat transfer coefficient between the heat medium in the shell side of the generator and the LiBr/H2O solution in the tubes. A solar-fired, double effect absorption chiller requires the collector array and storage tank to operate at temperatures in excess of 150°C. At these temperatures, the heating water must be at a pressure of about 700kPa to prevent it from boiling. This combination of high temperature and high pressure requires that the collectors, storage tanks, pumps, valves and piping be designed according to pressure vessel codes. This increases the initial cost of the system and also requires significant maintenance. The main objective of this work is to develop a method of lowering the requirements for a 150°C heating medium. The ultimate goal is to operate at about 120°C while maintaining the Coefficient of Performance and cooling capacity of the absorption chiller. The results presented in this paper show that the generator with twisted inserts can operate with an average log mean temperature difference of 10°C. The average COP of the chiller is about 1.0 and the chiller provided all of the cooling required by a 743 m2 building. Without the twisted inserts, the generator operated with a temperature difference of 22 to 28°C. The inserts provide significant reduction in the operating temperature of the solar collectors and do not adversely affect the performance of the double effect absorption chiller.",,"Absorption chillers; Volumetric flow; Absorption; Cooling; Costs; Electric generators; Energy transfer; Heat transfer; Heating; High pressure effects; High temperature effects; Solar collectors; Stainless steel; Vapors; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347593615

The present study investigates both experimentally and numerically the natural convection loss from the aperture of open cavity receivers used in paraboloidal dish concentrators. The aim of this study is to quantitatively determine the relationship between convection loss to various pertinent parameters such as ambient temperature, operating temperature, cavity inclination and cavity geometry. The experimental investigation was based on an isothermal electrically heated model receiver, with a test temperature of 450°C. The model receiver is tested at inclinations varying from 0° (cavity facing the side) to 90°(cavity facing straight down). With the numerical work the commercial CFD software package, Fluent 6.0 was used to model cavity convection losses. The range of input parameters used is similar to those of the experimental model. In addition, two cases of full-scaled receivers currently used in ANU dishes are considered. The accuracy concerning grid structure and grid resolution of the numerical model is also discussed. The numerical results obtained are qualitatively in good agreement with those predicted by various previously proposed correlations.

However, many conditions under which energy demands are estimated have some uncertainty at the design stage. Therefore, designers should consider that energy demands have some uncertainty, evaluate the robustness in the performance under uncertain energy demands, and design plants rationally in consideration of the robustness. The authors have developed a robust optimal design method based on the minimax regret criterion for the single-stage planning of energy supply plants. In this paper, the method is extended for the multistage expansion planning. Under uncertain energy demands increasing stepwise, equipment capacities and utility contract demands as well as energy flow rates for each expansion period are determined in consideration of their sequential relationships to minimize the maximum regret in the annual total cost and satisfy all the possible energy demands for all the expansion periods. Through a case study on a gas turbine cogeneration plant for district energy supply, features of the economic robustness and the robust optimal design are clarified in relation to the uncertainty in energy demands and the numbers of years for the expansion periods.","Cogeneration; Minimax Regret Criterion; Multistage Expansion; Optimization; Robust Design","Minimum regret criterion; Multistage expansion; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Gas turbines; Natural gas; Optimization; Robustness (control systems); Cogeneration plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347577889

This paper investigates the feasibility of CO2 capture using the carbonation reaction of CaO ""in situ"" in a fluidised bed combustor, where natural gas or petroleum coke (or any other fuel with low ash content) is being burned. The sorbent can be partially regenerated for CO2 capture by combustion of part of the fuel with O2/CO2 in a separate FBC. The thermodynamic limits in the proposed cycles, in terms of CO 2 capture efficiencies, are examined along with the limits imposed by the rapid decay in the sorbent activity during repeated carbonation/calcination cycles, which will be exacerbated by the presence of S. Despite these limitations, it is shown that operating windows exist where it is possible to integrate fuel combustion, CO2 and SO2 capture in a single dual reactor facility. The decay in activity in the sorbent appears to be the major practical limitation to this concept, but this can be compensated for by using a relatively large supply of fresh sorbent, which appears to be acceptable considering the low cost of limestone. Also, a novel concept to reactivate the spent sorbent using sonic energy is outlined here as an alternative to reduce the use of fresh limestone.","Calcination; Carbonation; CO2 capture; Fluidized bed combustion; Reactivation","Energy cycles; Sonic energy; Biomass; Calcination; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Cement industry; Concentration (process); Energy storage; Fluidized bed combustion; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Limestone; Low temperature effects; Natural gas; Petroleum coke; Solar energy; Sulfur dioxide; Fluidized bed combustors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347514582

Dynamic response analysis is needed for design of control algorithms in load changes. The operation of a pilot CFB-reactor in dynamic conditions and in load changes is analyzed experimentally and by modeling at different process conditions. Reactivity parameters for different fuels can be extracted from simple dynamic measurements and then used in computations studying operation in load changes. Dynamic studies are also required to see the necessary requirements for the fuel quality and fuel feed system to maintain stable operation. For high volatile coals the fuel feeding must be steadier to keep the variation in the outlet oxygen concentration at some range than with coals with low reactivity or alternatively greater air coefficient is needed to prevent too low O2 concentrations, which can cause an increase in CO emissions. The fuel quality can be characterized by the fluctuation of oxygen concentration in flue gases in steady operation conditions, which depends on the fluctuations in the combustion and in the fuel feed and on operational conditions. The amplitude of the fluctuations was studied. For advanced controls, it is necessary to know the factors affecting the process dynamics, such as reactivity and the behavior of char inventory in bed. This information is also necessary in developing and optimizing the CFB boiler considering emissions, combustion process and furnace scale up.","CFB; Coal; Combustion; Dynamics","Fuel combustion; Fuel quality; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Dynamic response; Electric energy storage; Flue gases; Fluidized beds; Gas emissions; Synthetic fuels; Chemical reactors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347514575

In the inner of cooker there are a mirrors arrangement in inclined position (inner reflectors) placed in angles of 30°, 45° and 75°, these helped to reflex the solar rays in direction to the cook recipient. The recipient also received the solar rays in the upper part (lid). The mathematical model that was obtained from energetic analysis, is formed for five .differential equations system no linear and the fourth Runge-Kutta method is used to resolve it. The numerical solution of the equations system is obtained with a computational software in C++. This work is a contribution to the application of numerical methods and computational for development of the solar energy used in thermal conversion equipments. The use of these techniques to solve the mathematical model is important to contribute in the evaluation and design of solar box cookers with multi-step inner reflector.","Angle of reflection; Inner Reflector; Solar Box Cooker; Steps","Energy balance; Solar cookers; Computer simulation; Computer software; Differential equations; Energy storage; Greenhouse effect; Heat convection; Hydraulics; Mirrors; Radiation; Regression analysis; Runge Kutta methods; Solar equipment; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346962639

A well-designed sunroom has the potential to reduce the annual heating loads by one-third or more. By integrating phase change materials (PCMs) into building elements such as floor tile and wallboard, the benefits of the sunroom can be further enhanced by providing enhanced energy storage. To maximize benefits from PCMs, an engineering analysis tool is needed to provide insight into the most efficient use of this developing technology. Thus far, modeling of the phase change materials has been restricted to finite difference and finite element methods, which are not well suited to inclusion in a comprehensive annual building simulation program such as BLAST or EnergyPlus (BLAST Support Office, 1991; Crawley et al, 2001). Conduction transfer functions (CTFs) have long been used to predict transient heat conduction in such programs (Sowell and Hittle, 1995). Phase changes often do not occur at a single temperature, but do so over a range of temperatures. The phase change energy can be represented by an elevated heat capacity over the temperature range during which the phase change occurs (Kedl, 1991). By calculating an extra set(s) of CTFs for the phase change properties, the CTF method can be extended to include the energy of phase transitions by switching between the two (or more) sets of CTFs. This method can be used to accurately predict the internal and external temperatures of PCM-containing building elements during transient heat conduction. The amount of energy storage and release during a phase transition can also be modeled with this method, although there may be some degree of inaccuracy due to switching between two or more sets of CTFs.",,"Phase change materials (PCM); Solar design; Air pollution; Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy storage; Fatty acids; Finite difference method; Finite element method; Fossil fuels; Frequency response; Heat conduction; Heat flux; Paraffins; Phase transitions; Solar heating; Solar radiation; Thermal effects; Transfer functions; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346332840

Increased first costs for improved efficiency are balanced against the size of the PV system required to achieve ZNE (where the net-metered PV system is the energy source of last resort, because it is expensive but can meet the remaining load ""using the grid for storage""). Discrete building component options are considered within various categories (e.g., walls, ceilings, foundations, glass types, air conditioners, furnaces, etc.).

One is two-step water splitting cycle by using a metal-oxide redox pair. The first step is based on the thermal reduction of metal oxide, which is a highly endothermic process driven by concentrated solar thermal energy. The second step involves water decomposition with the thermally-reduced metal oxide. The first thermal reduction process requires very-high temperatures, which may be realized in sun-belt regions. Another hydrogen production route is solar reforming of natural gas (methane), which can convert methane to hydrogen via calorie-upgrading by using concentrated solar thermal energy. Solar reforming is currently the most advanced solar thermochemical process in sun belt. There is also possibility for the solar reforming to be applied for worldwide solar concentrating facilities where direct insolation is weaker than that in sun belt.

Security of fuel supply and cost are therefore very often critical issues for thermal capacity additions. Also the distance from fuel sources and available fuel transport infrastructure is an important factor in the cost of generation. Many plant locations have only limited supplies of conventional gas turbine fuels, namely natural gas and distillate fuels, thus a drive to diversify the fuels involved. For other electricity producers, the optimal use of existing or potential fuel resources is a must for economical reasons. Therefore, the possibility of using alternative gas turbine liquid fuels, such as volatile and/or low viscosity fuels like naphtha, gas condensates, kerosene, methanol, ethanol, or low lubricity distillate fuels; refinery by-products such as BTX fuels (benzene-toluene-xylene mixtures), LCO-light cycle oil, or in the future synthetic fuels (GTL) are particularly interesting for their ability to be fred in heavy duty gas turbines. However, the practical use of these fuels creates specific issues such as low lubricity properties which can affect sensitive key components like fuel pumps and flow dividers. This paper addresses the many practical aspects of using fuel lubricity additives for reduced component wear in gas turbine fuel systems, and for reliability and successful plant operation on these alternative gas turbine liquid fuels.

People are concerned about rising fuel costs and effects of emissions on the environment. The major contributor for the increased levels of pollutants is the Diesel engines. Diesel engine finds application in almost in all fields, including transportation sector such as buses, trucks, railway engines, etc. and in industries as power generating units. In the present work an attempt is made for effective utilization of diesel engine aiming for reduction in fuel consumption and smoke density. This is achieved by some minor modifications in diesel engine, so as to run the existing diesel engine as a LPG-Diesel dual-fuel engine with LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) induction at air intake. The important aspect of LPG-Diesel dual-fuel engine is that it shows significant reduction in smoke density and improved brake thermal efficiency with reduced energy consumption. An existing 4-S, single cylinder, naturally aspirated, water-cooled, direct injection, CI engine test rig was used for the experimental purpose. With proper instrumentation the tests were conducted under various LPG flow rates, loads, and injection timings. The influence of the diesel replacement by LPG on smoke density, brake specific energy consumption and brake thermal efficiency were studied. The optimal diesel replacement pertaining to the maximum allowable LPG gas flow limits could be assessed with these experiments. The influence of the injection timing variation on the engine performance and smoke density were analyzed form the experimental results. It was also observed that beyond half load operation of the dual-fuel engine, the brake thermal efficiency increases with diesel replacement, and at full load up to 4% improvement was observed compared to full diesel operation. At full load reduction in smoke density up to 25-36% was observed compared to full diesel operation. At advance injection timing of 30°btdc the performance was better with lower emissions compared to normal and retarded injection timings.","Dual-fuel; Injection timing; Performance Characteristics; Replacement factor","High energy storage density; Pollutants; Dual fuel engines; Dynamometers; Eddy currents; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Fuel consumption; Liquefied petroleum gas; Nitrogen oxides; Petroleum reservoirs; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346253780

The paper contains basic parameters and characteristic of λ-devices, as well as shows factors influencing the choice, change in wide ranges and regulation of basic parameters of λ-devices, such as: V=1.5...25V, V off=1...15V, Imax=50μA...30mA, I off=0.1...10nA. The advantage of such triggers is law energy consumption in the mode of logic levels storage (from units up to tenths of nanowatts at V=5V) and voltage of logic levels practically does not differ from potentials of the earth and supply (Δ≈10μV) such devices enable to be commutated with frequencies up to 360 MHz if the duration of optic pulses t=0.8ns and power 100mW (using photodiodes having responsivity 0.5A/W). That corresponds to the switching energy of 80pJ, average consumption power from supply circuits of 58mW. The decrease of switching frequency at the expense of increase of porosity of supplied pulses and usage of photoreceivers with high conversion efficiency of A/W allows to decrease energy consumption of trigger. Thus, if commutation frequency is 100kHz and duration of optic pulses is 320ns, power 80μW, that corresponds to switching energy of 26pJ, and usage of photopreceivers having responsivity of 2.5 A/W, the consumed average power of considered optoelectronic trigger from supply circuit is 9μW.

During regenerative operation, the power is flowing from the mechanical disturbance through the electromechanical actuator and its switching drive into the electrical storage device (batteries or capacitors). We demonstrate that regeneration occurs when controlling one or both of the flow states (velocity and/or current).

The unsurpassed level of impurity control leads to suppression of nonradiative recombination paths and provides for a very long minority carrier lifetime. Up to the present, observation of an optical memory effect has not been reported for crystalline silicon (c-Si). In contrast, it has been observed in GaAs and GaN. In this study, we have used c-Si doped with erbium (Er) ions, since the trivalent Er3+ ion emits at a wavelength of 1.54 μm that is suitable for telecommunication applications. In a two-color experiment, utilizing a Nd:YAG pulse excitation as a writing beam and a free-electron laser (FEL) as a reading beam, we revealed that Si exhibits optical memory and afterglow effects at low temperatures T&lt;50 K. Both effects are, in fact, manifestations of the properties of Si itself, conveniently revealed by the optical dopant. Detailed investigations of the FEL-induced emission at 1.54 μm show that this excitation mechanism is governed by the release of a single type of charge carrier. This implies that hole and electron capture events necessary for the Er excitation could, in principle, be separated in time. Therefore it appears possible to combine optical and electrical write/read procedures for the reported memory effect.","Crystalline silicon; Erbium; Free electron laser; Optical memory; Photoluminescence; Two-color spectroscopy","Charge carriers; Electron spectroscopy; Electron traps; Energy gap; Free electron lasers; Low temperature effects; Photoluminescence; Semiconducting silicon; Semiconductor doping; Crystalline silicon; Radiative recombinations; Optical data storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242693218

To address these issues, the field of quantum computing has undergone substantial recent growth.

As such, today's warfighter has to be well equipped to insure independent operation and survival of small, deployed groups. The use of unattended ground sensors in reconfigurable sensor networks can provide portable perimeter security for such special operations. Since all of the equipment for the missions must be carried by the warfighter, weight is a critical issue. Currently, batteries constitute much of that weight, as batteries are short-lived and unreliable. An alternative power source is required to eliminate the need for carrying multiple replacement batteries to support special operations. Such a battery-free, replenishable, energy management technology has been developed by Ambient Control Systems. Ambient has developed an advanced mid-door photovoltaic technology, which converts light to energy over a wide range of lighting conditions. The energy is then stored in supercapacitors, a highly robust, long-term storage medium. Ambient's advanced energy management technology will power remote sensor and control systems 24 hours/day, 7 days/week for over 20 years, without batteries, providing for ongoing detection, surveillance and other remote operations.","Alternative; Energy; Harvest; Mobile; Network; Remote; Sensors; UGS; Unattended; Uninterrupted power","Fuel cells; Photovoltaic effects; Remote sensing; Uninterruptible power systems; Unattended ground sensors; Sensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242641174

An ideal solution would be to scavenge energy from structural strains and make the scavenging component a part of the sensor package. In principle, piezoelectric materials are suited to that role, and studies by others have demonstrated the feasibility of energy scavenging from flexible PZT devices operated at large strains and high strain rates. We have conducted experiments to collect electrical energy from PZT ceramics. We summarize the governing piezoelectric equations and outline the most convenient forms to use for the energy scavenging problem, illustrated by tracing one complete loading cycle. We review the material properties for the three PZT ceramics used in our experiments. We show experimental results recording voltage and charge in the cases of open-circuit, resistive loads, and capacitive loads, showing good agreement with analytical predictions. However, the greatest challenge is the approach to energy storage. In theory, capacitors can store energy but at varying voltage and with non-negligible leakage, whereas a battery can store energy at constant voltage with little leakage. We conducted experiments on both approaches, and we discuss our findings of the feasibility and efficiency of battery recharging at the scale of our devices, which have nominal dimensions of 10×10×1 mm.","Piezoelectric; PZT; Scavenging; Strain energy","Ceramic materials; Electric loads; Electric potential; Piezoelectric devices; Strain; Energy scavenging; Strain energy; Sensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242636111

The theory behind cantilever type piezoelectric elements is well known, but the transverse moving diaphragm elements, which can be used in pressure type energy generation is not yet fully developed. The power generation in a diaphragm depends on several factors. Among them, the thickness of each layer is important.

The system uses a combination of acoustic vibrations and electromagnetic waves to achieve highly specific target recognition, and a multistatic configuration to determine target location. The mechanical vibration resonance properties of the constituent elements of the targets constitute a signature which can be identified in clutter. In order to better detect these vibrations, continuous-wave radar signals are used rather than acoustic reflections, as in sonar-based systems. The energy stored in resonant vibrating elements is not directly detected, but rather modulates the radar signal. The received signals are sampled at high resolution to facilitate target signature recognition by cross-correlation and phase measurement. Location is accomplished by travel time determination for each receiver using absolute phase measurements at multiple frequencies. The phase measurements provide multiple sets of confocal elliptical lines of position, whose intersection identifies the target location. The region in which a mine can be precisely located is a subset of the region in which its presence can be detected.","Acoustic; Detection; Electromagnetic; Hybrid; Radar","Electromagnetic waves; Energy storage; Frequencies; Phase measurement; Radar target recognition; Sonar; Vibrations (mechanical); Buried-object detection systems; Radar signals; Ordnance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242543932

Present-day fuel cells have transient (dynamic) responses that are much slower than the dynamic responses of the typical power conditioner and load to which they are attached. As such, the fuel cell's inability to change its electrical output (current) as quickly as the electrical load changes has significant implications on the overall power system design. In particular, some form of energy storage with quick charge/discharge capability is needed to function as firm power backup during electrical load increases if the fuel flow to the fuel cell is not being kept constant at its maximum level (which is wasteful and inefficient). The slower the fuel cell's response, the larger the amount of energy storage that is needed with the attendant increases in its size, weight and cost; it also reduces the number of suitable energy storage options (ultracapacitor, flywheel, battery, etc). Hence, this paper describes an effort to model a PEM fuel cell's dynamic behavior as an initial step to prescribe internal design modifications and/or external controller designs to improve its transient behavior.

Even though some of these techniques can be applied to axial flux machines, manufacturing cost is especially high due to the unique construction of the axial flux machine stator. Consequently, new low cost techniques are desirable for use with axial flux PM machines.

A 3-kW, 8-pole axial flux surface-magnet disc type machine with double-rotor-single-stator is then designed and optimized in order to apply the proposed new method.

While one of the DVRs compensates for a voltage sag, the other DVRs connected to common DC-Link replenish the DCLink energy storage. A current mode control strategy is incorporated into the IDVR system in both working modes, voltage sag compensation and power flow control. The reference voltage for power flow control mode is derived from instantaneous active current calculated using DC-Link voltage error signal. Simulation results are presented for a simple system in order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed IDVR system.","Current Mode Control; Phase Angle Advance; Series Compensation; Voltage Sag","Computer simulation; Electric potential; Energy storage; Voltage control; Voltage restorers; Power electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242508312

Major economic losses might appear at the customers due to those failures. This paper presents a power electronic device, which keeps voltage sags away from sensitive loads. It is a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR), which creates a series injection of voltage into the medium voltage grid. Energy storage is keeping the sensitive load running in a limited time. The design and a new control method of a DVR are explained in this paper. The DVR is also tested at medium voltage level (10 kV) and methods to initiate voltage dips are described and implemented. Different test results at 10 kV level show that the DVR keep the voltage to a sensitive load fixed in the case of voltage dips. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that in the case of a transformer failure the system also works very fine.","Dynamic voltage restorer; Power electronic converter; Power quality; Voltage sags","Electric potential; Electric transformers; Oscillations; Power electronics; Voltage restorers; Power converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242508299

Supercapacitors are new and powerful components for energy storage. Compared with batteries, the amount of energy they can store is low and does not allow a large vehicle autonomy. Because supercapacitors have the property to be re-loadable in a few seconds, a sequential supply system has been developed, considering repetitive feeding at the stops. To solve the problem of the needed high power amount to reach short refill times, a solution is proposed which consists of using an intermediary supercapacitive tank placed at fixed stations, which is refilled between the bus arrivals with a much lower power. In addition to the description of the needed power electronic converters, theoretical and experimental results are presented, defining the controlled profile of the instantaneous power-level, in order to achieve a fast energy transfer between two supercapacitive tanks.","Energy storage; Supercapacitors","Capacitors; Electric potential; Energy storage; Power converters; Power electronics; Transportation; Supercapacitive tanks; Supercapacitors; Electric vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242507797

Many approaches have been applied to compensate harmonic currents generated in the power system.

Mixtures ball milled at a ball to powder ratio of 70:1 were able to absorb up to 11 wt% hydrogen. The dependence of hydrogen uptake on ball milling time and energy is shown to be related to the microstructural morphology of the ball milled powders. The original Mg powder particles were heavily deformed by the ball milling process and contained nano-sized inclusions of both Ti and Ni at the surface. The higher energy ball milled samples showed a more refined microstructure and a greater hydrogen capacity.

These models are widespread in engineering and life sciences and typically involve the exchange of nonnegative quantities between subsystems or compartments wherein each compartment is assumed to be kinetically homogeneous. However, in many engineering and life science systems, transfers between compartments are not instantaneous and realistic models for capturing the dynamics of such systems should account for material in transit between compartments. Including some information of past system states in the system model leads to infinite-dimensional delay nonnegative dynamical systems. In this paper we develop new notions of dissipativity theory for nonnegative dynamical systems with time delay using linear storage functionals with linear supply rates.

An important part of stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) system design is concerned with the balance between energy produced by the PV array and energy consumed by the load. Any short-term mismatch between these two energy flows is compensated by energy storage, usually in the form of a rechargeable battery. Other types of storage may also be encountered in certain applications. Considerations of energy balance cover a number of characteristic time scales, and can be discussed in terms of the energy stored in the battery. The energy balance displays various cycles that occur with different degree of regularity. This chapter explains load description and discusses about electricity consumption by lighting and electrical appliances. Daily energy balance dynamics is explained in detail. The chapter considers the profile of energy stored in the battery during the seasonal energy cycle. This analysis illustrates the intimate relationship between the configuration of a stand-alone PV system and the behavior of battery state of charge over prolonged periods of time that may considerably impact the battery lifetime. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover we succeeded in decreasing the contact resistance to 6μΩ with depositing the metal on the contact surface.

Although DLC films have been considered as a strong candidate for various applications due to its excellent mechanical properties, their poor adhesion on tool steels limits the applications. In order to overcome this drawback, some ideas were introduced. Recently, ion implantation was used to improve the adhesion between thin film and substrate. In this work, we investigated effect of ion implantation on the adhesion strength of DLC film as a function of ion does and implanted energies. Ti and W ions were implanted on the Si-wafer and WC-Co substrates, then DLC films were deposited by ion beam deposition method. A CSEM-REVETEST scratch tester was used to assess the adhesion characteristics. From results, the adhesion strength of films was improved as increasing ion implantation energy, however there was no significant with ion dose. Further results, including morphology and compositional variation at the different ion energies and doses, will be presented.","Adhesion; Diamond-like Carbon(DLC); Metal-Plasma Source Ion Implantation; Scratch","Adhesion; Coatings; Diamond like carbon films; Ion implantation; Magnetic storage; Morphology; Silicon wafers; Thin films; Adhesion strength; Plasma sources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141997232

Formally they may be divided into three parts; first one combined opening switch (COS), second one - the scheme of current zero and its break, third one-the scheme of correlation of storage and a load. COS consists of vacuum interrupter (VI) and plasma opening switch (POS) integrated in a single volume. The purpose of this technology is to raise the ratio of current passing time and current break time. It is attained by increase of electrical strength of small-power VI vacuum gap up to electrical strength of POS by means of magnetic self insulation. The scheme of current zero and its break in action of COS is offered to consideration in this paper. Customary schemes of generation and current zero break do not fulfil necessary requirements- under energy output the scheme of current zero has to withstand the full voltage, which is created on a load. The impedance of current zero scheme has to be significantly higher then of load one. Ability to work with repetition rate pulses. Current zero break must be realized with high degree of synchronizing. Therefore it is offered to use a scheme based on interception of secondary transformer winding by primary one with magnetic flow conservation. Initially, under current zero creation, the scheme is common LC-circuit, where L-inductance of primary winding and capacitor is charged up to voltage U.

Due to this, the problem of providing efficient self-sustained burning of such coal blends remains increasingly important. Often this problem is traditionally solved by using, for example, fuel oil for the purpose of both ignition and stabilisation of burning. However, this solution has shortcomings in terms of high cost, difficulties in storage and supply of fuel oil,.high temperature corrosion of heated surfaces, decrease in the overall efficiency, and of appearance of heavy metals and other toxic components in the exhaust. Although the problem of effective combustion can be solved by using the so-called ""ftuidised bed"" technology, this way requires a complete reconstruction of the existing power plants with substantial labour and financial expenditure. The mentioned problem calls for the development of nontraditional approaches to its solution. In this work, microwave plasma is studied as an alternative to oil or gas fuel for ignition and stabilisation of burning of lean coal. The study is performed on an experimental set-up which includes a burner with a microwave plasma generator, coal and air supply systems, and measurement equipment. Power and thermochemical characteristics of the coalplasma interaction have been measured and analysed. The obtained results indicate an essential intensification of ignition and combustion processes in the microwave burner compared to those in conventional burners. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the microwave energy consumption is only about 10 % of the required expenditure of oil or gas, measured in heat equivalent. A design of an industrial microwave-plasma burner is proposed. Prospects of such burner for applications at industrial boilers of power plants are discussed.",,"Boilers; Coal; Corrosion; Energy utilization; Fuel oils; Gas fuels; Ignition; Microwave devices; Oil burners; Power plants; Lean coals; Plasma devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141927455

In recent years, high permittivity dielectrics have been studied intensively for ferroelectric random access memories (FRAM) owing to low operating voltage and fast switching speed and nonvolatility. Bi-layered Bi4-xLaxTi3O 12 (BLT) has been intensively studied because it shows low leakage current, low coercive field and lack of fatigue with simple Pt electrodes and repeated polarization reversals with electric field cycling. In addition, BLT exhibits low crystallization temperature, good resistance of fatigue and a medium polarization. For the integration of ferroelectric thin films into high-density memories, anisotropic etching process should be developed. In recent years, most dry etching of semiconductor materials has been performed in high-density plasmas. Among high-density plasmas, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching systems posses of good properties such as superior uniformity and easy control of incident ion energy to the bottom electrode. However, there is only a few reports about etching mechanism and characteristics of BLT thin films in terms of gas chemistry such as Cl2/Ar and CF4/Ar. In this study, the etching properties of BLT in Cl2/Ar plasma was studied in terms of etch rate and selectivity as functions of substrate temperature. We obtained the maximum etch rate of 803 Å/min at 20% Cl 2 addition into Ar plasma. As the substrate temperature increased, the etch rate increased. The increase of etch rate can be explained by the enhancement of chemical etching effect. The variation of ion current density and of volume density for Cl and Ar atoms are measured by the Langmuir probe and optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The etch products are measured with quadruple mass spectroscopy (QMS). The etching profiles of samples are evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The etch mechanism of BLT can be explained as follows; 1) the etch rate of BLT increased and made nonvolatile etch products with increasing substrate temperature due to increasing of chemical etching effect. 2) nonvolatile etch products (La-Cl x) can be desorbed only by the ion bombardment.",,"Bismuth compounds; Etching; Polarization; Random access storage; Langmuir probes; Thin films",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141894124

This feature makes the SI Thy especially suitable for a switch of high rep-rate inductive-energy-storage pulsed power modulators, since the switch can interrupt a current rapidly. In this research, a high rep-rate inductive-energy-storage pulsed power modulator, which uses a high voltage SI Thy as an opening switch, has been designed and constructed for application to an induction synchrotron. The target operating frequency of the modulator is 1 Mpps. The induction synchrotron accelerates bunched charged particle beams using induced electric fields, which is proportional to the time derivative of magnetic flux in a toroidal core. In order to prevent a magnetic flux of the core from saturating, it is necessary to reset the toroidal core after each acceleration pulse. Therefore, a reset circuit independent of an acceleration circuit is needed in general. However, the proposed modulator can supply both the acceleration and the reset pulses without any additional circuit and is especially suitable for an induction synchrotron accelerator. We have succeeded in producing an acceleration pulse and a successive reset pulse. When the voltage of an acceleration pulse is about 170V with pulse width of 900ns, the obtained reset pulse has a peak voltage of 1.4kV with pulse width of 124ns. From a calculation of energy loss in SI Thy, it is expected to operate the modulator at a rep-rate of 200 kpps or more.",,"Charge carriers; Electric field effects; Gates (transistor); Inductance; Magnetic flux; Pulse modulation; Switching circuits; Synchrotron radiation; Pulsed power modulators; Thyristors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141893438

Dealing with the historic and potential future effects of sedimentation in the Clutha river has been an important issue in this process. In 1956, the Roxburgh dam was constructed on the Clutha river in New Zealand to provide hydroelectricity. Lake Roxburgh, the reservoir created by Roxburgh dam, has an operating range of 1.85m. It is a long narrow lake with an approximate length of 30km and a width varying from typically 150m to 300m. In the late 1950's a dam was also built upstream of Lake Roxburgh at the outlet of the natural Lake Hawea to raise the lake and provide water storage for use in the winter when natural river flows are generally lowest and the demand for electricity is highest. The present normal operating range of Lake Hawea is 8m. Lake Dunstan, which is formed by the Clyde dam and is situated between Lakes Roxburgh and Hawea, commenced filling in 1992. The operating range of Lake Dunstan is 1m. Figure 1 shows the Clutha catchment and the hydro dam locations. In the period from 1956 to 1992, Lake Roxburgh was progressively filling with sediment, sourced mainly from the Shotover river.

Our earlier research work associated with the fast Hadamard transform for robust watermark embedding and retrieval of images and characters suggests that this transform could also provide a good ""hidden"" space for digital watermarking. The Slant transform has many similar properties to the Walsh-Hadamard transform. In terms of transform coding, the Slant transform is considered to be a sub-optimum orthogonal transform for energy compaction. For digital watermarking, the energy spread becomes a significant advantage, as there is now a good spread of middle to higher frequencies with significant energies for robust information hiding. In this paper, an analytical comparative study on the performance of the Slant transform adapting our earlier watermarking schemes for fast Hadamard transform will be performed based on its robustness against various Stirmark attacks. The performance results of the Slant transform for image watermarking against other transforms such as Cosine transform will also be presented.","Copyright protection; Digital watermarking; Slant transform","Algorithms; Copyrights; Digital image storage; Image coding; Image reconstruction; Image retrieval; Mathematical transformations; Multimedia systems; Security of data; Digital images; Hadamard transform; Slant transform; Walsh-Hadamard transform; Digital watermarking",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141719306

The synchrotron is operated 24 hours/day, 7 days/week with few periods of shutdown, mostly dedicated to maintenance. During one of these periods, in August 2001, ENEA Fusion Technology Division (Italy), in collaboration with ELETTRA Accelerator Sector and Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI, Switzerland), carried out the 3D dimensional survey of the storage ring using its own optical metrology system (Leica laser tracker LTD500). The aim of the survey was the realignment of the storage ring magnets of the synchrotron. Within a two-weeks time shutdown, more than 2300 single measurements were taken on the 24 bending magnets, 108 quadrupoles and 72 sextupoles placed in the 259.2 m circumference storage ring. The overall root mean square error of the oriented network were less than 0.1 mm, thus making possible a subsequent and successful one-week alignment of one fourth of the storage ring (October 2001). This performance completely fulfilled the very demanding survey specifications in terms of accuracy, time required, and usability of the measurements.

Phosphate glasses also exhibit a very high solubility for rare earth ions. This feature permits the introduction of large concentrations of active ions into relatively small volumes resulting in smaller laser devices with high-energy storage capabilities. These high dopant concentrations also result in very rapid and efficient energy transfer between rare earth ions. This allows for the effective use of Yb3+ as a sensitizer for the Er3+ laser ion. Effective Er:Yb:Glass pumping, energy storage, and energy extraction involves the population of the 2F5/2 level of Yb 3+ (∼2ms fluorescence lifetime); a moderately rapid and efficient nonradiative transfer of energy to the 4I11/2 level of Er3+ (about 500 μsec transfer time); and a very rapid (&lt; 1μ,sec) nonradiative decay of the Er3+ from the 4I11/2 to the metastable 4I13/2 state (with an 8ms fluorescence lifetime). In this study we measured the fluorescence lifetime for the 4I13/2 level of Er +3 on different glass samples with various concentrations of erbium. The data indicate that for doping levels up to 7 wt.% Er2O 3 the lifetime remains above 7.0 ms. Theoretically, this highly doped glass could produce over 18 dB gain in a 1cm path length. In additional fluorescence lifetime testing, ytterbium doped and erbium/ytterbium co-doped glasses were evaluated for concentration quenching and energy transfer rate as a function of the Er3+ concentration. The effect on the energy transfer efficiency and laser efficiency was analyzed.","Diode pump; Erbium Glass; Fluorescence","Doping (additives); Energy transfer; Fluorescence; Optical pumping; Pumping (laser); Quenching; Rare earth elements; Diode pumps; Solid state lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141605329

The cargo will be regasified into 2.9 bcf of natural gas. Dominion invested $180 million to reactivate the facility since purchasing it in September 2002, and has started construction on a new 2.5 bcf storage tank, scheduled for service in January 2005. Dominion Cove Point will process LNG for BP, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and Stratoil ASA, each of which holds a one-third access right to processing facilities and storage as well as capacity on Dominion 87 mi pipeline linked to markets and storage fields. Meanwhile, Statoil received its first LNG cargo at the Cove Point terminal on 9/2/2003. The delivery, acquired as a spot purchase from Spain's Repsol-YPF SA, will be regasified into 2.8 bcf of natural gas. The group will receive as additional spot cargo later September 2003 from another supplier, and negotiations are under way for long-term LNG deliveries until Snohvit comes on stream in 2006.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117874333

The TWAC project directs on development and promotion of high intensity and high power heavy ion beam technology. The main goal of the TWAC project is accumulation in the storage ring of intense ion beam, its longitudinal compression and using the extracted beam for plasma experiments. An electron cooler with electron energy of 380 keV provides a small ion bunch size during charge-exchange injection into the U10 accumulator ring [I, Meshkov et al., Design project of electron cooling system for TWAC accumulator ring (Dubna, 2001)]. The cooling time is compared with the storage time during charge-exchange multi-turn injection. The electron cooler allows us to significantly improve the beam parameters at the target (specific energy, specific power and so on) and to suppress the beam losses by an order of magnitude. The application of electron cooling allows an increase in of the final power of an extracted ion beam on a target by a factor 2-3.",,"Cooling; Heavy ions; Ion beams; Ion exchange; Nuclear physics; Plasma theory; Storage rings; Accumulators; Electron coolers; Electron beams",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042388703

In particular, the predicted luminosities will allow for the investigation of direct reactions with stored and cooled radioactive beams in inverse kinematics using internal H, He, etc. targets. Such light-ion induced direct reactions, as for example elastic and inelastic scattering, transfer, charge exchange, or knock-out reactions, have been proved in the past, for the case of stable nuclei, to be powerful, tools for obtaining nuclear structure information, and were also applied within the last decade for the investigation of light exotic nuclei with radioactive beams bombarding external targets. A brief overview on the physics program planned at the future NESR storage ring at GSI, the physics questions to be addressed, the dedicated reactions to be used, and the regions of interest in the chart of nuclides is given. The advantage of using stored beams and internal targets for such investigations will depend on the specific exotic nuclei and reactions chosen. This is discussed by a comparison of the conditions for the application of internal and external targets for reaction experiments with exotic beams. For the special case of elastic proton scattering at intermediate energies a feasibility study is presented, including a discussion of the experimental scenario. This method was applied recently for the investigation of nuclear matter distributions of the light neutron-rich halo nuclei 6.8He and 11Li using external targets. A few examples of the results are briefly discussed. The use of internal targets and stored beams will allow in future to extend such investigations to a wide range of medium heavy and heavy nuclei far off stability, and will therefore be one of the key reactions of the experimental program at the future NESR facility.",,"Heavy ions; Inverse kinematics; Ion beams; Ion bombardment; Protons; Radioactive materials; Scattering; Storage rings; Nuclear structures; Nuclear physics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041386604

The highly charged ions can be decelerated to reduce the resolution limitation originating from Doppler effects. The decelerated ions are either used for internal experiments or extracted to a fixed target area with an ultraslow extraction mode.

Because core routers can have fairly large (e.g., 2000 rule) database and must use limited SRAM to meet OC-768 speeds, the best existing classification algorithms (RFC, HiCuts, ABV) are precluded because of the large amount of memory they need. Thus the general belief is that hardware solutions like CAMs are needed, despite the amount of board area and power they consume. In this paper, we provide an alternative to CAMs via an Extended Grid-of-Tries with Path Compression (EGT-PC) algorithm whose worst-case speed scales well with database size while using a minimal amount of memory. Our evaluation is based on real databases used by Tier 1 ISPs, and synthetic databases. EGT-PC is based on a observation that we found holds for all the Tier 1 databases we studied: regardless of database size, any packet matches only a small number of distinct source-destination prefix pairs. The code we wrote for EGT-PC, RFC, HiCuts, and ABV is publicly available, providing the first publicly available code to encourage experimentation with classification algorithms.",,"Algorithms; Classification (of information); Database systems; Energy utilization; Packet networks; Quality of service; Routers; Static random access storage; Cams; Codes (symbols); Hardware; Path compressions; Associative storage; Classification algorithm; Core routers; Database size; Hardware solutions; Packet classification; Path compression; Prefix-pair; Real database; Set of rules; Synthetic database",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042976157

Thin-film media for magnetic and optical information storage represents one of the most difficult classes of material from an ion beam analysis viewpoint. The suitability of ToF-E ERDA to analyze commercial hard disc, CD-ROM and CD-RW structures has been investigated. A complex Co/Cr/Ni-P/Al multilayer structure taken from a standard hard disc and up to 8 elements in CD samples could be distinguished simultaneously.

Two commercially available PEMFC Fuel Cell (25-39V, 500W) modules along with suitable DC/DC and DC/AC power electronic converter modules are employed. A Supercapacitor module is also employed to compensate for the instantaneous power fluctuations and overcome the slow dynamics of the fuel processor such as reformers. Further energy stored in the supercapacitor is also utilized to handle a momentary overload such as 200% for a short duration. Due to the absence of batteries, the system satisfies the demand for an environmentally friendly clean source of energy. A complete design example illustrating the amount of hydrogen storage required for 1hr power outage, and sizing of supercapacitors for transient load demand is presented for a 1kVA UPS. Simulation and experimental results show the validity and feasibility of the 1kVA fuel cell power plant.",,"Computer simulation; Electric energy storage; Power converters; Power electronics; Systems analysis; Uninterruptible power systems; Supercapacitors; Fuel cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041657381

According to Ron Denhardt of Strategic Energy & Economic Research Inc, the 74 bcf injection indicated that 1-1.5 bcf/day of demand had returned as a result of lower gas prices.

A second key contribution of this work is the ability to achieve very high energy-delay efficiency through a synergistic combination of: (1) special purpose memory subsystem components, namely, a Streaming Memory and Scratch-Pad Memory; and (2) a novel task-based execution model that exposes/enhances opportunities for efficient prefetching, and aggressive dynamic energy conservation techniques targeting on-chip and off-chip memory components.

For the data storage applications, optical near field is defined in terms of Evanescent coupling between the system used to read or write data and recording layer. Near-field techniques can be applied to optical data storage systems to greatly increase recording density. So near-field recording technique has great potential in optical disc recording system and hybrid recording system. The characteristic of near-field recording spot is of vital importance in the data storage system basing the near-field theory, so it is absolutely necessary to be analyzed and measured. This paper analyses characteristic of near-field spots. The heat response time of the near field to overcome super paramagnetic effect is calculated basing the heat transfer theory. A novel measuring method for the diameter of near-field recording spot is also presented. Since the grain of the recording media is tiny enough, with the aid of atomic force microscope (AFM), near-field optical lithography can be accomplished, The diameter of near-field recording spot can be obtained by specifically designed computer either. So the relationship between the near-field recording spot diameter and the probe size of near-field recording system, the near field recording distance coupling between head and disc can be got.","AFM; Evanescent energy; Near-field optical lithography; Near-field recording spot","Atomic force microscopy; Optical data storage; Paramagnetism; Photolithography; Near-field recording spots; Optical recording",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042667202

The chiral structure is transparent at zero fields and scattering in the field ON state. These two structures may be reversibly interchanged implying their use in devices that consume energy only during switching from one stable state to the other.

TG metabolism is a process for delivering free fatty acids for energy storage or β-oxidation, involving a number of different hydrolytic enzymes and apolipoproteins (apo). The genes encoding these proteins are, therefore, candidates for determining plasma TGs. There is evidence that common variations in LPL, apo CIII (APOC3) and apo E (APOE) have the strong effect on plasma TG levels at the population level. More recently, the latest recognized member of the apolipoprotein gene family, APOA5, identified by comparative sequencing between human and mouse DNA, was located approximately 27 kb distal to APOA4 in the APOA1–C3–A4 gene cluster on chromosome 11q23, and variation in APOA5 was shown to be associated with plasma TG levels. The involvement of variation in the APOA1–C3–A4 locus in determining differences in lipid levels is well documented. We have examined the relative influence of APOA5 variants on plasma lipids, compared to the impact of variation in other genes within the cluster to determine if these effects are independent or a consequence of the strong linkage disequilibrium across the locus. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.","Animal models; APOA1–C3–A4–A5 gene cluster; Triglycerides",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023019298

The size of the nanocrystals is fixed by the thickness of the Si layer and strong quantum confinement is provided in the vertical (growth) direction by the insulating a-SiO2 layers. However, the extent of quantum confinement in the lateral dimensions remains to be established. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements performed within a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) indicate that the nanocrystals are laterally isolated by approximately 2nm of a-SiO2. The confinement potential provided by this barrier is insufficient to localize carriers within a nanocrystal for prolonged durations and can permit quantum mechanical tunneling via wave function overlap between adjacent nanocrystals. Charge leakage kinetics within a sheet of Si nanocrystals was studied using electric force microscopy. Approximately 750 electrons were injected within a 100nm radius circular patch with an atomic force microscope cantilever. The entire charge dissipated from this area in 70min via lateral conduction routes.

We present a distributed middleware framework (PARM), that is inherently power-aware and reconfigures itself to adapt to diminishing power levels of low-power devices. In this paper, we i) determine whether a reconfigurable component-based middleware framework can be utilized to achieve energy gains in low-power devices, while preserving the semantics of the middleware services, ii) present and evaluate a graph theoretic approach for dynamically determining middleware component reconfigurations and ascertaining the optimal frequency at which the restructuring should occur, for maximal energy gains at the device. We use extensive profiling to chart the energy usage patterns of middleware components and applications, and use the profiled data to drive our reconfiguration decisions.

For some specific classes of systems, e.g., embedded systems, hardware-oriented, on-the-fly access pattern modification is also an option, as it trades generality in the applicability for better performance. This paper presents a class of algorithms for improving the locality of a given memory access profile through selective address relocation that require a very low-overhead custom hardware unit.

LH fruit exhibited higher transpiration rates, earlier ageing and degradation of visual appearance than fruit stored at HH. The three cultivars behaved differently. LH satsumas and LH tangelos lost about 23-26% of the initial weight after the 4 weeks of storage against 4-6% of HH fruit of the same cultivars. LH lemons lost 16,8% of the initial weight after 4 weeks of storage and 33% after 12 weeks, whereas in the same periods in HH lemons weight loss were respectively 9% and 18%. After three weeks of storage, the total amount of satsuma LH fruit was unmarketable and only 8% of the tangelos were marketable; 100% of HH fruit of both cultivars were still saleable after 4 weeks of storage and free of decay. The level in humidity less affected visual appearance of lemons. In fact, after 4 weeks of storage more than 90% of LH fruit were marketable even when the degree of freshness was less compared to HH fruit. HH lemons maintained freshness sufficient for sale up to 12 weeks. Respiration activity decreased in both experimental conditions. Internal CO2 showed an increasing trend, and a decreasing trend in internal O2 partial pressure. All these changes were pronounced at LH conditions, while only moderate at HH conditions. In particular, the highest differences in respiration activity between HH fruit and LH were detected in satsumas; while the least differences were detected in lemons. The results show that: 1) the response at different hygrometric conditions differs greatly between cultivars; 2) elevated hygrometric conditions can prolong postharvest life markedly; 3) storage of citrus fruit can be done at temperatures between 5 and10°C higher than those normally used if elevated levels of humidity are applied and fruit are adequately protected against decay with an effective fungicide, with the advantage of saving energy and reducing the risk of physiological alterations caused by prolonged exposure to low temperatures.","Citrus fruit; Fruit quality; Relative humidity; Respiration activity; Storage",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879673869

System Analysis, Vienna University fo Technology, Austria","The prospects for a global transition to a ""Methane Age"" are discussed. In the last two centuries, global energy systems have transformed from a reliance on carbon intensive sources such as coal to oil and more recently to natural gas. This has resulted in substantial decarbonization, a driving force for the emergence of the Methane Age. Another driving force is the need for clean and affordable energy services. Access to affordable energy services is crucial for economic development with over 1.3 billion people living in poverty (with &lt; $1 a day) and with 2 billion without access to affordable energy services. A challenge is to develop transboundary trade in natural gas through investment in pipeline and LNG infrastructures. Stationary use of methane for cooking and fuel cells for electricity generation is important for many developing countries. Greater use of natural gas in public transportation can reduce urban air pollution. Current estimates of natural gas resources are of abundance. The more speculative deposits of methane hydrates are gigantic. This is another driving force for the emergence of the Methane Age. Their exploitation would require development of new technologies. Technologies include fuel cells, gas and combined cycle turbines and mini-turbines for electricity generation and cogeneration of heat to steam reforming for hydrogen production. Bridge technologies such as CNG, bio-fuel, gas-to-liquids, and dimethylether (DME) vehicles would diversify the fleet, help reduce emissions, and provide enabling infrastructures for fuel cell vehicles with hydrogen propulsion in the long term. A larger role of natural gas would result in a higher share of global emissions of greenhouse gases and especially of CO2. Technologies for carbon capture and storage would need to be developed and deployed. Already today CO2 is separated and stored in a deep-sea aquifer below the North Sea and carbon dioxide serves as an agent for EOR. The amounts of carbon dioxide to be stored would be enormous from a few to &gt; 500 billion ton of elemental carbon accumulated by 2100. Achieving a hydrogen and electricity age has never been more urgent. The Methane Age can serve as bridge toward the Hydrogen and Electricity Era. It also provides a perspective toward future zero emissions energy systems with universal access to energy services by all.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347722499

One scenario is that natural gas will have 30% market share after 2050. However, the future of natural gas will be shaped by the outcome of critical uncertainties involving gas resources, economy and population, social preferences, and technologies. There may be 2 trillion bbl of equivalent of ultimately recoverable gas resources but over half has yet to be discovered and the even larger resources of unconventional gas resources, such as methane hydrates have yet to be made conventional. The levels of economic activity and population will shape the demands for natural gas. By 2100, most countries will have per capita energy demand levels comparable to present industrial economies. The public's preferences for tackling environmental issues including the reduction of carbon combustion will affect the demand for natural gas. So too could rising concerns over energy security and markets. Significant gas resources are in the Middle East and Russia. Energy technology discontinuities can be expected in the coming century. Some will support natural gas development and others may provide strong competition, such as the development of economic carbon storage and capture technologies. In the near term there will be the impediment of inadequate price incentives in some markets, a consequence of weak economies, past market liberalization, and over-capacity. The long-term contracts are under question also. In the next 30 yr the International Energy Agency calculates that 2000 Gw of new natural gas burning capacity and additional 10,000 billion cu m of natural gas production capacity will be needed with the infrastructure to bring this gas to market. However, query whether this can be achieved.

With shrinkage in device dimensions, interfacial analysis by TEM becomes more and more challenging, especially in the case of investigating failure mechanisms for nanoscale FRACTURED INTERFACES where electronic signatures found to be open. In this article, fractured interfaces at several Cl-type contacts (a path between a Bitline and a Metal 1 interconnecter) in a deep-subquarter-micron 256 Mbit DRAM device were investigated by a JEOL 2010F analytical transmission electron microscope (TEM) with field-emission gun (FEG) running at 200 KV. Considering the difficulty to exactly focus the fractured nano-scale interfaces at sufficiently high magnifications, high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) and analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled with x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) elemental linescan techniques were employed to provide supplemental information from difference prospects. An in-depth understanding for the nanoscale interfacial fracture mechanisms was established, and a simple model is initiated accordingly.",,"Dynamic random access storage; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fracture; Heterojunctions; Interfaces (materials); Semiconductor devices; Transmission electron microscopy; Field-emission guns (FEG); Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038310949

The information in this Report will prove valuable not only to the generator of this waste but to those organizations responsible for licensing and regulation. Since risks associated with waste are related to the concentration of the hazardous material, the quantity and form of the waste, and the potential for dispersion in the environment, the generator's first priority should be the partial or total elimination of the source of the waste stream. Furthermore, waste that cannot be eliminated should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner. Next, waste that cannot be eliminated or recycled should, when feasible, be treated to reduce its hazards and to reduce the volume of the wastes. The final step is that of selecting a disposal method consistent with protection of the public health and the environment which is in compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. An overview of applicable laws and regulations is essential in understanding the needs for a waste minimization program. The production and disposal of radioactive wastes are ultimately guided and controlled by federal laws beginning with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), as amended, and now include the following: Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA); Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments Act of 1984 (HSWA); Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 (LLRWPA); Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 (LLRWPAA); Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA); Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (PPA); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended; Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA). These laws and resulting regulations are discussed in detail in Section 2. Regulations derived from these laws are usually administered and enforced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The authority for implementing and enforcing many of EPA regulations is delegated to the states. The decreasing trend in waste generation by nuclear power utilities has been driven by the increased cost of waste disposal and by increased emphasis on overall plant performance by industry groups such as the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations. For example, it appears that the volume of these wastes has decreased sharply while the total radioactivity has remained nearly constant indicating that, in general, costs of disposal of LLRW are volume based. This reduction in utility waste is not seen in the small generators of waste, which suggests that waste minimization may be effective in reducing costs for them. Cost reduction for small generators can be a significant saving in overall project budgets. For the small generator, two sources of waste streams deserve particular mention. First, is the waste associated with analytical procedures, which has become a new source of wastes and can be expected to increase substantially with new activities such as decommissioning and environmental restoration. Second, is the large volume of scintillation fluids generated in research, academic and medical facilities. Currently these wastes in part are disposed into sanitary sewers without further regard to the radioactive materials content if they meet the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20.2003 (NRC, 2002a). An effective waste minimization program is required for each facility generating waste. To be effective, it is essential that the program be supported at all levels of management. A single individual with direct access to senior facility management should have responsibility for organizing, planning and promotion of all waste minimization functions. Waste minimization and management should be an integral part of the project and institutional planning and budgeting process. Effective strategies need the attention of senior management. Within this program an important element is the establishment of definitive and realistic goals. Employee awareness, incentives and training are essential to ensure that each individual involved in the program is an active participant in minimizing waste. An important management tool is trend analysis which can assist not only in delineating the progress in meeting goals but the data can focus attention on where additional resources may be needed. Detailed guidance is given in Section 4. Characterization of the individual sources of waste streams, which is required by regulations, can substantially aid in maximizing volume reduction and waste minimization. This characterization should include the chemical and radiological composition of the waste, information on input material, material usage, the generation process, applicable regulatory standards, minimization methods, and disposal costs. Information exchange and technology transfer is of great importance in bringing innovative approaches to the waste minimization program. Section 5 contains a compendium of internet and other sources of information exchange. The selection of waste minimization methods should begin with consideration of source reduction or elimination. This should then be followed by consideration of recycling the waste. The next step is treatment of the waste prior to disposal. Optimization of treatment and disposal should be evaluated from regulatory compliance and cost perspectives. Although source reduction has been effective in manufacturing and other industrial applications, it is more difficult in the research and educational environment, particularly in medicine, where substitution of materials can be difficult. Section 5 provides general guidance on waste minimization. Section 6 provides discussion and examples on the importance of attention to equipment, layout and process changes for minimizing waste. For example, introduction of microscale techniques. Examples of good operating practices are also discussed and examples given in this Section. Waste segregation in all its facets is the predominate issue: radioactive/nonradioactive, long/short half-life, radioactive/hazardous, etc. Detailed discussion and examples for each technique of minimization are presented in Section 7 which deals primarily with biomedical applications of radioactive material. For example, it has been shown that savings obtained through bulk purchases can be lost in disposing of the unused material and short-lived radionuclides can often be substituted for long-lived radionuclides. The last method discussed in Section 7 is treatment for storage or disposal. In the discussion and in the examples a number of approaches are given. For radioactive waste, the objectives are to reduce the radiotoxicity, the volume, and mobility of the contained radioactive materials. Further it is important to meet transportation, processor and disposal site requirements for waste that needs to be sent elsewhere for management. For mixed and multihazardous waste, an objective is to eliminate one or more of the hazardous properties to allow disposal as a single waste type. For multihazardous waste it is important to inactivate pathogens and other characteristics of regulated medical wastes. Section 8 provides specific guidance for the design of facilities with emphasis on the needs of the small user. Institutions handling radioactive material should incorporate pollution prevention and waste minimization considerations during the design of facilities. A primary issue during design is planning for a variety of waste handling areas such as satellite collection and assembly areas, temporary staging areas, central marshaling and processing areas, and treatment, storage and disposal areas. The objectives of good facility design will be met most effectively when the planners evaluate the complex interrelationships among the various processes, from construction to operation, decommissioning and demolition. There are a number of unresolved issues that adversely impact waste minimization. These are identified in Section 9. Of particular note are regulatory barriers to effective waste minimization. This is exemplified by the inconsistent approach to these issues by various federal and state regulations. For the small user, there is an absence of a well defined and focused infrastructure for waste.",,"activated carbon; chelating agent; microsphere; radioactive material; radioisotope; autoclave; bioremediation; carcass; chelation; disinfection; employee; environmental protection; filtration; generator; half life time; hazardous waste; hospital waste; human; hydrolysis; instrument sterilization; laboratory; laboratory personnel; law enforcement; liquid; liquid scintillation counting; low level radioactive waste; microencapsulation; nonhuman; nuclear energy; occupational health; occupational safety; oxidation; peroxidation; planning; pollution control; radiation measurement; radiation protection; radioactive waste disposal; recycling; review; risk management; solid waste; storage; technology; training; ultraviolet radiation; vitrification; waste disposal; waste management; waste segregation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037870626

The cycloaddition of two π bonds to yield a cyclobutane ring holds an important place in the annals of photochemistry. This potentially reversible transformation has become a celebrated example of a reaction that is kinetically inhibited as a thermally induced process due to orbital symmetry or topology constraints. The kinetic stability of photogenerated small rings is an important feature insuring the synthetic viability of many strained ring systems and the potential for photochemical energy storage. This chapter focuses on the theme of mechanisms of photoreactions of the (2 + 2) type (and the photoreversion), which have some potential for photochromic activity.

Gas exchange rate data were analysed by non-linear regression using Michaelis-Menten type models. O2 uptake followed a model with no inhibition by CO2. At harvest, maximum O2 uptake decreased with later harvest, and during storage it decreased in early-harvested pears, but not in late-harvested ones. Resistance to gas diffusion was higher for O2 than for CO2, contrary to what is predicted by Graham's Law. Late-harvested fruit showed higher resistance to gas diffusion, increased KmO2 with storage time and reduced aerobic respiration at pO2 close to that of storage atmosphere. Late-harvested fruit showed higher BH than normal-harvested fruit, especially with high pCO2. Gas exchange rates could be related to BH in late-harvested fruit.

'Conference' pears developed flesh browning, core browning and cavities under all CA-conditions. Severity of these disorders depended on the CO2 and O2 concentrations and the lenght of storage. CA-stored pears showed lower ATP concentrations than in air, specially in ultra low oxygen combined with high CO2. At these conditions, a low energy charge and an accumulation of ethanol and acetaldehyde as well as a strong decrease in total and free fatty acids was observed. In particular, the contents of C-16 and C-18 fatty acids were strongly reduced under CA-conditions. Most fatty acids of the polar lipids showed a slight increase followed by a decrease towards the end of storage. Neutral lipids declined initially and remained at a low levels thereafter. These results suggest the involvement of ATP in the development of pear browning possibly by limiting fatty acid biosynthesis.

External injuries of the fruit skin or internal disorders and cavities in the fruit tissue become finally visible as brown discoloured spots caused by oxidation of phenolic compounds.

Addition of 5 kPa carbon dioxide to the storage atmosphere increased the severity of this disorder. Experiments showed that anoxia can result in off-flavours, but not in internal browning. Internal browning is caused by brown pigments (melanins), which are formed due to oxidation of vacuolar polyphenols under the influence of tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1).

Mortality generally increases at higher CO2 and lower O2 concentration. Mortality at a given atmosphere generally increases with increasing temperature, and can also increase as temperature decreases near 0°C. Arthropods and lifestages within arthropods can vary considerably in their susceptibility to a given atmosphere. Effective treatments have been developed at cold storage temperatures and at high temperatures. Sequential CA treatments, including a short exposure to an extreme atmosphere followed by a longer exposure to a moderate or mild atmosphere or low temperature storage in air, have been very effective. The advantages of sequential treatments include improved commodity tolerance and the ability to conduct the follow-up mild atmosphere or cold storage during marine transit. Carbon dioxide has been used in combination with various fumigants to enhance the activity of the fumigant. Both low O2 and high CO2 atmospheres appear to induce metabolic arrest or a reduced metabolic rate in arthropods, resulting in low ATP levels, loss of membrane function, and eventual cell death. In addition, CO2 appears to have direct effects on membrane permeability; therefore, the failure of membranes under elevated CO2 could result from both energy insufficiency and increased membrane permeability. Therefore, it becomes more likely under elevated CO2 that the decreased energy supply due to metabolic arrest will not be able to meet the needs of maintaining a more permeable membrane.","Arthropods; Carbon dioxide; Fumigants; Heat; High temperature; Mode of action; Quarantine; Temperature",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141813311

This is done in the framework of a thermodynamic, internal-variable-based formulation for such behaviour as based on two basic assumptions: (i), the modeling of the local inelastic deformation in the material as a material isomorphism, and (ii), the modeling of the internal variables as structure tensors. The first of these assumptions follows from the idea that the local inelastic deformation does not influence the form of the dependence of the constitutive relations on the other independent constitutive variables. As shown in earlier work, one consequence of this assumption is the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into elastic and inelastic parts. And from a thermodynamic point of view, it is consistent with the idea that only a part of the local deformation results in energy storage in the material. Assumption (ii) leads among other things to concrete forms for the constitutive relations and the reduction of the flow rule to an evolution relation for the plastic right Cauchy-Green deformation or its inverse for general anisotropic behaviour. Finally, application of the general approach to the special cases of (1), non-linear kinematic and isotropic hardening in metals, and (2), anisotropic polymer membranes, is briefly discussed and demonstrated.",,"Decomposition; Elasticity; Hardening; Kinematics; Mathematical models; Plastic deformation; Elastic anisotropy; Finite deformation; Inelastic anisotropy; Structure tensors; Anisotropy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038025583

Ideally, the best option would be to avoid fire or explosion, which may be accomplished by either removing the explosible fuel/oxidant mixture, or the ignition source. One of the most overlooked and preventable ignition sources is electrostatic discharge (ESD). To evaluate the potential for ignition of a fuel/oxidant mixture, one must determine its minimum ESD ignition energy. Once the initiation thresholds have been identified, one can evaluate the likelihood of electrostatic charging and storage, which could result in an electrostatic discharge. Identifying this threshold level can be problematic. An ASTM standard has been developed but, for this test standard to be effective, it must reflect the true hazard potentials observed in industry. Some important questions that need to be addressed to increase the utility of any minimum ignition energy standard are: 1) discharge geometry, 2) duration of the discharge and 3) calculation of the energy of the discharge. This paper will discuss the importance of these factors when evaluating the least amount of energy required to initiate an explosion.",,"Electric discharges; Explosions; Geometry; Hazards; Oxidation; Ventilation; Discharge geometry; Fire protection; explosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037360599

The model allows prediction of transient behaviour of temperature, humidity and gas composition (CO2 &amp; O2). Several modules representing each of the components in a cool room were developed based on energy and mass balances. These sub-models were then interconnected to form a global cool room model. The production of CO 2 and the consumption of O2 is accounted for by including a respiration model. The heat generation by respiration is computed based on the production of CO2. Simultaneous simulation of several cool rooms (CA) loaded with different products is possible, which enables to predict the actual total load imposed on the refrigeration plant. The model allows tuning of control parameters to improve performance of the cool rooms. Due to the modular and object-oriented approach greater flexibility with respect to model modification is achieved. In this work the model was validated for an empty cool room.

In the NEET (Nuclear Excitation by Electronic Transition) process, an intense x-ray beam is employed to make vacancies, e.g. K-holes, in the atoms of a specific nuclear isotope. When a vacancy is filled by an electronic transition from a higher atomic level, there is some probability that instead of the usual x-ray or Auger emission, the nucleus of the atom itself will be excited. This is then followed by a nuclear decay exhibiting characteristic gamma-rays or other types of radiation, with time delays typical of the nuclear states involved. The probability for NEET increases when the energies of the atomic and the nuclear transitions become close. We address some theoretical aspects of the process and describe experimental efforts to observe it in 189Os and 197Au. The second process to be discussed is the possibility of ""triggering"" the decay of a nuclear isomer by irradiation with an x-ray beam. We focus on the case of the 31-year, 2.4-MeV, 16+ isomer of 178Hf. There has been speculation that if one could isolate gram quantities, say, of this isomer and then have the capability to accelerate its decay in a controlled way, one would have a powerful triggerable source of enormous energy. This could be used to generate explosions, for rapid irradiations, or for more general energy-storage applications, depending on the rate of energy release. We describe attempts to observe this process. © 2003 American Institute of Physics",,"Atoms; Energy storage; Gamma rays; Irradiation; Isomers; Electronic transition; Energy storage applications; Gram quantities; Nuclear excitation; Nuclear isotopes; Nuclear transitions; Synchrotron x rays; Theoretical aspects; X rays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078476034

Our results show that for high-Z systems relativistic effects such as spin-flip transitions show up in an unambiguous fashion which still persist even in the low-energy domain. Moreover, following REC into the 2p3/2 state a strong alignment of this level was observed by measuring the angular distribution of the Lyα1 transition in H-like uranium. Here, an interference between the leading E1 decay channel and the much weaker M2 multipole transition gives rise to a remarkable modified angular distribution of the emitted photons. For the particular case of hydrogen-like uranium the former variance of the experimental data with theoretical findings is removed when this E1/M2 multipole mixing is taken into account.

Four such rotor sections with simulated delaminations, foreign material inserts, and notches were investigated with a recently developed ultrasonic spectroscopy technique. The ultrasonic system employs a continuous swept sine waveform and performs an FFT on the frequency spectrum, In addition, the system is capable of equalizing the amount of energy at each frequency. Equalization of the frequency spectrum, along with interpretation of the second FFT aids in the evaluation of the spectrum resonance spacing, or fundamental frequency. The ultrasonic responses from defect free regions of the multilayered rotor sections are compared with responses from regions with simulated delaminations, foreign material inserts, and notches to establish the potential of this nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method for the evaluation of flywheel rotor systems.","Composite materials; Flywheel rotors; Resonance; Ultrasonic spectroscopy","Composite materials; Delamination; Energy storage; Fast Fourier transforms; Flywheels; Frequencies; Resonance; Ultrasonic measurement; Waveform analysis; Flywheel rotors; Frequency spectrum; Multilayers models; Nondestructive evaluation; Ultrasonic spectroscopy; Rotors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844285978

To demonstrate the usefulness of this method, this paper discusses typical hydroburst techniques to determine material properties for filament-wound composite rings. Test results are also presented. Seal design is a key element of this fixture, and a design has evolved that provides nearly uniform radial loading on the inside surface of the composite ring, while minimizing axial bending. Correlations of tow strand data with hydroburst lamina data are presented.

The bulk of the results presented were obtained using a composite (PMC IM7/8552 @135°C) material system. The material was characterized using a general multimechanism hereditary (viscoelastoplastic) model. As a general conclusion, the results have clearly shown that both the preload and the MDC rotor designs are significantly affected by time-dependent material behavior, which may impact the state of rotor balance and potentially reduce its operating life. In view of the results of the parametric studies and predictions made in the present study, the need for actual experimentation focusing on the time-dependent behavior of full-scale flywheel rotors is self-evident.","Composite flywheel; PMC; Rotating disk; Time-dependent material; Viscoelasticity; Viscoplasticity","Anisotropy; Creep; Deformation; Energy storage; Machine design; Rotating disks; Strain rate; Stress analysis; Viscoelasticity; Viscoplasticity; Composite flywheels; PMC; Time-dependent materials; Flywheels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844250075

The rotors are exposed to extreme loading conditions by high centrifugal forces, partially superposed by elevated temperatures due to an integrated electrical machine, bearings or air friction. A sophisticated fail-safe design of composite flywheel rotors has been applied here, which allows the rotor to fail catastrophically. To withstand the manifold burst behavior safely the exact loading of the containment must be known within a simultaneous engineering approach of rotor and containment. Therefore, adapted rotor rigs and devices for measuring the burst effects in the axial, radial and circumferential direction have been designed and successfully tested. Experimental failure studies on the fiber composite flywheel rims prove the manifold burst behavior and containment interactions. Extreme axial shock waves due to the composite fragment movement have been measured experimentally, which are principally not known for isotropic rotor failure.","Composite rotor; Containment; Failure effects; FEA; Flywheel; Spin testing","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Composite materials; Energy storage; Finite element method; Flywheels; Friction; Impurities; Machine design; Shock waves; Strength of materials; Air friction; Composite rims; Composite rotors; failure effects; Spin testing; Rotors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844248637

Now, after twenty years on primary depletion, a total of 500 MMSTB has been produced and additional 500 MMSTB remains to be produced of the original 2.6 BSTB in place. This corresponds to a recovery factor of 40%. Possibilities to increase ultimate recovery have been defined. These will require further insights into the detailed architecture of the field and improved understanding of the reservoir energy and displacement efficiency. Approximately 50% of the drive to date has been from rock compaction. The field is a North Sea Chalk field producing from Tor and Lower Hod Formations, porosity is exceeding 50% in places, some fractured permeability is present, but matrix permeability is generally low, less than 10 mD. Application of new technology has been fundamental in bringing the field up to current performance. New completion techniques combined with dedicated draw down schedules has been established to reduce influx of the weak chalk formations and reduce well failures. Special well design for a compacting and subsiding environment has also been implemented. Drilling of the overburden has been a key challenge. This has been partly mitigated by detailed geological mapping of problem zones versus structure, lithology, overpressure and wellbore stability analysis, but has also resulted in replacing extended reach wells by the installation of new flank drilling and production facilities. The particular characteristics of the overburden and chalk also pose challenges for data acquisition. Coring technology & practices are very tightly controlled, as is selection of logging devices. A water flood scheme has been approved based on a successful water flood pilot, but issues related to sweep efficiency, presence of fault and fracture zones and large variation in thickness need to be understood to capture it’s full potential. The reservoir will also experience extra water induced compaction and increased subsidence. New logging technology has recently made it possible to define and characterize the fracture system, which combined with a range of surveillance techniques will be key in this work. Seismic imaging has generally been a challenge at Valhall due to the presence of gas in the overburden. Use of 4C seismic technology has improved this. In addition, the 4D seismic response appears to be very sensitive to production-induced depletion, compaction of the reservoir and subsidence of the overburden and seafloor. Seismic techniques will be critical in future development. For a more detailed review of the first 10 years of Valhall, reference is made to the paper by Ali and Alcock [1].

This paper discusses recent work that was undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Glenn Research Center. A study was conducted to evaluate the use of regenerative systems on high altitude airships, which have the potential to meet many of these needs. The baseline airship configuration was derived from requirements set by the Department of Defense, in that it would fly at 70,000 feet (21 kilometers) for as long as a year. This would give it a 380 mile radius viewing capability which could provide radar coverage over most of the East Coast. The study commenced with various airship sizes to ascertain the capability of meeting long term missions throughout the year, especially given high winds during the winter. This would set the requirements for sizing the energy and power levels that would be used for stationkeeping as well as for an assumed payload. Operating scenarios versus technology breakthroughs will the trades necessary for continuous operation at altitude. These scenarios could include operating several airships sequentially, operating airships that are not fully regenerative (i.e., incorporating fuel storage to compensate for high-energy requirements) or operating alternative observation platforms such as Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) aircraft. Technology breakthroughs would be needed should the airship need to maintain continuous coverage throughout the year and at all locations. Primarily, these breakthroughs would require significant reductions in mass to minimize the lifting volume, which would minimize drag. The technologies that were incorporated in this study include: thin film photovoltaic cells, regenerative fuel cell energy storage systems, high voltage power management and distribution systems, lightweight, high speed motors and controls, low Reynolds number thermal management systems and mechanical integration. © 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Aircraft propulsion; Electric power systems; Energy conversion; Engineering research; Flight control systems; Fuel storage; NASA; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic cells; Regenerative fuel cells; Reynolds number; Upper atmosphere; Airborne warning and control system; Aircraft propulsion systems; Energy storage systems; High altitude airships; High energy requirements; Long term observations; Thermal management systems; Thin film photovoltaic cells; Airships",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088760048

Scheduling operations on multivoltage functional units lowers the energy-delay product by exploiting slack in the schedule. We find that using multivoltage partitioned register files do the same by exploiting the variable lifetimes in the schedule. In a resource constrained context, longer variable lifetimes provide the opportunity to store such variables in low voltage register files.

As mismatches occur much more frequently than matches in many situations, such circuits are extremely energy-inefficient. In recognition of this inefficiency, a series of dissipate-on-match comparator designs have been proposed to address the power considerations. These designs, however, are limited to at most 8-bit long arguments. In this paper, we examine the designs of energy-efficient comparators capable of comparing arguments as long as 32 bits in size. Such long comparands are routinely used in the load-store queues, caches, BTBs and TLBs. We use the actual layout data and the realistic bit patterns of the comparands (obtained from the simulated execution of SPEC 2000 benchmarks) to show the energy impact from the use of the new comparators. In general, a non-trivial combination of traditional and dissipate-on-match 8-bit comparator blocks represents the most energy-efficient and fastest solution. As an example of this general approach, we show how fast and energy-efficient comparators can be designed for comparing addresses within the load-store queue of a superscalar processor.","Low-power comparators; Superscalar datapath","Benchmarking; Bit error rate; Buffer storage; Computer simulation; Data reduction; Data storage equipment; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Formal logic; Queueing networks; Low-power comparators; Superscalar datapath; Microprocessor chips",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088341060

In this work, we focus on instruction caches and tailor two techniques that exploit the two major factors that shape the instruction access behavior, namely, hotspot execution and sequentiality. First, we adopt a hotspot detection mechanism by profiling the branch behavior at runtime and utilize this to implement a HotSpot based Leakage Management (HSLM) mechanism. Second, we exploit code sequentiality in implementing a Just-In-Time Activation (JITA) that transitions cache lines to active mode just before they are accessed. We utilize the recently proposed drowsy cache that dynamically scales voltages for leakage reduction and implement various schemes that use different combinations of HSLM and JITA. Our experimental evaluation using the SPEC2000 benchmark suite shows that instruction cache leakage energy consumption can be reduced by 63%, 49% and 29%, on the average, as compared to an unoptimized cache, a recently proposed hardware optimized cache, and a cache optimized using compiler, respectively. Further, we observe that these energy savings can be obtained without a significant impact on performance.","Cache design; Leakage power","Benchmarking; Buffer storage; Codes (standards); Design; Electric potential; Energy utilization; Microprocessor chips; Optimization; Program processors; Cache design; Leakage power; Leakage currents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088187019

This paper summarizes the development of a novel MS that improves reliability via fault tolerant operation. Specifically, flux coupling between poles of a homopolar magnetic bearing is shown to deliver desired forces even after termination of coil currents to a subset of ""failed poles"". Linear, coordinate decoupled force-voltage relations are also maintained before and after failure by bias linearization. Current distribution matrices (CDM) which adjust the currents and fluxes following a pole set failure are determined for many faulted pole combinations. The CDM's and the system responses are obtained utilizing 1D magnetic circuit models with fringe and leakage factors derived from detailed, 3D, finite element field models. Reliability results are presented vs. detection/correction delay time and individual power amplifier reliability for 4, 6, and 7 pole configurations. Reliability is shown for two ""success"" criteria, i.e. (a) no catcher bearing contact following pole failures and (b) re-levitation off of the catcher bearings following pole failures.

In addition, lithium-ion technology is especially attractive, since it has the potential to operate over a very wide temperature range, which is particularly important for a number of applications. This potential derives from the fact that lithium-ion cells possess organic solvent-based electrolytes, in contrast to aqueous-based electrolytes, which can be tailored to provide high conductivity over a wide range of temperatures. Thus, in recent years, advances in electrolyte formulations have led to dramatic improvements in the capability of lithium-ion technology to operate at extreme temperatures, especially low temperatures. However, it still remains a challenge to demonstrate excellent low temperature capability throughout the life of a cell, especially after being subjected to high temperature cycling or exposure. In order to understand these performance limitations, a number of aerospace prototype cells, ranging in capacity from 1 to 45 AHr, have been tested over a wide range of temperatures (-70 to +75°C). In addition, many cells have been tested under conditions of alternating high and low temperatures to determine the impact that variable temperature cycling has upon cell health and performance. To further elaborate upon possible performance degradation mechanisms present, the results of a number of experimental three-electrode cells will be presented. These individual cells have provided a test vehicle in which electrochemical characterization of electrodes can be performed, as a function of cycling and storage. © 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The increasing unreliability of electrical energy from the grid is financially hurting many organizations whose business revenue is dependent on the constant interchange of digital data information. Primary power to these organizations is provide by the electrical grid and backed up with lead acid batteries and diesel generators. Unfortunately, both the batteries and the diesel generators have many undesirable attributes including hazardous emissions, low reliability, and high cycle-life costs. ElectroChem's ECcell™ fuel cell based system has been designed to deliver reliable and high quality electrical energy for backup power applications with a low cycle-life cost. During a power outage, our system provides uninterrupted electrical power from a proton exchange membrane fuel cell stack using pressurized storage of hydrogen and oxygen gas. Water generated during the fuel cell reaction is collected and stored until the grid power or other primary power is restored. This water is then electrolyzed in our highpressure electrolyzer regenerating the hydrogen and oxygen gases in the gas tanks. One of the real advantages of our system approach is that the system is entirely a closed-loop system that is clean and quiet.

This leads to substantial mass savings. An advantage is also the capacity to deliver very high power. Li-Ion battery is today perceived by Astrium as the preferred technology for a 20 kW and higher power satellites. The prime function of the battery in telecommunication satellites is to supply energy to the satellite payloads whenever adequate solar array power is not available, during Sun and Moon eclipses. The geostationary communication satellites battery is using the current NiH2 technology. The size of these satellites, and consequently the power demanded during eclipses have been continuously growing since the 80's. By the early 90's, the average satellite weight was 2 tons for a power demand in the range 2 to 3 kW. Today the average weight is at least 5 tons for a 10 kW power demand. The complete battery will reach soon the critical weight. Considering the launch price of each kilogram to GEO orbit, the battery should become soon a strategic and key component. Moreover, the use of NiH2 battery will be limited in the range 14 to 16 kW due to the high thermal dissipation. Li-Ion is considered as the future technology for the satellites. Its numerous advantages compared to the NiH2 will lead to a short-term standardization of the choice of this technology for telecommunication satellites. The main advantage is the weight reduction of the battery system due to higher energy-to-weight ratio. The energy-to-weight ratio of Li-Ion is higher than 125 Wh/kg as the maximum achieved with NiH2 is 60 Wh/kg. At battery level, the weight reduction is at least more than 40%. More than 300 kg will be saved for a 20 kW satellite. The second advantage is also a weight saving linked to the lower thermal dissipation and higher energy efficiency of the Li-Ion compared to the NiH2. These characteristics impact on the solar panel and radiators sizes. At least 5 to 10% of the weight could be saved. An other advantage is the lower cost of a Li/ion cell compared to a Ni/H2 cell. © 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

In this paper, we address the memory energy issues by using a streamlined architectural partitioning technique that effectively reduces energy consumption in the memory subsystem without compromising performance. It is achieved by decoupling the d-TLB lookups and the data cache accesses, based on the semantic regions defined by programming languages and software convention, into discrete reference substreams - stack, global static, and heap.

The most effective means to reduce the system mass changes the process streams from mono-directional to bi-directional flow within the fluid lines. Unifying each process stream inlet and outlet lines require system components that function independently of fluid flow direction. A software model performed a preliminary evaluation of the bi-directional pressure regulation potential and was used to develop the resulting control algorithm. The bi-directional pressure regulator (BiPR), a software controlled stepping motor connected to a needle valve, is situated between the supply/vent port and a gas storage tank within the physical test stand. The BiPR controls the orifice size according to both the pressure on the supply/vent side of the valve and the pressure within the gas storage tank. Conducted between November 2002 and March 2003, the results from multiple charge/discharge cycles of the gas storage tank through the BiPR encourage further development of bidirectional flow systems. © 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Aerospace applications; Energy conversion; Potential energy; Pressure regulation; Pressure regulators; Regenerative fuel cells; Software testing; Stepping motors; Tanks (containers); Bi-directional flows; Fuel cell operation; Gas storage tank; Glenn Research Center; Multiple charge; Potential energy density; System components; Unitized regenerative fuel cell systems; Flow of fluids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086613456

Loop buffering techniques have been proposed for capturing and processing these loops in small buffers to reduce the processor's instruction fetch energy. However, these schemes are limited to straight-line or inner-most loops and fail to adequately handle complex loops. In this paper, we propose a dynamic loop buffering mechanism that uses backwards branch control information to identify, capture and process complex loop structures. The DLB controller has been fully implemented in VHDL, synthesized and timed with the IBM Booledozer and Einstimer Synthesis tools, and analyzed for power with the Sequence PowerTheater tool. Our experiments show that the DLB approach, on average, results in a factor of 3 reduction in energy consumption compared to a traditional instruction memory design at an area overhead of about 9%.","Instruction fetch; Loop buffer; Low-power","Benchmarking; Buffer storage; Computer architecture; Data storage equipment; Digital signal processing; Energy utilization; Program compilers; Switching systems; Instruction fetch; Loop buffers; Low power; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086491713

For physical systems a natural candidate storage function is the difference between the stored and the supplied energies- leading to the so-called Energy-Balancing control. whose underlying stabilization mechanism is particularly appealing. Unfortunately, energy-balancing stabilization is stymied by the existence of pervasive dissipation, that appears in many engineering applications. To overcome the dissipation obstacle the method of Interconnection and Damping Assignment. that endows the closed-loop system with a special- port-controlled Hamiltonian- structure, has been proposed. If, as in most practical examples. the open-loop system already has this structure. and the damping is not pervasive, both methods are equivalent. In this brief note we show that the methods are also equivalent. with an alternative definition of the supplied energy, when the damping is pervasive. Instrumental for our developments is the observation that, swapping the damping terms in the classical dissipation inequality. we can establish passivity of port-controlled Hamiltonian systems with respect to SOlIlE' new external variables- but with the same storage function.

Presently, this type of waste is subject to land disposal followed by lengthy bioremediation. This technology, based on the transformation of pulse energy, known as PET technology, recovers the heating energy of oil fraction from the waste containing up to 50% by volume of water, without separating the oil from the water. The process involves the fine emulsification of the mixture using a specially designed micro-pulsation unit. The resulting emulsion is then combustible so that the waste can be converted into useful fuel. Reported are results from the R&D testing of the technology with waste slurries and a variety of water-cut values. The most efficient combustion would typically result below 20% water cut. For higher values of water cut, some slurries could still be converted to fuel, whereas others require further processing or disposal. The study also shows the effect of post-treatment particle size distribution on the heating value of the treated waste. It demonstrates that adjusting the pulsation unit to produce emulsions of desired content could control the process. Other data, presented in the paper, include combined effects of types of waste, percentage of water cut, oil grade, emulsion stability, and energy consumption and production. PET has economic and environmental advantages over conventional techniques (biological treatment/gasification of waste fuels). The technology reduces pollution and generates energy, while reducing the amount of waste. There is no required energy input for additional heating or drying. There are also considerable savings in transportation and storage costs. In addition, up to two-thirds of existing liquid waste could be recycled as useful fuel.

D.C., United States","Sonic logging in shallow soft sands often shows ambiguous response. In particular, the dipole source provides two different shear slowness measurements at the same level of reliability. No general consensus has been found so far on the factors causing shear wave double arrivals. The petrophysicist has to make a difficult choice between two different values. This often leads to uncertainties in sonic log applications (AVO for instance) and to a bad use of the acquired data. This problem has been investigated in vertical wells from West Africa where double shear energy is clearly visible in water-bearing sands adjacent to hydrocarbon reservoirs. Sonic logging was performed in all available modes, generated by monopole and dipole source drives, and recorded by in-line and offline oriented receivers. A systematic analysis of data acquired leads to the following conclusions: • The dual character of shear waves is associated to a similar dichotomy on compressional waves. • The dual wave propagation is explained by a radial velocity profile, i.e. the mechanical properties of the sand layer vary in a direction perpendicular to the well axis • The fast velocity belt is adjacent to the borehole wall while the slow velocity belt is located further away from the borehole axis. In the studied wells, the velocity zoning appears to be artificially created by drilling operations and by invasive mud filtration in sands locally un-cemented. The phenomenon would be triggered by formation water quickly displaced and replaced by mud filtrate. The process disrupts the original sand grain texture and induces mechanical weakening of the formation as a general effect. However, close to the borehole wall, the solid particles of the mud filtrate work to reinforce the local sand texture. The near/reinforced zone and the far/weakened zone generate respectively fast and slow sonic paths in both compressional and shear waves.These case histories contribute to a better understanding of soft sand petrophysics in general sense. A conceptual scheme is provided allowing for a consistent choice of compressional/shear pairs. In addition, the different zones of investigation (near vs. far) are identified and optimally analyzed for the final log application (formation evaluation, AVO/seismic, geo-mechanics and drilling management). © 2003 Society of Petrophysicists and Well-Log Analysts.

Starch is also the major energy source in human and animal diets. Starch granules, consisting of highly branched amylopectin and primarily linear amylase (Chapter 1), are synthesized by apposition in amyloplasts of plants. Amylopectin and amylose molecules are organized in semicrystalline starch granules, and the outer chains of amylopectin molecules are arranged in double-helical crystalline structures.1 The native granular structure of starch, 2,3 with a specific density about 1.5 g/cm3, economizes the space for energy storage in seeds, grains, and tubers until it is ready to be utilized during germination. Transit starch in leaves, which is synthesized using sunlight and carbon dioxide during the daytime and hydrolyzed to glucose to be transported to storage organs at night, is in flat, small granule forms.4 The granular form of starch present in grains, tubers, and roots facilitates its isolation by gravity and by centrifugation during wet milling. The granular structure of starch also makes it possible to conduct chemical reactions followed by washing to produce chemically modified starches that are used as commodity products for food and industrial applications.5 Major markets of starch applications are in corn syrups, high-fructose corn syrup, paper, textile, and food industries. In recent years, there is increasing demand in alcohol fuel produced from starch fermentation to partially replace gasoline and to increase the octane number of the fuel. Alcohol containing gasoline has been reported to reduce air pollution.

This has led to renewed interest in olive cake (OC) as an alternative energy source in Turkey due to some of its advantages, such as negligible sulfur content, reducing environmental impact, low cost compared to fossil fuels, problem-free storage, and lack of transportation requirements if used in an olive oil production facility. OC is a byproduct of olive oil production and is a solid material consisting of seed particles and the fleshy parts of olives. The Mediterranean region represents 98% of the world's olive tree population. In this regard, Turkey is among the top 5 main olive oil-producing countries in the world. The main objective of the present study is to investigate the potential and utilization of OC in the country. It is estimated that over 360,000 tons of OC, corresponding to an average of 150,000 tons of oil equivalent (toe), were produced in the 2000-2001 season in Turkey. Suitable combustion systems, such as fluidized bed systems, stoker fed from the bottom with secondary air supply, etc., should be used for efficient energy production from the OC. There are no limiting values related to emissions for OC in the Turkish regulations of air quality yet. There are, however, some studies being conducted by the Ministry of Environment for the determination of these limiting values. In light of the present study, it may be concluded that OC is a very promising source of energy in Turkey.","Alpeorujo; Alternative fuel; Combustion; Energy sources; Olive; Olive cake; Olive oil; Renewable energy; Turkey","Combustion; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fluidized beds; Renewable energy resources; Stokers; Sulfur; Alpeorujo; Olive cake; Olive oil; Turkey; Synthetic fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047692600

Controls on the solution chemistry are in place to preclude the initiation and propagation of degradation in the tanks within the liquid space. However, recent experience has shown that steel not in contact with the bulk waste solution but exposed to the ""vapor space"" above the bulk waste and the liquid/air interface, may be vulnerable to the initiation and propagation of degradation. Experimentation was performed to determine the potential for vapor space corrosion and liquid/air interface corrosion in ASTM A285 and A537 steels, the materials of construction of the Savannah River Site (SRS) HLW storage tanks. Corrosion studies were performed with flat, unstressed coupons in nitrate, nitrite, and hydroxide solutions. The results suggest that the potential for vapor space and liquid/air interface general corrosion and pitting exists even with inhibited solution chemistry. Further experimentation is planned to quantify the magnitude of the corrosion and also to determine the potential for stress corrosion cracking under similar conditions. © 2003 by NACE International.","Carbon steel; High level waste tank; Pitting","Carbon steel; Corrosive effects; Interfaces (materials); Liquids; Radioactive wastes; Steel corrosion; Stress corrosion cracking; Tanks (containers); Corrosion mechanisms; High level radioactive wastes; High level waste tank; Initiation and propagation; Liquid/air interface; Materials of constructions; Savannah River sites; Vapor space corrosion; Pitting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046839762

These methods extract Q factors by numerically adding a capacitor in parallel to measured y 11 data of aD inductor, and by computing the frequency stability factor aDd 3-dB bandwidth at the resonant frequency of the resulting network. These parameters are then converted to effective quality factors using relationships for simple parallel RLC circuits. By sweeping the numerically added capadtance value, effective quality factors at varying frequencies are computed. These new techniques, in addition to being more relevant for circuit design, provide physically reasonable estimates all the way up to the self-resonant frequencies of inductors. At modente to high frequencies, the commonly used Q definition [-Im(y 11)/Re(y 11) can significantly underestimate and can even give unreasonable results. Data obtained using the new methods suggest that quality factors remain high and integrated indacton remain useful all the way up to their self- resonant frequencies, contrary to the behavior obtained using -Im(y 11)/Re(y 11). These indicate that the commonly used technique can lead to improper use and optimization of integrated inductors. © 2003 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Passenger railroad vehicles discussed in this paper is a fuel cell powered hybrid drive train in which fuel cells are used as its primary power source and batteries or ultracapacitors or flywheels as its peaking power source. The fuel cells supply a base power with modest magnitude and operated in their optimal region. The peaking power sources (batteries, ultracapacitors or flywheels) supply peaking power for acceleration and uphill operation. In deceleration or downhill operation, part of the braking energy can be recovered and restored into the peaking power source and then be re-used later on. Nowadays, many difficulties exist for the application of fuel cell on road vehicles, such as heavy, bulky batteries, bulky fuel cell system and fuel storage or fuel preparing system (hydrogen tank or fuel reformer). These difficulties become less severe for rail vehicles, due to the relatively large available space, need for weight to increase wheel traction and professional management.

Energy is stored in fat cells as triacylglycerols (TG). Factors that control the storage and mobilization of TG in adipocytes are important regulators of fat accumulation in various fat areas (1). The major source for adipocyte TG comes from chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). TG in the lipoprotein particles are hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) located on the capillary walls of adipose tissue so that nonesteri?ed fatty acids (NEFA) and monoacylglycerol are formed. NEFA are probably taken up by the fat cell through passive and active transport. Indeed, speci?c NEFA-transporting proteins have been described (2-4). Once taken up by the fat cells, NEFA are esteri?ed to TG.

The fragments formed deeper than the critical depth of seawater and are unlikely to be formed by supercritical expansion of seawater upon heating in contact with hot lava. Discharge of CO2 through erupting lava is the most likely way to make such bubbles at &gt;298 bars pressure. The distribution and composition of limu o Pele fragments indicate that low-energy strombolian activity is a common, although minor, component of eruptions along mid-ocean ridges. Combined dissolved and exsolved volatile contents of N-MORB from the Gorda Ridge with 12.8-15.6% spherical vesicles are about 0.78% CO2 and 0.18 wt% H2O and exceed estimates of primary CO2 of only 0.07 to 0.095 wt% calculated from whole rock Nb concentrations. This discrepancy suggests that the magmas accumulated an exsolved volatile phase prior to eruption. The evidence that a separated volatile phase drives strombolian eruptions on the seafloor also implies that volatile bubbles coalesce during storage or transport to the surface. The combination of large bubbles in otherwise dense magma suggests nearly complete coalescence of small bubbles and is most consistent with accumulation of the exsolved volatile phase, most likely near the tops of crustal magma chambers, prior to upward transport in shallow conduits to the eruptive vents on the seafloor. A portion of this CO2-rich separated fluid phase is released in brief bursts during eruptions where it becomes part of event plumes. © 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962735340

So, its development and application have widely been studied with the help of the power electronics technology and analysis by computer. Disk type single phase switched reluctance motor use the axial and radial flux simultaneously. It is 6 stator poles with '⊂' type core, magnetized by a circular type excitation coil of single phase and an outer-rotor of 6 salient poles with ""⊣"" type. The inductance profile of switched reluctance motor is an important parameter in the verification of the design and performance of the driver. Its profile is a function of rotor pole position. In this paper, the flux linkage measurement system was designed and manufactured with rotor pole positions. From the measured data, the linkage flux was calculated versus current, inductance profile, co-energy and torque. © 2003 International Academic Publishers/World Publishing Corporation.",,"Digital storage; Electric machinery; Inductance; Poles; Variable speed drives; Development and applications; Excitation coils; Flux-linkage measurement; Manufacturing cost; Salient poles; Single phase; Stator poles; Switched Reluctance Motor; Reluctance motors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958954610

However, as latencies increase, the size of the instruction window must increase even faster if we are to continue to tolerate these latencies. We have already reached the point where the size of an instruction window that can handle these latencies is prohibitively large in terms of both design complexity and power consumption. And, the problem is getting worse. This paper proposes runahead execution as an effective way to increase memory latency tolerance in an out-of-order processor without requiring an unreasonably large instruction window. Runahead execution unblocks the instruction window blocked by long latency operations allowing the processor to execute far ahead in the program path. This results in data being prefetched into caches long before it is needed. On a machine model based on the Intel® Pentium® processor, having a 128-entry instruction window, adding runahead execution improves the IPC (instructions per cycle) by 22% across a wide range of memory intensive applications. Also, for the same machine model, runahead execution combined with a 128-entry window performs within 1% of a machine with no runahead execution and a 384-entry instruction window. © 2003 IEEE.","Delay; Energy consumption; Engines; Hardware; Microprocessors; Out of order; Prefetching; Software; Trademarks; Windows","Buffer storage; Computer hardware; Computer software; Energy utilization; Engines; Memory architecture; Microprocessor chips; Program processors; Supercomputers; Trademarks; Windows; Delay; High performance processors; Instructions per cycles; Large instruction window; Out of order; Out-of-order execution; Out-of-order processors; Prefetching; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955506994

An analytical expression for torque in terms of stator phase current and rotor position can he used as torque estimator for this purpose. Such an analytical torque expression can he derived from SRM flux-Linkage model, using the co-energy principle. We have observed that most of the flux-linkage models for SRM available in the literature can map the measured flux-linkage accurately. However, the torque expression obtained fmm the flux-Linkage model fail to predict the torque accurately. In this work, a physically intuitive nonlinear flux-linkage model reported by Torrey et 01. in [31 has been adapted. The torque expression is derived from the flux-linkage expression. However, instead of using flux-Linkage data to find the parameters of the flux-linkage model, static torque data have been used to obtain the parameters of the torque model directly. The torque estimator provides very good match for the static measured torque data. It has Been experimentally verified that the torque estimator is accurate under dynamic conditions as well. © 2003 IEEE.","SRM modelling; Switched reluctance motor; Torque estimator","Digital storage; Power electronics; Reluctance motors; Torque; Analytical expressions; Closed-loop control; Dynamic condition; Flux linkage models; Nonlinear flux linkages; Switched Reluctance Motor; Torque estimator; Torque feedback; Electric machine theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955282019

Large cells (width>150 nm) showed a significant lower activation energy than expected from single-domain-theory, indicating non-uniform switching. Small cells (width ∼ 90 nm and length 150 to 200 nm) could be well described by Stoner-Wohlfarth single domain model and single step switching with Arrhenius activation energy.

Our cache organization and operational mechanism are especially designed to maximize temporal locality and spatial locality, selectively and adaptively. The overhead of prefetching operation is shown to be a negligible factor. Also the accuracy of the prefetch operation is over 97% of the total number of prefetches generated. Simulation shows that the average memory access time of the proposed cache is equal to that of a conventional direct-mapped cache with eight times as much space. In addition, the simulations show that our cache achieves better performance than a 2-way or 4-way set associative cache with four or twice as much space respectively. And also, compared with a victim cache with 32-byte block size, the average miss ratio can be reduced by over twice for multimedia applications. We have also shown that power consumption in the AMMC is around 10% ∼ 60% lower than these various cache systems. © 2003 IEEE.","Application software; Computer science; Energy consumption; Hardware; Laboratories; Multimedia systems; Power generation; Prefetching; Research and development; Signal generators","Application programs; Buffer storage; Computer science; Energy utilization; Hardware; Laboratories; Multimedia systems; Power generation; Signal generators; Average memory access time; Direct mapped cache; Embedded multimedia; Multimedia applications; Operational mechanism; Prefetching; Research and development; Set associative cache; Computer hardware",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947925219

In this paper, we explore some options along each of these two dimensions. We have constructed a logical-disk system, which can be configured to run on different storage technologies and to emulate the behavior of different file systems. As we explore these configuration options, we find that the energy behavior is determined by a complex interaction of three factors: the power management mechanism of the storage device, the distribution of idleness in the workload, and the file system strategies that attempt to exploit and bridge these first two factors. © 2003 IEEE.","Bandwidth; Bridges; Computer science; Delay; Energy consumption; Energy management; Energy storage; File systems; Power system management; Space technology","Bandwidth; Bridges; Computer science; Energy management; Energy storage; Energy utilization; File organization; Power management; Storage management; Virtual storage; Configuration options; Delay; File systems; Management mechanisms; Multiple dimensions; Power system management; Space technologies; Storage technology; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947919293

The code uses a novel parallel approach to solve the Kohn-Sham equations obtained from density functional theory (DFT). This approach uses limited local communications avoiding the large global communications found in other DFT based methods. This allows our code to scale efficiently to very large processor counts and large system sizes. Computationally our method can be implemented using mainly BLAS3 routines which typically run at a very high percentage of peak speed on most computers. Our large scale quantum mechanical simulations using this method reveal new details of the orientational configuration of the magnetic moments of γ-FeMn that are unobtainable by any other means. The understanding of the magnetic structure of γ-FeMn is important in exchange bias, which involves the use of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) layer such as FeMn to pin the orientation of the magnetic moment of a proximate ferromagnetic (FM). Exchange bias is of fundamental importance in magnetic multilayer storage and read head devices. Here the equation of motion of first principles SD is used to perform relaxations of model magnetic structures to the true ground (equilibrium) state.

TCAM can achieve O(1) lookup complexity with parallel technique. However, TCAM has three explicit disadvantages: high cost; high power consumption; and complex update. For load balancing and policy routing, routers have to hold considerable multi-nexthop routes with multi paths for a destination network. This paper proposes a fast TCAM-based lookup scheme that can support multi-nexthop routing lookups. Using two level index tables, the scheme can store and retrieve multi-nexthop routes quickly. To improve update performance of TCAM, we also propose a fast update algorithm-N-subspace algorithm that can approximately reach O(1) update complexity for TCAM routing tables. To decrease cost and power consumption of TCAM, we also apply an effective routing compaction method that is based on the trie structure and can reduce 20% routes for current Internet routing tables. Also, the scheme can easily scale to IPv6. © 2003 IEEE.","Bandwidth; Compaction; Computer science; Costs; Energy consumption; Hardware; Internet; Routing; SDRAM","Bandwidth; Compaction; Complex networks; Computer hardware; Computer science; Costs; Dynamic random access storage; Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Internet; Logic gates; Mobile computing; Network management; Routers; Compaction methods; Destination network; High power consumption; Parallel techniques; Routing; SDRAM; Sub-space algorithms; Ternary content addressable memory; Ternary content adressable memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946131437

A shipboard power distribution system is a stiff, isolated power system that is vulnerable to system transients. Power quality problems, such as voltage sags, which arise due to a fault or a pulsed load, can cause interruptions of critical loads. Critical loads include radar systems, pumps and weapon systems. A series voltage injection type flywheel energy storage system is proposed to mitigate voltage sap and maximize the survivability of the ship. The bask circuit consists of an energy storage system, power electronic interface and a series injection transformer. In this case the energy storage system consists of a flywheel coupled to an induction machine. The flywheel stores energy In the form of kinetic energy and the induction machine is used for energy conversion. The power electronic interface facilitates the bi-directional flow of power for charging and discharging the flywheel through the induction machine. The stored energy is used for sag correction when the critical load sees a voltage sag. Indirect field oriented control with space vector PWM is used to control the induction machine. Sinusoidal PWM is used for controlling the power system side converter.

This circuit-level technique overcomes the potential limitations in the existing techniques for reducing leakage in memory circuits. In this design, the data stored in the cell is retained even when the memory is put in the stand-by mode, with no additional complexity or circuit overhead.

Increasing concern about the effects of nuclear tests led to a series of international treaties limiting nuclear tests, culminating in the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty in 1996. The CTBT, which prohibits all nuclear test explosions in all environments, was opened for signature in New York on 24 September 1996, when it was signed by 71 States, including the (then) five nuclear-weapon States. A critical element of the treaty is the capability to verify compliance with the Treaty. The United States Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) is tasked with monitoring compliance of nuclear test ban treaties for the US. AFTAC utilizes several different techniques, each designed to monitor a specific physical domain (i.e. underground, space, oceans, etc.). Together, these monitoring systems, equipment, and methods form the US Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS). An essential part of the USAEDS is the Hydroacoustic Data Acquisition System (HDAS). The HDAS consists of underwater sensor systems linked to shore facilities with undersea data transmission cables, and shore based computers for data storage and transmission to the National Data Center (NDC). HDAS sensors are installed at Diego Garcia (Indian Ocean), Cape Leeuwen, Australia and Juan Fernandez Island, (South Pacific Ocean). Another HDAS system is to be installed at Ascension Island (AI), a volcanic island located in the South Atlantic Ocean, with one array located north and one array south of the island, with cabling back to shore at Southwest Bay. Figure 1 shows the location of Ascension Island. (Figure presented) In preparation for installation of the HDAS cable and sensors at Ascension Island, a detailed Desktop Study, Marine Cable Route and Sensor Site survey and shore landing preparations were needed. The extremely remote location of the island and the volcanic nature of the island required unique approaches for the survey and shore landing operations.

These coatings protect the underlying sensors and electronics from physical damage and water ingression, while allowing the passage of acoustical energy without significant reflection, loss, or distortion. Critical material parameters for superior acoustical performance include: (1) density and sound speeds close to those of seawater; (2) low mechanical loss tangent; (3) medium to high shear loss tangent; (4) low shear storage modulus; (5) Poisson's ratio near 0.50; and (6) no major polymeric transitions in/near the frequency and temperature ranges of interest. Recently, a new polyurethane-urea elastomer was synthesized at Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC), Division Newport for use as an encapsulant for transducers and hydrophones. This material, ""NUWC XP-1"", utilizes a toluene diisocyanate/polyether polyol base (molecular weight about 1500) and dimethylthiotoluenediamine as the cross-linking/curing agent. NUWC XP-1 cures overnight at room temperature to 75 Shore A hardness. Its sound speed is very close to that of seawater at room temperature, and at 25°C, its acoustic impedance is 1.71 × 106 metric Rayls. NUWC XP-1 exhibits a sub-ambient glass transition temperature (-31°C) and its dynamic mechanical properties are almost ideal for underwater transducer/hydrophone encapsulants. Side-by-side comparisons with several commonly used, commercially-manufactured Polyurethane encapsulants (PRC-DeSoto's PR-1547 and PR-1592; Cytec's Conathane EN-7) determined that properties of NUWC XP-1 are equal to, or better in almost every category required for effectively encapsulating acoustic devices and sensors. A distinct benefit to the industry is that the chemical formula of NUWC XP-1 is controlled by the U.S. Navy. The material is made from basic raw materials; thus its future availability is more assured than many other commercial products. © 2003 MTS.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945379869

These large emittances must be reduced or ""cooled"" both in size and in energy spread before the muons can be efficiently accelerated. Therefore, formation of muon beams sufficiently intense to drive a Neutrino Factory or Muon Collider requires multi-stage preparation. Further, because of the large beam phase space which must be successfully controlled, accelerated, and transported, the major stages that comprise such a facility: proton driver, production, capture, phase rotation, cooling, acceleration, and storage are complex and strongly interlinked. Each of the stages must be consecutively matched and simultaneously optimized with upstream and downstream systems, meeting challenges not only technically in the optics and component design, but also in the modeling of both new and extended components. One design for transverse cooling, for example, employs meter-diameter solenoids to maintain strong focusing - 300-500 mr beam divergences - across ultra-large momentum ranges, ≥ ±20% δp/p, defying conventional approximations to the dynamics and field representation. To now, the interplay of the different systems and staging strategies has not been formally addressed.

The use of thermal-assistance for writing very high anisotropy magnetic media is a natural means of continuing the decades-old paradigm for scaling upward the storage density capability of particulate magnetic films. This approach appears to be fully compatible with extension of the performance of perpendicular recording well beyond its expected limits using ambient temperature recording. Recent developments indicate that HAMR may take advantage of thermal energy imparted in the recording process to achieve extremely fast magnetic switching without the need for inordinately high writing head fields, thus enabling performance advances. ï¿½ 2003 IEEE.","Anisotropic magnetoresistance; Heat-assisted magnetic recording; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic films; Magnetic switching; Memory; Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; Perpendicular magnetic recording; Temperature; Writing","Anisotropy; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Enhanced magnetoresistance; Magnetic devices; Magnetic films; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Magnetism; Technical writing; Temperature; Heat assisted magnetic recording; Magnetic switching; Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; Perpendicular magnetic recording; Perpendicular recording; Recording process; Temperature recording; Thermal assistance; Magnetic anisotropy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945318183

Box 619, Migdal Haemek, 23105, Israel","Silicon oxide-nitride-oxide multilayers (ONO stacks) attract considerable interest for the charge storage structures in non-volatile memory devices [1 -2]. Ultra-thin ONO stacks are commonly prepared by thermal growth of a SiO2 layer (bottom oxide) on silicon, followed by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) of Si3N4. Subsequently, the top oxide is either grown by the nitride re-oxidation or deposited by LPCVD. The typical thickness of individual layers in the ONO stacks ranges from 5 nm to 15 nm. The critical structural and compositional parameters that affect electrical performance of ONO based devices include the physical density of the amorphous oxiddnitride layers and depth distributions of oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen atoms. In this study, we applied (i) spatially-resolved electron-energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in a transmission electron microscope and (ii) secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) to analyze elemental distributions in the differently processed ONO stacks deposited on Si. Additionally, densities of individual layers in the ONO stacks were measured using X-ray reflectometry (XRR). EELS spectrum-imaging in a dedicated scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) revealed radiation-induced nitrogen segregation to the Si/SiO2 interfaces; the extent of nitrogen segregation increased visibly with increasing the radiation dose. The EELS metrology was optimized to obtain artifact-free data. Artifactfree measurements revealed lack of detectable nitrogen segregation to the Si/SiO2 interfaces regardless of processing conditions used. SIMS analysis demonstrated that higher thermal budget used to process the top oxide layer yields lower hydrogen content at the Si/SiO2 interface and broader nitrogen distribution across the top SiO2/Si3N4 interface. No nitrogen segregation to the Si/SiO2 interfaces was observed consistent with the EELS measurements. XRR measurements revealed a clear dependence of the density of the top oxide layer on the processing conditions. EXAFSEXELFS measurements on the O-K edge were used to probe radial-distribution function in the individual oxide layers of differently processed stacks; however, no significant difference for the first WO coordination shells was observed. The results of combined chemical and structural analyses were correlated with electrical performance of ONO-based flash-memories.",,"Atoms; Budget control; Chemical analysis; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Distribution functions; Electron energy levels; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Electron scattering; Energy dissipation; Flash memory; Mass spectrometry; Nitrides; Nitrogen; Oxidation; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Segregation (metallography); Semiconductor devices; Silicon; Silicon oxides; Transmission electron microscopy; Electrical performance; Elemental distribution; Nitrogen distribution; Nonvolatile memory devices; Oxide-Nitride-Oxide stacks; Radial distribution functions; Scanning transmission electron microscopes; Secondary ion mass spectroscopies (SIMS); Crystal atomic structure",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945317129

Unfortunately, such architecture results in a significant waste of energy in nanoscale CMOS implementations due to high leakage and bitline discharge in the unaccessed subarrays. Recent research advocates bitline isolation to control precharging of individual subarrays using bitline precharge devices. In this paper, we carefully evaluate the energy and performance trade-offs of bitline isolation, and propose a technique to exploit nearly its full potential to eliminate discharge and reduce overall energy in level-one caches. Cycle-accurate and circuit simulation results of a wide-issue superscalar processor indicate that: 1) in future CMOS technologies (e.g., 70 nm and beyond), cache architectures that exploit bitline isolation can eliminate up to 90% of the bitline discharge; 2) on-demand precharging (i.e., decoding the address and subsequently precharging the accessed subarrays) is not viable in level-one caches because precharging increases the cache access latency; and 3) our proposal for gated precharging to exploit subarray reference locality and precharging only the recently accessed subarrays eliminates nearly all of bitline discharge in nanoscale CMOS caches with only a 1% of performance degradation. © 2003 IEEE.","Circuit simulation; CMOS process; CMOS technology; Computer architecture; Delay; Energy dissipation; Isolation technology; Out of order; Proposals; Random access memory","Circuit simulation; CMOS integrated circuits; Economic and social effects; Energy dissipation; Nanotechnology; Random access storage; CMOS processs; CMOS technology; Delay; Isolation technology; Out of order; Proposals; Random access memory; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944415863

A recent work proposed adaptive, non-uniform cache architecture (NUCA) to manage large, on-chip caches. By exploiting the variation in access time across widely-spaced subarrays, NUCA allows fast access to close subarrays while retaining slow access to far subarrays. While the idea of NUCA is attractive, NUCA does not employ design choices commonly used in large caches, such as sequential tag-data access for low power. Moreover, NUCA couples data placement with tag placement that is possible in a non-uniform access cache. Consequently, NUCA can place only a few blocks within a given cache set in the fastest subarrays, and must employ a high-bandwidth switched network to swap blocks within the cache for high performance. In this paper, we propose the non-uniform access with replacement and placement using distance associativity cache or NuRAPID, which leverages sequential tag-data access to decouple data placement from tag placement. Distance associativity, the placement of data at a certain distance (and latency), is separated from set associativity, the placement of tags within a set. This decoupling enables NuRAPID to place flexibly the vast majority of frequently-accessed data in the fastest subarrays, with fewer swaps than NUCA. Distance associativity fundamentally changes the trade-offs made by NUCA's best-performing design, resulting in higher performance and substantially lower cache energy. A one-ported, non-banked NuRAPID cache improves performance by 3% on average and up to 15% compared to a multi-banked NUCA with an infinite-bandwidth switched network, while reducing L2 cache energy by 77%. © 2003 IEEE.","Computer architecture; Delay; Energy efficiency; Power engineering and energy; Probes; Random access memory; Wire","Bandwidth; Buffer storage; Computer architecture; Economic and social effects; Microprocessor chips; Network architecture; Probes; Program processors; Random access storage; Switching circuits; Wire; Delay; Energy efficient; High bandwidth; Non-uniform access; Non-Uniform Cache Architecture; Non-uniform cache architectures; Power engineering and energies; Random access memory; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944411840

First, an additional passive resonant cavity connected into output line decreases the prepulse power and energy about 10...12 dB. The second way is processing signals in a radar receiver.

Our tasks were to research how the degree of raw-material defragmentation, energy density and the period of infra-red radiation influence specific energy use for drying the bio raw-material and the count of microorganisms. Also the total time of the drying process, moisture, content of vitamins, aminoacids, macro- and microelements in raw-materials and food products were controlled. The object of research were dill and vegetables. As a result of the research we discovered the modes of infra-red radiation ensuring harmless content of components and stability of dehydrated products. With the period of radiation 3,0-3,5 sec, the density of infra-red energy 12 kW/m2, and the length of dill 25-35 mm specific energy use was the lowest and amounted to 0,58 kWh/kg. Count of microorganisms was 102-105 colonies/g. With these parameters of drying the product preserve the nature quality of raw-material: 100% macro- and microelements, 85-90% aminoacids, 65-70% vitamin C, 90-95% vitamin A, E, 80-90% B group vitamins. © 2003, IEEE.

In this paper, a comparison of high frequency resonant converter topologies with four energy storage elements is presented. It first describes how all possible circuit topologies for such converters under voltage-source and voltage- or current-sink conditions were characterized. The analytical results and expressions obtained regarding the converter's main steady state characteristics (including input-output transfer function, DC gain, high-frequency-gain slope, input impedance, resonant frequencies, load invariant gains and load invariant frequencies) were then tabulated for easy reference. This tabulation provides valuable insight about which of these converters offer possible advantages (in terms of steady-state characteristics) over lower-order (two- and three-element) and other four-element resonant converters; those converters are identified for future indepth study. Furthermore, the table is also helpful for designers trying to identify suitable alternatives for satisfying the given converter requirements of particular applications. © 2003 IEEE.","Circuit topology; Energy storage; Frequency conversion; Impedance; Resonance; Resonant frequency; Steady-state; Transfer functions; Vehicles; Voltage","Electric impedance; Electric network topology; Electric potential; Energy storage; Natural frequencies; Optical frequency conversion; Resonance; State estimation; System theory; Topology; Transfer functions; Vehicles; Analytical results; High frequency gain; High frequency resonant converter; High power density; Input-output transfer functions; Resonant converters; Steady state; Steady state characteristics; Power converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944205721

We extend the ideas in [Narlikar, et al., 2003] to address the more challenging problem of general packet classification. We describe two extensions to the standard TCAM architecture. The first organizes the TCAM as a two level hierarchy in which an index block is used to enable/disable the querying of the main storage blocks. The second incorporates circuits for range comparisons directly within the TCAM memory array.

Applying a mix of static and dynamic decisions, this approach achieves the benefits of clustering at reasonable costs.

Wavelet methods involve overlapping transforms with varying-length basis functions. This overlapping nature of the transform alleviates blocking artifacts, while the multiresolution character of the wavelet decomposition leads to superior energy compaction and perceptual quality of the decompressed image. The embedded zerotree wavelet (EZW) coder is the first algorithm to show the full power of wavelet-based image compression. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact and quality of orthogonal wavelet filter for EZW. Meanwhile, we also look into the effect of the level of wavelet decomposition towards compression efficiency. The wavelet filters used are Haar and Daubechies (1992). The compression simulations are done on few modalities of medical images.

Until recent times, spent fuel storage pools criticality analysis were performed considering the fuel as fresh and with the maximum possible enrichment. These hypotheses have produced widely spaced or highly poisoned storages. Burnup credit permits more compact configurations. This work has followed the recommendations given by the NRC document: 'Guidance on the Regulatory Requirements for Criticality Analysis of Fuel Storage at Light-Water Reactor Power Plants'. The assumption of uniform axial burnup is considered a non-conservative hypothesis when the burnup and the initial enrichment of the fuel assemblies are high. Axial burnup distribution provides a well-defined approach to the criticality safety, considering the real effects of neutron leakage near the borders, and the fuel depletion and fission products buildup that occurs near the center of the fuel assembly. The proposed methodology consists of the criticality analysis of a hypothetical axial burnup profile (ABP) based on the specific axial profile databases. The Reactivity Equivalence Curve (REC) defines the decision criterion on admitting spent fuel assemblies in the spent fuel region of a Nuclear Power Plant.

Processing all of the commercial spent fuel existing in the U.S. would require a gargantuan effort, but processing some of the spent fuel is practical and could increase the effective storage capacity of Yucca Mountain. The purpose of this work is to determine potential scenarios for processing plant(s) needed to assure that the Yucca Mountain Repository technical capacity will be adequate at least until 2050 with increasing nuclear energy production. Processing reduces the geologic disposal requirements by separating the spent fuel into: 1) transuranics (TRU, i.e., plutonium plus minor actinides), 2) uranium, and 3) fission products. The transuranics are the primary long-term (> 250 years) heat source and the uranium is the major mass component of the spent nuclear fuel. These two products can be used to manufacture fast reactor fuel while the fission products, any process losses, and the non-processed fuel must be disposed in a geologic repository. If the TRU product is converted into fission products, which is assumed to be done in fast reactors in this study, and the TRU wastes are not placed in Yucca Mountain, the long-term heat sources are reduced. This reduction simplifies the heat management strategy and fission product storage. The equivalent metric tons of spent nuclear fuel, which legislatively sets the capacity of Yucca Mountain, can be increased five times as compared to unprocessed spent fuel. Fission product wastes also accrue from processing fast reactor spent fuel, at the same rate per GWY as thermal plants, and will also be stored in Yucca Mountain. A model to calculate the storage requirements for different power projections and processing plant sizes is described in this paper. As expected, results show storage saved is independent of the actual U.S. power in the future, but depends mainly on the processing plant size. The total storage required decreases strongly with processing rate. With any reasonable nuclear power projection, including one constant at the year 2000 level, the legislated capacity of Yucca Mountain will be reached by 2015. Early action taken to build a small plant (500 MTHM/yr) by 2014 would allow later larger plant(s) to be sized to fit the actual demand and still stay within the ""technical capacity"" of Yucca Mountain until at least mid-century. U.S. spent fuel plus the high level waste from a 500 MTHM/yr processing plant started in 2014, followed by an evolutionary 2000 MTHM/yr plant in 2025 with a nuclear growth of 2 percent per year starting in 2005 could be handled by Yucca Mountain until the year 2050. An alternative growth model staying static until 2010 and a 3% annual increase starting in 2011 could be handled by processing plants of 500 MTHM/yr in 2014, and a 1500 MTHM/y both in 2021 and 2028. In order to minimize the storage of transuranics, their consumption in fast reactors is important. The number of fast reactor plants is dependent on their design and their conversion ratio. For the 2% nuclear energy growth scenario, ninety plants would be required with a conversion ratio of 1., whereas only 47 plants with a conversion ratio of 0.5 are needed.",,"Fast reactors; Fission products; Fuels; Geological repositories; Landforms; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive wastes; Spent fuels; Uranium; Energy productions; Geologic repository; Spent fuel repositories; Spent nuclear fuels; Storage requirements; Technical capacity; Technical limitations; Yucca mountain repository; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933181846

The key function of IRWST of interest is to condense the steam released from the pressurizer through Pilot Operated Safety Relief Valves (POSRV) through ""sparger"" to the water in the tank under the accident condition. The integrity of the piping system and the IRWST in which the spargers are submerged is strongly dependent on the hydrodynamic loads induced by the POSRV and IRWST operation. In the present study, a regulatory approach to determine the local pool temperature limit specific to the APR-1400 is discussed. The approach is based on the similarity in function and structure between the IRWST and BWR (Boiling Water Reactors) suppression pool while considering the difference in quencher configuration. The criteria on the local temperature limit in BWR suppression pool, the related event analysis scope, and the analysis assumptions are reviewed for providing a background of the criteria for the APR-1400 IRWST. The detailed design of APR-1400 IRWST is reviewed and the related accident analyses are investigated. The applicability of the BWR criteria, accident analysis scope, and assumption in analysis are also investigated. As a result, it is found that maximum local temperature, 366.5 K (200°F), is an applicable limit during the all accident conditions of APR-1400 IRWST.

To corroborate the scaling methodology, various experimental tests were conducted. The thickness of the boundary layer that encloses the steam cavity was found to be equal to the maximum length of the steam cavity formed. Three key scaling parameters were identified and correlated with the maximum amplitude of pressure oscillation: flow restriction coefficient, area ratio of discharge hole to steam cavity, and density ratio of water to steam. Variations of the oscillation amplitude were small when steam-jetting directions were altered. The concept of a reduction factor was introduced for estimating the oscillation amplitude of the multi-hole sparger with test data from a single-hole sparger.",,"Condensation; Digital storage; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Oscillating flow; Steam; Test facilities; Experimental test; In-containment refueling water storage tank; Maximum amplitude; Oscillation amplitude; Pressure oscillation; Reduction factor; Scaling methodology; Scaling parameter; Steam condensers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933181709

KOPEC has developed the on-line Coil Current Monitoring System (CCMS) for the effective and preventive maintenance support of the Control Element Drive Mechanism Control System (CEDMCS). This paper introduces the design of hardware, man-machine interface (MMI), algorithm and software for the CCMS which consists of signal conditioning module, data acquisition computer, and monitoring and analysis computer including related application programs. All coil data are stored and retrieved, and the user can easily operate the system. This system provides various functions such as zoom, scroll, alarm, data logging, instruction and guide for troubleshooting, the generation of the database for abnormal waveform, print, and etc. The Control Element Drive Mechanism (CEDM) coil data is automatically analyzed by checking CEDM timing sequence, coil current amplitude and pattern mismatch of waveform. In addition, it shows various analytical results on MMI displays and informs the diagnosis of abnormal conditions. For more precise analysis, the acquired coil current waveform is manually compared with reference or specific waveform, and database file for automatic fault detection is generated if necessary. This paper also presents the review of test results of CEDM and CEDMCS integrity test performed at plant site using the CCMS. After a successful site acceptance test, many control components of CEDMCS such as opto-isolator card, hall sensor, ACTM (Automatic CEDM Timing Module) card and Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) have been calibrated or replaced after surveillance test using the developed system.

Nevertheless, attempts to create an international political consensus on the nuclear power's role in sustainable development failed. The question arises: What is behind these controversies? Why do technical views and public perception, that greatly influences the political debate, so diverge? The evaluation of the Global Nuclear Legacy that was performed within the IIASA ""Radiation Safety of the Biosphere"" (RAD) project definitely shows that the Global Nuclear Legacy has emerged as one of the most important environmental, social, and political problems today. The largest fraction of the radioactive waste is currently being stored at the sites where it was generated, in facilities that were not built for long-term storage. Recent terrorist attacks highlight the risk posed by radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel storage sites that may be targets or used for dirty bombs. Additional threats of environmental degradation are associated with decommissioning of aged nuclear facilities and with carrying out nuclear disarmament at the places where the lack of sufficient infrastructure made it extremely difficult. Thus, the actual and potential implications of the Global Nuclear Legacy will put a huge burden on the future generations and therefore contradict the definition of sustainability given in the Brundtland Report. It seems that the nuclear legacy of the 20th century will stigmatize attempts in the 21st century to utilize advanced techniques if they are characterized as ""nuclear"". We call this phenomenon ""the Stigma of the Global Nuclear Legacy"", meaning the inevitable association (conscious or unconscious) of the global nuclear legacy left by intensive development of the nuclear industry, civilian and military, during the second half of the 20th century with nuclear power in general. Is it possible to neutralize the stigma of the Global Nuclear Legacy, and thus enhance the likelihood of success of the nuclear energy option? The paper reviews some outcomes of the IIASA RAD project studies of the Global Nuclear Legacy and discusses the lessons learnt that could help hopefully to answer the above question. As a contribution to this need, the IIASA RAD-project formulated a concept of a five-step study aimed at a better understanding of how to neutralize the nuclear stigma and enhance the future of the nuclear option.",,"Fuel storage; Nuclear energy; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Energy development; Future generations; Long-term storage; Nuclear disarmaments; Nuclear facilities; Political debates; Political problems; Sustainable energy; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933177842

Processes such as wormhole formation, gravity segregation, channeling and fingering during oil production, formation damage and fluid invasion during drilling, and methane hydrate dissociation are also studied by CT imaging. Microfocal CT imaging, using high magnification provides pore network data needed for pore scale modeling and for the study of fluid-rock interactions which, together with the pore topology and geometry, control the flow and trapping of hydrocarbons.Equipment used for imaging porous rocks ranges from industrial CT scanners and modified medical scanners for large samples, to desktop micro-scanners and synchrotron sources for micron resolution of small samples. While traditional CT equipment was stationary, located in laboratories remote from drilling sites, recent development of a portable, cabinet sized, high-speed whole-core scanner, has permitted field measurements of rock properties and geological interpretation prior to any core degradation that can occur due to its preservation, transport, and storage (Freifeld, 2003). The continued trend towards higher resolution and less expensive system components is greatly enhancing the capability of specialized CT systems used in the oil and gas industry.X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been used extensively in the oil and gas industry for imaging, quantifying properties, and determining the distribution of fluids in porous rocks (Wellington, 1987). Samples imaged range in size from tens of centimeters to a few millimeters, with respective voxel sizes varying from hundreds of microns down to a few microns. Whole cores, retrieved during drilling operations, are scanned for geological characterization and for selection of locations where representative plugs will be taken for laboratory petrophysical measurements. Core plugs are scanned to evaluate heterogeneities, such as laminations, fractures, and vugs (large open voids), that influence fluid flow. During laboratory fluid flow tests performed on core plugs (core floods), CT scanning is used to measure the three-dimensional time-varying fluid saturations. Microplugs are scanned to image the pore structure and determine distributions of fluids within the pore space.Porosity and permeability are important rock properties that determine the economic value of a petroleum reservoir. Porosity is the fraction of the bulk volume of the material occupied by voids. It characterizes the volume available in porous rock to store fluids in. Permeability is a measure of the ease with which a fluid can be made to flow through the porous rock by an applied pressure gradient. Relative permeability characterizes the flow when multiple phases and fluids coexist within the same porous rock. Relative permeability is the ratio of permeability of a particular phase to the intrinsic rock permeability and it is a function of phase saturation.To determine the porosity of a core sample, CT scans are performed with the sample saturated successively by two fluids that exhibit strongly contrasting x-ray attenuations, such as air and brine. Knowing the attenuations of the two fluids, the difference between these two sets of images provides the porosity distribution. If two fluids occupy pore space in unknown proportions, CT can be used to determine the saturation of each fluid providing that the fluids have adequate attenuation contrasts. Otherwise, their contrast can be increased by contrast agents, such as iodine or bromine based compounds. Single energy scans are performed for two-fluid saturation measurements. If saturations of three phases (oil, brine and gas) need to be determined, scans are performed at two energies. Dual energy scanning is also used to measure the bulk density and the effective atomic number of the core material. To perform these measurements, the sample needs to be within a coreholder that keeps the ample both immobile, within the x-ray scanner, and provides a means to flow fluid through the core. © 2003 International Society for Industrial Process Tomography.",,"Air; Atoms; Bromine compounds; Core samples; Coremaking; Digital storage; Drilling equipment; Floods; Flow of fluids; Gas hydrates; Gas industry; Gases; Geology; Iodine compounds; Medical imaging; Methane; Oil shale; Oil well drilling; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Porosity; Reservoirs (water); Rock drilling; Rocks; Scanning; Tomography; Well drilling; Effective atomic number; Fluid-rock interaction; Geological interpretation; Methane hydrate dissociation; Petrophysical Measurements; Porosity distributions; Tomography applications; X-ray computed tomography; Computerized tomography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910110816

In this paper, we propose a compression scheme that effectively reduces the data volume while maintaining the real-time relighting capability. The proposed method is based on principal component analysis (PCA). A block-wise PCA is used to practically process the huge input data. The output of PCA is a set of eigenimages and the corresponding relighting coefficients. By dropping those low-energy eigenimages, the data size is drastically reduced. To further compress the data, eigenimages left are compressed using transform coding and quantization while the relighting coefficients are compressed using uniform quantization.

The chemical energy in the fuel is changed within the engine to provide the propulsion of the automobile. A small portion of the transformed energy is taken to operate the electrical equipment. In turn, the electrical apparatus may have to convert this energy into heat (demister), light (legal requirements), and sound (horn), or back to mechanical energy (starter motor). In addition, the electrical equipment may be called upon to supply energy when the automobile engine is at rest; so an energy storage system is necessary.

Temperature is one of the most frequently used process measurements. Almost all chemical processes and reactions are temperature-dependent. Not infrequently in chemical plants, temperature is the only indication of the progress of the process. Where the temperature is critical to the reaction, a considerable loss of the product may result from incorrect temperatures. In some cases, loss of control of temperature can result in catastrophic plant failure with the attendant damage and possible loss of life. Another area where accurate temperature measurement is essential is in the metallurgical industries. There are many other areas of industry where temperature measurement is essential. Such applications include steam raising and electricity generation, plastics manufacture and molding, milk and dairy products, and many other areas of the food industries. Furthermore, temperature is a measure of stored or potential energy in a mass of matter. It is the state of agitation, both lateral and rotational oscillation, of the molecules of the medium. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Metabolic myopathies ""sensu stricto"" are those with defined blocks of metabolic pathways caused by deficient or nonfunctional enzymes. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies are multisystemic disorders that usually include a metabolic myopathy. Muscle contraction depends on the provision of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Carbohydrates are the most important source of energy for brief, intense exercise in anaerobic conditions. The glycogenoses are hereditary disorders caused by enzyme deficiencies in glycogen metabolism or glycolysis. They have been assigned Roman numerals in the order of their discovery but are now also specified by the underlying enzyme defect. Muscle damage results from glycogen storage on the one hand and from energy failure on the other. The clinical manifestation of glycogen storage is fixed, progressive, mostly proximal muscle weakness. Many metabolic myopathies discussed in this chapter and several other conditions, especially exposure to therapeutic or recreational drugs, may lead to rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria. Even otherwise healthy individuals may have myoglobinuria when they subject themselves to unusually strenuous physical exertion for which they have not been adequately trained. Other causes of myoglobinuria include toxic, ischemic, mechanical, or thermal damage to muscle. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902223331

However, unlike in the two-stage approach, the dc voltage on the energy storage capacitor in a single-stage PFC circuit is not well regulated. As a result, in universal line application (90 - 265 Vac), the storage capacitor voltage varies with the load and line variation.

District cooling contributes to an overall improvement in the efficiency of energy use, as well as to minimize the use and corresponding leakage of ozone-depleting refrigerants. In an absorption district cooling system, combining a PCM storage for peak shaving provides economic advantages. In the present paper, a computer model has been developed to study phase equilibrium and design paraffin waxes cool storage. Based on the previously presented phase equilibrium diagram of the binary system of tetradecane and hexadecane, two polynomial equations of temperature and liquid/solid phase equilibrium composition, and one polynomial equation of the heat of fusion and liquid composition have been derived through curve-fit. The polynomial equations provide a convenient way to obtain the phase change temperature range and storage density, and both are very important thermal characteristics for PCMs storage design and application. One simple system layout for integrating a PCM storage with an absorption chiller, requiring no additional control for charging/discharging the storage is analysed. It is demonstrated that a design storage density corresponds to the paraffin waxes phase change temperature range.

Compared with conventional thermal energy storage, supercooled thermal energy storage (Super-TES) stores thermal energy at a lower temperature than the melting point of phase change material (PCM), so that Super-TES reduces heat loss from storage systems. The PCM used in this work is disodium hydrogenphosphate dodecahydrate. The melting point of the PCM is 35.5 °C. The volume of the storage tank is 14 L and the tank has 152 capsules of PCM. The tank is partitioned into two rooms by thermal insulation. The PCM capsule exists in both sides of the partition. After the storage period, the lower room is cooled for initiating crystallization. The result of the experiments shows that the storage unit can control the nucleation of the supercooled PCM. After two-month-period storage, about 60 % of the input energy remained and 10% of the energy was lost during the cooling operation for nucleation. Consequently, the energy efficiency was about 50%. © 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

This study looks at the specific weight density and specific volume density of potential fuel cell systems as an alternative to primary and secondary batteries that have traditionally been used for space missions. This preliminary study indicates that fuel cell systems have the potential for energy densities of >500 W-hr/kg, >500W/kg and >400 W-hr/liter, >200 W/liter. This level of performance makes fuel cells attractive as high-power density, high-energy density sources for space science probes, planetary rovers and other payloads.

To predict precisely the current spectrum an adequate mathematical model should be used. In this paper the authors presented an improved model of induction cage motor accounting for saturation of the magnetic circuit due to the main MMF harmonic in presence of eccentricity. The crucial point of this improvement is to determine nonlinear inductances of motor windings under such conditions. In this paper it is done by introducing an equivalent magnetizing current, which determines a state of machine magnetic circuit. It allows to predict qualitatively (by physical considerations) the co-energy function and finally, to create machine equations by Lagrange formalism. In order to find data for a such model, magnetic field distribution has to be round from field model of a machine. In this paper the authors created a model for a real induction motor being tested in the field by authors. Field distribution in magnetic circuit of this machine is found by FEM and basing on it the co-energy is calculated as a function of the equivalent magnetic current and parameters determining eccentricity.

The energy storage type STATCOM (E5TATCOM) is an advanced flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) device, which controls both reactive and active power injection/absorption to the power system. It also provides a better power swing damping. Using a linearized block diagram proposed by the authors, the present study examines the design of the ESTATCOM damping controller. Several case studies have been performed to evaluate the power swing damping effect of the ESTATCOM on one-machine infinite bus system. The results of the study show that an ESTATCOM, which controls both reactive and active power injection/absorption to power system, has a more significant effect on power swing damping than that controlling the reactive power alone. © 2003 IEEE.","Energy storage; Flexible ac transmission system (FACTS); Linearized model; Power system stability; Static synchronous compensator (STATCOM)","Controllers; Damping; Electric current regulators; Electric energy storage; Electric power system control; Electric power system stability; Energy storage; Linearization; Static synchronous compensators; Block diagrams; Damping controllers; Damping effect; Flexible ac transmission system (FACTS); Linearized models; One machine infinite bus system; Power system stability; Static synchronous compensator STATCOM; Flexible AC transmission systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861501953

The approach that is presented here uses the method of time scale decomposition of the solar irradiance and derived quantities in order to determine the power content of fluctuations depending on their characteristic persistence. Pseudo random time series of solar irradiance, based on measured values of instantaneous clearness index are applied as input data. Power flow calculations are carried out in order to assess the impact of fluctuating solar irradiance on the grid voltage.

The technique is finding widespread application in a variety of radiation dosimetry fields, including personal monitoring, environmental monitoring, retrospective dosimetry (including geological dating and accident dosimetry), space dosimetry, and many more. In this book we have attempted to synthesize the major advances in the field, covering both fundamental understanding and the many applications. The latter serve to demonstrate the success and popularity of OSL as a dosimetry method. The book is designed for researchers and radiation dosimetry practitioners alike. It delves into the detailed theory of the process from the point of view of stimulated relaxation phenomena, describing the energy storage and release processes phenomenologically and developing detailed mathematical descriptions to enable a quantitative understanding of the observed phenomena. The various stimulation modes (continuous wave, pulsed, or linear modulation) are introduced and compared. The properties of the most important synthetic OSL materials beginning with the dominant carbon-doped Al2O3, and moving through discussions of other, less-well studied but nevertheless important, or potentially important, materials. The OSL properties of the two most important natural OSL dosimetry material types, namely quartz and feldspars are discussed in depth. The applications chapters deal with the use of OSL in personal, environmental, medical and UV dosimetry, geological dating and retrospective dosimetry (accident dosimetry and dating). Finally the developments in instrumentation that have occurred over the past decade or more are described. The book will find use in those laboratories within academia, national institutes and the private sector where research and applications in radiation dosimetry using luminescence are being conducted. Potential readers include personnel involved in radiation protection practice and research, hospitals, nuclear power stations, radiation clean-up and remediation, food irradiation and materials processing, security monitoring, geological and archaeological dating, luminescence studies of minerals, etc. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Many algorithms for data compression (i.e., profile-driven, adaptive, differential) have previously been introduced. In all cases, data compression and decompression are performed on-the-fly on the cache-to-memory path: Uncompressed cache fines are compressed before they are written back to main memory, and decompressed when cache refills occur. This paper completes and extends these previous contributions by providing evidence on the feasibility of the proposed compression architectures by specifically addressing hardware implementation issues. CDU design is targeted towards energy minimization in the cache-bus-memory subsystem with a strict constraint on performance. As a result, average memory energy reductions evaluated on several benchmark programs are around 24%, at no performance penalty. © 2003 IEEE.","CADCAM; Clocks; Computer aided manufacturing; Counting circuits; Data compression; Energy consumption; Hardware; Logic; Random access memory; Read-write memory","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Cache memory; Clocks; Computer aided manufacturing; Computer hardware; Counting circuits; Energy utilization; Hardware; Memory architecture; Random access storage; CADCAM; Data compression algorithms; Energy minimization; Hardware implementations; Logic; Performance penalties; Processor based systems; Random access memory; Data compression",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78751507421

New sense amplifier techniques need to explicitly address this challenge. This paper describes two sensing techniques to overcome this problem: a current sense amplifier (CSA) and a charge transfer sense amplifier (CTSA) and their implementation based on 90 nm CMOS technology. The current sense amplifier senses the cell current directly and shows a speed improvement of 17-20% for 128 memory cells as compared to the conventional voltage mode sense amplifier, for the same energy. The other is a charge transfer sense amplifier that takes advantage of large bit-line capacitance for its operation. The CTSA shows an improvement of 18-22% for read delay for 128 memory cells and consumes 15-18% less energy than the voltage mode sense amplifier. The CTSA results in reduced bit-line swing, which in turn leads to 30% lower bit-line energy than the conventional voltage mode. © 2003 IEEE.","Capacitance; Charge transfer; CMOS technology; Delay; Differential amplifiers; Integrated circuit interconnections; Microprocessors; Operational amplifiers; Random access memory; Voltage","Capacitance; Charge transfer; CMOS integrated circuits; Differential amplifiers; Electric potential; Integrated circuit interconnects; Microprocessor chips; Operational amplifiers; Programmable logic controllers; Random access storage; Semiconductor storage; Static random access storage; Bitline capacitance; CMOS technology; Current sense amplifiers; Delay; Integrated circuit interconnections; Random access memory; Sensing techniques; Speed improvement; Amplifiers (electronic)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954087785

This paper investigates the potential benefits and costs of implementing this architecture using an asynchronous methodology. Since clock distribution and gating are relatively easy in the synchronous PipeRench, we focus on the benefit due to decreased timing pessimism in an asynchronous implementation. Two architectures for fully asynchronous implementation are considered. PE-based asynchronous implementation yields approximately 80% improvement in performance per stripe. This implementation, however, requires significant increases in configuration storage and wire count.

Previously, we reported the electron emission current was proportional to the incident infrared light energy and the 30% of the pyroelectric current was emitted to the vacuum. It is considered that increment of emission efficiency is important to increase its sensitivity. To increase emission efficiency, anode voltage dependence was studied. It is found that the emission current increased as the anode voltage increased. To applied electric field whole PZT surface, the surface of the PZT was polished flat. The emission efficiency increased two times from the unpolished one. On a pulsed infrared light irradiation, the electron emission phenomena from the PZT thin plate were confirmed. The emission current increased rapidly and decreased. Amplification of the emission electrons were tried to use MCP device. The emission electrons can be multiplied 40 times.

Solder joint shape prediction method has been incorporated as a design tool to enhance the reliability of the wafer level packaging. Wafer level chip-scale-packaging (WLCSP) is expected to be widely used in static-dynamic random access' memory (SDRAM) for its higher electrical performance and lower manufacturing costs. However, reliability of solder joints for large chip size such as 6mm X 6mm without underfill assembly is still in question. In conventional WLCSP, the dimension of each solder ball and each solder pad is the same. The maximum thermally induced stress/strain would occur on the die-side surface of the solder joint that are located farthest away the chip center. In this research, a hybrid method combined analytical algorithm and energy-based method is applied to predict standoff heights and geometry profiles of solder balls. A hybrid-pad-shape (HPS) system is also proposed to design solder ball layout and to enhance the reliability of solder joints. The HPS system contains two kinds of solder volume and pad diameters as well as their relative location during reflow process. Next, a commercial finite element code ANSYS is applied to simulate the stress/strain behavior of the solder balls in WLCSP under temperature cycling conditions. In addition, a nonlinear and parametric finite element analysis is conducted to, investigate the reliability issues that result from several design parameters including solder joint layout, solder volume, pad diameter, die/substrate thickness, and thickness, material properties of stress buffer layer (SBL). The results reveal that as the WLCSP contains larger solder balls located at corner area underneath the chip, the maximum equivalent plastic strain of the solder joints would be evidently reduced and the solder joint reliability under thermal loading would be highly enhanced On the other hand, thinner die and thicker SBL are also good for the reliability of the WLCSP. Furthermore, the findings presented in this research can be used as a design guideline for area array interconnections such as CSP, flip chip packaging, Super CSP and fine pitch BGA. © 2003 IEEE.","Capacitive sensors; Chip scale packaging; Finite element methods; Flip chip; Manufacturing processes; Mesh generation; Process design; Soldering; Thermal stresses; Wafer scale integration","Capacitive sensors; Chip scale packages; Design; Dynamic random access storage; Electric connectors; Finite element method; Flip chip devices; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuit layout; Intermetallics; Manufacture; Mesh generation; Process design; Random access storage; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Soldered joints; Soldering; Static random access storage; Thermal stress; WSI circuits; Chip-scale packaging; Commercial finite element codes; Equivalent plastic strain; Flip chip; Manufacturing process; Mechanical and electrical; Parametric finite elements; Wafer-level chip-scale packaging; Electronics packaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450053326

Conventional solid-state switched tap changer was modified to minimize the total cost and the harmonic contents in the injected voltage. Proposed DVR was designed to compensate the typical power disturbance such as the voltage sag up to 50% level. It is composed of a parallel transformer, a series transformer, gate turned-off AC switches and bypass switches. Since the proposed DVR does not need any kind of energy storage devices such as capacitor or battery, we can minimize maintenance problems and maximize reliability compared to the conventional DVR, which is composed of voltage sourced inverter and energy storage capacitor. In the proposed DVR, the bypass switch shorts the secondary winding of the series transformer during the normal condition. On the other hand, AC switches are controlled to compensate the voltage sag during the voltage disturbance. Parallel transformer provides only two tap voltage levels to minimize the number of switching devices. The basic operation of the proposed DVR was explained, and new output voltage control algorithm was discussed. The proposed DVR was verified through the computer simulation. © 2003 CIGRE.","Batteries; Capacitors; Costs; Energy storage; Maintenance; Regulators; Solid state circuits; Switches; Voltage control; Voltage fluctuations","Algorithms; Capacitors; Costs; Current limiting reactors; Electric current regulators; Electric energy storage; Electric power system security; Electric power transmission; Electric windings; Energy storage; Maintenance; Power quality; Solar cells; Switches; Voltage control; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Dynamic voltage regulators; Energy storage capacitor; Maintenance Problem; Parallel transformers; Solid-state circuits; Voltage disturbances; Voltage fluctuations; Voltage sourced inverters; Voltage regulators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349246392

Monitoring the transformers for problems before they occur can prevent faults that are costly to fix and result in a loss of service. Current systems can provide information about the state of a transformer, but are very expensive to implement. This paper outlines a new approach that is based on using light absorbance to monitor the transformer oil. Oil is continually sampled from the transformer, and light is passed through the oil and tested for absorbance. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that a system based on certain wavelengths could determine the difference between an acceptable or unacceptable sample of oil. Samples of a failed transformer showed a general increase in absorbance during the experiment. Additional wavelengths can be identified, which provides more information about the state of the transformer and makes the system more versatile in determining fault types. Basic principles of operation experimental data and a prototype of this monitoring system are presented. © 2003 IEEE.","Absorption; Chemicals; Condition monitoring; Costs; Oil insulation; Optical sensors; Petroleum; Power engineering and energy; Testing; Transformers","Absorption; Chemicals; Condition monitoring; Cost engineering; Costs; Crude oil; Digital storage; Electric drives; Electric machinery; Electric transformer testing; Electric transformers; Monitoring; Optical sensors; Power electronics; Testing; Basic principles; Fault types; Monitoring system; New approaches; Oil insulations; Power engineering and energies; Transformer monitoring; Transmission and distribution systems; Oil filled transformers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649435316

Understanding the regulation of energy balance and nutrient partitioning can potentially facilitate the treatment of obesity. Although the factors that lead to an imbalance between energy/fat intake and energy expenditure, and thus the development of obesity, remain incompletely understood, nutrient partitioning may be especially relevant to the development of obesity as it relates to the hypothesis of Flatt (1). The latter suggests that total food intake increases to meet carbohydrate needs. According to this theory, food intake is regulated, at least in part, to assure an adequate amount of carbohydrate. Consumption of a high-fat diet would require the intake of excess fat in order to satisfy carbohydrate needs and therefore lead to obesity under this scenario. The concept of a diet “relatively” deficient in carbohydrate becomes important in that dysregulation of substrate partitioning could potentially affect the body's sense of what constitutes adequate carbohydrate intake. For example, if fat were preferentially shunted toward storage, more carbohydrate would be required to meet oxidative needs, thereby preventing suffcient repletion of glycogen stores. This process is proposed to generate signals that stimulate appetite. Other examples where nutrient partitioning relates to obesity and body fat content include the stimulation of lean tissue synthesis at the expense of fat calories by androgens and growth hormone, and (presumably) the reverse of this process by deficiencies of these hormones. © 2003 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149517515

For dry laser cleaning, two cleaning models were established for removal of particles from substrate surfaces from the viewpoint of energy and force. For steam laser cleaning, a cleaning model was established for removal of particles from substrate surfaces with a thin liquid layer by taking Van der Waals force, capillary force, cleaning force, and chemical bonding into account.

Wind power is getting attention for prospective renewal energy sources, and introduction of wind farm generation will solve environmental matters and energy exhaust problem. However, the quality of power system frequency will be degraded as the capacity of wind power generator increases. Attenuation of mismatch between the served power and load demand is most important problem in order to increase number of wind generators. Here, a large rotary frequency converter is proposed as a buffer to connect the wind farm and the power system. This provides energy storage function of the output power associated with irregular wind power. The converter has a synchronous generator and a doubly-fed machine. The synchronous motor is connected to the wind farm to supply AC voltage for induction generators of wind power generation units. The shaft of the doubly-fed machine is mechanically jointed to the synchronous motor, and rotates together. Tuning the current of the secondary winding supplied by cycloconverter or self-commutated inverter controls the output power. At present, doubly-fed machine is commonly used in pumped storage hydraulic power plants recently constructed. The proposed scheme is an expansion from the present application. For the evaluation of the proposed scheme, two simulation tests are carried out. One is load reference setting test for discussion of the power exchange response to a power grid. Other is load frequency control test in order to discuss required capacity for the rotary frequency converter to improve the frequency quality. © 2003 IEEE.","Frequency control; Power generation; Wind power generation","AC-AC power converters; Asynchronous generators; Electric frequency control; Electric power generation; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Frequency converters; Hydroelectric generators; Power control; Power generation; Quality control; Synchronous motors; Wind power; Doublyfed machines; Dynamic characteristics; Hydraulic power plant; Load-frequency control; Power system frequencies; Secondary windings; Wind farm generations; Wind generator systems; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44449151979

The multistage scheduling problem is thus decomposed into many smaller scale one-stage subproblems with evolved cost-to-go functions. For each evolutionary individual, linear programming is used in the forward pass process to solve the dispatch subproblems and the total system operational cost over the scheduling period is assigned to its fitness.

But, they also increase the on-chip energy spent. With the increase in transistor density and decrease in feature sizes, the dominant component of the energy spent is the leakage energy. Since, on-chip caches consume a major portion of the chip's transistor budget, they are good candidates for the control of leakage energy. In the cache hierarchy, most of the time, the data present at the first level also exists in the lower levels, and hence expends the leakage energy in all the levels that it is present. This paper proposes a mechanism to reduce this leakage energy by exposing the redundancy. In this mechnism, sub-blocks of the L1-data cache are turned off, when the data also exists in the register file. Also, a control mechanism is proposed to turn-off the blocks of L2-cache (in both instruction cache and data cache portions) when the data also exists in L1-cache. An architectural technique is also proposed, to effectively turn-off the portions of the L1 and L2-caches, which are never used for data storage by keeping the cache circuitry initially in low-leakage mode. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes has been demonstrated through cycle accurate simulation using a set of media and SPEC CPU 2000 benchamrks. This mechanism yields an average of about 33% to 36% reduction in the leakage energy for 16 KB to 32 KB dll-cache and an average of 79% and 86% for 128 KB of dL2 and iL2 caches respectively, albeit with a little performance degradation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",,"Budget control; Cache memory; Digital storage; Redundancy; Cache hierarchies; Control mechanism; Cycle-accurate simulation; Instruction caches; Leakage energies; Performance degradation; Processor performance; Transistor density; Data reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35248824138

Two distributed energy sources that are at the center of interest in this context are wind energy converters and fuel cells. While renewable energy based and environmentally benign, a major problem of wind energy conversion with regard to large-scale network integration is the direct dependence of the power generation capability on the given wind speed. Similar problems of controllability exist for other renewable energy sources with intermittent output. This conflicts with the need to schedule power output in a deterministic manner. A concept to overcome the stochastic nature of the source is proposed. The overall solution consists of a plant where the stochastic source is coupled over a DC bus with diverse storage modules and a versatile grid interface. As storage solutions hydrogen and in addition a second form of storage for quasiinstantaneous power delivery is considered. The intermittent source is so transformed into an emission-free deterministic generation plant with controlled power output to the grid. © 2003 CIGRE.","Energy resources; Fuel cells; Hydrogen storage; Large scale integration; Power generation; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic processes; Wind energy; Wind energy generation; Wind power generation","Electric power generation; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Energy resources; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hydrogen storage; LSI circuits; Power generation; Power quality; Random processes; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Wind; Wind effects; Wind power; Distributed Energy Resources; Distributed energy sources; Environmentally benign; Large-scale network; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Wind energy converters; Wind energy generation; Electric power system security",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646479236

While its predecessors focused on the storage and transmission of audiovisual sequences, MPEG-4, being the first object-based coding standard, has much more to offer. Motion estimation (ME), the most computationally intensive part of MPEG, requires very high power throughput on account of its high memory utilization. To cope with the bandwidth and processing power requirements, the best approach entails a dedicated implementation for such a demanding algorithm. The first step of the design involves hardware/software partitioning to map most of the motion estimation functions in hardware. In order for the system to meet area and power dissipation constraints, fewer time critical functions, like intra-frame coding, discrete cosine transform, quantization, variable length coding and zigzag scanning, are handled as part of the software portion of the program. We have increased the precision significantly by doubling the accuracy of motion compensation from integer-pel to half-pel. Sum of absolute differences (SAD) is chosen as the criterion for evaluating the best match of motion vectors. The block matching is achieved with the novel robust search algorithm called predictive diamond search (PDS). © 2003 IEEE.","Bandwidth; Computer architecture; Hardware; Motion estimation; MPEG 4 Standard; Partitioning algorithms; Power dissipation; Throughput; Time factors; Very large scale integration","Algorithms; Bandwidth; Codes (symbols); Computer architecture; Computer hardware; Discrete cosine transforms; Electric losses; Energy dissipation; Hardware; Image coding; Image matching; Memory architecture; Motion analysis; Motion compensation; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Throughput; Video signal processing; VLSI circuits; Hardware/software partitioning; MPEG-4 standard; Partitioning algorithms; Predictive diamond search; Robust search algorithms; Sum of absolute differences; Time factors; Variable length coding; Motion estimation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646248499

The Floriade is held once every ten years - the event in 2002 will be the fifth. The Dutch glasshouse industry and research will participate in the Floriade 2002 showing how the researchers expect a modern glasshouse to be in the year 2010: ""The Glasshouse of the Future"". The main target of this modern glasshouse is to comply with the Dutch Integral environmental terms of reference (IMT-2010). This means an enormous effort to reduce the consumption of energy, fertilisation and chemical crop protection towards 2010. This presentation shows how growers may reach these terms of reference with new glasshouse constructions and covers, new crop production systems, alternative energy supply systems and dehumidification. Further, researchers expect Total Quality Management, energy management and rural integration of glasshouse production to be important issues in 2010, but these aspects of the research project are beyond the scope of this presentation. Antireflection coatings on hardened glass combined with larger spans and windows transmit 9% more light, which means almost 9% more production for most crops in the Netherlands. Improved synthetic covers can reduce the need of heating to 30%. On the other hand, we expect an increased supply of heat, due to long term energy storage in aquifers and the use of heat pumps and fuel cells. Dehumidification combined with long term energy storage can make it possible to recover heat and water. Further, growing with closed ventilators reduces the amount of new insects and makes it easier to enrich the inside air with CO2. Looking at crop production systems, temperature integration and an equal temperature distribution will lead to the greatest energy savings. We expect new distribution techniques, biological crop protection and the use of pesticides from natural sources to reduce the consumption of chemical crop protection. Researchers expect it to become difficult to reduce the consumption of nutrients. This is because for the expected higher production more nutrients are needed. On the other hand, now that almost all glasshouses recycle their drain water the emission of nutrients can be further decreased with FD sensors in soil cultures and with using models connected to the climate control in substrate cultures. Robotisation is still quite rare in horticulture. Moving the plants to the robot instead of the other way around may increase the possibilities of it. The use of artificial lighting for more and controlled photosynthesis is increasing. This also will increase the consumption of energy, nutrients and chemical crop protection per m2. The consumption per unit of production however, may stay the same or even decrease. In conclusion, we can say that it will be possible to have an enormous reduction of the consumption of energy, nutrients and chemical crop protection per unit of production in 2010. How much the consumption per m2 will decrease depends on how much artificial lighting the horticulture will use then.","Exhibit; Floriade; Greenhouse; Netherlands",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645354838

The development of such an infrastructure is a challenge due to the resource-constrained nature of the mobile devices, in terms of the computational power, storage capacities, wireless connectivity and battery energy. With spatial data and location-aware applications widely recognized as being significant beneficiaries of mobile computing, this paper examines an important topic with respect to spatial query processing from the resource-constrained perspective. Specifically, when faced with the task of answering different location-based queries on spatial data from a mobile device, this paper investigates the benefits of partitioning the work between the resource-constrained mobile device (client) and a resource-rich server, that are connected by a wireless network, for energy and performance savings. This study considers two different scenarios, one where all the spatial data and associated index can fit in client memory and the other where client memory is insufficient. For each of these scenarios, several work partitioning schemes are identified. It is found that work partitioning is a good choice from both energy and performance perspectives in several situations, and these perspectives can have differential effects on the relative benefits of work-partitioning techniques. © 2003 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Computational power; Differential effect; Information access; Location-aware application; Partitioning techniques; Spatial query processing; Storage capacity; Wireless connectivities; Data handling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645230709

Alcohol suppresses the oxidation of fat, favoring fat storage, and can serve as a precursor for fat synthesis. Moderate alcohol consumers usually add alcohol to their daily energy intake rather than substituting it for food, thus increasing energy balance. On the basis of this it would seem surprising if alcohol did not contribute directly to body weight. However, the relationship between alcohol consumption and body weight “remains an enigma to nutritionists and in many instances paradoxical.” The epidemiological evidence is inconsistent, with numerous studies suggesting absent or positive associations in men and strong inverse relationships in women. A comprehensive review of representative studies of the relationship between alcohol intake and body weight found remarkable inconsistency between studies which is explained to some degree by confounding factors. Another recent review concludes that “there is no consensus on the relationship between moderate alcohol intake and body weight,” and the issue of whether or not alcohol calories “count” has been the topic of recent editorials. Most epidemiological studies of this issue have been cross-sectional in nature. There have been relatively few prospective studies of the relation between alcohol and weight gain. The aim of this chapter is to review the epidemiological evidence in population studies for alcohol as a risk factor for overweight and obesity with particular focus on prospective studies. © 2004 by CRC Press LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31544481807

This is due to the inherent difficulties in optimizing rotary and flapping wing designs. The three classes of designs will emerge with varying capabilities, and for a time, the fixed wing systems will have the greatest endurance for a given mass. But then ornithopters or flapping wing aircraft may become the dominant configuration as wingspans shrink and requirements evolve, with spans of less than 1 cm, and masses less than 1 gram. This is where biological flyers can show us how to best operate in those extremely low Reynolds numbers regimes. AeroVironment has developed some of the early pioneering MAVs, which were very useful in developing tools for understanding and optimizing these diminutive flyers. The Microbat MAV is a 23 cm span, electric, remotely piloted, flapping wing ornithopter capable of flying for over 22 minutes. The Black Widow MAV is a 15 cm span, electric, remotely piloted flying wing with a color video payload that can operate at a 2 km range with an endurance of 30 minutes.1 Through careful analysis of propulsion systems, energy storage systems, and aerodynamic design, optimization tools can be developed and utilized to design MAVs with surprisingly high performance. This paper examines the current state of the art of several MAV subsystem technologies, provides a near-term outlook for the future, and suggests areas that could benefit from further research. © 2003 by Matthew T.

The dots have been deposited onto an ultra-thin tunnel oxide by chemical vapour deposition, and then annealed at 1000 °C for 40 s, to crystallize all the dots. After deposition the dots have been covered by a CVD SiO2 layer, thus resulting in dots completely embedded in stoichiometric silicon oxide. The nanocrystal density and size have been studied by energy filtered TEM (EFTEM) analysis. An electrostatic force microscope has been used to locally inject the charge. By applying a relatively large tip voltage a few dots have been charged, and the shift in the tip phase has been monitored.

A solution to the uniaxial loading boundary condition was developed fully and compared to a linear model published by Madden and an electrochemical model published by Mazzoldi et al.

We propose a memory architecture called IPStash to act as a TCAM replacement, offering at the same time, better functionality, higher performance, and significant power savings. The premise of our work is that full associativity is not necessary for IP-lookup. Rather, we show that the required associativity is simply a function of the routing table size. We propose a memory architecture similar to set-associative caches but enhanced with mechanisms to facilitate IP-lookup and in particular longest prefix match. To perform longest prefix match efficiently in a set-associative array, we restrict routing table prefixes to a small number of lengths using a controlled prefix expansion technique. Since this inflates the routing tables, we use skewed associativity to increase the effective capacity of our devices. Compared to previous proposals, IPStash does not require any complicated routing table transformations but more importantly, it makes incremental updates to the routing tables effortless. The proposed architecture is also easily expandable. Our simulations show that IPStash is both fast and power efficient compared to TCAMs. Specifically, IPStash devices - built in the same technology as TCAMS - can run at speeds in excess of 600 MHz, offer more than twice the search throughput (>200Msps), and consume up to 35% less power (for the same throughput) than the best commercially available TCAMs when testes with real routing tables and IP traffic. © 2003 IEEE.","Costing; Energy consumption; Energy management; Error correction codes; Memory architecture; Memory management; Microarchitecture; Random access memory; Routing; Sorting","Cache memory; Computer architecture; Energy management; Energy utilization; Error correction; Logic gates; Memory architecture; Program processors; Random access storage; Routers; Sorting; Telecommunication networks; Costing; Error correction codes; Memory management; Micro architectures; Random access memory; Routing; Ternary content adressable memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27944489986

In a fully closed cycle, the waste for disposal consists, only of fission products with trace amounts of actinides. Eliminating the transuranics reduces the heat load in the repository, increasing its capacity by about a factor of five. This permits the expanded use of LWRs to produce pollution-free electricity and reduce dependence on foreign oil. Cycling back to LWRs amounts to an expensive storage option that puts off for maybe a decade or two the need to deal effectively with the transuranics. That delay is bought at the cost of implementing and operating the thermal-recycle infrastructure, with extra expense later on because the resulting spent fuel would significantly complicate fast-reactor processing. Before DOE undertakes development of technologies for thermal recycle, the viability of forgoing it altogether should be carefully assessed - it might turn out to be an impediment rather than a necessity. Since there is no need in the long term for such an infrastructure, the energy and dollars needed to implement it might be better spent on wrapping up the development fast reactors and their fuel cycle. It is not too early to embark seriously on a program to deploy pyroprocessing and fast reactors, for ultimate closure of the fuel cycle and optimal long-term utilization of the Yucca Mountain repository.",,"Actinides; Economics; Fast reactors; Fission products; Plutonium; Pressurized water reactors; Pyroelectricity; Thermal effects; Toxic materials; Uranium; Waste management; Nuclear fuel cycles; Pollution-free electricity; Thermal-reactor fuels; Thermal-recycle infrastructure; Spent fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642537726

The generation of point defects was then followed by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR). All these electron irradiations generated defects of the same nature (oxygen centers and Ti 3+ ions) but in different proportions varying with electron energy and fluence. The annealing of irradiated samples lead to the disappearance of the latter defects but gave rise to two other types of defects (aggregates of light elements and titanyl ions). It is necessary to heat at relatively high temperature (T=800°C) to recover an EPR spectrum similar to that of the pristine material. The stability of hollandite phase under radioactive cesium irradiation during the waste storage is discussed.",,"Cesium compounds; Crystal structure; Electron irradiation; Heating; High resolution electron microscopy; Paramagnetic resonance; Radioactive wastes; Sintering; Thermodynamic stability; Atomic displacements; Electron energy; Irradiation-induced defects; Paramagnetic defects; Radiation effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442443076

It is found that the vibrational frequencies corresponding to these eigen values depend strongly on the size of the nano particles and the peaks in the Raman spectra shift to the higher frequencies side as size of the nano particles decreases. We have also investigated the effect of a polymer matrix on the frequencies and Raman shift of MgO nanoparticles. The damping constant is found to vary linearly with the size of nano particles which shows that the mechanical damping is the prominent mechanism in the damping of the acoustic phonon modes.",,"Boundary conditions; Damping; Data storage equipment; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Energy transfer; Magnesia; Natural frequencies; Optoelectronic devices; Parameter estimation; Phonons; Polymers; Raman scattering; Semiconductor quantum dots; Vectors; Damping constant; Nanoparticles; Raman shift; Switching devices; Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442430376

Obesity induced by hypothalamic lesions clearly demonstrated the major impact of the central nervous system and the neuroendocrine system in regulating ingestive behavior and energy expenditure. The identifications of the leptin/leptin receptor and the melanocortin systems by molecular genetics and positional cloning methodologies provided clear molecular and cellular substrates for the interactions between peripheral tissues (adipocytes in the case of leptin, and pancreatic beta cells in the case of insulin) and the brain. Other elements of the neuroendocrine system such as growth hormone, cortisol, thyroid hormone, and sex steroids/gonadotropins influence the disposition of ingested calories toward expenditure or storage in various tissues as specific molecules (“partitioning”).

In contrast to traditional communication networks, the single major resource constraint in sensor networks is power, due to the limited battery life of sensor devices. It has been shown that data-centric methodologies can be used to solve this problem efficiently. In data-centric storage, a recently proposed data dissemination framework, all event data is stored by type at designated nodes in the network and can later be retrieved by distributed mobile access points in the network. In this paper we propose Resilient Data-Centric Storage (R-DCS) as a method to achieve scalability and resilience by replicating data at strategic locations in the sensor network. Through analytical results and simulations, we show that this scheme leads to significant energy savings in reasonably large-sized networks and scales well with increasing node-density and query rate. We also show that R-DCS realizes graceful performance degradation in the presence of clustered as well as isolated node failures, hence making the sensornet data robust. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",,"Digital storage; Energy conservation; Information management; Sensor nodes; Wireless ad hoc networks; Analytical results; Data centric storage; Data dissemination; Distributed events; Graceful performance degradations; Resource Constraint; Strategic locations; Wireless ad hoc sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21144446980

The technique predicts the inverter power require to correct a DC voltage error within one fundamental AC cycle. This is based on the power balance between DC input and AC output, and the energy stored in the DC link capacitor. The fast response means a smaller capacitor can be used, and operation with a large double-line-frequency ripple on the DC bus is possible without causing distortion of the AC output current. This scheme is suitable for applications where substantial DC link buffer energy is unnecessary, e.g.: grid-connected photovoltaic generators. The reliability and lifetime of the inverter can be significantly improved if a non-electrolytic type capacitor is used. Experimental results are presented that verify the inverter operation. © 2003 IEEE.","Active filters; Capacitance; Capacitors; Energy storage; Error correction; Filtering; Photovoltaic systems; Pulse width modulation inverters; Solar power generation; Voltage control","Active filters; Capacitors; Electric inverters; Energy storage; Error correction; Filtration; Industrial electronics; Modulation; Photovoltaic cells; Pulse width modulation; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Voltage control; Dc link capacitor; DC voltage control; DC-link capacitance; Double line-frequency ripples; Grid-connected photovoltaic; Inverter operations; Photovoltaic systems; Pulse width modulation inverters; Capacitance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20544478074

We examine these issues in the context of a mechanism that tries to enhance data cache reliability by replicating cache lines (blocks) in active use. When replicating data cache lines, it is important to not evict other lines that may be needed or to not incur very high power consumption. We evaluate the tradeoffs between these three goals (reliability, energy, and performance) by modulating two important parameters, namely, the hot-block threshold and the dead-block threshold. We show that having a hot-block threshold in the range of 10-1000 cycles can provide good reliability characteristics, without compromising on performance or power. At the same time, our results indicate that one could use aggressive dead-block thresholds to provide leakage power savings without compromising on the performance and reliability characteristics.

The main characteristic of such networks is that geographic location of nodes determines network topology. As opposed to encoding individual node locations, at each node our approach groups the remaining nodes in the network into regions. All shortest paths to nodes in a specific region are routed via the same neighboring node. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for dividing a network field into distinct regions to minimize routing table size while guaranteeing shortest path routes. We show that this problem is NP-hard, propose a heuristic to find efficient solutions, and empirically demonstrate the resulting system performance from the perspective of compression ratio and scalability. In our experiments, routing tables compressed using this technique, require 88.9% to 97.9% less storage than uncompressed tables. In order to achieve energy efficient routing, we propose an augmentation to the original routing mechanism that enables load balancing flexibility along with guaranteed shortest path routing at the expense of larger routing tables. Preliminary experiments estimate 10% lifetime extension of network nodes with a tradeoff of an increase in the size of routing tables. Finally, we propose a compression technique that aims at representing trajectories in a sensing network in a compact manner. This approach relies on trajectory prediction using three weighted Markov models, a local, regional and global one, all of them with context-length equal to one. Finally, we discuss a range of possible applications that rely on the developed prediction and routing models.

The main challenge in SPM design is mapping memory locations to scratchpad locations. This paper describes an algorithm to optimally solve such a mapping problem by means of Dynamic Programming applied to a synthesizable hardware architecture. The algorithm works by mapping segments of external memory to physically partitioned banks of an on-chip SPM; this architecture provides significant energy savings. The algorithm does not require any user-set bound on the number of partitions and takes into account partitioning overhead. Improving on previous solutions, execution time is polynomial in the input size. Strategies to optimize memory requirements and speed of the algorithm are exploited.

A scratch-pad is a fast compiler-managed SRAM memory that replaces the hardware-managed cache. It is motivated by its better real-time guarantees vs cache and by its significantly lower overheads in energy consumption, area and overall runtime, even with a simple allocation scheme [4]. Existing scratch-pad allocation methods are of two types. First, software-caching schemes emulate the workings of a hardware cache in software. Instructions are inserted before each load/store to check the software-maintained cache tags. Such methods in-cur large overheads in runtime, code size, energy consumption and SRAM space for tags and deliver poor real-time guarantees just like hardware caches. A second category of algorithms partitions variables at compile-time into the two banks. For example, our previous work in [3] derives a provably optimal static allocation for global and stack variables and achieves a speedup over all earlier methods. However, a drawback of such static allocation schemes is that they do not account for dynamic program behavior. It is easy to see why a data allocation that never changes at runtime cannot achieve the full locality benefits of a cache. In this paper we present a dynamic allocation method for global and stack data that for the first time, (i) accounts for changing program requirements at runtime (ii) has no software-caching tags (iii) requires no run-time checks (iv) has extremely low overheads, and (v) yields 100% predictable memory access times. In this method data that is about to be accessed frequently is copied into the SRAM using compiler-inserted code at fixed and infrequent points in the program. Earlier data is evicted if necessary. When compared to a provably optimal static allocation our results show runtime reductions ranging from 11% to 38%, averaging 31.2%, using no additional hardware support. With hardware support for pseudo-DMA and full DMA, which is already provided in some commercial systems, the runtime reductions increase to 33.4% and 34.2% respectively.

The energy regenerative suspension has nonlinear characteristics with dead zone for low speed motion. Hence the energy is not re-generated nor has it damping force. In order to overcome this problem, a step-up chopper is introduced between the actuator and the charging circuit. This chopper is controlled by velocity-dependent PWM signal to improve the damping characteristics and the efficiency of the regenerative suspension. The suspension system changes its height according to the carrier load. Hence linear AC motor is used to the isolation actuator. A simple experiment was performed and the results showed better performance than the standard regenerative suspension. The system is planned to be modified incorporating active control.

Phase Change Materials, (PCMs); have received great consideration in electronic industry for cooling of electronics and in telecommunication equipment to control internal temperature under emergency operating conditions. High melting temperature materials have been proposed as thermal energy storage mediums in space applications because of their high melting temperatures and latent heat. In the present work, a numerical simulation is developed to predict the thermal performance of a phase change material of high melting point in a cylindrical enclosure. In this simulation the phases are assumed to be homogeneous and a source term, S, arises from melting and solidification processes is considered as a function of the latent heat of fusion and the liquid phase fraction. By introducing the thermo-physical properties of one of those materials, the thermal performance of it as a phase change material is predicted.","Cylindrical; High melting temperature; Phase change materials; Thermal performance","Cavitation; Computer simulation; Diffusion; Mathematical models; Melting; Numerical methods; Phase transitions; Shrinkage; Solidification; Cylindrical; High melting temperature; Phase change materials; Thermal performance; Heat convection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842779848

To investigate the complexities involved in the design of a flywheel mechanical battery system, a test rig has been constructed at the Virginia Tech Rotor Dynamics Laboratory. This test rig consists of a fifty-pound steel flywheel that is mounted on a vertical shaft system and driven by a brushless permanent magnet motor. Initially, it was thought that the rotor could be supported with a single bearing, positioned at the upper mount point of the rotor. This pendulum-type configuration was found to have a major instability at low frequency. This paper will discuss these initial results and the further analysis and testing of a two bearing vertical shaft design.

With the recent advances in wireless and MEMS technology, sensors can be placed almost anywhere necessary. Since these devices are wireless it becomes necessary that they have their own power supply. This power supply in most cases is the conventional battery, however problems can occur when using batteries because of their finite life span. When the battery is extinguished of all its power, the sensor must be retrieved and the battery changed. Because wireless sensors are developed so that they can be placed in remote locations such as structural sensors on a bridge or GPS tracking devices on animals in the wild, obtaining the sensor simply to replace the battery can become a very expensive task. Therefore, if a method of obtaining the untapped energy surrounding these sensors was implemented, significant life could be added to the power supply. One method is to use piezoelectric materials to obtain energy lost due to vibrations of the test specimen. This captured energy could then be used to prolong the life of the power supply or in the ideal case provide endless energy for the sensors lifespan. The goal of this study is to develop a model of the piezoelectric power harvesting device. This model would simplify the design procedure necessary for determining the appropriate size and vibration levels necessary for sufficient energy to be produced and supplied to the electronic devices. An experimental verification of the model is also performed to ensure its accuracy.","Piezoelectric; Power harvesting; Wireless sensors","Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy dissipation; Global positioning system; Microelectromechanical devices; Microsensors; Vibrations (mechanical); Wireless telecommunication systems; Power harvesting; Wireless sensors; Piezoelectric materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842611685

While the economics of using solar energy exclusively for all these needs is not currently feasible, it is worth exploring the engineering feasibility so as to provide a roadmap for future use as fossil fuel reserves continue to dwindle. A prototype 500 sq-ft Habitat Operated Utilizing Solar Energy (HOUSE©) was designed and constructed to provide all the amenities associated with comfortable living, including all necessary living spaces such as a living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and dining room. The house was powered by 36 roof-mounted photovoltaic modules in tandem with two 8' × 4' flat-plate collectors. Electric energy was stored in a 48V battery bank while thermal energy was stored in an 80-gal tank. The HOUSE was field-tested for a week in early October in an attempt to obtain performance data. The performance period included a variety of weather conditions from sunny and clear, to rainy and overcast. The paper provides information on insolation and use of energy during that period.

The physics based mathematical model consists of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy equations for the liquid subjected to variable boundary conditions at the liquid-vapor interface and constant heat flux boundary condition at the walls of the container. The density of the liquid is assumed to be temperature dependent only in the buoyancy term of the momentum equation (Boussinesq approximation). The vapor in the ullage is assumed to be an ideal gas with uniform thermodynamic properties and is modeled by single node conservation equations for mass and energy. The two domains are coupled through a set of interface equations for mass and energy exchange between the liquid and the vapor.

The equations for the vapor are solved by a simple explicit finite difference technique.

The goal of the ALPS project is to demonstrate the feasibility of an advanced locomotive propulsion system with the following features: Operation up to 150 mph on existing infrastructure Acceleration comparable to electric locomotives Elimination of $3-5M per mile electrification costs Fuel efficient operation with low noise and exhaust emissions The propulsion system consists of two major elements: a gas turbine prime mover driving a high speed generator and an energy storage flywheel with its associated motor/generator and power conversion equipment. The 2.5 MW high speed generator is a three phase, eight pole synchronous machine designed to directly couple to a 15,000 rpm gas turbine. Power from the turbine/alternator system feeds the locomotive dc bus through a conventional full bridge rectifier. The energy storage flywheel features a graphite/epoxy composite rotor operating on active magnetic bearings and is designed to store 480 MJ at 15,000 rpm. An induction motor/generator and variable frequency motor drive provide the link to the dc bus and are used to control power flow into and out of the flywheel. In addition to design and fabrication of the propulsion system components, the project is also developing a distributed control system with power management algorithms to optimize the hybrid propulsion system. Fabrication of the major components of the propulsion system is nearing completion and some preliminary testing of the flywheel and high speed generator has been completed. After completion of the laboratory testing, the propulsion system will be integrated onto a locomotive platform for rolling demonstrations at the Transportation Technology Center test track in Pueblo, Colorado.

The result is of interest in circuits theory, but also has applications in control problems as it suggests the paradigm of power shaping stabilization as an alternative to the well-known method of energy shaping. We show in the paper that, in contrast with energy shaping designs, power shaping is not restricted to systems without pervasive dissipation and naturally allows to add ""derivative"" actions in the control. These important features, that stymie the applicability of energy shaping control, make power shaping very practically appealing, as illustrated with examples in the paper. To establish our results we exploit the geometric property that voltages and currents in RLC circuits live in orthogonal spaces, i.e., Tellegen's theorem, and heavily rely on the seminal paper of Brayton and Moser in 1964.",,"Capacitors; Closed loop control systems; Damping; Electric network topology; Hamiltonians; Matrix algebra; Partial differential equations; Passivation; Power inductors; Problem solving; Resistors; Theorem proving; Vectors; Electromagnetic coupling; Scalar functions; Vector function; Nonlinear networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542378352

As mismatches occur much more frequently than matches in many situations, such circuits are extremely energy-inefficient. In recognition of this inefficiency, a series of dissipate-on-match comparator designs have been proposed to address the power considerations. These designs, however, are limited to at most 8 bit long arguments. In this paper, we examine the designs of energy-efficient comparators capable of comparing arguments as long as 32 bits in size. Such long comparands are routinely used in the load-store queues, caches, BTBs and TLBs. We use the actual layout data and the realistic bit patterns of the comparands (obtained from the simulated execution of SPEC 2000 benchmarks) to show the energy impact from the use of the new comparators. In general, a non-trivial combination of traditional and dissipate-on-match 8 bit comparator blocks represents the most energy-efficient and fastest solution. As an example of this general approach, we show how fast and energy-efficient comparators can be designed for comparing addresses within the load-store queue of a superscalar processor. © 2003 ACM.","Buffer storage; Cams; Computer science; Digital integrated circuits; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Integrated circuit layout; Logic; Microprocessors; Permission","Associative storage; Buffer storage; Cams; Comparators (optical); Computer science; Design; Digital integrated circuits; Digital storage; Energy dissipation; Integrated circuit layout; Integrated circuits; Logic circuits; Low power electronics; Microprocessor chips; Power electronics; Energy efficient; Energy impact; Load store queues; Logic; Permission; Power efficient; Superscalar micro-processors; Superscalar Processor; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542359120

Low oxide thickness gives rise to considerable direct tunneling current (gate leakage). Power dissipation in large caches is dominated by the gate and sub-threshold leakage current. This paper proposes a novel cache that has high noise immunity with improved leakage power. For every bank of SRAM cells, this technique requires an extra diode in parallel with a gated-ground transistor connected between the source of NMOS transistors and ground in SRAM cells. The row decoder itself can be used to control the extra gated-ground transistor.

Scheduling operations on multivoltage functional units lowers the energy-delay product by exploiting slack in the schedule.

Fuel cells are continuously under development to incorporate latest technology and focus on specific details of fuel cell systems relevant to harsh space transportation environments. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is developing proton exchange membrane fuel cell systems for space power applications because of the potential for longer life, reduction in cost, and increase in safety compared to current alkaline fuel cell technology. Space fuel cell applications utilize oxygen instead of air, which introduces better performance but greater hazards. Circulation of reactants is beneficial for these systems to aid in removal of product water from the fuel cell stack and to humidify reactant fluid streams. Current space fuel cell prototype systems use a simple but effective pump for reactant recirculation known as a gas ejector. A gas ejector uses a high-pressure primary gas supply to produce suction to a secondary fluid at a lower pressure. A gas and water separator is then necessary to remove the fuel cell product water from the unutilized recirculated oxygen. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is analyzing and testing several different means to separate the oxygen gas and water in both microgravity and increased gravity conditions.

Electrolytic and electroless nickel/gold (Ni/Au) deposition process are used commonly to provide flat, solderable pad surface finish on area array (BGA or CSP) packages and printed wiring boards (PWB). The electroless nickel/immersion gold (ENIG) process is widely used which do not requires plating lines for electrolytic plating, better meets the fine pitch wiring requirements. However, ENIG deposition process may cause or contribute to catastrophic, brittle, interfacial solder joint fractures. ENIG plating has previously shown lower reliability at solder joints. This is because Phosphorous segregation at the interface Sn-Ni intermetallic and Ni layer caused poor adhesion at that interface, especially high phosphorous content (10-15%) of the electroless Ni. There have been many studies verified that Ni3P formation is a major factor, which causes weaker joint strength and flat fracture surface. Owing to sodium hypophosphite (NaH 2PO2) was used to provide electron and return Ni ion to deposit on Cu pad for ENIG plating, it is not dodge that phosphorous element exist at the Ni layer. Hence, ph value, temperature and loading factor (plating area/ plating tank volume) in the plating path are controlled to reduce phosphorous content (less than 10%) to avoid Ni3P formation. Furthermore, ENIG has a potential risk of black pad, because Porous Au plating layer caused the oxidation of Ni layer underneath the Au plating to occur solder joint failure and low shear forces after assembly. In order to overcome foregoing problem, a flip chip ball grid array (FCBGA) test vehicle is used to compare three kinds surface finish electroless Ni/Au, direct gold and solder on Cu pad in this study. 63Sn/37Pb solder bump is reflowed onto these substrates. High temperature storage test (HTS) is used to evaluate thickness and structure of IMC to affect solder joint attachment reliability. Ball shear test is used to measurement joint strength at various HTS time. Optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to observe failure modes after ball shear.","Electroless nickel/immersion gold (ENIG); High temperature storage test (HTS); Intermetallic compound (IMC)","Diffusion; Electroless plating; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Integrated circuits; Interfaces (materials); Intermetallics; Oxidation; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermal cycling; Automobile electronic equipment; Chip scale packages; Electric wiring; Failure analysis; Finishing; Fracture; Gold deposits; Intermetallics; Optical microscopy; Phosphorus; Plating; Printed circuit boards; Scanning electron microscopy; Soldering; Soldering alloys; Substrates; Testing; Tin; Electroless nickel/immersion gold (ENIG); High temperature storage (HTS) tests; Ball shear; Ball-shear test; Deposition process; Electroless; Electroless Ni; Electroless nickel/immersion golds; Electrolytic plating; Electronic systems; Fine pitch; Flip chip ball grid array; Fracture surfaces; High temperature storage test; Interconnection density; Intermetallic compounds; Joint strength; Loading factors; Major factors; pH value; Plating layer; Plating tank; Poor adhesion; Potential risks; Printed wiring boards; SEM; Shear force; Sodium hypophosphite; Solder Bump; Solder joints; Surface finishes; Test vehicle; Wiring requirements; Electronics packaging; Gold",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242331837

Eng., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332, United States","Data center facilities, which house thousands of servers, storage devices and computing hardware, arranged in 2 meter high racks are providing many thermal challenges. Each rack can dissipate 10 - 15 kW, and with facilities as large as tens of thousands of square feet, the net power dissipated is typically on the order of several MW. The cost to power these facilities alone can be millions of dollars a year, with the cost to provide adequate cooling not far behind. Significant savings can be realized for the end user by improved design methodology of these high power density data centers. The fundamental need for improved characterization is motivated by inadequacies of simple energy balances to identify local 'hot spots' and ultimately provide a reliable modeling framework by which the data centers of the future can be designed. Recent attempts in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of data centers have been based around a simple rack model, either as a uniform heat generator or specified temperature rise across the rack. This desensitizes the solution to variations of heat load and corresponding flow rate needed to cool the servers throughout the rack. Heat generated at the smaller scales (the chip level) produces changes in the larger length scales of the data center. Accurate simulations of these facilities should attempt to resolve the range of length scales present. In this paper, a multi-scale model where each rack is subdivided into a series of sub-models to better mimic the behavior of individual servers inside the data center is proposed. A Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes CFD model of a 110 m2 (1,200 ft2) representative data center with the raised floor cooling scheme was constructed around this multi-scale rack model. Each of the 28 racks dissipated 4.23 kW, giving the data center a power density of 1076 W/m2 (100 W/ft 2) based on total floor space. Parametric studies of varying heat loads within the rack and throughout the data center were performed to better characterize the interactions of the sub-rack scale heat generation and the data center. Major results include 1) the presence of a nonlinear thermal response in the upper portion of each rack due to recirculation effects and 2) significant changes in the surrounding racks (up to 10% increase in maximum temperature) observed in response to changes in rack flow rate (50% decrease).","Data center; Multi-scale; Thermal characterization","Air conditioning; Algorithms; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Energy dissipation; Mathematical models; Navier Stokes equations; Porous materials; Servers; District heating; Electronics packaging; Floors; Thermal load; Computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units; High power density; CFD models; Chip-level; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Computing hardware; Data centers; Design Methodology; End users; Floor cooling; Floor space; Heat generators; Heat loads; High power density; Hot spot; Length scale; Maximum temperature; Modeling frameworks; Multi-scale Modeling; Multiscale models; Multiscales; Parametric study; Power densities; Recirculations; Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes; Storage devices; Submodels; Temperature rise; Thermal characterization; Thermal response; Electronics packaging; Satellite communication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242309513

In fact, the data center is a computer. The walls of the data center are akin to the walls of the chassis in today's computer system. The new slim rack mounted systems and blade servers enable reduction in the footprint of today's data center by 66%. While maximizing computing per unit area, this compaction leads to extremely high power density and high cost associated with removal of the dissipated heat. Today's approach of cooling the entire data center to a constant temperature sampled at a single location, irrespective of the distributed utilization, is too energy inefficient. We propose a smart cooling system that provides localized cooling when and where needed and works in conjunction with a compute workload allocator to distribute compute workloads in the most energy efficient state. This paper shows a vision and construction of this intelligent data center that uses a combination of modeling, metrology and control to provision the air conditioning resources and workload distribution. A variable cooling system comprising variable capacity computer room air conditioning units, variable air moving devices, adjustable vents, etc. are used to dynamically allocate air conditioning resources where and when needed. A distributed metrology layer is used to sense environment variables like temperature and pressure, and power. The data center energy manager redistributes the compute workloads based on the most energy efficient availability of cooling resources and vice versa. The distributed control layer is no longer associated with any single localized temperature measurement but based on parameters calculated from an aggregation of sensors. The compute resources not in use are put on ""standby"" thereby providing added savings.","Computer room air conditioning; Cooling; Data center; High power data center; Power; Smart cooling","Air conditioning; Algorithms; Boundary conditions; Computer control; Decision making; Energy management; Feedback control; Flow interactions; Optimization; Servers; Temperature distribution; Thermal load; Cooling; Cooling systems; Distributed parameter control systems; Electronics packaging; Temperature measurement; Thermoelectric equipment; Computer room air conditioning (CRAC); Thermal fluids; Computer room air conditioning; Data center; High-power; Power; Smart cooling; Cooling systems; Satellite communication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242287075

Two silicate spin-on-glasses (SOG), potassium silicate KASIL 2130 and sodium silicate N/N CLEAR , both of them from PQ Inc., are used. Previous experiments have revealed the formation of clusters and voids in the cured glass layer, that diminishes the bonding quality. A quantitatively analysis of the bonding process in terms of work of adhesion and interfacial tensions enabled us to identify the hot points of the bonding process: the wettability of the surfaces to be bounded, the appropriate concentration of the soluble glass, the adhesion of the spin-on-glass on these surfaces in both liquid and solid state, the spun-on-glass curing process. To overcome these hot points appropriate technological steps are added to the bonding process : O2 plasma and hot HNO3 exposure of glass/silicon respectively silicon nitride surfaces, one minute delay of spinning after sog-deposition on the substrate, increasing up to 125°C the annealing temperature of the spun-on-glass. Smooth, uniform, reproducible glass layers, are obtained and the dependency of their thickness (ranging from 100 Å to 5000 Å) versus silicate concentration of the soluble glass is determined. In order to explain the clusters and voids formation, successively observations of the cured layer after the annealing treatment and after room temperature storage are performed, and show that room temperature storage of non-completely cured silicate layers leads to the formation of clusters. The effect of the concentration of the soluble silicates is qualitatively analysed, by means of optical microscopy, showing that silicate solutions having 2 -3 % of wt. are suitable for bonding applications with best results when the obtained glass layer is thin enough.","Glass clusters; Interracial tension; Potassium silicate; Sodium silicate; Surface energy","Adhesion; Adhesives; Annealing; Bonding; Interfacial energy; Micromachining; Nitric acid; Optical microscopy; Potassium compounds; Silicon; Silicon nitride; Sodium compounds; Surface tension; Glass clusters; Potassium silicate; Sodium silicate; Spin-on-glass (SOG); Glass",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242286416

Fossil fuels such as oil, natural gases and coal, as well as bio-fuels can all be chemically converted to hydrogen. The basic chemistry of the various steps in the conversion is well known. However, each type of fuel cell has different fuelling requirements and therefore the design of fuel processors depends not only on the availability and form of fuel but also the application. For stationary power plants natural gas is an ideal fuel. It is best converted to hydrogen as close to the fuel cell as possible. In the case of the MCFC and SOFC this ensures high efficiency by using heat that would otherwise be lost from the stack. Recent advances in micro-channel catalytic reactor design may also lead to higher efficiencies and more compact stationary and portable systems. For transportation applications, hydrogen appears to be the preferred fuel in the long term. In the near term, methanol is a good fuel to use in vehicles, since it can be converted relatively easily on-board to hydrogen. Hydrogen can be generated by electrolysing water, and in combination with a fuel cell, this offers a means of storing energy from intermittent renewable power sources. In the future, hydrogen may be generated by direct solar electrophotolysis, or by biological methods. As such technologies advance, the transportation and storage of hydrogen stands out as perhaps the major barrier to the realisation of commercial fuel cell systems.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Coal; Crude petroleum; Hydrogen fuels; Natural gas; Protons; Renewable energy resources; Fuel processors; Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC); Solid oxide fuel cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242264990

E.P., Garching, Germany","A data acquisition system has been developed for the prototype of the Medium Energy Gamma-ray Astronomy (MEGA) telescope. It reads out two different types of detectors: The first type, called tracker, is a stack of Silicon strip detectors. The second is a calorimeter consisting of CsI(Tl) bars coupled to Silicon PIN-photodiode arrays. Analyzable photon interactions in the detectors cause either coincident events in both detector types or hits in multiple subsequent strip detectors. Once such a pattern is detected, all channels of both detector types are read out. This leads to data from 11328 channels, which is reduced to the channels containing interactions and written to the computer hard disk. The whole system is designed around the front-end chip TA1, which is used for both types of detectors. It is a charge sensitive device including discriminators for trigger generation. The triggers from all chips are evaluated by our coincidence electronics, a self-made VME-bus card. Nearly all logic of this card is implemented in a programmable logic device. An additional RAM forms a lookup table for trigger patterns that should start the readout of the whole detector. Commercially available VME modules perform the analog to digital conversion and generate the readout sequence. A single-board computer takes care of the instrument control, the data reduction and storage, collects housekeeping data etc. Its software is written in C++, so that a high modularity and several abstraction layers can be achieved easily. The system showed stable operation over several weeks during laboratory measurements as well as during beam tests.","Compton-scatter; Data acquisition; Pair-creation; Self-triggering; Trigger processing","Astronomy; Calorimeters; Data acquisition; Elementary particles; Gamma rays; Photodiodes; Scattering; Compton scatter; Pair creation; Self-triggering; Trigger processing; Telescopes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11944268901

We go further in our approach by proposing to perform the mass event selection by the usage of a visual language that expresses the physics analysis queries in a declarative way. Through our solution we can express complex decay queries easily with no programming efforts, abstracting the storage and optimization details, and reducing the need to deal with the normal framework intricacies.

Various digital implementation of filters and baseline restorers have been combined with numerical least mean square fit to the data to extract the time of interaction and the energy deposited in BGO-APD detectors. Using the same detector and pro-amplifier, a time resolution of 7.2 ns was obtained with digital techniques, as compare to 12.7 ns with the conventional analog method. By reducing the BGO-BGO coincidence time window by more than -40 %, an equivalent reduction of the rate of random events can be obtained, which would improve image SNR significantly at high counting rate in a BGO-APD PET scanner.

In 2002 we installed tracking loops to measure each ring's horizontal and vertical tunes. (The tune, a critical parameter for beam stability and for luminosity, is the fractional part of the number of oscillations of the beam about the central orbit in one revolution.) Each tracker uses a lock-in amplifier to measure the phase difference between a sinusoidal excitation of the beam and its response. If the drive frequency is swept across the tune resonance, this phase drops by 180 degrees. The tracker continually adjusts the frequency to maintain the phase at the middle of this transition. This drive frequency, normalized to the revolution frequency, gives the fractional tune. Recently these four loops (electron and positron, x and y) have been extended to controlling the tunes, by adjusting combinations of quadrupole magnets. However, at the same time we have increased the luminosity by setting the tunes just above the half-integer resonance, where a misadjustment can quickly lose the beam, and beam-beam forces from collisions make the tune spectra broad and complex. Consequently, we added a few non-colliding bunches to the fill pattern of each ring. Fast gates let us excite and measure only these bunches, and let us stop feedback damping of transverse motion for them.",,"Amplifiers (electronic); Damping; Electrons; Natural frequencies; Oscillations; Parameter estimation; Positrons; Scattering; Spectrum analysis; Fractional tune; Luminosity; Storage-ring colliders; Tracking loops; Colliding beam accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11844260055

While these advances bring unprecedented performance to electronic products, they pose difficult power/energy consumption problems. For example, large number of transistors in dense on-chip cache memories consume significant static (leakage) power even if the cache is not used by the current computation. While previous compiler research studied code and data restructuring for improving data cache performance, to our knowledge, there is no compiler-based study that targets data cache leakage power consumption. In this paper, we present code restructuring techniques for array-based and pointer-intensive applications for reducing data cache energy consumption. The idea is to let the compiler to analyze the code and insert instructions that turn off cache lines that keep variables not used by the current computation. This turning off does not destroy contents of a cache line, and waking up the cache line incurs very little overhead. Due to data locality, we find that at a given time only a small portion of the data cache needs to be active; the remaining part can be placed into a leakage-saving mode (state); i.e., they can be turned off. Our preliminary results indicate that the proposed strategy reduces the cache energy consumption significantly. We also show that several compiler optimizations increase the effectiveness of our strategy.","Compiler analysis; Data caches; Energy optimization","Algorithms; Cache memory; Computer architecture; Data storage equipment; Data structures; Energy utilization; Microprocessor chips; Transistors; Code restructuring; Compiler analysis; Data caches; Energy optimization; Program compilers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1142293068

This is because these parameters grow superlinearly as read and write ports are added to support wide-issue. This paper presents techniques to reduce the number of ports of a register file intended for a wide-issue microprocessor without noticeably impacting its IPC. Our results show that it is possible to replace the 16 read/8 write port file of an eight-issue processor with an 8 read/8 write port file so that the impact on IPC is insignificant. This is accomplished with the addition of some small auxiliary memory structures. Furthermore, the access time of the smaller file plus the auxiliary structures is such that if it were the critical path a 45-50% increase in clock speed would be possible. Finally, there is an energy per access savings of about 20% and an area savings of 40%, which has the potential for further savings by shortening global interconnect in the layout. An extension to the scheme that reduces the number of write ports from 8 to 6 is also presented. It suffers modest penalty in terms of IPC, but shows further reduction in energy and area. Depending on implementation characteristics it could yield a further increase in performance.","Instruction Level Parallelism; Low Power; Out-of-order Processor; Register File; Write Queue","Buffer storage; Computer hardware; Computer simulation; Computer systems; Data storage equipment; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Mechanical clocks; Pipeline processing systems; Problem solving; Instruction level parallelism; Low power; Out-of-order Processors; Register files; Writte queue; Microprocessor chips",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1142280977

Relevant experience in the petroleum industry comes from natural gas storage and enhanced recovery using carbon dioxide, but this experience is over a time scale less than the hundreds or thousands of years required for carbon dioxide storage. On these long time scales different mechanisms need to be considered. In the long-term the dominant mechanism for dissolution of carbon dioxide in formation water is convective mixing rather than pure diffusion. This arises because the density of formation water increases upon dissolution of carbon dioxide, creating a density instability. Linear stability analysis has been used to estimate the time required for this instability to occur in anisotropic systems. For sufficiently thick formations with moderate vertical permeability, this time is years to decades. Further approximate analysis shows that the time needed for the injected gas to dissolve completely is typically much longer, of the order of hundreds to thousands of years, depending on the vertical permeability.

DOE and other federal agencies must move quickly to ease short-term supply constraints. If storage will increase from 1 tcf to between 3 and 3.5 tcf by the start of the new contract in November, injections must rise above the usual weekly average of 60 bcf. Progress on exploiting Alaska's North Slope, with proved reserves of 35 tcf in a state said to hold 237 tcf, is bogged down in a contentious political debate. Both the National Energy Board and the Canadian Energy Research Institute have warned the US against taking for granted further growth in Canadian supplies, especially if EIA is accurate in its forecast that the US is counting on gas imports from Canada to increase to 5.5 tcf/yr in 2020 from 3.7 tcf/yr.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10044298404

While the first commercial isoengine is envisaged to have a power output of 7 MW, a 3 MW prototype engine is currently being tested.

Successful power quality implementations range from low-power telecommunications equipment (low-kW for hours) to high-power industrial support (hundreds of kW for seconds). Using this proven technology, Beacon Power has begun development of a modular, high-energy system to deliver robust and responsive megawatt output levels - for seconds, minutes and even hours. This flywheel energy matrix would be ideal for grid stabilization, spinning reserves, renewable power, and distributed resource applications. For example, a system such as this would have sufficient energy to provide the minutes needed for ride-through capability to start smaller gas turbine-powered generators. This paper describes the technical feasibility of combining the best features of flywheel energy storage with standard high-power electronics for energy storage and delivery. Two system-level configuration options are discussed: 1) Fixed installations, comprising a matrix of flywheels installed in a building with the Power Conversion System (PCS); and, 2) Deployable, portable equipment, based on a system-modular approach comprising an array of flywheels and PCS packaged in a standard shipping container to be easily dispatched for grid stabilization or load support. The technical discussion includes a building block-level component description of the flywheel and its motor/generator drive, electrical ratings, mechanical ratings and more. At a system level, an overview of component interconnection is provided, including links to the PCS. In addition, footprint and weight values are illustrated for both proposed system configuration options. This paper also includes a more detailed examination of ways in which this innovative energy storage solution can be economically used in electric supply systems. The flywheel's deep discharge and resilient, high-power cyclic capability, combined with a long design life, make it an ideal solution for voltage and frequency stabilization as well as an attractive, passive alternative for spinning reserves.

X-rays are scattered by electrons, hence, if diffraction data of sufficient quality are obtained, it is possible to map the entire electron density distribution. This may be used in a variety of ways. In the simplest application, partial charges may be assigned to atoms. By comparison with a promolecule composed of neutral spherical atoms, the deformation of the electron density on bond and molecule formation may be obtained. From the analysis of the topology of the total electron density, chemical bond orders may be cleanly characterized, and partial charges defined according to the Bader Atoms in Molecules approach. Calculation of the Laplacian of the electron density provides an additional parameter to characterize chemical bonding interactions. From the location of the nuclei (assumed to be at the center of the core electron density) and the electron density distribution, the electrostatic potential may be mapped for a molecule. From the electron density distribution and the Laplacian, the kinetic and potential energy density distribution may be obtained, thus giving a measure of energy storage in the molecules themselves (especially when compared with a promolecule), and the interaction energies between neighbors. The methodologies used to obtain these parameters are presented along with examples taken from recent studies on energetic molecules.",,"atomic particle; chemical bond; chemical interaction; chemical structure; density; electron diffraction; energy; geometry; kinetics; radiation scattering; review; X ray crystallography",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344983811

In that sense, alloys with e/a&lt;7.60 are known to exhibit soft mode condensation into a premartensitic phase prior to the MT itself, manifested as a weakly first order transformation, while alloys with e/a&gt;7.70 do not undergo any premartensitic transformation but they show instead a first order intermartensitic transformation during cooling. Alloys with intermediate e/a do not show such defined behaviours, but they are highly sensitive to the external applied fields. In the present work, three single crystalline Ni-Mn-Ga alloys with e/a between 7.60 and 7.70 are studied. The obtained results indicate that, even though the transformation temperatures are quite similar and the martensitic structures are in all cases modulated crystal lattices of 5 or 7 layer period, the transformation behaviour is different for each alloy, as revealed by the DSC and, especially, by the internal friction (IF) and modulus (E) evolution during cooling and heating these alloys.

They not only serve as the building blocks for protein synthesis but also play additional important roles in neurotransmission, production and storage of metabolic energy, nitrogen metabolism, and synthesis of hormones, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, and glutathione. The intracellular pool of amino acids is derived not only from endogenous production (biosynthesis as well as protein degradation) but also from transfer across the plasma membrane. Due to their ionic nature, amino acids do not permeate biological membranes by diffusion to any great extent. Transfer across biological membranes therefore requires participation of specific transport proteins. This transfer process does not necessarily have to serve only the entry of amino acids into cells. This process also mediates the exit of certain amino acids in a tissue-specific manner. In a number of cases, the transfer involves exchange across the membrane, a process that couples the entry of certain amino acids into cells and the exit of different amino acids from the cells. A multitude of transport systems is known to facilitate the transfer of amino acids across the plasma membrane in mammalian cells. These transport systems exhibit variable but in many instances overlapping substrate specificity and are not expressed uniformly in all cell types. The differential expression of amino acid transport systems coupled with their variable substrate specificity has physiological significance because different tissue types vary markedly in their requirements for specific amino acids to suit their specific physiological functions. In addition to the differences in substrate specificity, the amino acid transport systems also differ in their energetics and hence in their transport mechanism. Some transport systems are passive, functioning either as uniporters or exchangers without involving any driving force, whereas others are active, driven by transmembrane ion gradients. In many cases, multiple ion gradients are involved in the energization process, thus enhancing the concentrative capacity of the transport systems. © 2004 by CRC Press LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242482523

Post-fetch decompression, in which decompression is performed after the compressed instructions have been fetched, allows the instruction cache to store compressed code but requires a highly efficient decompression implementation. We propose implementing post-fetch decompression using dynamic instruction stream editing (DISE), a programmable decoder-similar in structure to those in many IA32 processors-that is used to add functionality to an application by injecting custom code snippets into its fetched instruction stream. A DISE implementation of post-fetch decompression naturally supports customized program-specific decompression dictionaries, enables parameterized decompression allowing similar instruction sequences to share dictionary entries, and uses no decompression-specific hardware. Cycle-level simulation of DISE decompression shows that it can reduce static program size by 35% and execution time by 20%. Parameterized decompression, a feature unique to DISE, accounts for 20% of the code size reduction by making more effective use of the dictionary and allowing PC-relative branches to be included in compressed sequences. DISE-based compression can reduce total energy consumption by 10% and the energy-delay product by as much as 20%.","Code compression; Code decompression; DISE","Data storage equipment; Embedded systems; Microprocessor chips; Program processors; Storage allocation (computer); Code compression; Code decompression; Dynamic instruction stream editing; Computer systems programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242443857

Helium ion irradiation through nanofabricated masks can been used to produce sub-micron planar magnetic nanostructures of various types. Among these, perpendicularly magnetized dots in a matrix of weaker magnetic anisotropy are of special interest because their quasi-static magnetization reversal is nucleation-free and proceeds by a very specific domain wall injection from the magnetically ""soft"" matrix, which acts as a domain wall reservoir for the ""hard"" dot. This guarantees a remarkably weak coercivity dispersion. This new type of irradiation-fabricated magnetic device can also be designed to achieve high magnetic switching speeds, typically below 100 ps at a moderate applied field cost. The speed is obtained through the use of a very high effective magnetic field, and high resulting precession frequencies. During magnetization reversal, the effective field incorporates a significant exchange field, storing energy in the form of a domain wall surrounding a high magnetic anisotropy nanostructure's region of interest. The exchange field accelerates the reversal and lowers the cost in reversal field.

Presently, this type of waste is subject to land disposal followed by lengthy bioremediation. This technology, based on the transformation of pulse energy, known as PET technology, recovers the heating energy of oil fraction from the waste containing up to 50% by volume of water, without separating the oil from the water. The process involves the fine emulsification of the mixture using a specially designed micro-pulsation unit. The resulting emulsion is then combustible so that the waste can be converted into useful fuel. Reported are results from the R&D testing of the technology with waste slurries and a variety of water-cut values. The most efficient combustion would typically result below 20% water cut. For higher values of water cut, some slurries could still be converted to fuel, whereas others require further processing or disposal. The study also shows the effect of post-treatment particle size distribution on the heating value of the treated waste. It demonstrates that adjusting the pulsation unit to produce emulsions of desired content could control the process. Other data, presented in the paper, include combined effects of types of waste, percentage of water cut, oil grade, emulsion stability, and energy consumption and production. PET has economic and environmental advantages over conventional techniques (biological treatment/gasification of waste fuels). The technology reduces pollution and generates energy, while reducing the amount of waste. There is no required energy input for additional heating or drying. There are also considerable savings in transportation and storage costs. In addition, up to two-thirds of existing liquid waste could be recycled as useful fuel.",,"Bioremediation; Emulsification; Industrial economics; Oil spills; Separation; Gravity separation; Crude petroleum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242321823

Our strategies focus on such applications and try to cluster dynamically created data with temporal affinity in the physical address space such that the data occupy a small number of memory banks.

In a hardened SRAM cell where an active delay element is often used in the feedback loop, single particle hits to a single critical node are not likely to cause an SEU upset. However, when the secondary heavy ions, created by the interactions between high-energy protons and Si nuclei, travel through a critical node as well as the pass gate inside the delay element, the delay element will be shunted out by charge deposited and as a result the stored state can easily be disturbed. Simple calculations based on this assumption yield good correlation to test results in terms of upset cross-section.

The people against hydrogen economy say that a focus on hydrogen will detract from the accelerating evolution to renewables. Some caution that the growth in hydrogen will encourage continued reliance on conventionals and fuel a resurgence in nuclear.",,"Environmental protection; Hydrogen; Renewable energy resources; Green power; Electric power generation",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141996421

Hydrogen supply involves production, shipping and storage; cost estimates are presented to show the necessity of utilizing onsite hydrogen generation in the future hydrogen energy system. The methanol steam reforming reaction with a copper catalyst in the presence of a palladium membrane as a means of serving as an onsite hydrogen supply system was studied. In the course of this study our kinetic study indicated an unexpected rate enhancement of the forward reaction. This is attributed to hydrogen spillover from the catalyst allowing the direct transport of the newly produced atomic hydrogen to the membrane surface. This phenomenon is further supported by the chemisorption-permeance of hydrogen through a palladium membrane in the presence of a copper catalyst. The hydrogen permeance through the membrane is increased by the presence of a copper/zinc catalyst on the membrane surface. This indicates that hydrogen spillover or reverse spillover is playing the role of a kinetic bridge connecting the catalyst site and membrane surface. This shortcut bridge enables the newly produced hydrogen atom to diffuse to the membrane surface for permeation out of the system and the active catalyst site to turn over faster for a new run of chemisorption-reaction.",,"copper; hydrogen; methanol; palladium; zinc; atomic particle; catalysis; catalyst; chemical reaction; complex formation; conference paper; diffusion; energy; kinetics; membrane permeability; permeability; reactor; water vapor",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042809536

The catalysts enhance the rate of conversion of unburned CO, HC and NOx to harmless products. Throughout the world emission standards are becoming ever more stringent, thus demanding more from the catalyst and engineering design of the power source. Furthermore, fossil fuel combustion generates large quantities of greenhouse gases such as CO2. The widespread use of fuel efficient lean burn vehicles is hindered by lack of an adequate technology for NOx reduction. Although progress has been made with NOx-storage systems, especially in Japan, the presence of sulfur and complicated regeneration requirements have hindered their application. Is it time to investigate alternative means of power generation that will not require after-treatment? The automobile companies throughout the world are answering yes. The fuel cell generates power by direct conversion of chemical energy, i.e., H2 and O2, to electrical energy avoiding the traditional combustion processes that generate pollutants. Furthermore, the system power efficiency is no longer limited by the Carnot cycle in which chemicals must be first combusted to produce mechanical energy. Greater efficiency translates to energy conservation and lower emissions of CO2 depending on the source of hydrogen necessary to operate the fuel cell. For this reason there has been tremendous research in attempting to develop fuel cells as an alternative to conventional combustion systems used for power generation. The state-of-the-art of the modern automotive emission control catalysts is discussed.

Several studies have shown that cache memories account for about 50% of the total energy consumed in these systems. The performance of a given cache architecture is largely determined by the behavior of the application using that cache. Desktop systems have to accommodate a very wide range of applications and therefore the manufacturer usually sets the cache architecture as a compromise given current applications, technology and cost. Unlike desktop systems, embedded systems are designed to run a small range of well-defined applications. In this context, a cache architecture that is tuned for that narrow range of applications can have both increased performance as well as lower energy consumption. We introduce a novel cache architecture intended for embedded microprocessor platforms. The cache can be configured by software to be direct-mapped, two-way, or four-way set associative, using a technique we call way concatenation, having very little size or performance overhead. We show that the proposed cache architecture reduces energy caused by dynamic power compared to a way-shutdown cache. Furthermore, we extend the cache architecture to also support a way shutdown method designed to reduce the energy from static power that is increasing in importance in newer CMOS technologies. Our study of 23 programs drawn from Powerstone, MediaBench and Spec2000 show that tuning the cache's configuration saves energy for every program compared to conventional four-way set-associative as well as direct mapped caches, with average savings of 40% compared to a four-way conventional cache.","Architecture tuning; Cache; Configurable; Embedded systems; Low energy; Low power; Microprocessor","Associative storage; Cache memory; Computer architecture; Embedded systems; Cache architecture; Configurable architecture tuning; Microprocessor chips",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038684781

ASHRAE 1120-TRP revised the concept of equivalent full-load hours (EFLHs) as an alternative to a more elaborate energy analysis. This paper applies results of this project to study the impact of the recommended values with over- and underestimated EFLHs in three climates for three different building types. Results indicate the required design length for a vertical GHCP system can be substantially affected by the annual imbalance of heat rejected to and absorbed from the ground in nonporous formations. The impact is reduced for porous formations. Overestimation of the annual cooling energy by 50% resulted in increases in required lengths of 4% to 15% for nonporous formations. Overestimation of the annual heating energy by 50% resulted in a 13% increase in required length in Minneapolis and minimal change in St. Louis and Atlanta. The impact of bore-to-bore separation in nonporous formations is significant, and designers should weigh the option of increasing this value beyond 20 ft (6 m) in warm climate, high cooling load applications. Finally, the accuracy of determining EFLHs using ASHRAE 1120-TRP results is sufficient to perform GCHP system design, since gross errors (±50% and +100%) result in much smaller errors in required ground loop lengths.",,"Absorption; Computer simulation; Cooling; Heat storage; Heating; Numerical analysis; Thermal effects; Ventilation; Equivalent full load hours; Ground coupled heat pump; Ground heat exchangers; Heat pump systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038493859

Melanocortins are also involved in the pathogenesis of disorders at the opposite end of the spectrum of energy homeostasis, the anorexia and weight loss associated with inflammatory and neoplastic disease processes. Studies using melanocortin antagonists (SHU9119 or agouti-related peptide) or genetic approaches (melanocortin-4 receptor null mice) suggest that intact melanocortin tone is required for anorexia and weight loss induced by injected lipopolysaccharide (an inflammatory gram-negative bacterial cell wall product) or by implantation of prostate or lung cancer cells. Although the precise mechanism whereby peripheral inflammatory/neoplastic factors activate the melanocortin system remains unknown, the proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α) that are produced in the hypothalamus of rodents during both inflammatory and neoplastic disease processes likely play a role.

In many cases, if the revised design floods occurred, the result would actually be dam overtopping because the existing reservoir has insufficient storage and spillway capacity. A number of overtopping protection systems have been developed for embankments and earthfill dams. These include concrete overtopping protection systems, timber cribs, sheet-piles, riprap and gabions, reinforced earth, minimum energy loss weirs, and the precast concrete block protection systems developed by Russian engineers. An interesting feature of the concrete block system is the flexibility of the stepped channel bed allowing differential settlements of the embankments. Individual blocks do not need to be connected to adjacent blocks. Another advantage is the short construction time on site. In a typical design, the blocks lie on a filter and erosion protection layer. The layer has two main functions: to filter the seepage flow out of the subsoil and to protect the subsoil layer from erosion by flow in the drainage layer. In addition the protection layer reduces or eliminates the uplift pressures acting on the concrete blocks. Usually, a geotextile membrane is laid on the embankment before the layer is placed and another membrane covers the protection layer before the installation of the blocks. The pressure differential created by the high velocity glow over the vertical face of the step creates suction that abstracts the fluid from underneath the concrete steps. Drains placed in areas of sub-atmospheric pressure act to releive uplift pressures.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Dams; Drainage; Embankments; Erosion; Earthfill dams; Floods; dam; embankment dam; overtopping; spillway; dam construction; design flood; embankment dam; overtopping; spillway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038206807

Several other hydroelectric schemes are also due for completion during the same period as Malaysia expands hydro power and coal-fired generation to reduce dependence on gas-fired generation. Plans include the development of pumped storage power in Peninsular Malaysia to make use of growing off-peak coal-fired power supplies. Hydro power represents the largest indigenous renewable energy resource in Malaysia. The total amount of technically exploitable hydro potential countrywide is 123,000GWh per year.

Start-up includes the selection and implementation of over 75 IT systems or computer applications which include: engineering applications; systems required to control mining activities, maintenance, the processing plant and utilities; and also systems required to run the company, such as human resources, finances and inventory/warehousing. This paper outlines the processes used for the selection, implementation and integration of these systems in order to optimize the use of information and to meet the technical, business and IT requirements of the company. The first step in ASE's approach to identifying system requirements is the development of a business activity model, outlining all tasks involved in running the operations. The computer applications required to accomplish each task are then identified by having the IT team work closely with each technical and business unit. Historically, at some companies, the selection of systems has been led by the IT team or by consultants, with little input from the technical or business units. Typically, this results in products that do not meet the company's expectations. To ensure a more positive outcome, ASE believes that it is imperative that the company's technical and business people be closely involved in the selection process. Integration of the IT systems is also key, including linking all applications through a data warehouse and EDMS. Over 120 required integrations have been identified. This ensures the storage of all data in only one location, data security, and easy data and document retrieval for all requirements throughout the company.","Albian Sands Energy; Computer applications; Implementation; Integration; IT systems","Finance; Information analysis; Inventory control; Process control; Business activity model; Mining; information technology; mining; oil sand; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037284540

However, alloying Mg with metals such as Ni introduces positive changes in the kinetics of hydrogen absorption. In the Mg-Ni system, the best hydrogen absorber is the intermetallic compound Mg2Ni that can be easily activated. The production of a high purity, single phase Mg2Ni, by means of mechanical alloying (MA) is possible. Previous results indicated the existence of an amorphous-like phase, or ""precursor"", after 12 hours of milling time. This phase partially transforms to the intermetallic compound by heating at 433 K. In the present work, the amount of Mg combined to form the precursor was quantified using a quantitative X-ray diffraction method: the internal standard method using a constant amount of Mo. The quantity of Ni combined was calculated using the magnetisation curves. Results confirmed that the precursor had a stoichiometry close to Mg2Ni intermetallic compound.","Amorphous precursor; Intermetallic; Internal standard method; Mechanical alloying","Absorption; Activation energy; Amorphous materials; Hydrogen; Intermetallics; Magnetization; Mechanical alloying; Phase transitions; Stoichiometry; X ray diffraction analysis; Dehydriding; Hydriding; Internal standard method; Magnesium nickel alloys; Magnesium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037282387

University Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721, United States","Photorefractive polymers exhibit large refractive index changes when exposed to low power laser beams. When the optical excitation consists of two interfering coherent beams, the periodic light distribution produces a periodic refractive index modulation. The resulting index change produces a hologram in the volume of the polymer film. The hologram can be reconstructed by diffracting a third laser beam on the periodic index modulation. In contrast to many physical processes that can be used to generate a refractive index change, the photorefractive effect is fully reversible, meaning that the recorded holograms can be erased with a spatially uniform light beam. This reversibility makes photorefractive polymers suitable for real-time holographic applications. The mechanism that leads to the formation of a photorefractive index modulation involves the formation of an internal electric field through the absorption of light, the generation of carriers, their transport and trapping over macroscopic distances. The resulting electric field produces a refractive index change through orientational or non-linear optical effects. Due to the transport process, the index modulation amplitude is phase shifted with respect to the periodic light distribution produced by the interfering optical beams that generate the hologram. This phase shift enables the coherent energy transfer between two beams propagating in a thick photorefractive material. This property, referred to as two-beam coupling, is used to build optical amplifiers. Hence, photorefractive materials are also playing a role in imaging applications. Discovered and studied for several decades mainly in inorganic crystals and semiconductors, the photorefractive effect has not yet found wide spread commercial applications. This can be attributed to the difficulties associated with the growth of crystals, and to the high cost of optical and optomechanical components necessary for the development of complete optical systems. With the emergence of novel low cost plastic optical components that can be mass produced by techniques such as injection molding, the cost and the weight of optical components is decreasing rapidly. This trend together with the advances made in fabricating integrated laser sources at lower cost provide a great momentum to the development of new optical processing technologies. As real-time optical recording and processing media, photorefractive polymers are expected to play a major role in these technologies. The optical, physical, and chemical properties of photorefractive polymers are outlined and discussed. Current material classes and their respective merits and future challenges are presented together with examples of applications.","Carrier transport; Charge generation; Electro-optics; Glass transition temperature; Holographic storage; Interferometry; Kerr effect; Optical processing; Orientational birefringence; Photoconductive; Photorefractive; Polymer; Real-time holography","polymer; crystal; electric field; holography; laser; light refraction; light scattering; optics; refraction index; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037278895

This technique has a significant advantage in practice, being free from an ion collision, a thermal effect or the radiation damage from the generated plasma. Incident argon ions to the target were generated by an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) source. In order to control the concentration ratio of transition elements (TM) to magnesium in film, the target area ratio was changed with the combination of pure metal target plates. Deposited magnesium alloy films were characterized by EDX, XRD and TEM. Various concentrations of Mg alloy films were obtained with 10 to 90 mol% TM. Through XRD analysis, an amorphous-like thin film can be fabricated. Cross-sectional TEM observation showed that the Mg-Ni film deposited on silicon wafer substrates had two different regions of crystal structures.

The performance of an active hybrid power source (battery/capacitor/converter) is compared to that of a passive hybrid (battery/capacitor) using both simulation and experiment. Particularly in this paper, two cells of Sony US18650 lithium-ion battery and two cells of Maxwell PC 100 supercapacitor are used as the energy storage components in the power source construction. Both the experimental data and the simulation results show that the active hybrid power source achieved greater mass and volume densities of power without drawing excessive currents from the battery. The active hybrid yielded a peak power of 130 W with terminal voltage variation (1.31V), compared to a maximum of 42 W for the passive hybrid with voltage variation 1.7V.","Hybrid power source; Lithium-ion battery; Power converter; Pulse power; Ultracapacitor","Computer simulation; Electric potential; Energy storage; Lithium batteries; Power converters; Hybrid power sources; Capacitors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037230737
