To increase the output power of solar panel, an active solar tracker based on the horizon coordinate system of solar has been developed. The solar horizon coordinate system used to determine the position of the sun at every single time, thus the solar panel's position to the sun is more precise. This device consists of arduinouno as control system, two servo motors as a panel drive, a PLX-DAQ program as a data monitoring, ACS - 712 as the current sensor, and a DC voltage sensor as the output voltage sensor. Sensor characterization shows that ACS-712 measures current in mA orde and has a maximum relative error of 4.25%, meanwhile the voltage sensor detects the output voltage up to 15 Volt and has the maximum relative error of 4.34%. The output power of this device increases 83,89% to the other active solar panels.

The main disadvantage of the battery is the long duration during charging process, short lifetime and less environment friendly. This is one of the obstacles in the development of electric vehicles. Recently, it has been found an electrical energy storage media that uses capacitor technology. The basic principle of capacitors is similar to a battery, which can store electrical charges. The charging process of capacitor is relatively faster than battery, but the discharging process is also very fast. The advantages of capacitor are not using chemical process, cheap maintenance and longer lifetime than battery. Therefore, the researcher developed supercapacitor.

Resist-stenciling can produce micropatterned reduction features with over ten times the feature density compared to techniques such as laser-scribing or screen printing. As a proof-of-concept, resist-stenciling is used to fabricate the first 2D micro-supercapacitors integrated into a layered graphene bionanocomposite. These demonstrate a specific capacitance of ≈128 F g−1, good capacitance retention under charge cycling (87.5% after 2000 cycles), and repeated mechanical bending without failure.

The construction materials quality closely depends on the drying external and internal parameters and requires a deep analysis of different drying conditions such us air temperature, air humidity and air flow rate in relation with the particular properties of the considered raw material. In order to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions in clay tiles manufacturing alternative energies have to be used in this industrial process either as a unique or supplemental source. Thanks to the high thermal conversion efficiency, solar energy is one of the most suitable green energy sources for industrial heat generation. In this paper a small-scale solar drying system of a clay tile sample has been designed under Fez's climatic conditions. The thermal performance of the considered solar dryer has been evaluated during the least sunny week of the year based on a dynamic simulation environment via TRNSYS software coupled to an external mathematical code estimating the moisture content in the clay tile sample during the drying time.

A large number of PV accesses may cause the voltage fluctuation or even the voltage exceeding, which will affect the safety and operation reliability of the power grid. In view of the voltage exceeding caused by PV access, the influence of energy storage system on PV capacity in distribution network is studied in this paper. First, a distributed PV consumption model is established based on the constraints of voltage and power flow. Secondly, the influence of adding energy storage system on the capacity of distributed PV is analyzed. Finally, the maximum PV access capacity before and after adding energy storage is solved by trial method. Taking IEEE 30 node distribution system as a simulation example, the reasons for limiting the increase of PV capacity of each node are analyzed.

The stability of power grid frequency mainly depends on primary frequency compensation (PFC) of thermal power units. How to control and improve the PFC ability is the precondition to realize the safe and stable operation of power grid. By analyzing the PFC assessment system and standard of power grid, the problems in the current unit's PFC were pointed out. By dynamically correcting the current rotation difference according to the actual main steam pressure measurement value of the unit, it can fully compensate the grid power gap by using the unit's heat storage.

Framing early-stage results in such a context will advance the prospects of next-generation Zn batteries while avoiding the “hype cycle” that has plagued research and development for other energy-storage technologies.

Framing results in such a context will advance the prospects of next-generation batteries while avoiding the hype cycles that often plague energy-storage technologies. We present guidelines for evaluating and reporting zinc-based battery data such that the results will directly inform which breakthroughs are relevant for scale up. © 2018Lithium ion dominates the battery landscape thanks to decades of progress and refinement that have increased cycle life and improved energy content. Yet, lingering concerns about safety and the use of strategic materials have motivated the search for “beyond-lithium-ion” technologies. Promising alternatives such as Na-ion, Li-S, and Li-O 2 still incorporate nonaqueous electrolytes that present safety and environmental challenges. Aqueous-based zinc batteries (e.g., Ni-Zn, Ag-Zn, Zn-MnO 2 , and Zn-air) offer compelling “beyond-lithium” alternatives by providing high practical specific energy, competitive power performance, and decades of safety validation. A new wave of researchers across the scientific community are now revisiting zinc battery configurations, developing new electrode and cell designs and electrolyte formulations in order to solve long-standing limitations such as poor cyclability. Unfamiliarity with cell-level considerations can result, however, in reports that misinterpret materials-level or bench-scale test findings when projecting performance of practical zinc batteries. We describe appropriate means by which to translate materials- and component-level performance into device-level metrics so that future reports on rechargeable Zn-based batteries can stand as technology enablers. © 2018","alkaline; guidelines; metrics; nickel-zinc; rechargeable batteries; silver-zinc; zinc; zinc-air","Binary alloys; Digital storage; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Grid computing; Ions; Lithium compounds; Manganese alloys; Manganese oxide; Secondary batteries; Silver alloys; Sodium compounds; Storage (materials); Strategic materials; Sulfur compounds; Zinc; Zinc alloys; alkaline; Energy storage technologies; Environmental challenges; guidelines; metrics; Non-aqueous electrolytes; Research and development; Silver-zinc; Lithium-ion batteries; alkalinity; electrode; electrolyte; guideline; nickel; power; silver; zinc",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059623933

Herein, we have systematically studied the kinetic behaviors of Li-S chemistry on Co-based compounds with fixed metal cation and varied non-metal anions, and deciphered the intrinsic modulation essence of the anions. Among the Co-based compounds, CoP exhibits the lowest overpotential for polysulfide transformation. Even at 40.0 C, S@CoP/rGO still delivers a high capacity of 417.3 mA hr g −1 and an unprecedented power density of 137.3 kW kg −1 , representing the best rate performance.

Although various metal-based compounds have been extensively used as additives in sulfur cathodes to relieve the aforementioned issue, they exhibit large performance variations. Unfortunately, the essential modulation principle for the large variations remains unclear, especially at the atomic level, which substantially prevents the rational design of electrode materials for Li-S batteries.

Fuel cells, which convert chemical energy into electricity, will play an important role in this transformation. Herein, we report a new strategy for electrochemical O 2 reduction in a fuel cell that uses an organic mediator to shuttle electrons and protons between the electrode and a heterogeneous catalyst that is contained within an off-electrode packed-bed reactor where O 2 reduction occurs. Design and synthesis of a robust quinone mediator provided the basis for this advance. Further development of this fuel cell design has the potential to achieve higher power densities than current state-of-the-art non-PGM fuel cells. This strategy has potential use in various other electrode-driven chemical redox transformations. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.New methods for interconversion of electrical and chemical energy are crucial to addressing emerging challenges in renewable energy storage and conversion. Dissolved redox mediators provide an effective means to transport electrons (and protons) between an electrode and catalysts that are not in direct physical contact with an electrode. Mediators are widely implemented in biofuel cells, but such devices typically exhibit low power densities. Here, we report the development of a tetrasubstituted quinone mediator that exhibits excellent stability under strongly acidic conditions and supports electrochemical reduction of O 2 at an off-electrode heterogeneous cobalt catalyst contained within a packed-bed reactor. Efficient oxidation of the hydroquinone by O 2 in the reactor provides the basis for mediator regeneration, and an integrated “flow-cathode” fuel cell system supports high power densities. These results establish the combination of organic mediators with off-electrode heterogeneous catalysts as a versatile platform for development of new electrode-driven chemical redox transformations. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.Dissolved organic redox mediators enable transport of electrons and protons between an electrode and off-electrode heterogeneous catalysts.

Currently one of the main challenges in developing high-performance HSICs is the lack of suitable electrode material with superior Na-ion storage capability. In this work, a novel nanocomposite comprised of MoSe2 nanosheets decorated with SnO2 nanoparticles through interfacial Se-O bonding (denoted as O-MoSe2/SnO2) has been rationally synthesized and studied as an electrode for both SIBs and HSICs. The nanocomposite delivers an impressive Na-ion storage capacity of 249 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 10 A g−1. Kinetics analyses using cyclic voltammetry technique reveal the Na+-ion storage in the nanocomposite is governed by a pseudocapacitive charge storage (accounting for ∼88% at a scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1) with fast Na+ insertion/extraction kinetics. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations disclose that a charge accumulation occurs at the interface of O-MoSe2/SnO2 nanocomposite, which promotes rapid Na+-ion transport through the interface. Furthermore, a HSIC device is assembled using the O-MoSe2/SnO2 nanocomposite as anode and an activated carbon as cathode, demonstrating a high energy density of 70 W h kg−1 at a power-output of 62 W kg−1 with an excellent cycling stability of high capacitance retention rate of 94% for 6000 cycles at 5 A g−1. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Density functional theory calculations; Hybrid sodium ion capacitors; Pseudocapacitive charge storages; Sodium ion batteries","Activated carbon; Anodes; Cathodes; Chemical bonds; Cyclic voltammetry; Density functional theory; Metal ions; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Selenium compounds; Storage (materials); Synthesis (chemical); Capacitance retention; Charge accumulation; Charge storage; Electrode material; High current densities; High energy densities; Novel nanocomposites; Sodium ions; Sodium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051921960

The evolution of the material system is then characterized by two energetic principles: the global stability condition and the energy balance between stored and dissipated energies with the work of external loading. Rate-independent generalized standard materials are endowed with such structure, whereas the existence of such energetic structure is not so apparent in materials with non-associated flow rule. In this paper, we consider a rate-independent gradient damage model for concrete where the evolution of the damage does not follow the normality rule. We will show that such model can be nevertheless derived by a dissipation potential at the expense of having a state variable-dependent potential, and therefore the energetic formulation can be obtained also in this case. After introducing the incremental minimization problem consistent with such formulation, we obtain a discrete version of the stability condition and establish lower and upper a-priori energy bounds met by the energetic solution. These are fundamental results for the analysis of the formulation. The actual numerical solution of the incremental minimization problem is realized by considering first a variable splitting in order to treat the gradient of the damage field as an independent variable, and then by applying the augmented Lagrangian method to tackle with the resulting constrained optimization problem. We solve the first order stationarity conditions of the augmented Lagrangian functional by a path-following Newton's method based on the energy dissipation rate control. We show that we are able to describe highly non-linear responses of the material, such as softening branches and snap-back responses. Several numerical tests are performed to verify the objectivity of the formulation and of the proposed numerical method. Details of the numerical implementation are also given. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Concrete material behavior; Dissipation based continuation Newton's method; Energetic formulation; Gradient damage model; Rate-independent processes; Two-sided energetic inequality","Concretes; Constrained optimization; Energy dissipation; Lagrange multipliers; Newton-Raphson method; Problem solving; Concrete materials; Energetic formulations; Gradient damage; Newton's methods; Rate-independent process; Two-sided energetic inequality; Numerical methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051528826

Therefore, from both fundamental and applied viewpoints, to reveal the causes of the improved damage tolerance of NCMs, there is large interest in the advancement of an understanding of the fundamental micromechanisms for the competition/interaction between plastic deformation and fracture process in NCMs. In doing so, this paper develops a theoretical model to describe the energy and critical conditions of the tilt GB migration and then the disclinated TJ nanocrack nucleation and growth processes near a nanovoid at the triple junctions (TJs) of GBs in plastically deformed NCM. The analytic solutions of the total energy changes that characterize these processes are derived quantitatively by the complex variable method. The results show that the stress-driven tilt GB migration near a nanovoid is energetically favorable and effective in relieving high local stresses near a nanovoid, which is crucially significant for stopping further nanovoid growth and enhancing the ductility of the plastically deformed NCMs. On the other hand, GB disclination storage is capable of causing the stress concentration, and consequent generation and growth of nanocracks at the TJs near a nanovoid, thereby decreasing their ductility. The predominant mechanism controlling plasticity deformation and fracture process in NCMs is closely related with nanovoid, GB configuration and geometry. © 2018","Analytical solution; Critical condition; Disclinated cracking; Grain boundary migration; Nanovoid induced stresses","Cracks; Ductility; Grain boundaries; Nanocrystalline materials; Complex variable method; Critical condition; Deformation and fracture; Generation and growth; Grain boundary migrations; Induced stress; Nucleation and growth; Theoretical modeling; Nanocrystals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050554972

The past two decades have witnessed the evolution of a wide spectrum of low dimensional carbon materials with extraordinary physical and chemical properties, ideal for microscale electrical energy storage and generation. Tremendous progress has been made in harnessing the energy associated with the interactions between these nanostructured carbon substrates and the surrounding molecular phases, subsequently converting them into useful electricity. This review summarizes the important theoretical and experimental milestones the field has reached to date, and further classifies these energy harvesting processes based on underlying physics, into five mechanistically distinct classes—phonon coupling, Coulombic scattering, electrokinetic streaming, asymmetric doping, and capacitive discharging. With a special mechanistic focus, the authors hope to resolve the fundamental attributes shared by this diverse array of molecular scale energy harvesting schemes, offer perspectives on key challenges, and ultimately establish design principles that guide further device optimization. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Especially dietary intake of n-3 PUFA and a lowered n-6:n-3 ratio are highly encouraged due to beneficial and diminishing effects on basal cortisol secretions. However, the time of such effects to occur and how plasma PUFA patterns affect cortisol concentrations in the short-term was rarely investigated. In order to address this, we supplemented forty male and forty female Guinea pigs with diets high in the essential PUFA α-linolenic acid (ALA, 18 : 3n-3) and linoleic acid (LA, 18 : 2n-6) for 20 d. Saliva cortisol concentrations in relation to altering plasma PUFA patterns during this time span were analysed in a repeated measurement design both during basal conditions (individual housing) in 5-d intervals and during stressful social confrontations. We detected very fast plasma PUFA accumulation rates, corresponding to the major dietary PUFA, which resulted in plasma PUFA plateau phases after 10 d. ALA negatively and LA positively affected saliva cortisol concentrations throughout the study. A positive effect of the plasma n-6:n-3 ratio on saliva cortisol concentrations was detected during peak plasma PUFA accumulations and social confrontations, while no effects were detected in relation to plasma PUFA plateau phases. These results suggest that the plasma n-6:n-3 ratio diminishes HPA axis activity during altered physiological conditions only and highlights the importance of altering plasma PUFA patterns for HPA axis functions and the control of energy balance and physiological stress. © The Authors 2018.","Linoleic acid; n-3 Ratio; n-6; Plasma non-esterified PUFA; Saliva cortisol concentrations; α-Linolenic acid","hydrocortisone; linolenic acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; fatty acid; hydrocortisone; linolenic acid; unsaturated fatty acid; animal experiment; animal housing; Article; controlled study; energy balance; fatty acid blood level; female; guinea pig; hydrocortisone release; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; physiological stress; saliva analysis; social stress; animal; animal behavior; animal food; blood; diet; metabolism; reproducibility; saliva; alpha-Linolenic Acid; Animal Feed; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Diet; Fatty Acids; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Female; Guinea Pigs; Hydrocortisone; Male; Reproducibility of Results; Saliva",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054991400

However, the difficulty of access to distributed power and battery energy storage stations makes the traditional distribution network planning method to be somewhat inadaptable. For this reason, this paper establishes a distribution network planning model with a power distribution station, substation, distribution network line, DG and battery energy storage station considered. The objective function of the model is to minimize the construction cost and maintenance cost during the distribution network planning period, and the constraint conditions take into consideration the operation reliability of the power system. Based on this, an improved multi-objective shuffled frog leaping algorithm (IMO-SLFA) was used for sample validation. According to the results, the model can effectively solve the expansion planning problem of a distribution network for several years, and then meet the access demand of DG and battery energy storage stations and the demand of load growth within a certain region.

A 6-fold increase in solubility is obtained with eutectic-based electrolytes. A redox flow battery using N-methylphthalimide as anolyte shows high capacity and stable cycle life. This promising strategy that takes advantage of forming eutectic electrolyte is effective for further development of concentrated redox-active organic molecules for organic RFBs as grid-scale energy storage systems. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.Recent development of high-energy-density organic-based redox flow batteries for large-scale energy storage systems is challenged by the stability and limited molar concentration of the redox-active molecules. Here, we report green and effective eutectic-based anolytes to achieve enhanced reversibility and high concentration through phthalimide derivatives. A nearly 6-fold increase in solubility can be achieved with the eutectic electrolytes composed of phthalimide derivatives, urea, and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). The interaction between phthalimide derivatives and LiTFSI weakens the chemical bonds, facilitating the formation of eutectic electrolytes. Meanwhile, urea contributes to decreasing the viscosity of the eutectic solvent as well as to improving the reversibility of phthalimide radical anions generated during the electrochemical process. Compared with previously reported organic redox flow batteries, the resulting redox flow battery demonstrates comparable storage capacity but superior cycling stability, showing the promise of the eutectic-phthalimide-based organic molecules for high-performance organic redox flow batteries. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.As one of the promising electrochemical energy storage systems, redox flow batteries (RFBs) have received rapidly increasing interest for large-scale storage applications because of their scalability, flexible modular design, and long cycle life. However, their practical application in industry is still impeded by the low energy density largely attributable to the limited working voltage and concentration of redox species. Here, we present a promising strategy for improving the concentration and enhancing the reversibility of phthalimide-based organic anolytes by forming eutectics with the supporting salt and urea. Compared with the traditional complex organic synthesis method, this eutectic-based strategy is more convenient and effective.

Several uncertainties including the output power of distributed generation and load power are considered and each uncertainty factor is divided into several typical scenarios. The probability of each scenario is calculated by asymptotically optimal scenario analysis. The annual investment cost, the fault outage cost expectation, the annual cost regret value expectation and penalty function, the violating electrical constraints degree, and the source-network-load equilibrium degree are applied to represent the flexibility of the planning model. Allocation of energy storage system capacity is considered in the network planning model, which can reduce the negative effects on the microgrid in extreme scenarios. An energy management strategy is constructed to coordinate the distribution of source and load. The tree structure encoding is employed to ensure the connectivity of the network. Dynamic Pareto set-based particle swarm optimisation is adopted for the solution of the network planning model. Finally, the calculation results of planning schemes are demonstrated by radar chart, and the optimal one is selected by its comprehensive evaluation value. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018.",,"Data storage equipment; Economics; Energy management; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Trees (mathematics); Asymptotically optimal; Calculation results; Comprehensive evaluation; Energy management strategies; Energy storage systems; Optimal planning models; Particle swarm optimisation; Tree structure encoding; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057411092

Early studies characterized the structures, charge states, and reactivity of sparsely distributed soft-landed species. The recent development of high-flux ionization sources has opened up new opportunities for the precisely controlled preparation of both two-dimensional structures and three-dimensional multilayer architectures by ion soft landing. The deposition of large numbers of ions onto supports led to previously unknown phenomena being uncovered, thereby opening several exciting research directions. Furthermore, faster ion deposition has enabled fabrication of novel functional devices.

Factors that affect the performance of the freezer is an unstable electric current, frost and others things. The most frequent problem found is frost. Previous research shows that the thickness of the frost up to 5 mm and 10 mm of freezer energy consumption up to 20% and 33%. The formation of frost is a common physical phenomena that occur at environmental temperature conditions freezer and humidity. The heat exchange occurs and the water molecules in the air condenses as the temperature in the freezer is below the dew point and causes frost growth. The prevention formation frost by means of the air moist in the freezer absorb and condensation with tools. Tools make air circulation, after which the air moist not returned in the freezer. The experimental study verifies the tools can reduce consumption power up to 11% in 2.5 hours.

The thermophysical properties of phase change material (PCM) materials are important to know before they are applied in a variety of uses. The thermophysical properties of PCM materials are very important to note i.e. melting point, super cooling temperature, latent heat, heat type and thermal conductivity of the PCM material. Methods of determining the thermophysical properties of PCM materials that have been widely used are differential thermal analysis (DTA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and calorimetry. These three methods have weaknesses. DTA and DSC methods that have very small test samples (110 mg) cause the materials thermophysical properties to be different when used in larger quantities. Another disadvantage is that DTA and DSC measurement equipment is complex and expensive, and cannot measure latent heat, specific heat and thermal conductivity of multiple PCM samples simultaneously. The weakness of the calorimetry method is the process of changing the two phases of PCM that is difficult to observe. T-history method that uses simple equipment has been widely used at this time. In this research, we will use T-History method to measure the thermophysical properties of phase change materials that will be used as heat storage material in solar water heating system. The material is: paraffin, beeswax, cow fat, and mixture of the material with a certain ratio. From the test, results can be concluded that the use of T-History method gives good results with a difference of 7% with the measurement results using DSC. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Calorimeters; Differential scanning calorimetry; Differential thermal analysis; Dye-sensitized solar cells; Heat storage; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Latent heat; Materials properties; Solar heating; Solar water heaters; Specific heat; Storage (materials); Thermal conductivity; Constant temperature; Differential thermal analyses (DTA); DSC measurements; Energy storage density; Latent heat storage system; Measurement of thermal properties; Solar water heating systems; Super-cooling temperature; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058274243

This paper will discuss in detail the numerical analysis of building thermal characteristics using PCM materials on the walls for climatic conditions of Banda Aceh City. The PCM used is beeswax. The weather data used in the simulation was customized for the year 2015 from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) website.

To reveal the fundamental enhancement mechanism, intensive surface Li + diffusion kinetics, postmortem structural characteristics, and aging tests are performed for four sample systems. The results show that the integrated coating layer plays an important role in addressing interface compatibility, not only limited in stabilizing the bulk structure and suppressing side reactions, synergistically contributing to the performance enhancement for the active electrodes.

The resulting growth of harvested energy is bound by a linear function. Here we show that exponential energy harvesting can be achieved in a system of reconfigurable energy storage elements. The exponential extraction results from the positive feedback of the system potential energy due to repetitive system reconfigurations. The concept is studied theoretically and validated with results from systems of droplet capacitors. A device with three 300 μL mercury drops can generate an exponentially growing voltage that reaches 168 V within a few cycles of a low-level and low-frequency mechanical excitation.

Here we show the possibility to boost the magnetic anisotropy of the smallest magnetic nanostructure—transition metal dimer. Through systematic first-principles calculations, we proposed an effective way to enhance the MAE of an iridium dimer from 77 meV to 223–294 meV by simply attaching a halogen atom at one end of the Ir–Ir bond. The underlying mechanism for the enormous MAE is attributed to the rearrangement of the molecular orbitals which alters the spin-orbit coupling Hamiltonian and hence the magnetic anisotropy.

Here we report imidazolate ionic liquids (Im-ILs) for rapid and efficient capture, and reliable storage of iodine. These Im-ILs can chemically capture iodine to form I-substituted imidazolate ILs with an iodide counterion and the newly formed ILs can absorb iodine to form polyiodide species and low-temperature eutectic salts. For example, choline imidazolate shows iodine capture capacities of 8.7 and 17.5 g of iodine per gram of IL at 30 and 100 oC, respectively, which are, to the best of our knowledge, higher than the values (0.5–4.3 g/g) reported to date.

C-RAN consists of the baseband units (BBUs) and the remote radio heads (RRHs). BBUs are pooled in a central cloud, i.e., the BBU pool is to provide powerful computation and storage resources while RRHs are distributed across multiple sites to provide coverage and interact with user equipments. In order to exploit the benefits of C-RAN, each BBU can be actualized by a virtual machine, i.e., virtual BBU (VB). VBs can be initiated and shut down as needed to serve clusters of RRHs (i.e., many-to-one mapping between RRHs and BBUs). RRHs can be turned into the sleep mode to reduce the energy consumption. In this paper, we jointly optimize BBU-RRH mapping and user association with the objective to minimize the system cost incurred by the energy bill from RRHs and VB rentals under the constraint of user quality of service, which is formulated as an integer linear programming problem. Furthermore, we decompose the joint problem into two subproblems and design a time-efficient algorithm to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm performs close to the optimal solutions obtained from CPLEX. © 2017 IEEE.","BBU-RRH mapping; Cloud radio access network (Cloud-RAN); power consumption; user association","Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Green computing; Integer programming; Mapping; Network architecture; Problem solving; Cloud architectures; Cloud radio access networks; Cloud-RAN; Integer Linear Programming; Remote radio heads; Time efficient algorithms; User associations; User Quality of Service; Quality of service",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063021239

Hydrogen produced by water electrolysis is an ideal energy carrier for potentially scalable storage of these energy sources because it has high energy density and does not emit any pollutant or greenhouse gas upon combustion. However, overall water splitting, including hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER, respectively), currently requires a large excess potential to expedite the reactions (200–400 mA cm−2 at cell voltages of 1.8 V–2.4 V in base), resulting in less than 4% of the world's industrial hydrogen being produced by electrolysis. To overcome this obstacle, as well as the high cost of traditional noble-metal catalysts, considerable achievements have been made recently in the development of cheap and earth-abundant electrocatalysts, including some robust catalysts approaching commercial criteria, but reviews of these electrocatalysts and their compatibility with commercial-scale water electrolysis remain lacking. In this review, we will present an overview of recent developments in the production of high-performance earth-abundant and non-noble electrocatalysts for HER and OER, as well as for overall water splitting. With an eye toward the commercialization of water electrolysis, emphasis is placed on the most efficient electrocatalysts for either HER or OER, as well as those showing sustainable capability of withstanding accelerated degradation under large current densities (≥500 mA cm−2) over long periods of time, which is critically indispensable for actual applications of this technology. The major challenges facing the production of such electrocatalysts and possible future improvements in the fabrication of robust electrocatalysts for water electrolysis are also highlighted. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bifunctional; Electrocatalyst; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Overall water splitting; Oxygen evolution reaction","Electric power transmission networks; Electrocatalysts; Electrolysis; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Hydrogen storage; Oxygen evolution reaction; Precious metals; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Water pollution; Water treatment; Accelerated degradation; Bi-functional; High energy densities; Large current density; Noble metal catalysts; Non-noble electrocatalysts; Water electrolysis; Water splitting; Hydrogen production",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062910713

The influence of the voltage caused by the PV plant is analyzed in a simple distribution feeder at first.

It can be operated either connected with the external system or islanded with the support of ESSs.

The optimization problem is proposed to obtain the economic operation for the microgrid based on this model. In day-ahead scheduling, with the estimated power generation and load demand, the optimal charging/discharging scheduling of EVs during 24 h is achieved by serial quadratic programming. With the optimal charging/discharging scheduling of EVs, the daily load curve can better track the generation curve.

In this study, a water insensitive synthetic scheme based on carboxyl and aziridinyl was employed to prepare PEG-based BSSPCMs via solvent-free bulk polymerization: First, a carboxyl modified polyethylene glycol was synthesized through esterification reaction of citric acid and PEG with the molar ratio 2:1. Then, the BSSPCMs were prepared based on an self-curing and organic solvent-free process, using trimethylolpropane tris(1-aziridine propionate) as the cross-linking agent. The chemical structure, crystalline properties, phase change properties, thermal stability, and reliability were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, polarizing optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and accelerated thermal cycling testing, respectively. Solid–solid phase change behavior was testified by the leakage test. The biodegradation experiment was conducted to prove the biodegradability of solid–solid PCMs. The results indicated that BSSPCMs had a similar crystalline structure to PEG, and the crystal size was smaller than PEG. The phase change temperature of BSSPCMs was in the range of 25–65°C, and the latent heat of phase change materials (PCMs) was about 103–108 J/g. Moreover, the extent of supercooling of BSSPCMs was reduced.

The results demonstrated that the permittivity of thermal treated nanocomposites increased and dielectric loss decreased compared with the untreated system. In addition, the energy density was also greatly improved due to the inclined residual polarization. For example, the energy density of the treated nanocomposite with 50vol.% nanofillers was 3.14 times higher than the untreated nanocomposite at 50MV/m. Moreover, the charge-discharge efficiency was also promoted from 6.36% to 56.89%. According to the viewpoint of microstructure, the improvement of the dielectric and energy storage properties would be ascribed to the suppression on void defects in the interphase of dielectric nanocomposite by employing the thermal treatment process.

We explore the role of biomass in China's long-term mitigation toward the Paris climate goals in light of three narratives and five mitigation scenarios, modeling by a refined Global Change Assessment Model. While presenting a limited contribution to achieving China's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), biomass plays an important role in China's post-NDC mitigation toward the Paris climate goals. All the assessed scenarios call for extensive biomass use, accounting for 6.5%-28% of China's 2100 primary energy in our three 2 °C scenarios and 15%-30% in our two 1.5 °C scenarios. The exact biomass deployment trajectories tend to depend greatly on how China envisages national mitigation paces and BECCS strategies. For either 2 °C or 1.5 °C, a smaller negative-emission narrative, which means a more rapid immediate decarbonization of the energy system toward mid-century, depends on larger bioenergy in medium-to-long-term. Delaying short- and medium-term ambition delays bioenergy applications but requires far more in the second half of the century to create greater negative emissions via BECCS. Moving from 2 °C toward 1.5 °C features higher and earlier bioenergy deployments and meaningfully increasing BECCS volumes and biofuel shares in China's energy system. Consequently, the Chinese stockholders might be ready to make a decision on to what degree biomass and BECCS enter the sphere of China's energy and climate policies, which will greatly influence not only national biomass roadmap but also mid-century mitigation targets. © 2018 The Author(s).

This paper focuses on selecting a suitable architecture among the different options, while also indicating the control strategy that the converters must follow to ensure appropriate performance. Also, several modes of operation for the complete system are introduced to implement energy management. For the selected DC architecture, two case studies, viz. off-grid and peak-shaving for a grid-tied system, were employed to characterize the response of the model demonstrating its utility to perform maximum power-point tracking, excess solar power curtailment, and battery charging and discharging.

The HHP system harvests solar energy during summer, stores it in a Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage (STES) and releases the stored energy for anti-icing the road surface during winter. The aims of this study are to investigate: (i) the feasibility of HHP system with low fluid temperature for harvesting solar energy and anti-icing the road surface; and (ii) the long-term operation of the STES. In this study, a Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES) is considered to be the STES. The HHP system and the BTES are decoupled from each other and their performances are investigated separately. A hybrid 3D numerical simulation model is developed to analyze the operation of the HHP system. Moreover, a 3D numerical simulation model is made to calculate the temperature evolution at the borehole walls of the BTES. The climate data are obtained from Östersund, a city in the middle of Sweden with long and cold winter periods. Considering the HHP system with the inlet fluid temperature of 4 ◦C, the road area of 50 m × 3.5 m as well as the BTES with 20 boreholes and 200 m depth, the result showed that the harvested solar energy during summer is 352.1 kWh/(m2·year), the required energy for anti-icing the road surface is 81.2 kWh/(m2·year) and the average temperature variation at the borehole walls after 50 years is +0.5◦C. Installing the HHP system in the road leads to a 1725 h shorter remaining number of hours of slippery condition on the road surface during winter and a 5.1 ◦C lower temperature on the road surface during summer, compared to a road without the HHP system. © 2018 by the authors.","Anti-icing; Fluid temperature decline; Hybrid 3D model; Ice-free road; Slippery surface","Digital storage; Harvesting; Heat storage; Hot water heating; Numerical models; Pavements; Solar energy; Thermal energy; 3-d modeling; 3-D numerical simulation; Anti-icing; Borehole thermal energy storage; Fluid temperatures; Numerical investigations; Slippery surfaces; Temperature variation; Boreholes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059284505

In this article, a method for the energy storage configuration used for black-start is proposed. First, the energy storage capacity for starting a single turbine was determined. Then, a hierarchical planning model was established. This model did not consider the starting efficiency of the WPP, but it did consider the layout of the energy storage in the WPP and the balance of the terminal voltage when starting the WPP. Finally, the feasibility and value of the proposed method and model were verified in a 49.5 MW WPP with an ESS (a power rating of 2.24 MW and energy capacity of about 1.68 MWh). The result suggests that configuring an ESS with a small capacity on the side of the turbine can achieve black-start for a WPP with an ESS as the power source. © 2018 by the authors.","Black-start; Energy storage configuration; Hierarchical planning model; The wind power plants with energy storage system","Turbines; Wind power; Black start; Energy capacity; Energy storage capacity; Energy storage systems; Hierarchical planning; Power ratings; Terminal voltages; Wind generation; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059278057

However, while they may be characterized by better accuracy, larger DNNs require significant energy and area, thereby limiting their wide adoption. The energy consumption of DNNs is driven by both memory accesses and computation. Binarized neural networks (BNNs), as a tradeoff between accuracy and energy consumption, can achieve great energy reduction and have good accuracy for large DNNs due to their regularization effect. However, BNNs show poor accuracy when a smaller DNN configuration is adopted. In this article, we propose a new DNN architecture, LightNN, which replaces the multiplications to one shift or a constrained number of shifts and adds. Our theoretical analysis for LightNNs shows that their accuracy is maintained while dramatically reducing storage and energy requirements. For a fixed DNN configuration, LightNNs have better accuracy at a slight energy increase than BNNs, yet are more energy efficient with only slightly less accuracy than conventional DNNs. Therefore, LightNNs provide more options for hardware designers to trade off accuracy and energy. Moreover, for large DNN configurations, LightNNs have a regularization effect, making them better in accuracy than conventional DNNs. These conclusions are verified by experiment using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets for different DNN configurations. Our FPGA implementation for conventional DNNs and LightNNs confirms all theoretical and simulation results and shows that LightNNs reduce latency and use fewer FPGA resources compared to conventional DNN architectures. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Deep neural networks; FPGA; Low-power design","Economic and social effects; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; Low power electronics; Network architecture; Energy efficient; Energy reduction; Energy requirements; FPGA implementations; Hardware designers; Hardware implementations; Highly accurate; Low-power design; Deep neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058801493

The liver, as the central organ in energy metabolism, might be an important target organ for WGW interventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential benefits of WGW consumption compared with RW consumption on liver health and associated parameters. Design: We performed a double-blind, parallel trial in which 50 overweight 45- to 70-y-old men and postmenopausal women were randomly allocated to a 12-wk intervention with either WGW (98 g/d) or RW (98 g/d) products. Before and after the intervention we assessed intrahepatic triglycerides (IHTGs) and fat distribution by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy/magnetic resonance imaging, fecal microbiota composition, adipose tissue gene expression, and several fasting plasma parameters, as well as postprandial plasma lipids after a mixed meal. Results: Fasting plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acids, and insulin were not affected by RW or WGW intervention. We observed a substantial increase of 49.1% in IHTGs in the RW when compared with the WGW group (P = 0.033). Baseline microbiota composition could not predict the increase in IHTGs after RW, but gut microbiota diversity decreased in the RW group when compared with the WGW group (P = 0.010). In the WGW group, we observed increased postprandial triglyceride levels compared with the RW group (P = 0.020). In addition, the WGW intervention resulted in a trend towards lower fasting levels of the liver acute-phase proteins serum amyloid A (P = 0.057) and C-reactive protein (P = 0.064) when compared to the RW intervention. Conclusions: A 12-wk RW intervention increases liver fat and might contribute to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, whereas a 12-wk 98-g/d WGW intervention prevents a substantial increase in liver fat. Our results show that incorporating feasible doses of WGW in the diet at the expense of RW maintains liver health. © 2018 American Society for Nutrition.

RBCs storage is associated with the abnormal metabolism of glutathione (GSH), which may increase the risk of the oxidative damage of RBCs after transfusion. The responsible mechanisms remain unknown. Methods: We determined the L-cysteine efflux and influx by evaluating the changes of free -SH concentrations in stored RBCs. The glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) activities and protein content in stored RBCs was determined by fluorescence assay and western blotting. In addition, the glucose metabolism enzyme activity of RBCs was measured by spectrophotometric assay under in vitro incubation conditions. Results: We found that both L-cysteine transport and GCL activity significantly declined, thereby inducing the dysfunction of GSH synthesis during blood storage, which could be attenuated by ATP supplement and DTT treatment. In addition, the glycometabolic enzyme (G6PDH, HK, PK and LDH) activity significantly decreased after 6 weeks storage. Oxidant stress-induced dysfunction in glucose metabolism was the driving force for decreased GSH synthesis during storage. Conclusion: These experimental findings reflect an underlying molecular mechanism that oxidant stress induced glucose metabolism dysfunction contribute to decreased GSH synthesis in stored RBCs. © 2018 The Author(s).

Our previous studies suggested that resveratrol (RSV) supplement could improve hepatic steatosis, but the underlying mechanism, particularly which related to LD accumulation, has not yet been elucidated. Methods: A high-fat diet (HFD) and palmitic acid were used to induce hepatic steatosis in mouse liver and hepatocytes, respectively. The effects of RSV on LD accumulation were analyzed in vivo and in vitro. The effects of RSV on the expression levels of LD-associated genes (ATF6, Fsp27β/CIDEC, CREBH, and PLIN1) were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot assays, followed by KD or overexpression of SIRT1 and ATF6 with small interfering RNAs or overexpressed plasmids, respectively. The dual luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assay were utilized to clarify the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and possible interaction between SIRT1 and ATF6. Results: There was a significant increase in the accumulation of LDs in liver and hepatocytes during the process of HFD-induced steatosis, respectively, which was significantly inhibited by RSV supplementation. RSV notably activated SIRT1 expression and decreased the expression levels of ATF6, Fsp27β/CIDEC, CREBH, and PLIN1, which are associated with LD accumulation. Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of RSV on LD accumulation and the associated expression of genes in hepatocytes were abrogated or strengthened with SIRT1 silencing or overexpression, respectively. On the contrary, the benefits of RSV in hepatocytes were eliminated or aggravated when transfected with the overexpressed ATF6 or ATF6 siRNA, respectively. Furthermore, we found that RSV stimulated SIRT1 expression significantly, which was followed by increased deacetylation and inactivation of ATF6, resulting in a positive feedback loop for SIRT1 transcription associated with ATF6 binding to the SIRT1 promoter region. Conclusion: Taken together, these findings indicate that RSV supplementation improves hepatic steatosis by ameliorating the accumulation of LDs, and this might be partially mediated by a SIRT1/ATF6-dependent mechanism. © 2018 The Author(s).

Nevertheless, the low discharged energy density (Ue) of current dielectric film material restricts their further application. In this work, core-shell structured SrTiO3@SiO2 nanowires (ST@SiO2 NWs) fillers are fabricated based on interface engineering for high Ue. The optimized SiO2 insulating layer could effectively confine the mobility of space charge carriers in the interfacial zone between ST NWs and thick SiO2 insulating layer, thus reducing the interfacial polarization between the interface of nanofillers/polymer, which could be used to optimize the electric field strength and electric displacement of the corresponding nanocomposite. As a result, this nanocomposite film simultaneously exhibits enhanced maximum applied electric field (Emax) and (Dmax-Pr) values, thus releasing an ultrahigh discharged energy density of 14.7J/cm3 at 390MV/m, which is 99% higher than that of the conventional ST/P(VDF-CTFE) (without SiO2 coating) nanocomposite, and it is almost 2.5 times that of pure P(VDF-CTFE).

The results showed that the amount of Bi content has a significant impact on the ceramics of 0.93KNN-0.07BixMN. XRD indicates that all specimens exhibit a pure perovskite structure and existing oxygen vacancy in the specimens. The mean grain size for all specimens belong to submicron scale, and the sample of x=0.95 owns the smallest grain size is 0.11μm. The maximum dielectric constant increases but the phase transition temperature Tm exhibits a contrary tendency at 1MHz with increasing Bi concentration. Besides, all ceramics are relaxor ferroelectric. The impedance analysis further revealed that the activation energy of the ceramics increases with Bi content. Eventually, the highest ν of 58.8% and Wrec of 1.30J/cm3 are simultaneously achieved in the sample with x=0.60.

However, faster technical development at a large scale have restricted faster development. In particular, in the charging process, uneven deposition of zinc easily forms zinc dendrites and pierces the separator to cause serious self-discharge of the battery, which greatly reduces the coulombic efficiency and service life. Pyrolytic method can improve the electrochemical properties of the carbon felt (CF) and effectively promote the uniform deposition of zinc in the ZBFBs. In this work, we found that the zinc deposits formed on the CF surface after calcined at 500 °C are tight and uniform, and the deposition quality is much better than that of the untreated ones. In terms of performance, compared with the original CF as the negative electrode of the zinc-bromine battery, operating at a current density of 40 mA cm-2, the coulombic efficiency increased from 91.8% to 99.3%, and the energy efficiency increased from 71.8% to 81.9%.

The renewable energy can be stored in the form of compressed air inside the pile foundation with a hollowed section. The pile foundation should resist complex combined actions including structural loads, soil effects, and pressures induced from the compressed air, and thus it requires a careful analysis and design considerations to secure a sufficient structural safety. This paper presents analytical investigation results on the structural responses of the energy piles under these combined loadings. The pile foundations were designed based on the current design practices for various building geometries including the number of stories and column spacing. The magnitude of air pressure was determined from the thermodynamic cycles for the available renewable energy for storage considering building and pile foundation geometries. Finite element analyses were conducted using an elastic 3D model to determine critical tensile stresses of the pile foundation. These critical tensile stresses were used to identify required reinforcement in the pile section. On this basis, several nonlinear finite element analyses were then conducted using inelastic constitutive models of materials to investigate the crack patterns of the hollowed concrete section. Recommendations were finally presented for proper practical designs of the pile foundation serving as the renewable energy storage medium. © 2018, The Author(s).","compressed air; pile foundation; reinforced concrete; renewable energy storage; structural responses","Compressed air; Compressed air energy storage; Finite element method; Pile foundations; Pressure vessels; Reinforced concrete; Storage (materials); Structural design; Tensile stress; Thermodynamic properties; Analytical investigations; Design considerations; Multi-disciplinary research; Non-linear finite-element analysis; Renewable energies; Renewable energy storages; Structural response; Thermodynamic cycle; Piles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057837226

The composition of the glass-ceramics was BTBMN-x wt.% BNN (x=0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15; abbreviated as BG). The sintering characteristics, phase structure, microstructure, dielectric properties and energy storage properties were systematically investigated. The sintering temperature of BTBMN ceramics was greatly reduced by the addition of BNN glass. The second-phase BaTi(BO3)2 was observed in the BG system until the glass content reached 15wt.%. The addition of BNN glass significantly reduces the grain size of BTBMN ceramics. With the increase of BNN glass content, dielectric constant of BG glass-ceramics at 1kHz gradually decreased, the maximum dielectric constant (μm) of BG glass-ceramics gradually decreased, while the temperature corresponding to the maximum dielectric constant (Tm) increased, the ferroelectric relaxation behavior decreased and the temperature stability of the dielectric constant gradually improved. As the BNN glass content increased, the breakdown electric field strength (BDS) of BG glass-ceramics increased first and then decreased, and the polarization values reduced gradually, while the trend of energy storage performance is similar to BDS. When the BNN glass content was 3wt.%, the energy storage properties of the BG glass-ceramics were optimal, and a recoverable energy storage density (Wrec) of 1.26J/cm3 and an energy storage efficiency (ν) of 80.9% were obtained at the electric field strength of 220kV/cm.

Here, we fabricated a novel P(VDF-HFP)-based capacitor with surface-modified NBT-xST (x=0, 0.10, 0.26) whiskers, denoted as Dop@NBT-xST/P(VDF-HFP). The influences of ST content, fillers' volume fraction and electric field on the dielectric properties and energy-storage performance of the composites were investigated systematically. The results show that the dielectric constant monotonously increased with the increase of ST content and fillers' volume fraction. The composite containing 10.0 vol% NBT-0.26ST whiskers possessed a dielectric constant of 39 at 1kHz, which was 5.6 times higher than that of pure P(VDF-HFP). It was noticed that the D-E loops of the composites became thinner and thinner with the increase of ST content. Due to the reduced remnant polarization, the composite with 5.0 vol% NBT-0.26ST whiskers achieved a high energy density of 6.18J/cm3 and energy efficiency of approximately 57% at a relatively low electric field of 200kV/mm.

however, the detailed molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Moreover, the factor(s) that determines the Wnt/β-catenin output level during adipogenesis is also not completely defined. In this study, we showed that Pygo2 exhibited a declined expression pattern during adipocyte differentiation, resulting in an attenuated Wnt/β-catenin output level. The mechanism study indicated that Pygo2 inhibition led to the downregulation of Axin2, a constitutive Wnt target, in the cytoplasm. Consequently, Axin2-bound GSK3β was released and translocated into the nucleus to phosphorylate C/EBPβ and Snail, resulting in an increase in the DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ and decreased protein stability of Snail, which subsequently activated the expression of C/EBPa and PPARγ. Consistent with this, embryonic fibroblasts from Pygo22/2 mice exhibited spontaneous adipocyte differentiation, and adipocyte precursor-specific Pygo2-deficient mice exhibited increased adiposity with decreased energy expenditure. We further showed impaired glucose tolerance and decreased systemic insulin sensitivity in Pygo2-deficient mice. Our study revealed an association between Pygo2 function and obesity or diabetes. © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

This study investigates sputter-coated thin V2O5 shells on vertically aligned carbon nanofiber (VACNF) arrays as a novel three-dimensional (3D) core-shell material for SIB cathodes. SEM, TEM, XRD and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the as-deposited V2O5 shell has a highly disordered bilayered V2O5 ⋅ nH2O structure with a large interlayer spacing of 11.0 Å, which can accommodate Na+ ions better than orthorhombic α-V2O5 crystals. This hydrated metastable structure has been systematically characterized for Na+ storage. A high initial insertion capacity of 277 mAh g−1 can be achieved at a current density of 250 mA g−1 in the potential window of 4.0–1.0 V (vs Na/Na+). Using higher charge-discharge rate or narrower potential windows, the electrode becomes more reversible, able to reach a coulombic efficiency of ∼99 %. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements indicate that the Na+ storage is dominated by a large pseudocapacitive contribution due to fast surface reactions, which facilitates the improved stability and high power density. Such highly disordered bilayered V2O5 ⋅ nH2O material in the 3D core-shell architecture provides new insights for developing future SIB materials. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Subsequently, the BT particles with an organic double-shell structure is compound to a dielectric poly (vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-CTFE)), and the flexible 0–3P(VDF-CTFE)/BT@HBP@PDA-Ag nanocomposites films with ∼20 μm in thickness are obtained using spin-casting method.

However, the high cost of its components such as Pt electrocatalyst is a major challenge. Heteroatom doped carbon nano-materials show potential applications for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) which can be used for fuel cells and may be promising replacement of Pt catalyst. Recently, we implemented a facile method for preparing partially nitrogen functionalized graphene oxide (PNG) nano-sheets. To achieve better nitrogen functionalization, graphene oxide was annealed in ammonia solution for 12 h at 220 oC. The electrochemical measurement data show that the PNG synthesized in NH3 environment possesses good electrocatalytic activities for ORR. In addition, we identified a physical method for the first time to drive the randomly oriented graphene nano-sheets to be aligned parallel to the surface of electrode for electrocatalytic application by using an AC electric field. An additional effect of the applied electric field is the induction of a polarization on PNG nano-sheets that create a dielectrophoresis phenomenon. The poling effect of the electric field on the sample shows much improved electrocatalytic performance. The enhanced catalysis can be used for ORR as an important reaction in fuel cells.

The metabolic network comprised 2514 reactions distributed among nine intracellular compartments and the extracellular space. The metabolic network included all the key biochemical pathways for synthesis and metabolism of starch and triacylglycerols (TAGs). Under light and nitrogen limitation, the model simulated the accumulation of the energy-rich compounds (TAGs and starch) in the cell. In the dark, the model could simulate cell growth and maintenance on stored compounds. The model-predicted consumption rates of storage compounds (starch or TAGs) to enable growth in the dark, were found to be greater than the rates of synthesis under light. This implied utilization of the storage compounds for cell maintenance in the dark. Under constant illumination, the simulations of cell growth and intracellular starch content agreed closely with independent experimental data. In other simulations, compared with the case without photorespiration, light uptake rate increased 1.04-fold when the ratio of the rates of oxygenation and carboxylation (Rubisco) was 0.1. Although extensive experimental work exists on culture and physiology of microalgae, it does not allow quantitative predictions of the influence of dark metabolism on the productivity of metabolites to be made. This limitation is overcome using the present model. A metabolic network model of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is shown to simulate growth and synthesis of energy-rich compounds (triacylglycerols and starch) under light.

In this paper, we primarily focus on improving our understanding of the geology, including lithofacies and depositional environment, of Nugget Sandstone-a potential carbon storage reservoir, by integrating results from three different techniques including seismic attributes, seismic inversion, and petrophysical modeling. The Nugget Sandstone formation is primarily an eolian sandstone, deposited in the early Jurassic and is present throughout southwestern Wyoming. Seismic attribute analysis indicates the presence of NW-SE trending elongated geological features in the Nugget Sandstone interval. Based on our seismic and well log analyses, we interpret these features to be eolian sand dunes, which is consistent with the previous publications indicating a general NE-SW paleo-wind direction at the time of the deposition of Nugget Sandstone and other equivalent formations in Wyoming and Utah. The petrophysical analysis indicates that the Nugget Formation is mostly composed of quartz; however, clay and evaporites such as anhydrite and halite are also present. The acoustic impedance, derived from well logs, indicates that high porosity dunal sandstones correspond to low impedance values whereas interdunal evaporites are characterized by high impedance values. Combined analysis of seismic attribute coherence and inverted P-impedance discriminates the dunal and interdunal deposits in 3D seismic data volume; the low coherence defines the extent of low impedance dunal deposits. Detailed analysis of the curvature attribute from the seismic data indicates a dominant paleo-wind direction of approximately N225°. © 2018","3D Seismic; Nugget Sandstone; Paleowind direction; Seismic attributes","Deposits; Digital storage; Forestry; Geology; Geophysical prospecting; Sandstone; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Sodium chloride; Well logging; 3D seismic; Depositional environment; Paleowind direction; Petrophysical analysis; Seismic attribute analysis; Seismic attributes; Three different techniques; US Department of Energy; Acoustic impedance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054168146

Maximizing the economic benefits of CSP systems requires deliberate selection of the timing of thermal energy dispatch to coincide with high-price or high-value periods. The performance and value of CSP systems have traditionally been evaluated using two distinct approaches: (1) production cost models (PCMs), which optimize commitment and dispatch schedules for an entire fleet of generators to minimize the cost of satisfying electricity demand; and (2) price-taker (PT) models, which optimize dispatch of the CSP system against historical or forecasted electricity prices to maximize revenue available to the CSP operator. The PCM approach is, in principle, superior because of the ability to capture system-level details such as transmission pathways and associated constraints, and feedback between CSP dispatch schedules and operation of other generators. The computationally simpler PT technique cannot explicitly address these concerns, but the comparative reduction in solution time is attractive for sensitivity analysis and rigorous optimization of CSP plant design and operation. In this work, we directly compare the dispatch profiles, net revenue, and operational value of CSP systems using implementations of each technique to assess how closely the solutions from the PT technique can approach those from the PCM for a specific market scenario. The PT implementation produced characteristically similar dispatch profiles as the PCM for both a large solar-multiple configuration and a small solar-multiple peaking configuration, while requiring only 1% of the computational time of the PCM. In addition, dispatching the CSP plant according to the self-scheduled PT solution—as opposed to the system-optimized PCM solution—only reduced the total CSP operational value by 1–5%, with consistent trends across CSP configurations and locations. This analysis validates the ability of the PT approach to substantially capture the economic benefits of CSP systems when pricing profiles are available, and indicates that the PT approach is suitable for initial design and optimization of CSP technologies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrating solar power; Dispatch optimization; Grid integration; Thermal energy storage","Constraint satisfaction problems; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric load dispatching; Heat storage; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Thermal energy; Computational time; Concentrating solar power; Concentrating solar power plant; Electricity demands; Electricity prices; Grid integration; Production cost model; Renewable resource; Costs; comparative study; computer simulation; cost analysis; demand analysis; electrical power; energy storage; model validation; optimization; performance assessment; power plant; production cost; sensitivity analysis; smart grid; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053755299

This paper analyzed the economic and environmental impacts of four different biomass storage systems for woodchips (Outdoor-open, Outdoor-tarped, Indoor, and Silo) and two systems for pellets (Indoor and Silo). Storage cost includes the costs for handling (including ventilation in case of silo storage), infrastructure investment, and dry matter loss (DML) for each system. The estimation of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions includes the fugitive emissions from storage piles and emissions due to electricity and fuel consumption for each system. Among four storage systems, the outdoor-tarped ($15.0 ODMT−1, ODMT: Oven Dry Metric Ton) and silo ($5.8 ODMT−1) storage were the least-cost options for woodchips and pellets respectively. However, silo-storage could be the most promising option for storing woodchips ($5.8 ODMT−1) and pellets ($2.3 ODMT−1), if it is used for short-term (two months) and frequently (at least six times) in a year. The total GHG emissions for six-month storage were 2.8–11.8 kgCO2e ODMT−1 for woodchips and 8.6–42.0 kgCO2e ODMT−1 for pellets. During Outdoor-open storage, the lower heating value of woodchips could drop to 37% due to increased dry-matter loss (DML) and moisture content. The initial moisture content, bulk density, DML, and resource required during handling were the most sensitive parameters influenced the storage performances of both woodchips and pellets. This study has demonstrated that a combination of different storage options along the supply chain could reduce the total biomass storage cost for a biorefinery or power plant. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Pellets; Storage methods; Techno-economic analysis; Woodchips","Biomass; Calorific value; Costs; Economic analysis; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Moisture; Moisture determination; Ore pellets; Pelletizing; Refining; Supply chains; Bio-energy; Biomass supply chain; Dry matter loss (DML); Infrastructure investment; Initial Moisture Content; Lower heating value; Techno- economic analysis; Woodchips; Gas fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053076144

Strategic development of transportation, storage, and conversion infrastructure to enable this expansion requires detailed information on patterns and drivers of waste biomass production, quality, and geography that are currently lacking. This analysis contributes new geographic and temporal data on biomass residue availability for the state of California. Biomass residues are characterized for the year 2014 at the county- and month-scales for the agriculture, municipal, and forestry sectors in California, with values collected or estimated from numerous publications, databases, industry surveys, and methodologies. We present methods for developing supply scenarios out to the year 2050 that reflect anticipated changes in key environmental, market, and policy drivers. Our results suggest that biomass residue production could grow 16% by 2050 to 71 million tonnes of dry-matter per year, and that the co-processing of diverse high-moisture residue sources and storage of seasonally available low-moisture residues is needed to ensure adequate steady supply to bioenergy and composting facilities.

Unfortunately, there is no single EMS that can be implemented to improve energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease fuel usage, minimize the amount of imported energy from the main grid, and increase the use of renewable energy for all micro-grids at the same time. Therefore, the main concern of this paper is to investigate the impact of micro-grid's topologies on developing an efficient micro-grid's EMS and an optimization model using Genetic Algorithm (GA) that aim to optimally select the objective function that suits each individual micro-grid's topology. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis is carried out taking into consideration three grid-connected micro-grids topologies; networks, loads profiles, embedded dispatchaple (biomass) and non-dispatchaple (PV) Distributed Generation (DG), storages elements, switching capacitors, and demand response. Three case studies (objective functions) are minimized; micro-grid's energy loss, imported energy from the main grid, and CO2 emissions, to select the most optimal objective function that suits each individual micro-grid topology.

Different state of charge (SoC) among various battery energy storage units (BESU) during operation will reduce batteries’ service life. A hierarchical distributed control method is proposed in this paper for SoC balancing and power control according to dispatching center requirement in DBESS. A consensus algorithm with pinning node is employed to allocate power among BESUs in the secondary control whereas in the primary control, the local controller of BESU adjusts output power according to the reference power from secondary control. Part of BESUs are selected to be pinning node for accepting command from dispatching center while other BESUs as following nodes which exchange output power and SoC information with the adjacent nodes through communication network. After calculating reference power of each BESU by adopting consensus algorithm, the power sharing in DBESS is achieved according to their respective SoC of BESUs.

To address the challenges of water scarcity and growing energy demand, the water–energy nexus of Shaanxi is investigated in this paper by input–output analysis (IOA). The findings indicate that water and energy resources are interdependent on each other. It is observed that agricultural water use intensity is 0.28 m3 per USD and industrial water use intensity is at the lowest level of 0.013 m3. Therefore, there is a huge water saving potential in the agricultural sector. Owing to the high energy consumption in agricultural irrigation, reducing irrigation water is of benefit both for water saving and energy conservation in the agricultural sector. Meanwhile, the industrial sector accounts for 63.8% of total energy consumption in Shaanxi, and it is urgent to change the economic structure to service-based rather than agricultural or industrial activities. It is believed that integrated strategies and planning are more favored in the future in Shaanxi. Water use limitation, energy mix adjustment and pricing mechanisms should be involved in water and energy policy formulation. Remarkably, because of being low carbon and water saving, the natural gas industry will become increasingly promising in the following decades. © IWA Publishing 2018.","Input-output analysis (IOA); Integrated strategies; Shaanxi; Synergistic effects; Water–energy nexus","Economics; Energy policy; Energy resources; Gas industry; Irrigation; Water conservation; Water resources; Water supply; Agricultural irrigation; High energy consumption; Input output analysis; Integrated strategy; Shaanxi; Synergistic effect; Total energy consumption; Water-saving potentials; Energy utilization; carbon; coal; fuel oil; gasoline; kerosene; natural gas; petroleum; water; demand analysis; economic structure; energy conservation; energy policy; fuel consumption; gas industry; input-output analysis; price dynamics; water storage; water use; Article; China; controlled study; energy conservation; energy resource; energy yield; hydropower; irrigation (agriculture); water availability; China; Shaanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050333873

One such platform is the IBM TrueNorth neurosynaptic system. Recently, TrueNorth compatible representation learning algorithms have emerged, achieving close to the state-of-the-art performance in various data sets. However, its application in temporal sequence processing models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), is still only at the proof of concept level. There is an inherent difficulty in capturing temporal dynamics of an RNN using spiking neurons, which is only exasperated by the hardware constraints in connectivity and synaptic weight resolution. This paper presents a design flow that overcomes these difficulties and maps a special case of recurrent networks called long short-term memory (LSTM) onto a spike-based platform. The framework utilizes various approximation techniques, such as activation discretization, weight quantization, and scaling and rounding, spiking neural circuits that implement the complex gating mechanisms, and a store-and-release technique to enable neuron synchronization and faithful storage. While the presented techniques can be applied to map LSTM to any spiking neural network (SNN) simulator/emulator, here we choose the TrueNorth chip as the target platform by adhering to its hardware constraints. Three LSTM applications, parity check, extended Reber grammar, and question classification, are evaluated. The tradeoffs among accuracy, performance, and energy tradeoffs achieved on TrueNorth are demonstrated. This is compared with the performance on an SNN platform without hardware constraints, which represents the upper bound of the achievable accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.","Long short-term memory; Neuromorphic hardware; Recurrent neural networks; Spiking neural networks","Brain; Commerce; Computation theory; Computer architecture; Computer hardware; Distributed computer systems; Energy efficiency; Hardware; Intelligent agents; Logic gates; Neurons; Recurrent neural networks; Synchronization; Timing circuits; Approximation techniques; Biological neural networks; Neuromorphic hardwares; Question classification; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Spiking neural network(SNN); Spiking neural networks; State-of-the-art performance; Long short-term memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049952757

Technological advancements have enabled offshore structures to pump the cold water lying at 1000 m depth in the seawater column to the surface, and through the temperature difference set up with the warm surface layer, drives a turbine and generates electricity. In this study, a model has been developed to compute the temperature difference between the deep (1000 m) and surface (20 m) seawater layers around Mauritius. An algorithm has been implemented to determine the net power generated from a proposed OTEC power plant, acquired through the processing of sea surface temperature satellite images, at a resolution of 1 km. The spatial and temporal variations of the net power generated has been observed by splitting the annual data into four monsoonal time frames. Results show that the south-western region of Mauritius possesses high OTEC resources, with annual mean daily net power generation capacity of about 95 MW, representing about 20% of the peak power demand of the island. Moreover, the bathymetry of the southern region is propitious due to deep cold water availability at a proximity of less than 5km from the coastline. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the OTEC system are found to be 1.9 and 22.8%, respectively.

Firstly, a reliable evaluation model of trust perception is presented, which can estimate the node’s trust value derived from its behavior to identify or isolate the malicious nodes effectively. The penalty function and regulator function are applied to reflect the effect of state changes on the trust value according to the node’s behavior in the process of the communication.

However, while highly efficient accelerators on convolutional DNNs (Conv-DNNs) have been developed, less progress has been made with regards to fully-connected DNNs. Based on analysis of bit-level SRAM errors, we propose memory adaptive training with in-situ canaries (MATIC), a methodology that enables aggressive voltage scaling of accelerator weight memories to improve the energy-efficiency of DNN accelerators. To enable accurate operation with voltage overscaling, MATIC combines characteristics of SRAM bit failures with the error resilience of neural networks in a memory-adaptive training (MAT) process. Furthermore, PVT-related voltage margins are eliminated using bit-cells from synaptic weights as in-situ canaries to track runtime environmental variation. Demonstrated on a low-power DNN accelerator fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, MATIC enables up to energy reduction versus the nominal voltage, or application error reduction. We also perform a simulation study that extends MAT to Conv-DNNs, and characterize the accuracy impact of bit failure statistics. Finally, we develop a weight refinement algorithm to improve the performance of MAT, and show that it improves absolute accuracy by 0.8-1.3% or reduces training time by 5. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","deep learning; machine learning acceleration; Neural networks; SRAM; voltage scaling","Acceleration; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Energy efficiency; Errors; Static random access storage; Voltage scaling; Absolute accuracy; Aggressive voltage scaling; Environmental variations; Failure statistics; Hardware accelerators; Refinement algorithms; Simulation studies; Voltage overscaling; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048197466

Despite their success, they suffer from high energy requirements. In recent years, the inherent error resiliency of DNNs has been exploited by introducing approximations at either the algorithmic or the hardware levels (individually) to obtain energy savings while incurring tolerable accuracy degradation. However, there is a need for investigating the overall energy-accuracy trade-offs arising from the introduction of approximations at different levels in complex DNNs. We perform a comprehensive analysis to determine the effectiveness of cross-layer approximations for the energy-efficient realization of large-scale DNNs. The approximations considered are as follows: 1) use of lower complexity networks (containing lesser number of layers and/or neurons per layer); 2) pruning of synaptic weights; 3) approximate multiplication operation in the neuronal multiply-and-accumulate computation; and 4) approximate write/read operations to/from the synaptic memory.

Nonvolatile logic (NVL) addresses the latter by saving the system state in flipflops enhanced with spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel junctions (STT-MTJs) as the nonvolatile storage devices. Manufacturing variations in the STT-MTJs and in CMOS transistors significantly reduce yield, leading to overdesign and high-energy consumption. A detailed analysis of the design tradeoffs in the driver circuitry for performing backup and restore, and a novel method to design the energy optimal driver for a given yield is presented. Next, efficient designs of two nonvolatile flip-flop (NVFF) circuits are presented, in which the backup time is determined on a per-chip basis, resulting in minimizing the energy wastage and satisfying the yield constraint. To achieve a yield of 98%, the conventional approach would have to expend nearly 5 × more energy than the minimum required, whereas the proposed tunable approach expends only 26% more energy than the minimum. Also included are the energy consumption of the proposed NVFF designs when used in two larger function blocks.

In the new architecture, patterns are stored as resistive states of emerging nonvolatile memory nanodevices, while the analyzed data are streamed via CMOS subsystem. The main improvements over prior work offered by the proposed circuits are increased nanodevice utilization and, as a result, substantially higher throughput, which is demonstrated by a detailed analysis of the implementation of pattern matching task on the new architecture. For example, our estimates show that the proposed CMOL FPGA circuits based on the 22-nm CMOS technology and one crossbar layer with 22-nm nanowire half-pitch allows up to 12.5% average nanodevice utilization, i.e., the fraction of the devices turned to the high conductive state, as compared to a typical 0.1% of the original CMOL FPGA circuits. This in turn enables throughput close to 7.1 × 1016cm2 at 1 fJ/bit energy efficiency, for matching of 107 250-bit patterns stored locally on a 1 cm2 chip. These numbers are at least 2 orders of magnitude better throughput as compared to that of other state-of-the-art FPGA methods, and begin to approach ternary content-addressable memory-like performance at similar CMOS technology nodes. More generally, we argue that the proposed concept combines the versatility of reconfigurable architectures and density of the associative memories.

The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has recently announced 'the seven giants of statistical data analysis' in which data clustering plays a central role. This report also emphasizes that more scalable solutions are required to enable time and space clustering for the future large-scale data analyses. As a result, hardware and software innovations that can significantly improve energy efficiency and performance of the data clustering techniques are necessary to make the future large-scale data analysis practical. This paper proposes a novel mechanism for computing bit-serial medians within resistive RAM arrays with no need to read out the operands from memory cells. We propose a novel four-transistor, four-memristor memory cell that enables in situ median computation within the data arrays. (If necessary, the proposed cell could be used as four ordinary one-transistor, one-memristor memory cells to store four bits of information.)

Thermally driven structural phase transitions are employed in phase-change memory to achieve lower programming voltages and potentially lower energy consumption than mainstream nonvolatile memory technologies. However, the waste heat generated by such thermal mechanisms is often not optimized, and could present a limiting factor to widespread use. The potential for electrostatically driven structural phase transitions has recently been predicted and subsequently reported in some two-dimensional materials, providing an athermal mechanism to dynamically control properties of these materials in a nonvolatile fashion while achieving potentially lower energy consumption. In this work, we employ DFT-based calculations to make theoretical comparisons of the energy required to drive electrostatically-induced and thermally-induced phase transitions. Determining theoretical limits in monolayer MoTe2 and thin films of Ge2Sb2Te5, we find that the energy consumption per unit volume of the electrostatically driven phase transition in monolayer MoTe2 at room temperature is 9% of the adiabatic lower limit of the thermally driven phase transition in Ge2Sb2Te5. Furthermore, experimentally reported phase change energy consumption of Ge2Sb2Te5 is 100-10,000 times larger than the adiabatic lower limit due to waste heat flow out of the material, leaving the possibility for energy consumption in monolayer MoTe2-based devices to be orders of magnitude smaller than Ge2Sb2Te5-based devices. © 2018 The Author(s).",,"Antimony compounds; Energy utilization; Germanium compounds; Molybdenum compounds; Monolayers; Phase change memory; Tellurium compounds; Virtual storage; Waste heat; Athermal mechanism; Electrostatically driven; Low energy consumption; Non-volatile memory technology; Orders of magnitude; Programming voltage; Structural phase transition; Two-dimensional materials; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042229863

This process is assumed lossless. We measure COSS losses from 5-35 MHz sine, square, and Class- Φ2 waveshapes in enhancement-mode and cascode devices, and find that losses are present in all tested devices, equal or greater than conduction losses at MHz frequencies, and exponentially increasing with V/dt.

In this paper, multiple energy storage mechanisms are analyzed on an order-of-magnitude basis to identify potential alternatives for conventional passive components, especially magnetics, which have frequency-dependent power losses. The high energy density of mechanical storage methods provides an attractive alternative to the widely used LC resonance. Piezoelectric transduction is explored, and the performance of a piezoelectric resonator is compared to that of an LC resonator in terms of efficiency and power handling capabilities in a resonant switched-capacitor-type circuit. The analysis provides a basis for exploring potential passive energy storage component technologies and comparing their performance limits with those of electromagnetic passive components. The analysis shows that both electromagnetic and mechanical resonance, in the ideal scenarios, can offer much better performance than do passive component technologies in use today.

It has been found that the bulb temperature as well as the heating efficiency of the evacuated tube heat pipe has increased in case of inserting oil in the evacuated tube and replacing the finned surface with foamed copper. Also, the thermal oil acts as a heat storage. © 2017 Ain Shams University","Energy storage; Evacuated tube; Heat pipe","Energy storage; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Tubes (components); Bulb temperature; Evacuated tubes; Finned surface; Foamed coppers; Foamed metals; Heating efficiencies; Inner surfaces; Rate of heat transfer; Heat pipes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031120115

The enthalpy-porosity theory was utilised to simulate the phase transition of the PCM, and the simulations then used to mimic the charging and discharging of thermal energy storage of optimum length at different heat transfer fluid flow rates.

Traditionally, the lime is burnt and CaO, traditionally called burnt lime or fire lime is produced. Burnt lime is used as raw materials for construction and chemical industry. Adding water to CaO changes the burnt lime to become Ca (OH)2, which has higher price than the burnt lime, and produces heat that can be used as chemoreaction reactant for drying process. The special drying natures of CaO will be synergized during the chemoreaction drying process in the closed containers containing the burnt lime reactant and materials to be dried. The drying process in chemoreaction become special because the drying is held at slightly above room temperature, which is about 35°C. The resulting dry product can reach the water level 2 - 4 %; hence the product will be durable with very high quality. The weakness in the conduction of the chemoreaction drying process can be resolved by the use of burnt lime doubled in quantity and the drying process is compensated with longer time without depending on availability of electrical energy. Chemoreaction drying involves the process of evaporation of water in the material to be dried and heat production by the burnt lime used. The advantages of chemoreaction drying technology can be applied to produce many types of dried high quality products, without losing the expensive essential oil. Chemoreaction drying has been used to drying up seeds (corn, soybean, peanut, red chili) to produce quality seeds with very high growing power. Chemoreaction drying was also used to dry brem, a traditional fermented cake, that become highly hygroscopic sheets with 10 - 15 % water content with very good quality. The drying experiment was also be done on yeast (Saccharomyces serevisiae) suspension to obtain dried form for storage culture. with cell viability of 109/ml and in form of fine flour yeast culture. The experiments on pepper at drying temperature 29-30°C produce dry pepper with 4 - 8% moisture. The most important role of the chemoreaction drying process is able to maintain the essential oil with the loss only 1.4 %. The quality of nutmeg by chemoreaction drying was much higher, than the sun dryed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agriculture; Chemical industry; Essential oils; Hydrated lime; Lime; Water levels; Yeast; Cell viability; Drying process; Drying technology; Drying temperature; Electrical energy; Heat production; High-quality products; Yeast culture; Drying",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058052788

The positive role of the friction has been taken into consideration, namely to help drive the machinery and to properly disintegrate the soil, as well as the negative role of friction, which generate wear of working tools, high energy consumption and pollution [1, 2]. It is proposed to give a more accurate estimate of the weight of terms expressing the friction, implicitly producing wear, in the formula of the traction force required to pull the agricultural machine. Starting from this information, it is proposed a description of the evolution of wear depending of time, or function of the amount of work performed, as well as criteria for the decision to replace the working tools as worn out. Since 1960, a series of mathematical formulas describing the wear phenomenon have appeared in the literature [1]. The authors [1] identified 182 equations describing the wear phenomenon in its various forms. In this paper we have proposed a mathematical model that is specific to ploughing tools and we attempts to estimate a possible duration of exploitation. The detailed calculation of the possibility of identifying some mathematical models' constants, using experimental data, shows that structural changes are sometimes required. The structural changes of some formulas, made in accordance with other research results in this field, can highlight components of the traction resistance forces useful in detail calculations of some phenomena that accompany the general process being pursued. The fact that the model for estimating the wear of the working tools of the soil processing machinery can well estimate experimental facts encourages the further development of the model by introducing more parameters defining the geometry of the working tools. This opens the way of optimizing the work tools of the machines that work in and with the soil in general. The mathematical model of plough chisel wear proposed also provides a useful tool for determining the end use at which the work tool must be changed. This value can be, for example, that distance xlim, at which the pointed side of the chisels is completely worn out. For the concrete case under consideration, for example, this value is: xlim = 863 km, working distance. © 2018 Web Portal IOP.

Nevertheless, the practical application of MgH2 is hindered by its poor dehydrogenation ability and cycling stability. Herein, the influences and mechanisms of thin pristine magnesium oxide (MgO) and transition metals (TM) dissolved Mg(TM)O layers (TM = Ti, V, Nb, Fe, Co, Ni) on hydrogen desorption and reversible cycling properties of MgH2 were investigated using first-principles calculations method. The results demonstrate that either thin pristine MgO or Mg(TM)O layer weakens the Mg–H bond strength, leading to the decreased structural stability and hydrogen desorption energy of MgH2. Among them, the Mg(Nb)O layer exhibits the most pronounced destabilization effect on MgH2. Moreover, the Mg(Nb)O layer presents a long-acting confinement effect on MgH2 due to the stronger interfacial bonding strength of Mg(Nb)O/MgH2 and the lower brittleness of Mg(Nb)O itself. Further analyses of electronic structures indicate that these thin oxide layers coating on MgH2 surface reduce the bonding electron number of MgH2, which essentially accounts for the weakened Mg–H bond strength and enhanced hydrogen desorption properties of modified MgH2 systems. These findings provide a new avenue for enhancing the hydrogen desorption and reversible cycling properties of MgH2 by designing and adding suitable MgO based oxides with high catalytic activity and low brittleness. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Electronic structure; First-principles calculations; Hydrogen storage properties; Magnesium hydride; Magnesium oxide","Bond strength (materials); Brittleness; Calculations; Catalyst activity; Desorption; Electronic structure; Fracture mechanics; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Magnesia; Plasticity; Stability; Titanium oxides; Transition metals; Confinement effects; Destabilization effects; First-principles calculation; Hydrogen desorption; Hydrogen storage properties; Interfacial bonding strength; Magnesium hydride; Structural stabilities; Niobium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055505911

Cobalt-containing NPs are particularly important, where their widespread use raises questions about the relationship between composition, structure, and potential for environmental impacts. To address this gap, we investigated the effects of lithiated metal oxide and phosphate NPs on rainbow trout gill epithelial cells, a model for environmental exposure. Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) NPs significantly reduced cell viability at10 µg/mL, while a 10-fold higher concentration of lithiated cobalt hydroxyphosphate (LCP) NPs was required to significantly reduce viability. Exposure to Li + and Co 2+ alone, at concentrations relevant to ion released from the NPs, did not reduce cell viability and minimally impacted reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Both LCO- and LCP-NPs were found within membrane-bound organelles. However, only LCP-NPs underwent rapid and complete dissolution in artificial lysosomal fluid. Unlike LCP-NPs, LCO-NPs significantly increased intracellular ROS, could be found within abnormal multilamellar bodies, and induced formation of intracellular vacuoles. Increased p53 gene expression, measured in individual cells, was observed at sub-toxic concentrations of both LCO- and LCP-NPs, implicating both in inductions of cellular damage and stress at concentrations approaching predicted environmental levels. Our results implicate the intact NP, not the dissolved ions, in the observed adverse effects and show that LCO-NPs significantly impact cell viability accompanied by increase in intracellular ROS and formation of organelles indicative of cell stress, while LCP-NPs have minimal adverse effects, possibly due to their rapid dissolution in acidic organelles. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Here, a robust yet flexible membrane with enhanced selectivity for nonaqueous RFBs is designed via in situ synthesis of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in a porous polymeric membrane (Celgard) with a gradient density. The crossover of active species is mitigated by the reduced effective pore size while high ionic conductivity is maintained, which is attributed to the 3D channel structure of MOFs and their gradient distribution in the membrane. A Li/ferrocene RFB with the MOF-imbedded membrane delivers an excellent high-rate capability and enhanced cycling stability. The discharge capacity reaches as high as ≈94% of theoretical value at a current density of 4 mA cm−2, and maintains 76% even at 12 mA cm−2. Moreover, a much slower capacity decay rate is achieved (0.09% per cycle over 300 cycles) by using the composite membrane compared with the pristine Celgard membrane (0.24% per cycle). The demonstrated strategy provides new insight into rational design and fabrication of size-sieving separators for RFBs and can promote further research of MOFs' capability in energy storage. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here we proposed a concept of integration of extraction-separation and materials-preparation to further reduce the materials’ cost. The power of this concept was demonstrated by the large-scale room-temperature synthesis (150 g per batch) of multi-shelled Na3(VOPO4)2F microspheres based on in situ generated bubbles as soft templates. The as-prepared Na3(VOPO4)2F shows superior rate capability with discharge capacity of 81 mAh g−1 at 15 C current rate and capacity retention of 70% after 3,000 cycles. Ex situ UV-vis was first employed to characterize the variation of oxidation state for vanadium during the charging and discharging process.

Therefore, there is a stringent need to expand the synthetic methods, shifting from high-temperature synthetic routes toward low-temperature green process at comparably low temperature. The proposed concept (integration of extraction-separation and materials-preparation) and room-temperature strategy in this work can significantly decrease the manufacturing cost of the electrode materials. It can be extended to synthesize other compounds and can be utilized to recycle spent batteries. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.To save energy and decrease cost, it is essential to explore a low-temperature green process for the synthesis of electrode materials.

We evaluate nearly 1,000 cases covering varying CO2 limits, technological uncertainties, and geographic differences in demand and renewable resource potential. Availability of firm low-carbon technologies, including nuclear, natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration, and bioenergy, reduces electricity costs by 10%–62% across fully decarbonized cases. Below 50 gCO2/kWh, these resources lower costs in the vast majority of cases. Additionally, as emissions limits decrease, installed capacity of several resources changes non-monotonically. This underscores the need to evaluate near-term policy and investment decisions based on contributions to long-term decarbonization rather than interim goals. Installed capacity for all resources is also strongly affected by uncertain technology parameters. This emphasizes the importance of a broad research portfolio and flexible policy support that expands rather than constrains future options. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.Mitigating climate change while fueling economic growth requires decarbonizing the electricity sector at reasonable cost. Some strategies focus on wind and solar energy, supported by energy storage and demand flexibility. Others also harness “firm” low-carbon resources such as nuclear, reservoir hydro, geothermal, bioenergy, and fossil plants capturing CO2. This paper presents a comprehensive techno-economic evaluation of two pathways: one reliant on wind, solar, and batteries, and another also including firm low-carbon options (nuclear, bioenergy, and natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration). Across all cases, the least-cost strategy to decarbonize electricity includes one or more firm low-carbon resources. Without these resources, electricity costs rise rapidly as CO2 limits approach zero. Batteries and demand flexibility do not substitute for firm resources.

Two theories, Rentier State, and Obsolescing Bargaining, are applied to the cases of multinational and artisanal cobalt mining operations in the former Katanga region. Risks between the DRC government and multinational cobalt mining companies are compared to the risks present in artisanal cobalt mining. This paper explores how the decision to include or exclude Congolese, artisanal cobalt from supply chains involves broader questions of bargaining power, political stability, and resource dependency. This paper expands consideration to explore how the inclusion of artisanal cobalt in the supply chain might impact political stability and corruption in the DRC, rather than focusing on how Western or Chinese purchasers of electrified vehicles, for example, might perceive the suitability of the product's supply chain. By relating artisanal cobalt mining to multinational mining companies and the broader political issues present in the DRC, decision-makers can better consider current and historical outcomes as part of a broader political-economy that includes both artisanal and multinational mining. Furthermore, this paper hopes to provide a robust argument for the transparent and intentional inclusion of artisanal cobalt in electrified vehicle supply chains to make the transition to low-carbon transportation more sustainable through improvements to measures of social sustainability in the DRC. © 2018 Zeuner.","ASM; Cobalt; DRC; Electric vehicle; Obsolescing bargain; Political economy; Rentier state; Responsible sourcing","Decision making; Electric vehicles; Lithium-ion batteries; Supply chains; Vehicles; Democratic Republic of Congo; Distributed energy systems; Low carbon transportations; Obsolescing bargain; Political economy; Rechargeable lithium ion battery; Rentier state; Responsible sourcing; Cobalt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057252020

In this study, the Au cocatalyst is demonstrated to be highly favorable for electron transfer from BiVO4 to [Fe(CN)6]3−, and Au and CoOx dual cocatalysts with site-selective deposition make a synergetic promotion on the charge separation of BiVO4, leading to an unprecedentedly efficient ZOWS system.

Here we report an assembly of unprecedentedly efficient ZOWS system with apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 10.3% at 420 nm using [Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4− as redox mediator. The breakthrough of AQE is mainly ascribed to an effective cocatalyst strategy that significantly promotes charge transfer and surface catalysis. Meanwhile, the metallic Au cocatalyst is first revealed to favor electron transfer from BiVO4 to [Fe(CN)6]3− shuttle ions, and site-selective deposition of Au and CoOx dual cocatalysts on the corresponding electron-rich {010} and hole-rich {110} facets of BiVO4 is crucial for promotion of water oxidation.

The performance of the cooling system was evaluated in terms of temperature drop, increase in relative humidity (RH) and cooling efficiency. Two tomato cultivars (‘9065′ jam and round) were harvested from smallholder farms in Umsinga, South Africa (28˚45′56.45′’S, 30˚33′42.37′’E). Tomatoes were assigned to one of the three storage conditions namely; evaporative cooling system (ECS), cold room (CR) and room temperature (RT). Quality parameters evaluated included mass loss, respiration rate, colour, firmness, total soluble solids and titratable acids for both tomato cultivars. ECS reduced temperature to 19.8 °C which was 13% lower than RT (23.0 °C). RH increased from 63.59% in RT to 83.91% in the ECS with an average cooling efficiency of 67.17%. Storage treatments and time had significant (p < 0.05) effect on fruit quality. Fruit in the CR retained colour, mass, firmness, respiration rate, TA and TSS of both cultivars longer than the other treatments. However, the ECS was able to preserve the freshness of tomatoes for 20 days and had a slower rate of change in mass, respiration, colour, firmness, TA and TSS compared with those stored at RT. This suggested that the evaluated ECS is capable of maintaining postharvest quality and increasing shelf-life of tomatoes. Therefore, ECS has a potential as a low-cost and energy-free system for preserving quality and reducing postharvest losses under smallholder farming systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cooling efficiency; Postharvest losses; Postharvest quality; Ripening; Sustainable cooling","cooling; cultivar; efficiency measurement; farming system; fruit; herb; numerical method; physicochemical property; relative humidity; respiration; ripening; temperature effect; South Africa; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049301149

They occur when the fluid is transferred between 2 vessels (liquefaction plant to trailer, trailer to station storage, station storage to pump or compressor, then possibly onto fuel cell electric vehicles …) and when it is warmed up due to heat transfer with the environment. Those losses can be estimated with good accuracy using thermodynamic models based on the conservation of mass and energy, provided that the thermodynamic states are correctly described. Indeed, the fluid undergoes various changes as it moves along the entire pathway (2 phase transition, sub-cooled liquid phase, super-heated warming, non-uniform temperature distributions across the saturation film) and accurate equations of state and 2 phase behavior implementations are essential. The balances of mass and energy during the various dynamics processes then enable to quantify the boil-off losses. In this work, a MATLAB code previously developed by NASA to simulate rocket loading is used as the basis for a LH2 transfer model. This code implements complex physical phenomena such as the competition between condensation and evaporation and the convection vs. conduction heat transfer as a function of the relative temperatures on both sides of the saturated film. The original code was modified to consider real gas equations of state, and some semi-empirical relationships, such as between the heat of vaporization and the critical temperature, were replaced by a REFPROP equivalent expression, assumed to be more accurate. Non-constant liquid temperature equations were added to simulate sub-cooled conditions. The model shows that under environmental heat transfer only the liquid phase of a LH2 vessel would experience cooling, while the boil-off is mainly a result of evaporation from the saturation film onto the vapor phase. Under the conditions assumed for this work, it was also concluded that the actual LH2 density was lower than the corresponding saturation density given by the working pressure of the vessel. During a bottom fill transfer, for example from a LH2 trailer to an on-site stationary vessel, it is shown that the boil-off losses are due to the compression of the vapor phase (“pdV” force). The model indicates that the magnitude of those losses is not dependent on the regulated pressure in the receiving vessel but is rather a function of the initial pressure in the vessel, amounting to more than 12% of losses for a vessel initially at 100 psia. At last, the model is used to estimate the amount of vapor H2 vented when depressurizing a LH2 trailer following a LH2 delivery. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",,"Codes (symbols); Equations of state of gases; Equations of state of liquids; Evaporation; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Heat conduction; Hydrogen; Liquids; NASA; Rockets; Temperature; Behavior implementation; Conservation of mass; Critical temperatures; Environmental heat transfer; Equivalent expression; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Hydrogen refueling stations; Relative temperatures; MATLAB",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055098318

The pyroelectric effect, a phenomenon that converts temperature variation into electricity, enables a material to be operated like a heat engine between high and low temperatures and electric fields, producing electrical work. However, current literature focuses on material performances, with no energy stored by operating in such conversion cycles. This work presents a complete pyroelectric management system that both realized cycled energy conversion and a maximum harvested power up to 13.1 μW. We achieved this by integrating a laser heat source, an advanced pyroelectric device, a practical power interface, and an energy storage component together. A thin film Lead Zirconate Titanate device was fabricated to achieve very fast temperature response (∼0.1 ms). Thus, the energy conversion can be achieved in a much higher thermodynamic frequency (1 kHz), leading to a larger power density. The proposed power interface manages an optimized pyroelectric conversion cycle while recharging a battery, or a storage capacitor (up to 2.1 V). The results provide a promising method to harvest energy from waste-heat and have shown great potential to supply power to small-scale, distributed devices. In addition, the application of the laser source has also enabled the system to achieve wireless power transmission, which would enable a more flexible way to supply power to multiple devices. © 2018","Power conditioning; Pyroelectric generator; Pyroelectricity; Thermal energy harvesting","Crystallography; Electric energy storage; Electric fields; Energy conversion; Energy harvesting; Engines; Ferroelectric ceramics; Lead zirconate titanate; Pyroelectricity; Temperature; Thermal energy; Waste heat; Energy storage components; Material performance; Power conditioning; Pyroelectric devices; Pyroelectric generator; Temperature response; Temperature variation; Wireless power transmission; Storage (materials); conditioning; electricity; energy storage; engine; management; power generation; thermal power; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053197651

We tested the prototype over four simulated days, where each day consisted of four phases of operation: charging, discharging, simultaneous charging and discharging, and storage. Our results show three major conclusions. First, the thermal energy storage system was able to receive and distribute heat with small temperature gradients – less than 5 °C throughout the thermal storage tank. Second, the valved thermosyphon was able to effectively control heat transfer, demonstrating an on/off thermal conductance ratio of 430.

Shipboard load fluctuations, such as propulsion-load fluctuations and pulse power loads, can significantly affect power system reliability. In order to address this issue, this paper explores a real-time model predictive control based energy management strategy for load fluctuation mitigation in all-electric ships. A battery combined with ultra-capacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is used as a buffer to compensate load fluctuations from the shipboard network. In order to implement the proposed real-time MPC-based energy management strategy on a physical testbed, three special efforts have been made to enable real-time implementation: a specially tailored problem formulation, an efficient optimization algorithm and a multi-core hardware implementation. Given the multi-frequency characteristics of load fluctuations, a filter-based power split strategy is developed as a baseline control to evaluate the proposed MPC. Compared to the filter-based strategy, the experimental results show that the proposed real-time MPC achieves superior performance in terms of enhanced system reliability, improved HESS efficiency, long self-sustained time, and extended battery life. The bus voltage variation and hybrid energy storage losses can be reduced by up to 38% and 65%, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","All-electric ships; Energy management; Hybrid energy storage; Model predictive control (MPC); Real-time optimization","Buffer storage; Electric batteries; Electric ship equipment; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy storage; Predictive control systems; Real time control; Reliability; Ship propulsion; Ships; All electric ships; Energy management strategies; Hardware implementations; Hybrid energy storage; Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS); Power system reliability; Real-time implementations; Real-time optimization; Model predictive control; algorithm; control system; electric vehicle; electrification; energy storage; model; optimization; real time; vessel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051793699

Until now, there has been limited methods to reliably and efficiently release and control the extraction of thermal energy from a material containing stored sensible or latent heat. Due to their isothermal property, phase change materials (PCMs) storing latent heat are an ideal choice for storage, though it has proven challenging to reliably extract and utilize that heat. To solve this problem, the geometry of a thermosyphon was rearranged to create a thermal valve that is able to turn the flow of thermal energy from a PCM ""on"" and ""off"". A stainless steel thermal valve using sodium as the working fluid was designed, fabricated, assessed, and found to effectively and selectively extract heat from a 577°C molten aluminum PCM. It is expected that thermal valves will significantly contribute to more widespread implementation of CSP as a stored energy source from distributed generation to utility-scale power production. © 2018 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057127592

Furthermore, with higher operating temperatures, a number of new concepts become feasible, the most important of which are supercritical CO2 cycles and air Brayton cycles. Hybrid CSP-fossil fuel systems fall within the air Brayton family of concepts, where the solar field is used to preheat air, while a fossil fuel is burned to bring the air temperature to the firing temperature of a gas-fired Brayton turbine. To make this approach more attractive and environmentally friendly, it is desirable to maximize the solar ""contribution"" and minimize fuel assistance. This can be done by using novel receivers that increase the air temperature significantly and/or employing a recuperator, where the operating pressure and temperature are lower than conventional Brayton cycles. This paper presents information about an experimental integrated gas turbine-solar particle heating system that uses the hybrid approach. The system is located on the campus of King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and has a peak thermal power of 300 kW. In addition to providing details about the individual components and how they are integrated, the paper explains the start-up procedure, which consists of preheating the system with the heliostat field, followed by additional heating from the turbine itself until the nominal heat exchanger operating temperature is reached, at which point on-sun operation can commence. The study shows that solar preheating requires one to two days to complete, followed by a few hours of heating by the turbine to bring the temperature to about 560°C. Furthermore, with a temperature rise of up to 180°C in the particle heating receiver (and a drop of 10°C in the particle conveyor), the maximum particle temperature will approach 730°C, making the solar contribution significant. As larger scale systems will naturally allow for larger particle drop heights and higher temperature rises in the receiver, it is envisaged that maximum particle tempertures in those systems will approach the firing temperatures of recuperated turbines, making this solution technically, economically, and environmentally worth considering. © 2018 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057125169

Latitude and weather impact efficiency and availability, and local labor rates have a further influence on cost. To explore the impact of these effects, we performed techno-economic analysis of a small-scale solar power tower concept in six different locations in the United States, Australia, and India. The specific configuration we considered has a nominal power rating of 100 kWe and 5 hours of thermal energy storage. Further, we considered two deployment strategies: a single stand-alone 100 kWe tower, and a 20 MWe cluster of many towers. For each scenario, we used a probabilistic analysis method to evaluate levelized cost of electricity. We found that this configuration has potential for cost-competitive electricity generation and the ability to improve grid flexibility for integration of intermittent renewables. In addition, solar resource, latitude, and local labor rates all have an impact on the levelized cost of electricity of the system. © 2018 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057123756

In the present study, the techno-economic analysis of a hybrid CSP+PV plant integrated with TES and a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) at utility scale was conducted. The plant model was simulated at Crucero, Chile using TRNSYS. The dispatch strategy is to deliver a net output of 100MWe to the grid. A parametric analysis varying PV size, solar multiple, TES hours of storage and BESS capacity was carried out. Results show that the hybrid plant can achieve capacity factors over 90% and the BESS allows to exploit the surplus of PV energy. However, the contribution of the BESS to the total generation is only significant for PV sizes above 100MW and for TES capacities lower than 10h. The minimum LCOE obtained with the parametric analysis was 98.46 USD/MWh with a capacity factor of 85% and a configuration with 100MW PV plant, a solar multiple of 2, 12h of TES, but without batteries. Yet, a solutions domain with capacity factors above 90% and LCOE values between 110 and 130 USD/MWh with BESS capacities from 250 to 500 MWh was found. These results show that it is still necessary a higher reduction cost of the batteries to increase the economic feasibility of this concept besides its technical potential, however, the BESS addition allows to provide higher capacity factors and achieving less dumped PV energy. © 2018 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057109936

This benchmark has now been achieved, with a product that is available for commercial delivery in 2018. After years of continued development, research support from the US Department of Energy (DOE), and a shift to a global supply chain, SkyFuel® has now achieved a Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for the SkyTrough® DSP parabolic trough collector of less than $100/m2 (2017 US Dollars). This achievement required a holistic approach to parabolic trough analysis, with the development effort based on efficiency analyses, material indices, labor rates, manufacturing and assembly methods, and worldwide supply chain logistics. The following text describes in detail the base assumptions, optimization strategy, component design, manufacturing approach, and supply chain logistics undertaken to achieve this goal. As a result of the analyses, the primary material of construction changed from aluminum to steel. The aperture of the trough increased from six to seven meters, and extended to a total collector length of 146 m. There are four receivers per module, each 4.51 m long by 80 mm diameter, and eight modules in a Solar Collector Assembly (SCA). After analyzing torque tubes, torque boxes, and monocoque structures as a comparison, a space frame design was selected as the primary structural support; however, the frame has been reduced in relative size and has assumed a new geometry. The trough's reflective surface was also assessed against thick glass mirrors, thin glass mirrors, composite stacks, and thin-film polymer reflectors. A thin-film polymer reflector was selected as the reflective surface, due to its low cost of materials and savings from shipping and installation. This collector is designed for use with a variety of working fluids including molten salt, with an outlet temperature of up to 565°C. Use of molten salt as the collector working fluid reduces storage volume, improves plant efficiency, and allows for operation in parallel with fossil-fueled boilers for hybridized utility-scale power applications. It has built-in electrical isolation and salt-compatible flexible piping connections, a reduced-cost drive system, and a parabolic rib design that contributes to its high efficiency and low cost. This publication documents the fundamental approach taken to achieve a COGS of $100/m2, detailing the methods used in the analysis and the unique characteristics of the resulting product. © 2018 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057079847

However, the Chinese government has recently shifted from supporting the development of coal power plants to cancelling many proposed projects. In addition, government support of renewables, including solar, has increased dramatically. Combined with a stable or slowing national energy demand, China's energy generation capacity is outpacing need. Curtailment in China typically begins with coal, and as such, the capacity factors on coal-fired plants are decreasing. All indications are that this trend will continue and extend to other fossil-fuel based generation in the future. Many Rankine power cycles found in fossil-fuel based electricity generation operate at steam temperatures around 550°C, a temperature that can be matched by Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) technologies operating with molten salts. An advantage of installing CSP technology as a hybrid with existing plants is the complete utilization of existing power block equipment, including the turbine, cooling, and power transmission systems. In addition, direct molten salt thermal energy storage allows the solar portion of the plant to operate through transient events or, if desired, up to 24 hours a day. The steam turbine can operate consistently at full load, and therefore the highest efficiency, while still directly reducing fuel consumption or maintaining the low capacity factor of the coal boiler. There are other advantages, such as a potential increase in plant capacity factor if currently limited by governmental regulations on the quantity of fossil fuels used, or increased revenue if a power purchase agreement or carbon emission credit can be reached valuing the solar portion of plant generation higher than the fossil-fuel portion. This paper examines the current state of the Chinese energy market and the variables above are explored to determine the engineering challenges, economic feasibility, and potential market for CSP hybridization with existing coal-based plants in China. Example sites are identified and evaluated, risks and challenges are addressed, and the final Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and power generation results are compared to current Chinese pricing for greenfield CSP projects.

The root cause of its instability is still unclear. In this paper, its internal mechanism and the improvement method were studied in depth. First, the flow characteristics in a model pump-turbine during the runaway process at four guide-vane openings (GVOs) were investigated by 3D transient numerical simulations. Then, the energy dissipation characteristics of different types of backflow vortex structures (BFVSs) occurring at the runner inlet and their impacts on the runaway stability were investigated by the entropy production theory. The results show that the location change of BFVSs between the hub side and the mid-span of the runner inlet around the no-load point leads to the sharp change in the energy dissipation rate, which makes the slope of dynamic trajectory positive and the runaway oscillation self-excited. If the occurrence of BFVSs at the hub side is suspended, the runaway process will be damped. Finally, the pump-turbine runner was improved to obtain a wider stable operating range. © 2018 by the authors.","Entropy production; Oscillation stability; Pump-turbine; Pumped-storage power plant; Runaway process; Transient flows",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056210446

These regions have weak transmission grids and building new transmission lines are expensive due to large distances. The tight restrictions on the power systems in these regions makes daily operation difficult and unexpected variations in wind power production can have significant negative impacts, such as rationing of power. A stochastic rolling horizon model is formulated and implemented to consider the importance of including wind power stochasticity when operating flexible hydrogen loads in a congested power system. Wind power scenarios are created using realized wind power production and meteorological weather forecasts. The resulting operation plans of hydrogen storage and hydro power plants, using expected values or wind power scenarios, are tested and compared in a simulator with the realized wind power production. Results from the case study show that the stochastic model gives a better strategy than the deterministic model which use the expected value of wind production by about 5.6% and there is potential for further cost reductions by improving the forecasting. When including more than 27 wind power scenarios the changes in results are small.

Processing this amount of data poses a challenge for current computing systems. PIM enables in-place computation which reduces data movement, a major latency bottleneck in conventional systems. In this paper, we propose an in-memory implementation of fast and energy-efficient logic (FELIX) which combines the functionality of PIM with memories. To the best of authors' knowledge, FELIX is the first PIM logic to enable the single cycle NOR, NOT, NAND, minority, and OR directly in crossbar memory. We exploit the voltage threshold-based memristors to enable single cycle operations. It is a purely in-memory execution which neither reads out data nor changes sense amplifiers, while preserving data in-memory. We extend these single cycle operations to implement more complex functions like XOR and addition in memory with 2X lower latency than the fastest published PIM technique. We also increase the amount of in-memory parallelism in our design by segmenting bitlines using switches. To evaluate the efficiency of our design at the system level, we design a FELIX-based HyperDimensional (HD) computing accelerator. Our evaluation shows that for all applications tested using HD, FELIX provides on average 128.8X speedup and 5,589.3X lower energy consumption as compared to AMD GPU. FELIX HD also achieves on average 2.21X higher energy efficiency, 1.86X speedup, and 1.68X less memory as compared to the fastest PIM technique. © 2018 ACM.","energy efficiency; hyper-dimensional computing; machine learning; memristors; non-volatile memories; processing in-memory","Big data; Computation theory; Computer aided design; Computer circuits; Data handling; Data storage equipment; Energy utilization; Green computing; Internet of things; Learning systems; Memristors; Conventional systems; Current computing; hyper-dimensional computing; In-place computation; Internet of thing (IOT); Non-volatile memory; Processing in memory; Single-cycle operations; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058161750

In order to realize the grid-friendly access of renewable energy power generation represented by wind power, it is necessary to involve energy storage, of which the battery energy storage is the most widely used type, and build a relatively controllable combined power generation system. Target tracking is one of the demand that wind power and energy storage combined generation system is supposed to meet. According to the discrepancies in tracking target, this paper firstly categorizes the target tracking issue into three parts, namely tracking wind power forecasting curve, tracking generation plan and tracking dynamic power generation index. Then based on the categories and considering their own research focuses, relevant literatures are summarized and compared. Conclusions and future research points are provided in the end. It is found that the issue of tracking dynamic power generation index worth more attention attributed to its novelty and complexity, where future work may be conducted from two aspects, the mathematical model dynamic power generation index and control strategy with overall management ability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Clutter (information theory); Energy storage; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Power control; Target tracking; Wind power; Battery energy storage; Combined generation systems; Control strategies; Environmental pollutions; Management ability; Power generation systems; Renewable energy power generations; Wind power forecasting; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057563512

In the experiment, two common hydrated salts of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate were selected as phase change materials, and tested at room temperature. Recording temperature and drawing the step cooling curve method, by adding different proportions of nucleating agent and dye to improve the supercooling and phase separation of the phase change materials, so that the reaction temperature of the biogas plant was always maintained at a suitable temperature (20-30 ° C) to ensure the activity of microorganisms. The experimental results showed that sodium tetraborate decahydrate can effectively reduce the subcooling degree of zinc nitrate hexahydrate, and the azo (-N = N-) dye not only improved the solar absorption rate but also weakened the phase separation of phase change materials to some extent.

The energy storage system can be used for peak load shaving and smooth out the power of the grid because of the capacity of fast power supply. Because of the high energy storage cost, it restricts the wide use of energy storage system, so it is very important for optimizing the storage capacity allocation. This paper analyses the economic benefits of the battery energy storage system used for load shaving in the distribution network. Through genetic algorithm, and considering the investment costs and economic benefits of energy storage system, the optimal value of energy storage capacity allocation is obtained by maximizing annual income as the objective function which is based on time-sharing electricity price. Finally, a 17-node distribution network is tested with typical daily load curve to justify the effectiveness of this method, and the results show that this method can not only play the role of peak load shaving, but also obtain certain profits. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data storage equipment; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Genetic algorithms; Battery energy storage systems; Capacity optimization; Daily load curves; Economic benefits; Electricity prices; Energy storage capacity; Energy storage systems; Objective functions; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057549068

However the control of Reversible pump Turbines (RPT) operations within these plants is still an issue, where the so-called S-shape flow instabilities cause different problems especially when under low discharge operating conditions. Taking from the grounds that these instabilities have been found to mostly be based within the vaneless space between the guide vanes and the runner, this paper intends to investigate the effect of guide vanes opening (GVO) on runner flow characteristics. CFD-backed numerical simulations were carried out on a RPT complete flow passage under different GVOs; namely 17mm, 21mm and 25mm openings. Instabilities were found to take source from low flow conditions where resulting hydraulic losses maybe the trigger of s-shape characteristics appearance. The GVO however, showed the ability to tame the severity of these flow instabilities and associated pressure pulsations. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Electric power system stability; Hydraulic motors; Hydraulic turbines; Numerical models; Pumped storage power plants; CFD numerical simulations; Flow charac-teristics; Flow instabilities; Guide vane openings; Low flow condition; Operating condition; Pressure pulsation; Reversible pump-turbine; Computational fluid dynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057538760

Due to the leakage of metal ion from the adsorbents, there is no metal ion affinity adsorbent for hemoperfusion. In this study, chitosan was used to coat the adsorbent for preventing the leakage of Zn 2+ loaded. Meanwhile, freeze-drying method was used to enhance adsorption capacity of Zn 2+ -loaded cellulose beads for testosterone. The results indicate that after the adsorbent was coated by 0.02% chitosan solution, the highest adsorption percentage reached 48%, during adsorption, the Zn 2+ concentration in plasma did not increase; the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent can be significantly enhanced by freeze-drying. The results may be caused by porosity of the adsorbent enlarged via freeze-drying and improved stability by coating with chitosan.

While using capacitors for storage offers these systems indefinite lifetime, it comes at a cost-they must tolerate the decreased availability, lower energy utilization, and more complex programming models inherent to a volatile, intermittent design. We argue that many of these problems stem from insufficient energy storage and could be eliminated with the use of batteries. Recent advances in rechargeable battery technology weaken the historical arguments against their use. We believe that using batteries in energy harvesting sensors will push us closer to a class of reliable, general purpose devices that can better serve human-centric sensing applications than their capacitor-based counterparts at the cost of having a finite, but long, lifetime. © ENSsys 2018 - Proceedings of the 2018 International Workshop on Energy Harvesting and Energy-Neutral Sensing Systems, Part of SenSys.",,"Energy utilization; Secondary batteries; Energy harvesting sensors; Human-centric sensing; Programming models; Sensing tasks; Status quo; Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058406764

Contractive dynamic aperture becomes an inevitable but pivotal characteristic of future diffraction-limited storage rings, which lead to the exclusion of the conventional off-axis injection schemes. In this paper we will present a new on-axis injection scheme in allusion to future light sources, which is based on a triple-frequency rf system. By means of delicate superposition of rf voltages with fundamental, 2nd and 3rd hamonic frequencies, a commodious and rational main bucket which can accommodate an injected bunch and a circulating bunch simultaneously is able to be formed. The injected bunch can be captured by the longitudinal acceptance on-axis in a reasonable time offset with respect to the circulating bunch, utilizing the ultrafast pulse kicker, and ultimately merging to the center of the main bucket through synchrotron radiation damping. Detailed construction of the triple-frequency rf system and application of this scheme to the High Energy Photon Source will be discussed in the paper, relevant simulation studies and discussions are also presented. © 2018 authors.

This study aimed to explore the differential regulation between adipogenic and myogenic precursors by comparative analysis of their global proteome expression profile. Adipogenic and myogenic precursors isolated from neonatal porcine longissimus dorsi muscle by the preplate method were verified for their unique and distinct differentiation potential under myogenic or adipogenic induction. A total of 433 differentially expressed proteins (DEP) (P < 0.05 and FC > 1.20 or <0.83) between adipogenic and myogenic precursors were detected via a tandem mass tag (TMT)-coupled LC-MS/MS approach, including 339 up-regulated and 94 down-regulated proteins in myogenic precursors compared with adipogenic precursors. On the basis of functional annotation and enrichment analysis of 433 DEP, adipogenic and myogenic precursors showed significantly different metabolic pattern of energy substances and differential regulations of gene expression, cell structure and development, ion homeostasis, and cell motility and migration. Three pathways including PPAR signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, and autophagy signaling pathway, which was differentially regulated between adipogenic and myogenic precursors, was also discovered to play crucial roles in cell differentiation. In conclusion, these differentiated regulation patterns between the two cell subsets of mesenchymal precursors together defines their differentiation potential specificity. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","cell differentiation; cell migration; cell structure; intramuscular fat; ion homeostasis","peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; phosphatidylinositol; proteome; muscle protein; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; phosphatidylinositol; adipogenesis; animal cell; animal cell culture; Article; cell differentiation; cell migration; cell motility; cell structure; fractionation; gene expression regulation; high performance liquid chromatography; lipid storage; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; longissimus muscle; mesenchymal stem cell; muscle development; nonhuman; pig; precursor; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; tandem mass spectrometry; adipocyte; adipogenesis; animal; antibody specificity; autophagy; cell motion; cytology; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene ontology; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular genetics; muscle cell; muscle development; newborn; skeletal muscle; stem cell; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Autophagy; Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Ontology; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Muscle Cells; Muscle Development; Muscle Proteins; Muscle, Skeletal; Organ Specificity; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Phosphatidylinositols; Signal Transduction; Stem Cells; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055134845

Inertial storage was considered to be a flywheel coupled with an induction motor and controlled by a voltage inverter type power converter. First, a model of inertial energy storage system (flywheel + asynchronous machine) is presented; then, two control methods, namely, the Direct Torque Control (DTC) and DTC-conventional SVPWM (space vector pulse with modulation), are proposed. The two control methods gave similar performance, but the DTC-SVPWM required less computation time. The two regulators and the proportional integrator SVPWM technique were used to determine the switching frequency. Using direct control with vector modulation strategy enabled the inertial energy storage system to attain good continuation, even under rather severe operating conditions, and the torque ripples were significantly reduced compared to the case of conventional DTC.

Combined with the above comprehensive target and heat network model, a mixed integer linear programming model for a multi-region CCHP system capacity collaborative optimization configuration is established. The integrated energy system, just a numerical model solved with the LINGO software, is presented. Taking a typical urban area in Shanghai as an example, the simulation results show that the integrated energy system with multi-zone heat-suply network interaction compared to the single area CCHP model improved the clean energy utilization of the system, rationally allocates equipment capacity, promotes the local consumption of distributed energy, and provides better overall system benefits. © 2018 by the authors.

In this study, an integrated system with power generation, CO2 capture and heat supply are proposed, which adopts three measures to reutilize the waste heat released from the CO2 capture process, including extracted steam recirculation, a CO2 Rankine cycle and a radiant floor heat subsystem. Amongst these measures, the radiant floor heat subsystem can efficiently reuse the relatively low temperature waste energy in the absorbent cooler. Through thermodynamic analysis, it is determined that the power output of the new integrated system is 19.48 MW higher compared with the decarbonization Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) power plant without system integration. On the other hand, 247.59 MW of heat can be recovered through the radiant floor heat subsystem, leading to an improved overall energy efficiency of 73.6%. In terms of the economic performance, the integration requires only 2.6% more capital investment than a decarbonization NGCC power plant without system integration and obtains extra revenue of 3.40 $/MWh from the simultaneous heat supply, which reduces the cost of CO2 avoided by 22.3%. The results prove the economic and efficiency potential of a NGCC power plant integrated with carbon capture, which may promote the industrial demonstration of carbon capture theology. © 2018 by the authors.

Three optimization methods are proposed based on the traditional UPQC: (1) The shunt converter is substituted with multi-modular parallel converters. Hence, the reactive power and harmonic currents can be increased greatly, which are suitable for low-voltage high-current distribution systems. (2) The series converters consist of three H-bridge inverters, and each of the H-bridge inverters is controlled separately. The control strategy is easier to achieve and can improve the control performance of voltage regulation under unbalanced voltage sag or swell. (3) A three-phase four-leg (3P4L) converter is connected to the common DC bus of the proposed UPQC to connect the renewable energy and energy storage system. The detailed mathematical models of shunt and series converters are analyzed, respectively. A multi-proportional resonant (PR) controller is presented in the voltage regulation and reactive power compensation control algorithms.

Furthermore, reduced system inertia as a result of the integration of conventional PV systems may lead to an increased frequency deviation of the grid for contingencies. In this paper, a grid-supporting PV system, which can provide inertia and participate in frequency regulation through virtual synchronous generator (VSG) technology and an energy storage unit, is proposed. The function of supporting the grid is implemented in a practical PV system through using the presented control scheme and topology. Compared with the conventional PV system, the grid-supporting PV system, behaving as an inertial voltage source like synchronous generators, has the capability of participating in frequency regulation and providing inertia. Moreover, the proposed PV system can mitigate autonomously the power imbalance between generation and consumption, filter the PV power, and operate without the phase-locked loop after initial synchronization. Performance analysis is conducted and the stability constraint is theoretically formulated. The novel PV system is validated on a modified CIGRE benchmark under different cases, being compared with the conventional PV system. The verifications demonstrate the grid support functions of the proposed PV system. © 2018 MDPI AG.

The analysis is based on a 36-year monthly climatology of the surface heat flux; estimates of geothermal input, mechanical energy input, and heat storage; and a detailed treatment of freshwater fluxes. The ocean's Carnot efficiency is estimated to be 0.86%. The Carnot work is equal to 110 TW, which exceeds the mechanical energy input by the winds and tides. The net entropy flux from the ocean to its surroundings is found to be 0.617 TW/K, in good agreement with an independent estimate of the irreversible entropy production from viscous dissipation, thermal mixing, and haline mixing, demonstrating a balanced entropy budget of the ocean. Thermal mixing accounts for 56% of this entropy production, with most of the remaining production due to viscous dissipation and only small contributions from haline mixing and sea ice melting. Two thirds of the thermal entropy production is due to isopycnal mixing. The effect of thermal diffusion is to reduce the Carnot work significantly. The actual reduction is proportional to the amplitude of the (poorly known) eddy thermal diffusivity. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

It is clear that integrated energy systems can improve energy efficiency and reduce costs. However, the use of a battery energy storage system (BESS) as a backup power source will affect the operating costs of a regional integrated energy system (RIES) in different situations. In this paper, a regional integrated energy system including wind turbines, photovoltaics, gas turbines and battery energy storage was introduced. In order to obtain the minimum operation cost, an operation optimization model was built. The schedule plans of each unit were optimized by a moth flame optimization (MFO) algorithm. Finally, three different scenarios were proposed for the simulation optimization. The simulation optimization results show that when the BESS is used as a backup power source, the operating cost of the system and the resulting pollutant emissions are less than the diesel generator (DG) set. Therefore, it is worthwhile to use BESS instead of DG as the backup power source in RIES. © 2018 by the authors.

As a core element, energy storage battery plays an important role in the development of energy storage power station. The negative electrode material has a great influence on the overall battery performance. The traditional LiFePO4 battery uses graphite material as the negative electrode and has poor multiplying power performance and poor cycle performance. Because soft carbon is an excellent material, the battery in which the anode is made of soft carbon has excellent rate performance and large energy density. Compared with the traditional graphite anode material, soft carbon has better properties. In this paper, a set of megawatt-level energy station, the container type energy station, is studied. A novel structure of soft carbon anode lithium iron phosphate battery is developed as the energy battery. The 400KWh capacity charge and discharge experiments with low load power are carried out for the energy storage power station. The results show that the charging efficiency reaches 93% and the discharge efficiency reaches 97%. The experiments also verify the charge and discharge characteristics battery with soft carbon anode. The new structure of soft carbon material battery has good rate performance and the level of the platform is low and stable during charging and discharging. The experimental results are compared with the simulation results and they match very well.

Previous studies attributed the hydrological changes to global warming or land cover change, and obtained contrary conclusions on the dominant drivers. Here we show that natural climate change is mainly responsible for most hydrological changes (except low flows) over the Sanjiangyuan region, followed by the anthropogenic climate change, while land cover contributed the least. The newly developed Conjunctive Surface-Subsurface Process version 2 land surface model that was evaluated comprehensively in the first part of this series was used to conduct a set of high-resolution simulations driven by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 detection and attribution experiment outputs with natural or anthropogenic forcings. By using an integrated hydroclimate attribution framework, anthropogenic climate change was found to cause significant ground temperature warming and soil frozen period shortening. However, significant decreasing trends in annual mean streamflow and high flows over the Yellow River headwater region and the terrestrial water storage averaged over the Sanjiangyuan region were mainly caused by natural climate change, with contribution by 57–97%. The contributions from land cover change are less than 11%. This study suggests that adaptations are more important than mitigations for the water resource management over the Sanjiangyuan and its downstream regions, because natural climate change outweighed human-induced climate change in the headwater region. ©2018.

Due to the randomness and fluctuation of DPG, however, the distribution and direction of power flow are changed frequently on some days. Therefore, more attention is needed to ensure the safe operation of the distribution network. The installation of energy storage systems (ESSs) can help the network to withstand the fluctuations caused by DPG. Based on the discrete Fourier transform method, this paper presents an ESS capacity allocation strategy for the medium/low voltage distribution network with DPG. The reliability scenario models are created via Latin hypercube sampling with Cholesky decomposition and scenario reduction. Numerical results show that the proposed strategy can reduce the power flow fluctuation with less ESS capacity, and increase the penetration capacity of DPG in the distribution network while maintaining the quality of the power supply. © 2018, The Author(s).","Discrete Fourier transform; Distributed photovoltaic; Energy storage system; Medium/low voltage distribution network","Discrete Fourier transforms; Electric load flow; Energy storage; Voltage distribution measurement; Capacity allocation; Cholesky decomposition; Discrete Fourier transform method; Energy storage systems; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Latin hypercube sampling; Photovoltaic; Voltage distribution; Data storage equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056104770

These networks require large data sets for training, which is usually performed on GPUs and CPUs in either a cloud or edge computing setting. No matter where the training is performed, it is subject to tight power/energy and data storage/transfer constraints. While these issues can be mitigated by replacing SRAM/DRAM with nonvolatile memories (NVMs) which offer near-zero leakage power and high scalability, the massive weight updates performed during training shorten NVM endurance and engender high write energy. In this paper, an NVM-friendly NN training approach is proposed. Weight update is redesigned to reduce bit flips in NVM cells. Moreover, two techniques, namely, filter exchange and bitwise rotation, are proposed to respectively balance writes to different weights and to different bits of one weight. The proposed techniques are integrated and evaluated in Caffe.

TEM and AFM examinations revealed the occurrence of nano-hills formed on the SS surface during heating process in an NH3 environment. This is a key step for uniform growth of VACNTs. The VACNTs have uniform length and diameter, good alignment, and uniform coverage over the substrate surface, superior to reported results. The particle on the tip of most of the VACNTs was found to be single crystalline Fe metal, although a few other VACNTs were found to have an alloy of Fe, Ni, Mn, and Cr at the tips. This highlights the dominating catalytic behavior of Fe over Ni, Cr, and Mn, which are the elemental composition of the nano-hills.

However, the nonvolatile main memory system suffers from a new security vulnerability. An attacker can readily access sensitive information on the memory, since the nonvolatility allows information to be retained for a long time even after the power is OFF. While real-time memory encryption during memory accesses with dedicated Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) engine is an effective solution for this vulnerability, it incurs runtime performance and energy overhead. Alternatively, in this paper, we propose a fast and efficient AES in-memory (AIM) implementation, to encrypt the whole/part of the memory only when it is necessary. Rather than adding extra processing elements to the cost-sensitive memory, we take advantage of NVM's intrinsic logic operation capability to implement the AES algorithm. We leverage the benefits (large internal bandwidth and dramatic data movement reduction) offered by the in-memory computing architecture to address the challenges of the bandwidth intensive encryption application. Embracing the massive parallelism inside the memory, AIM outperforms existing mechanisms with higher throughput yet lower energy consumption. The experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art AES engine running at 2.1 GHz, AIM speeds up the encryption process by 80× for a 1-GB NVM. © 2018 IEEE.","Advanced Encryption Standard (AES); encryption; main memory; nonvolatile","Bandwidth; Computation theory; Computer architecture; Data privacy; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Engines; Interactive computer systems; Nonvolatile storage; Parallel processing systems; Real time systems; Advanced Encryption Standard; Main memory; Non-volatile; Non-volatile memory; Parallel processing; Random access memory; Cryptography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053160559

In this study, the torrefaction of two types of commercially available wood pellets was carried out in the temperature range of 230–290 °C for 30 min residence time. Torrefaction produces both the solid fuel known as torrefied pellets and the volatile stream known as torgas. The torgas was further separated into condensable liquids, known as tor-liquid and non-condensable gases. The products yield, its compositions and fuel properties at various torrefaction temperatures were also determined. The increase in temperature reduced the torrefied pellet yield from 89 to 52%, while increased the condensable liquid yield from 5 to 23% within the torrefaction study condition. The heating value (24 MJ kg−1) and the volumetric energy density (12.5 GJ m−3) of torrefied pellets at 270 °C were comparable to that of coal for biopower. The increase in torrefaction temperature improved the hydrophobicity (resistance to water uptake), but adversely reduced the pellet density, hardness, and durability of torrefied pellets causing high susceptibility to breakage and fine generation during handling, transport, and storage. Further research is required to improve the quality of torrefied pellets for safe handling and storage. The non-condensable fraction of torgas was mainly composed of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and traces of methane.

Two systems are defined: System 1, which independently produces natural gas and oil, and System 2, which captures carbon dioxide (CO2) from the natural gas-processing plant and utilizes this captured CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The LCA uses customized spreadsheet models with emission factors from peer-reviewed literature and publications of the National Energy Technology Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy. The modeling results show that the CO2 EOR scenario using captured CO2 produces both natural gas and oil with lower life cycle GHG emissions than alternative systems producing natural gas and oil independently. Sensitivity analyses show that the model results are most sensitive to the fraction of CO2 captured (or equivalently, the fraction of CO2 vented) at the natural gas-processing facility and the incremental oil recovery factor and net CO2 utilization factor of the EOR operations. The input variable driving the relative difference in life cycle GHG emissions between these two systems is the fraction of CO2 captured at the natural gas-processing facility (i.e., the capture rate). The results of this study highlight the necessity of linking processes in the life cycle modeling, as a change to one process can affect other processes within the coupled energy system comprised of natural gas and oil. In addition, this analysis shows, as prior work has also suggested, that CO2 EOR using captured anthropogenic CO2 provides a viable means for offsetting carbon emissions from oil production and combustion via the associated storage of CO2 that occurs incidentally during this tertiary method of oil recovery. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 storage; CO2 utilization; Enhanced oil recovery; Life cycle analysis","Carbon dioxide; Crude oil; Gas emissions; Gas producers; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Petroleum analysis; Sensitivity analysis; CO2 storage; Enhanced oil recovery; Life cycle analysis; Life-cycle GHG emissions; National Energy Technology Laboratory; Natural gas processing; Natural gas processing plants; U.S. Department of Energy; Enhanced recovery; anthropogenic source; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; crude oil; enhanced oil recovery; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; natural gas; oil production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052862123

Peabody Drive, Champaign, IL  61820, United States","Laboratory tests were conducted in a triaxial load frame with acoustic emission and transmission capability to investigate mechanisms that might be initiating the microseismicity experienced in CO2 injection operations. Although often related to reactivation of mapped faults or local fracturing due to reduced injectivity, the case of the Illinois Basin – Decatur Project is used here to illustrate the need for better understanding of what triggers microseismic events in relatively large permeability, good reservoir candidates. There, microseismicity has occurred in the CO2 storage target formation, the Mt. Simon sandstone, as well as in the underlying Precambrian basement. The microseismicity in the Mt. Simon sandstone occurred ahead of CO2 plume arrival and at relatively low injection pressure conditions, well below the fracturing pressure at the injection well. A hypothesis is suggested for the occurrence of such events in the field, whereby critically stressed planes are activated by the passage of the pressure front at injection start; these faults are small and thus not visible in the seismic survey. In order to test this hypothesis, sandstone plugs were prepared by two different methods to incorporate a fracture plane, which we attempted to reactivate by pore pressure pulses. The reactivation was successful at low pressure for a fracture created in the laboratory at reservoir conditions but was unsuccessful except at a much higher pore pressure in a saw-cut artificial fracture. The results suggest that tortuous, rough stress-induced fractures may be easier to reactivate because of the higher probability that sections are already favorably oriented with respect to critical shear stress at a low pore pressure increase. Saw-cut fractures may close completely under isotropic stress loading and may be difficult to activate unless exactly oriented with respect to critical shear stress at a low pore pressure increase. Acoustic emission accompanying fracture reactivation was also recorded and analyzed. This revealed a different event distribution energy between creating and reactivating the fracture. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Acoustic emission; Fracture; Saw-cut; Shear strain; Triaxial test","Acoustic emissions; Carbon dioxide; Fracture; Injection (oil wells); Petroleum reservoir engineering; Pore pressure; Pressure effects; Sandstone; Seismic waves; Seismology; Shear strain; Shear stress; Stress analysis; Critical shear stress; Experimental investigations; Fracture reactivation; Fracturing pressure; Low injection pressure; Precambrian basement; Reservoir conditions; Transmission capability; Acoustic emission testing; acoustic emission; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; experimental study; fracture; pore pressure; sandstone; seismicity; shear strain; triaxial test; Illinois Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052454046

This participation should comply with the utility restrictions with respect to power oscillations at the point of common coupling (PCC). Consequently, there is a need for battery energy storage system (BESS) to fulfill this task. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization (MOO) methodology that aims at maximizing the revenues of the PV based EV (PV-EV) station while minimizing the BESS capacity fading simultaneously. The objectives are to be met under the power fluctuations restriction imposed by the hosting grid at the point of common coupling (PCC). The proposed methodology provides detailed modelling of the dynamics of the BESS as well as the EV parking garage behavior. The MOO problem is solved by the augmented ε-constrained (AUGMECON2). The results showed the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in achieving the aforementioned objectives. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was performed to show the effect of neglecting one of the objectives on the other, and the effect of the power fluctuations limit constraint on the objectives of concern in this study. Moreover, the results showed the adverse effect of neglecting the battery's detailed modelling on the battery's lifetime.

The approach is demonstrated for a 3-node network and a 9-node network for a simulated year with hourly load and solar data for each unique microgrid agent. Results are compared against baseline networks without trading enabled to quantify a 3.6% and 5.4% reduction in the levelized cost of energy, respectively, with trading enabled for the 3-node and 9-node cases. Local energy storage capacities are varied to examine impact on the levelized cost of energy and trading behaviors. Results indicate that trading between microgrids reduces the levelized cost of energy for each individual node and the whole network, and that certain trends emerge between agents that allow some microgrids to operate at a lower cost than others. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Microgrid networks; Microgrids; Multi-agent; Power trading; Transactive energy","Cost reduction; Digital storage; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Multi agent systems; Power markets; Micro grid; Micro-grid networks; Multi agent; Power trading; Transactive energy; Commerce; emissions trading; energy market; energy resource; energy storage; negotiation process; network analysis; scale effect; utility sector",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051376602

However, such technology results in simultaneously running multiple foreground processes, which increases the power consumption of a smartphone and reduces its battery lifetime. We present an integrated system-level resource management framework that aims to minimize the total energy consumption of a smartphone with negligible impact on the quality of service (QoS) of applications whose resource usage characteristics are not precisely known offline or vary over time. Our proposed solution: 1) leverages applications' offline profiles to detect instantaneous phase changes (i.e., dynamic changes in resource usage patterns) of the workload of a given application at runtime and 2) adaptively adjusts both voltage and frequency settings of the processor and memory bandwidth to achieve the most energy-efficient configuration subject to QoS constraints. Our approach is also able to progressively reduce the energy consumption of newly installed real-world applications for which there exists no prior resource usage data. Experiments on a Nexus 6 smartphone show that our approach achieves an average energy reduction of 23% (19%) and up to 31% (27%) compared to existing work (and default Android governor) for different combinations of real-world applications running side-by-side in split-screen mode. For applications with no prior resource usage data, the proposed framework saves up to 22% (18%) of energy within at most 14 s when compared to existing work (and default Android governor). © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Android; application profiles; energy management; phase detection; runtime adaptation; smartphones","Android (operating system); Anthropomorphic robots; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Governors; Smartphones; Storage allocation (computer); Androids; Humanoid robot; Memory management; Multiple applications; Resource management framework; Resource usage patterns; Side-by-side execution; Total energy consumption; Quality of service",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050979188

Infrared spectroscopy analyses suggested successful crosslinking between all varieties of SMA and PEI. Coatings were evaluated in their inherent form (cationic), and chlorinated as N-halamines. Surface concentration of primary amines ranged from 350 to 900 nmol/cm2, and N-halamine concentration ranged from 90 to 130 nmol/cm2, with values varying depending on SMA molecular weight. Surface energy decreased with increasing molecular weight of SMA. Optimal cross-linker molecular weight was determined based on antimicrobial performance, where the coated PP with 6 kDa SMA demonstrated enhanced biocidal effect against Escherichia coli O157:H7 in its chlorinated form. Further, the antimicrobial coating demonstrated efficacy between ∼3 and &gt;5 logarithmic reductions in its unchlorinated and chlorinated forms against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Pseudomonas fluorescens.

Large, power-hungry register files are required in GPUs to support the simultaneous execution of thousands of threads on the hardware. Prior work proposed reducing register access energy by adding a small register cache (RC) to the GPU. The cache stores recently referenced registers and services subsequent accesses to these registers, reducing accesses to the main register file. Later work obtained further energy savings by replacing this cache with a compiler-managed scratchpad. We note that registers are allocated to the cache dynamically and reactively whereas registers are allocated to the scratchpad statically and proactively. Our insight is that these allocation schemes are complimentary because the cache leverages runtime information unavailable to the compiler and the scratchpad leverages compile time information unavailable to the cache. Further, there exist register access patterns that are easily captured by one structure but for which the other structure is ineffective. Instead of implementing either an RC or scratchpad alone, we propose dividing temporary register storage capacity between a cache and a scratchpad in order to capture a broader range of register accesses. Given 12 KB of storage per streaming multiprocessor, our hybrid design reduces register energy to 38.7% of the baseline, compared to 47.9% for a RC and 47.1% for a register scratchpad. © 2018 IEEE.","Compiler; energy efficiency; graphics processing unit (GPU); microarchitecture; register file","Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Computer hardware; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Hardware; Memory architecture; Program compilers; Throughput; compiler; Kernel; Message systems; Micro architectures; Register files; Registers; Resource management; Graphics processing unit",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050378902

One of the major challenges is to obtain a strong interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) for sufficient thermal stability during data storage. Here we investigate magnetic anisotropy energies (MAEs) in the ferromagnet (FM)/W structure with different FM materials and interface insertions. We find that the Fe/W interface exhibits a remarkable PMA, whereas the Co/W interface displays a large in-plane anisotropy, which reduces the PMA in the MgO/CoFeB/W structure. By inserting a thin Fe layer at the CoFe/W interface, the interfacial PMA can be enhanced to 3.34 mJ/m2.

Pd-based zeolites (BEA, SSZ-13) with different SAR (Si-to-Al ratio) were used for PNA investigation, and Pd/Ce/Al2O3 catalyst was used as a reference for comparison. In this study, NOx adsorption is investigated at low temperature (80 °C) and it is released during a temperature ramp (to 400 °C) under various gas feed composition. Moreover, detailed characterization was performed using BET, XRD, XPS, TPO, STEM and ICP-SFMS and the stored NO species was studied using in-situ DRIFTS. The addition of CO to the storage mixture resulted in that for Pd/zeolites with low and medium SAR the binding energy for NO was increased. In addition, NO was stored in larger quantities, especially for the Pd/SSZ-13 samples. However, for Pd/BEA (SAR = 300) no such stable NO species was formed and for Pd/Ce/Al2O3 the CO addition was even negative. Moreover, in-situ NO DRIFTS showed that there was large amount of nitrosyls on ionic palladium for the Pd/zeolites with low and medium SAR, indicating that a significant fraction of the palladium was in ion-exchanged positions, while this peak was small for the Pd/BEA (SAR = 300) and non-existing for Pd/Ce/Al2O3. Thus, CO addition is beneficial for Pd species that are in ion-exchanged positions, but this is not the case for Pd particles and this can explain the observations that CO is only beneficial for Pd/zeolites with low and medium SAR. Moreover, experiments with similar SAR [Pd/BEA (SAR = 25) and Pd/SSZ-13 (SAR = 24)], showed that there is larger stability of the stored NOx in the small pore Pd/SSZ-13. © 2018, The Author(s).","Al2O3; BEA; DRIFTS; Palladium; Passive NOx adsorbers (PNA); SSZ-13; TPD","Adsorption; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Binding energy; Catalysts; Cerium; Ion exchange; Nitrogen oxides; Temperature; Temperature programmed desorption; Zeolites; Adsorbers; DRIFTS; Gas feed composition; Large amounts; Low temperatures; NOx adsorption; SSZ-13; Temperature ramp; Palladium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049664785

To overcome this challenge, microgrids have been advocated as a viable solution to reduce variability and uncertainty associated with renewable generation by rescheduling their energy generation and storage resources based on grid flexibility requirements. In this paper, we propose an incentive mechanism design to motivate microgrids to participate in the peak ramp minimization problem for the system. By offering reimbursement for each microgrid to deviate from the original optimal operation point, the ramping capability requirement to match supply demand can be significantly reduced. We model and analyze the economic interaction between the distribution system operator (DSO) and microgrids using the Nash bargaining theory. The Nash bargaining solution (NBS) can be obtained by solving the centralized social welfare maximization problem. However, due to the distributed topology of the power network as well as independent decision-making nature of microgrids, the centralized design is not suitable for practical implementation. Therefore, we propose two distributed algorithms to achieve the NBS using the alternating direction method of multipliers decomposition technique, which can execute in either synchronous fashion or asynchronous fashion. The simulation results demonstrate the convergence performance of the proposed distributed algorithms as well as the efficacy of our model in achieving benefits for both microgrids and the DSO. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","ADMM; distributed algorithms; integrated microgrids; Nash bargaining solution; peak ramp minimization","Decision making; Parallel algorithms; ADMM; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Capability requirements; Decomposition technique; Micro grid; Nash bargaining solution; Nash bargaining theories; Social welfare maximization; Digital instruments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049328544

This paper presents a novel continuous-flow approach to achieve high heat transfer coefficients hw for particle receivers by fluidizing net-downward-flowing particles in a narrow vertical channel bounded by an external irradiated/heated wall and a parallel interior wall with a metal mesh opening that allows the upward-flowing fluidizing gas to exit at the top of the channel. To demonstrate the high hw of this flow configuration, a fluidized bed in a 10 cm × 10 cm × 0.64 cm deep channel was heated through an external aluminosilicate wall with mid-IR quartz lamps that provided external wall heat fluxes up to 20 W cm−2. Extensive heat transfer measurements with fluidized Carbo Accucast ID50 particles (diameters between 150 and 350 μm) in steady-state continuous downward flow and in transient batch mode assessed total hw as functions of particle bed temperatures Tb, bed solids volume fractions αb, and superficial gas velocities Ug. Results showed that the narrow-channel fluidized bed can achieve overall hw as high as 1000 W m−2 K−1. The highest hw were measured at upward Ug between 2 and 4 times the minimum bed fluidization velocities, Umf, which decreased to 0.12 m s−1 for the mean particle diameter at Tb=600°C. Increasing Ug further above Umf decreased hw due to an associated decrease in αb. hw increased strongly with Tb in part, because gas-phase conductivity and the radiative heat transfer contribution increased with Tb. The extensive measurements were fit to a modified version of the Nusselt number correlation by Molerus (1992). For αb⩾0.1, the Molerus correlation with adjusted dependence on excess fluidization velocity (Ug-Umf) provided an excellent fit to the measured convective fraction of hw (with &lt;10% error). Adding the radiation component with the Molerus correlation provides an effective tool for calculating hw for this counterflow fluidized bed configuration. A simple analysis explored the impact of such high hw for an indirect receiver design with angled external walls to spread solar aperture fluxes. Results from the analysis indicated that total hw=1000 W m−2 K−1 can enable solar collection efficiencies approaching 90% with external wall temperatures Tw,ext≈1020°C. This potential performance motivates further exploration of this fluidized bed configuration for particle receivers for CSP applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bubbling fluidization; Concentrating solar power; Fluidized bed; Particle heat transfer; Thermal energy storage","Fluidization; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Petroleum prospecting; Solar energy; Thermal energy; Bubbling fluidization; Concentrating solar power; Heat transfer measurements; Mean particle diameter; Nusselt number correlation; Radiative heat transfer; Solids volume fraction; Superficial gas velocities; Fluidized beds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048549283

In this study, as a novel mechanical activation style, bead milling (BM) was presented and ZnO ore was selected to determine its effectiveness. Results showed that median particle size of ZnO ore could be pulverized to as low as 1/164 of its original value (from ∼29.2 μm to ∼178 nm), indicating much higher activation potential of BM than that of conventional ball milling. Besides, structure destruction, even phase transformation with the direct participation of airborne CO2 occurred. All these processes rendered the superior activation capacity of BM. In view of the extraction promotion, the combination of ultrasound and BM exerted more pronounced effect than those of individual ones, indicating the synergistic effect between extra energy input (by ultrasound) and inner energy storage (by fierce BM). The classic shrinking core model with the product layer diffusion as the rate-controlling step was found to well model the extraction kinetics. The modeling disclosed high capability of ultrasound and BM combination in decreasing the activation energy (Ea) (from 54.6 kJ/mol to 26.4 kJ/mol), while ultrasound, BM could only decrease the Ea to 44.9 kJ/mol, 41.5 kJ/mol, respectively.

The variation of the strain energy and internal friction per period when an alternating stress is applied to the viscoelastic material is discussed which shows that the storage and release of the strain energy are alternately carried out. The internal friction per period is related to the loss modulus. However, it is independent of the energy storage modulus. In addition, the energy storage modulus, loss modulus, tangent of loss angle and internal friction for four viscoelastic constitutive models, i.e., Maxwell model, Kelvin model, Lessersichi model and Jeffreys model, are calculated from which we know that they are all the functions of frequency. When the frequency is zero, the internal friction for the Kelvin model and Jeffreys model are zero, while the Maxwell model and Lessersichi model are infinity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Beams and girders; Constitutive models; Elastic moduli; Energy storage; Internal friction; Storage (materials); Strain energy; Alternating stress; Jeffreys model; Kelvin model; Loss angle; Loss moduli; Maxwell models; Visco-elastic material; Viscoelastic constitutive models; Viscoelasticity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056333975

Improving fuel efficiency is conceived as a sustainable measure in terms of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and overall marine energy use. As such, electrification of ship propulsion has been introduced as a solution for operating at higher efficiency and hence more saving fuel. However, energy efficiency in the context of marine transport is to be more stringent over time as required by International Maritime Organization (IMO). The energy performance indicators to evaluate such requirements include Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI). Several energy efficient methods are therefore proposed to further improve fuel efficiency on board electric vessels. These involve integration of energy storage system, implementation of DC distribution, optimal power distribution and scheduling as well as various operational practices that are currently applicable for existing conventional vessels. The paper summaries the concept of ship energy efficiency in terms of the standard indicators and provide a brief review on the energy efficiency improvement strategies published in literature. The aim of the review is to analyze the methods that are potential to incorporate into the autonomous system of all-electric vessels. The results show a significant variation in reported efficiency gain and thus a combination of various methods is suggested to achieve full potential for emissions reduction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental regulations; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Ship propulsion; Ships; Waterway transportation; Emissions reduction; Energy efficiency design indices (EEDI); Energy efficiency improvements; Energy performance indicators; Energy storage systems; International maritime organizations; Operational indicator; Operational practices; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056329576

NEXUS is developing inexpensive and efficient sustainable energy greenhouse heating technologies that provide affordable and sustainable means to improve the food-growing capacities and the standard of living for farmer communities in rural Appalachia while reducing the use of fossil fuels. This is done by using on-farm biomass resources/wastes such as agricultural waste and wood chips to produce energy. Growing season extension with heated greenhouses increases the availability of local food throughout the year, expands available markets and increases farmers' profits. The 7 m by 10 m greenhouse (conventional hoop) includes an above ground 5,700-liter water storage tank and an aquaculture pond. It is supported by a small-scale pyrolysis system, an anaerobic digestion system, solar thermal, and compost heating. The heat from various heating methods is delivered and stored in the water storage tank inside the greenhouse. An Arduino module controls the flow rate of water from the tank to various heat exchangers based on temperature differentials. A closed loop heat exchanger circulates heated water from the tank to the aquaculture pond to maintain an optimal temperature for tilapia growth. The pond also acts as a thermal storage, and holds/distributes heat to the greenhouse. The main purpose of this study is to test the integrated sustainable energy heating system for growing season extension with less energy cost. Our preliminary result shows that compared to a conventional space heating system, about 30% of energy was saved to keep the greenhouse temperature available for growing by radiation from the water storage tank. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Anaerobic digestion; Aquaculture; Composting; Energy conservation; Food storage; Fossil fuels; Greenhouses; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Heating equipment; Lakes; Space heating; Sustainable development; Tanks (containers); Thermal processing (foods); Wood products; Greenhouse heating; Greenhouse temperature; Multi-disciplinary teams; Optimal temperature; Sustainable energy; Sustainable technology; Temperature differential; Water storage tanks; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056318647

The C-EMS is in charging of them. With the management of C-EMS, for the power system, the building-scale hybrid microgrid can be considered as a four-quadrant controllable node, which means it can be controlled to either generate or consume reactive and active power to the power system. In addition, based on wireless communication, the C-EMS receives the command of cloud management centre and make the microgrid operate at the assigned power. Therefore, numerous C-EMS can be managed via the cloud manage centre, which improves the controllability of the power system.

Nevertheless, power generation from renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy, is highly dependent on suitable weather conditions and therefore highly fluctuating. Thus, alternatives to compensate fluctuations in the energy production are necessary. Biogas plants have the potential to balance energy generation fluctuations and work independently from unstable weather. Experiments on laboratory scale showed that the storage of food waste had only a marginal impact on its energy content. A rapid acidification due to a lactic acid fermentation leads to a pH decrease and concomitant organic acids increase, preserving the stored organic waste. The pH dropped from initially 4.8 to 4 within the first 2 days of storage. It declined until day 10 to 3.6 and stayed at this level until the end of the experiment. Due to a low pH and a high VFA concentration, only minor amounts of gas were produced during storage. No formation of explosive gas mixtures was detected during the storage. Therefore, no safety precautions are necessary to avoid danger from explosion. The results obtained in laboratory were confirmed by experiments on real scale. Thus, pre-condition of organic waste for a flexible feeding and demand-oriented energy supply is feasible to balance energy generation fluctuations. © Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2018.","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Demand-oriented energy supply; Organic waste",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063140660

The thermal energy storage (TES) benefits CSP plants to produce electricity during temporary weather transients and peak-load demand hours. However, the main drawback of the CSP plants is the high investment costs. To improve the economic viability, it is necessary to design CSP plants appropriately. In this study, an optimal co-allocation model of solar field and TES for CSP plants considering with the operation demand of power system is developed to deal with the tradeoff between investment costs and benefits. To consider realistic operating constraints account for the interaction between hourly variability, the uncertainties of solar irradiation and wind power are characterised by a set of scenarios.

Novel applications such as smart textiles, where portable electronics are coupled to fabrics, are expected to become a worldwide trend when they overcome some limitations, especially with the energy storage systems used to power them. It is in this context where a flexible battery with the shape of a fiber is of importance. Electrospinning is a versatile synthesis technique where micro and nano fibers can be obtained. When these fibers are conducted onto a substrate it is possible to produce materials with different characteristics and morphologies. In this work, Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) was synthesized as anode material for li-ion batteries and was further characterized. LTO is attractive as it presents characteristics such as high thermal stability, relatively high volumetric capacity and high cyclability. The synthesis of this material was developed in two steps. First, a precursor solution containing a spinnable polymer, and titanium and lithium salts, which were dissolved in a mixture of solvents, was subjected to a process of electrospinning. Then, the obtained fibers were calcined at temperatures between 650 and 850 °C for 7-10 hours in air or argon.

As the electrocatalysts, graphene is more remarkable in electrochemical reactions. Additionally, heteroatoms doping with metal-free materials can obtain unique structure and demonstrate excellent electrocatalytic performance. In this work, we proposed a facile method to prepare bifunctional electrocatalyst which was constructed by nitrogen, sulfur doped graphene (NSG), which demonstrate superior properties with high activity and excellent durability compared with Pt/C and IrO2 for oxygen reduction (OR) and oxygen evolution (OE) reactions. Accordingly, these phenomena are closely related to the synergistic effect of doping with nitrogen and sulfur by rationally regulating the polarity of carbon in graphene. The current work expands the method towards carbon materials with heteroatom dopants for commercialization in energy-related reactions. © 2018 by the authors.

Harnessing solar radiation holds the answer to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. It is the most abundant energy resource and could meet humans’ future energy needs. The efficient conversion of solar radiation into stable, energy-dense liquid energy carriers that can use existing or adapt global supply chains for storage, shipping, and distribution is the key to large-scale deployment of solar energy at gigaton levels. Liquid sunshine is the vision of combining the sun's energy with carbon dioxide and water to produce green liquid fuels. CO2 released on using these fuels is recycled back into the environment, thus maintaining an ecologically balanced cycle. Multi-source and multi-purpose alcohols are optimal candidate fuels. Methanol and ethanol are actionable first targets with gigaton production potential. The intertwined goals of economic growth, environmental conservation, and energy security (3E) are pressing global challenges of our time. The paper discusses solutions to 3E goals, particularly in the context of developing countries that are most affected by climate change and local environmental degradation. 3E goals call for “common man solutions”; cheap, clean energy that can help combat hazardous pollution threatening public health and break the mutually reinforcing downward spiral of human poverty and environmental degradation. Alcohols are clean, affordable, multi-source, multi-purpose fuels that can rise to the call. The liquid sunshine roadmap charts stepwise technology advancements from intermediate technologies such as natural gas renewable hybrid systems to green systems for methanol production entirely from renewable energy. Intermediate solutions such as hybrid alcohols build production capacity, establish downstream markets, and begin the adaptation of existing supply chain infrastructure for subsequent widespread market penetration of alcohols in the global energy market. Hybrid alcohols also provide the “breathing space” until green technologies reach maturity for commercial production of green alcohols. Looking ahead, green alcohols and electricity can function as the dual pillars of green energy systems, with alcohol reservoirs forming the backbone. Such green energy systems can support myriad applications and services to build a sustainable future. Replacing fossil fuels with renewables will require efficient carriers of the sun's energy at gigaton scale. The diagram illustrates an ecologically balanced cycle where green alcohols are produced by combining sunshine with CO2 and H2O drawn from the environment and returned to the environment. Only the sun's energy is consumed in the cycle. Methanol, an example of a green alcohol, is a multi-purpose liquid energy carrier of the Sun's energy. It can also function as “liquid hydrogen” and “liquid electricity.” © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","conservation; energy security; environmental; green energy; liquid sunshine; sustainability; sustainable development","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Commerce; Conservation; Developing countries; Energy policy; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Hybrid systems; Liquefied gases; Methanol; Natural gasoline plants; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Commercial productions; environmental; Environmental conservation; Global energy market; Green energy; Large-scale deployment; Methanol production; Technology advancement; Energy efficiency; alcohol; conservation management; developing world; energy resource; future prospect; methanol; pollution control; public health; sustainability; sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056422182

However, the adoption of Li-S batteries to date has been severely plagued by the polysulfide shuttling effect, whereby polysulfide molecules dissolve into the electrolyte and shuttle across the separator to react with the anode materials, leading to a rapidly fading capacity. Herein, by directly coating a thin layer of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/sodium lignosulfonate (SL) composite on the standard polypropylene (PP) separator, we produce a rGO@SL/PP separator with abundant negatively charged sulfonic groups in the porous lignin network, which effectively suppress the translocation of the negatively charged polysulfide (PS) ions without compromising the transport of positively charged Li+ ions. Using the rGO@SL/PP separator, we demonstrate a highly robust Li-S battery with a capacity retention of 74% over 1,000 cycles. This study defines an effective strategy to inhibit the PS shuttling effect for highly robust Li-S batteries. High-density energy storage is critical for many technologies. Li-S batteries are of particular interest for their high theoretical capacity up to 1,675 mAh g−1. However, the Li-S battery today is seriously plagued by that polysulfide shuttling effect, thich can lead to rapid capacity fading, preventing long-term stable operation for commercial deployment. Here we report the design of a negatively charged graphene composite separator for effective suppression of the polysulfide shuttling effect, whereby a negatively charged 3D porous structure effectively inhibits the translocation of negatively charged polysulfide ions to enable highly robust Li-S batteries. Such a separator may be easily integrated into other optimized devices by simply replacing the traditional separators with the newly designed separators without modifying the electrode structure, and thus may be readily implemented with the most advanced developments in the field to exert a rapid impact on practical technologies. A graphene composite separator with abundant sulfonic groups is prepared by directly polymerizing hexamethylene diisocyanate with reduced graphene oxides and sodium lignosulfonates, followed by a simple filtration process. The rich negative charge in the composite separator effectively suppresses the translocation of the negatively charged polysulfide ions to enable highly robust lithium-sulfur batteries. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","graphene oxide; lithium-sulfur battery; polysulfide shuttling; separator","Anodes; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Graphene; Graphene oxide; Ions; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Polypropylene oxides; Polypropylenes; Polysulfides; Separators; Commercial deployment; Effective suppression; Electrode structure; Hexamethylene diisocyanate; Reduced graphene oxides; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Sodium lignosulfonates; Theoretical capacity; Lithium sulfur batteries; chemical compound; composite; electrolyte; energy storage; three-dimensional modeling; Anodes; Electrolytes; Ions; Lithium Compounds; Polysulfides; Separators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056406326

Recently, we revealed the atomic structure of these reactive and sensitive battery materials and their SEIs using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). However, the SEI nanostructure's fundamental role and effect on battery performance remain unclear. Here, we use cryo-EM to discover the function of two distinct SEI nanostructures (i.e., mosaic and multilayer) and correlate their stark effects with Li metal battery performance. We identify fluctuations in crystalline grain distribution within the SEI as the critical feature differentiating the mosaic SEI from the multilayer SEI, resulting in their distinct electrochemical stripping mechanisms. Whereas localized Li dissolution occurs quickly through regions of high crystallinity in the mosaic SEI, uniform Li stripping is observed for the more ordered multilayer SEIs, which reduces Li loss during battery cycling by a factor of three. This dramatic performance enhancement from a subtle change in SEI nanostructure highlights the importance of cryo-EM studies in revealing crucial failure modes of high-energy batteries at the nanoscale. Batteries with high energy density are actively being pursued for applications in transportation and grid-level energy storage. Although high-energy battery chemistries exist, the fundamental mechanisms governing their failure modes are not well known at the atomic level. In particular, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is a critical battery interface that forms on all lithium battery anodes whose exact mechanistic function is poorly understood at the atomic scale. It has been widely believed that the SEI chemistry is the major factor in regulating performance. In our present work using cryoelectron microscopy, we show for the first time that it is instead the SEI nanostructure that ultimately dictates battery performance. This surprising yet consistent finding provides an entirely new direction to explore for engineering the SEI nanostructure in battery materials. The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) forms on all lithium battery anodes during operation and dictates their performance. Using cryoelectron microscopy, we stabilize these reactive materials for atomic-scale observation and correlate their nanostructure with battery performance. By imaging at various stages of battery operation, we reveal that the distribution of crystalline domains within the SEI is critical for the uniform transport of lithium ions. This establishes the important role that the SEI nanostructure plays in determining the performance of a battery. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","batteries; coulombic efficiency; cryo-EM; Li metal anode; solid electrolyte interphase","Anodes; Atoms; Corrosion; Crystalline materials; Lithium-ion batteries; Medical imaging; Multilayers; Nanostructures; Seebeck effect; Solar cells; Solid electrolytes; Coulombic efficiency; Cryo-electron microscopies (cryo- em); Cryo-electron microscopy; cryo-EM; Electrochemical stripping; Li metal; Performance enhancements; Solid electrolyte interphase; Lithium batteries; electrolyte; ion; lithium; microscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054135854

Given its relatively low heating-value and several issues concerning its storage and transportation, methane upgrading to liquid fuels is of particular interest. Microbial methane conversion/utilization and upgrading is gaining increasing interest due to its high conversion efficiency. In this study we computationally compare aerobic and anaerobic microbial pathways for CH4-oxidation and discuss theoretically achievable biomass yields as well as the possibility for building synthetic biological production platforms for liquid fuels. Specifically, the presented in-silico work investigates the potential of microbial methane upgrading in a metabolic network analysis by means of elementary flux modes. Aerobic fixation of methane via conversion of methane to methanol by a methane monooxygenase (MMO) and different subsequent formaldehyde assimilation pathways (Serine-cycle, RuMP, XMP/DHA-pathway) is compared with anaerobic pathways for oxidation of methane (AOM) by means of reverse-methanogenesis or via a presumed glycyl-radical enzyme, which uses fumarate for activation of methane. The different pathways for aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation are compared in different central carbon-metabolism envelopes in order to identify highest achievable carbon yields. The capability of efficient CO2 fixation, as well as energy preservation in form of reducing equivalents is identified as crucial to enable high yields, which ranged from 22 100%. The potential of the different microbes to grow on these gas streams is assessed by means of the maximum achievable biomass yield and the CO2/CH4 uptake ratio. CO2 co-utilization, by transferring reducing power between the two co-substrates, is highest, when combining reverse-methanogenesis with the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, effectively replacing the need for H2 with CH4. Further, the possibility to upgrade methane into liquid (drop-in) bio-fuels is investigated. Established routes to methanol, ethanol, C4-alcoholes and farnesene are evaluated in the most promising substrate-pathway/organism combinations.

Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculation of H and H2 adsorption on Pt(111), H(a) adatom strongly interacts with surface Pt; while H2 weakly adsorbs on Pt(111). H(a) adatoms stably occupy the face-centered cubic sites on Pt(111) which agrees with the experimental LERS observations. By using kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation, the qualitative effects of the kinetic parameters on the H2 TDS spectra indicate that the H2 desorption peaks shift to the low temperature with increasing pre-exponential factor and decreasing desorption barrier. Simultaneously, the desorption peaks shift downwards and broaden to two peaks with the increase of the lateral interaction energy among H(a) adatoms. Using the kMC simulation based on DFT calculation, the predicted H2 TDS spectra are well consistent with the experimental ones. It unanimously proves that the two peaks of TDS spectra are derived from the lateral interactions among H(a). This work provides the intrinsic kinetics of H(a) and H2 on Pt(111) at an atomic level, and gives insight into the development of hydrogenation catalysts. © 2018 by the authors.

The topic has attracted extensive research effort, aiming to achieve better energy harvesting, storage, conversion, desalination and separation, sample concentration, stochastic sensing, and so on. In this report, dynamic ion concentration polarization inside charged conical nanopores, one of the two characteristics to describe the electrical double layer (EDL) structure (charge distribution and potential profile), is quantified. The hysteresis in the ion transport or redistribution in single nanopores is determined from the pinched current–potential loops by time-dependent electrokinetic measurements. The extent of polarization in ion concentrations over different timescales, or residual charges during the transition from one ion distribution/EDL structure to another, is quantitated from the area enclosed in the hysteresis current loops. The ratio of the residual charges during the high/low conductivity states is correlated with the current ratio at the threshold potentials (rectification factor), which, in turn, serves as a convenient parameter to estimate the charge transport hysteresis. By adjusting the solution pH and ionic strength, and under different potential sweeping rates, the dynamics of ion enrichment or depletion is elucidated, respectively, and successfully described with a simple capacitive charging model. Taken together with our previous reports of the memristive ion transport in conical nanopores/nanopipettes and the physical meaning of the unique non-zero cross-point potential, a comprehensive view of the charge redistribution and EDL dynamics at nanoscale interfaces is offered. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We report here the quantification of catalytic activity of single Au144 nanoclusters towards hydrogen evolution reaction in mixed organic media. The electrocatalytic amplification by the proton reduction reaction was used to detect current spikes produced by collisions of single Au144 nanoclusters (1.6 nm in diameter) with a carbon ultramicroelectrode. Relatively short (ms-scale) current spikes were recorded at the naturally hydrophilic carbon surface, while longer (seconds) collision current responses were observed at the hydrophobic carbon fibre electrode treated by acetone. The kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction at a single Au nanocluster was evaluated by measuring the amplitudes of current spikes at different overpotentials. The relationship between the current amplitude and the overpotential yielded a linear Tafel plot with the 114 mV/decade slope. This approach is potentially useful for quantifying the electron-transfer kinetics at singe catalytic nanoclusters and larger nanoparticles. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the aromatic rings in organic electrode materials are inaccessible for Na+-ion storage. Here, we have designed a wavy-layered 3D structure of metal-organic compound zinc perylenetetracarboxylates (Zn-PTCA) with stretched space between adjacent perylene planes, which enables aromatic rings activated as Na+-ion storage sites. Such Zn-PTCA delivers a high specific capacity of 357 mAh g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 within the potential range of 0.01–2 V versus Na+/Na, corresponding to an eight-electron-transfer process. Experiments and calculations revealed that both C=O groups and aromatic rings are involved in the Na insertion processes. We believe that the present strategy can open up an avenue for developing a big family of 3D open-framework-structured organic materials for application in high-capacity Na+-ion batteries. Designing 3D open-framework structures to activate sp2-hybridized carbons in aromatic rings as Na+-ion storage redox sites, which are inaccessible for Na ions in many organic materials, has proved to be an effective strategy for increasing the specific capacity. Here, the metal-organic compound zinc perylenetetracarboxylates (Zn-PTCA) with 3D wavy-layered structure is investigated as an anode material to disclose the Na+-ion storage amount and active redox sites. After Zn2+ coordinates with the organic ligand, the perylene planes are stretched by the [Zn(COO)2O] infinite chain and form an open space between the adjacent perylene planes. Such 3D open channels enable Na+ ions to approach aromatic rings, resulting in a reversible insertion process with eight Na+ ions, which can accommodate six more Na+ ions than corresponding neatly pillared-layer-structured sodium perylenetetracarboxylates (Na-PTCA). A metal-organic compound designed with an extremely stable 3D open-framework structure enables the aromatic rings in organic ligand to be activated as Na+ storage redox sites. A large number of aromatic structures can be constructed into a 3D metal-organic framework for high-capacity electrode materials. © 2018","anode; high capacity; metal-organic frameworks; multiple-electron transfer; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy; sodium-ion batteries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056377012

The widely distributed heating network affords high heat flexibility, which reflects in the mismatch between energy production value (EPV) and energy consumption value (ECV). The concept of generalized energy storage system (GESS) is introduced in this paper. To describe the relationship and build thermoelectric energy hub (EB) model considering heating network flexibility, temperature is employed as characteristic quantity.

Herein, we report a facile pressure-driven oriented assembly approach to synthesize an unprecedented type of dehiscent mesoporous TiO2 microspheres with radial mesopore channels and oriented rutile crystallites. By varying the concentrated HCl amount, we have been able to produce TiO2 microspheres with well-controlled rutile/anatase phase ratio. By further manipulating the reaction conditions including solvent evaporation time and hydrothermal temperature, the oriented growth with tunable crevices can also be well manipulated. Such dehiscent mesoporous TiO2 microspheres have exhibited great permeability and excellent photocatalytic properties for H2 generation. We believe that the high structural complexity and predictability of this method offers great opportunities in enhancing the performance of TiO2-based materials. The development of porous materials and their applications has been in great demand recently. However, the progress in rational synthesis of porous semiconductors remains unproductive. Here, we have demonstrated a hydrothermal method to synthesize a novel type of mesoporous TiO2 microsphere with highly controllable structure. By regulating the synthetic conditions, the mesoporous TiO2 can be well controlled with oriented mesopores and lattices, tunable crystalline phase, and tailored open crevices. The resulting mesoporous TiO2 microspheres exhibit excellent penetration properties and photocatalytic activities, which is attributed to their unique mesostructures associated with accessible high surface area and particular architectures. Such a simple method, which is able to fabricate mesoporous TiO2 with controlled architectures and crystallites, is expected to be applied to produce numerous delicate nanostructures at moderate conditions for potential applications, such as catalysts, energy storage, and biosensors.

To reduce fuel consumption, avoid over-sizing of DG, and further enable a smooth resynchronization to main grid, a hybrid Auxiliary Power Supply (APS) system is designed with a combination of DGs, Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs), and battery Energy Storage System (ESS). Different from the typical industrial solution, this hybrid APS system uses not only DGs, but also WTGs to supply part of the auxiliary load when there is wind blowing for reducing fuel consumption and the corresponding refuelling works; moreover, the wind turbine converters can provide reactive power for balancing the charging power from the cable array inside the OWF, so as to avoid the oversizing of DG itself. ESS are also introduced to further reduce the dependence on the DGs. With enough capacity of ESS, it is even possible to remove DGs while still be able to fulfil the requirement on auxiliary load supply during islanding mode. In this paper: firstly, the cost effectiveness of such hybrid APS is discussed via techno-economic analysis; secondly, two types of hybrid APSs with coordinated hierarchical control architectures are introduced, as well as the control strategy design for both centralized and distributed controllers; thirdly, simulation models are developed in MATLAB/Simulink, where two types of models are included. They are phasor-type model for centralized control strategy verification, and average-type model for distributed control strategy verification. The performance of hybrid APS models is validated under typical working scenarios, and the simulation results show that the control strategy has no high requirement on the communication speed between central controller and distributed controllers. © 2018 Web Portal IOP.

Whereas studies have highlighted the pivotal roles of Tnks in cancer, cherubism, systemic sclerosis, and viral infection, the requirement for Tnks under physiological contexts remains unclear. Here, we report that the loss of Tnks or its muscle-specific knockdown impairs lifespan, stress tolerance, and energy homeostasis in adult Drosophila. We find that Tnks is a positive regulator in the JNK signaling pathway, and modest alterations in the activity of JNK signaling can strengthen or suppress the Tnks mutant phenotypes. We further identify JNK as a direct substrate of Tnks. Although Tnks-dependent poly-ADP-ribosylation is tightly coupled to proteolysis in the proteasome, we demonstrate that Tnks initiates degradation-independent ubiquitination on two lysine residues of JNK to promote its kinase activity and in vivo functions. Our study uncovers a type of posttranslational modification of Tnks substrates and provides insights into Tnks-mediated physiological roles. Poly-ADP-ribosylation of Tnks substrates is closely coupled to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Li et al. reveal that Tnks can induce K63-linked ubiquitination to enhance the kinase activity of JNK.

Rather than wasting it to the atmosphere, or burying it underground, CO2 can be combined with water and turned into valuable chemicals and fuels, the process being powered by renewable electricity. Renewable electricity generated by wind and photovoltaics (PV) is making big strides, but is limited by ill-matched supply and demand. In addition, electricity only makes up 20% to 30% of total energy demand. Domestic heating, high temperature/pressure Industrial processes and mobility/transportation gobble up the rest. Mobility and transportation prove particularly difficult to decarbonise. Aviation is a case in point. Battery-powered aircraft are unlikely to become feasible by 2050. Hydrogen has too low an energy density and is haunted by safety issues. Current policy, therefore, is directed at bio fuels. One problem, there is not enough of it. The Fuel vs. Food vs. Flora trilemma of bio-based fuel is unlikely to gain public acceptance. By converting renewable electricity into fuel, power to molecules (P2M), two birds are killed with one stone: providing fuel for long haul transportation and enabling long-term, large-scale energy storage to cover the seasonal mismatch between supply and demand of renewable electricity. Feedstock consists of air-captured carbon or nitrogen and water. Chemically combined, it creates a liquid fuel with greatly enhanced energy density, such as kerosene or ammonia, or gaseous fuel like methane which can replace natural gas in the existing gas network. Direct air capture of CO2 is currently being commercialised. The conversion technology of water and CO2 by electrolysis has recently been extended to novel plasma technology, the sub ject of this paper. For CO2 splitting by plasmolysis, the reduced electric field has been identified as the key parameter explaining and improving the energy efficiency. Energy efficiency by plasmolysis is similar to that of electrolysis, but offers advantages in energy density, upscaling and switching in response to intermittent power with no use of scarce material. A simple model explains the inverse relation between energy efficiency and particle conversion and relates input microwave power to CO2 gas density, plasma dimension and ionisation degree, allowing design parameters for a 100 kW pilot reactor to be specified. Recycling CO2 in combination with P2M is a game-changing technology to meet overall CO2 emission reduction targets. It takes advantage of existing, inexpensive infrastructure for energy storage, transport and distribution. Existing internal combustion engine technology can be maintained where necessary. Close coupled to a remote solar array or an off-shore wind farm it offers a solution to decentralised renewable fuel production at the renewable electricity source. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055722227

In this regard, ionic liquids capable of providing a higher voltage window of operations compared to an aqueous and/or polymer electrolyte can significantly enhance the specific energy densities of EDLCs. Here we demonstrate that EDLCs fabricated using ionic liquid 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium tris (pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate (BMP-FAP) as an electrolyte and few layer liquid-phase exfoliated graphene as electrodes show remarkable performance compared to EDLC devices fabricated with aqueous potassium hydroxide (6M) as well as widely used ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIM-PF6). We found that graphene EDLC’s with BMP-FAP as an electrolyte possess a high specific energy density of ≈25 Wh/kg along with specific capacitance values as high as 200 F/g and having an operating voltage windows of >5 volts with a rapid charge transfer response. These findings strongly indicate the suitability of BMP-FAP as a good choice of electrolyte for high energy density EDLC devices. © 2018 by the authors.

Sensors are low cost devices with limited storage, computation, and power. Finding optimal based routing solutions is a challenging task in IoT because of constraint over nodes and lossy links. IETF standardized the IPv6 based RPL routing protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) in 2012. It selects the ideal routes from a source to a destination node based on certain metrics injected into the Objective Function (OF). Because RPL uses the DODAG topology, it is easy to lead to the rapid depletion of node power at the upper level of the routing topology. Reducing the network energy consumption to prolong the life cycle of network is very important for IoT.

The Qixia Fm is characterized by developed dissolved vugs and fractures, low matrix porosity and strong heterogeneity, so evaluation faults tend to occur if reservoir effectiveness is evaluated by means of the traditional porosity evaluation, and the consequently the predicted gas well productivity is more deviated from the actual measurement. In this paper, the characteristics of Qixia Fm reservoirs in this area were firstly analyzed. Then, the method and criterion of the effectiveness evaluation of Qixia Fm reservoirs in the western Sichuan Basin were established by means of numerical simulation and special logging data processing. And the following research results were obtained. First, surface porosity of matrix pores and secondary dissolved vugs calculated based on the special processing of conventional logging and electric imaging logging can be used to evaluate the reservoir properties of reservoirs. Second, deep and shallow dual lateral logging in combination with electric imaging logging and Stoneley wave energy data can be used to evaluate the filtration capacity of reservoirs. Third, the criterion of effective Qixia Fm reservoirs is established, including storage coefficient ≥0.6, deep lateral resistivity <5000 Ω·m, surface porosity >0.6%, Stoneley wave attenuation ≥10% and comprehensive reservoir evaluation index ≥0.25, and the evaluation criterion can well characterize reservoir quality and gas well productivity. The field application results of this evaluation method and evaluation criterion indicate that the coincidence rate of reservoir effectiveness has increased from 70% to over 90%. Thus, the technical difficulties related to the heterogeneous carbonate reservoir effectiveness evaluation are basically solved. Besides, they provide a basis for the determination of production test layer selection, completion engineering and development scheme so as to cut down the natural gas exploration and development cost. © 2018 Sichuan Petroleum Administration","Adaptability; Comprehensive reservoir quality evaluation index; Effectiveness; Filtration capacity; Logging; Permian; Qixia Fm; Reservoir; Sichuan Basin; Western",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061037949

More transistors are integrated within the same footprint area as the technology node shrinks to deliver higher performance. However, this is accompanied by higher power dissipation that usually exceeds the coping capability of inexpensive cooling techniques. This Power Wall prevents the chip from running at full speed with all the devices powered-on. This is known as the dark silicon problem. Another major bottleneck in CMP development is the imbalance between the CPU clock rate and memory access speed. This Memory Wall keeps the CPU from fully utilizing its compute power. To address both the Power and Memory Walls, we propose a monolithic 3D hybrid architecture that consists of a multi-core CPU tier, a fine-grain dynamically reconfigurable (FDR) field-programmable gate array (FPGA) tier, and multiple resistive RAM (RRAM) tiers. The FDR tier is used as an accelerator. It uses the concept of temporal logic folding to localize on-chip communication. The RRAM tiers are connected to the CPU and FDR tiers through an efficient memory interface that takes advantage of the tremendous bandwidth available from monolithic inter-Tier vias and hides the latency of large data transfers. We evaluate the architecture on two types of benchmarks: compute-intensive and memory-intensive. We show that the architecture reduces both power and energy significantly at a better performance for both types of applications. Compared to the baseline, our architecture achieves an average of 43.1× and 2.5× speedup on compute-intensive and memory-intensive benchmarks, respectively. The power and energy consumption are reduced by 5.0× and 40.5×, respectively, for compute-intensive applications, and 2.0× and 4.2×, respectively, for memory-intensive applications.

However, the isolated operation of DC microgrids, in the case of a power-grid failure, is a key factor limiting their development. In this paper, we analyze the six typical operation modes of an off-grid DC microgrid based on a photovoltaic energy storage system (PV-ESS), as well as the operational characteristics of the different units that comprise the microgrid, from the perspective of power balance. We also analyze the key distributed control techniques for mode transformation, based on the demands of the different modes of operation. Possible reasons for the failure of PV systems under the control of a voltage stabilizer are also explored, according to the characteristics of the PV output. Based on this information, we propose a novel control scheme for the seamless transition of the PV generation units between the maximum PV power tracking and steady voltage control processes, to avoid power and voltage oscillations. Adaptive drooping and stabilization control of the state of charge of the energy storage units are also considered, for the protection of the ESS and for reducing the possibilities of overcharging and/or over-discharging.

To this end, three interest bodies in the MECS were investigated, which included the energy provider, the energy facilitator, and the energy consumer, and a hierarchical optimal economic operation strategy was then presented.

Case studies were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical optimal economic operation strategy, whereby demonstrating that the proposed strategy can achieve rational energy allocation and decrease the energy cost in the MECS compared with traditional energy systems. © 2018 by the authors.","Energy hub; Energy storage system; Hierarchical energy management; Multi-energy carrier system; Optimal operation strategy","Energy management; Hierarchical systems; Nonlinear programming; Economic operations; Energy hubs; Energy storage systems; Hybrid optimization; Interior-point method; Multi energy; Optimal operation strategy; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056109602

In this paper, based on energy hub (EH), the day-ahead hierarchical steady state optimal operation for IES is discussed, in which the coupling natural gas system, electricity transmission system, and district heating system are all considered. Firstly, the model architecture of EH with diverse storage devices, renewable energy, and different energy conversion equipment is proposed and the steady state mathematical model of different energy networks in IES is developed, respectively. Secondly, the day-ahead operating cost of EH is minimized by an optimizing strategy to maximize the benefits of all kinds of energy demand users, where different types of energy power input into EH can be obtained. Then, the day-ahead optimal operation mode for IES considering minimization of operating fuel cost index is proposed via an energy management system, which provides various energy power data that are uploaded from EH.

A comprehensive reliability analysis is performed, which confirms ∼ 90mV and ∼ 10mV (worst-case) sense margin for memory and in-memory logic operation in variations on resistance-area product and tunnel magnetoresistance. We further show that sense margin for in-memory logic computation can be significantly increased by increasing the oxide thickness. Furthermore, we employ bulk bitwise vector operation and data encryption engine as case studies to investigate the performance of our proposed design. IMFlexCom shows ∼ 35× energy saving and ∼ 18× speedup for bulk bitwise in-memory vector AND/OR operation compared to DRAM-based in-memory logic.

Understanding these processes provides new information regarding how to model time-dependent observations associated with seismicity and/or deformation in volcanic areas. In addition, since these ash beds are inherently similar to ash-based concrete, a bridge of knowledge can be built across disciplines in the earth sciences and engineering. This paper investigates how the permeability of a volcanic ash cemented with hydrated lime changes upon exposure to carbon dioxide (CO2) in humid and hydrous conditions relevant to natural or human-driven processes such as those found in hydrothermal settings or near wellbores used for secondary oil recovery, CO2 plume geothermal energy, or carbon storage. We characterized samples by their permeability during carbonation and subsequent changes in pore pressure and confining pressure. Products from the reaction of CO2 with the cemented ash matrix reduced permeability and entrapped fluids. The regions within samples permeated with unreacted CO2 were susceptible to fracturing upon rapid depressurization, but only when the effective stress state was sufficiently low. Altogether, the results indicate that lime-cemented volcanic ash beds are particularly suited to act as flow barriers to CO2-rich fluids. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

In nonruminants, saturated FFAs upregulate the hepatic synthesis and secretion of ceramide, which inhibits insulin action. Objective: We aimed to determine whether an increase in plasma FFAs promotes hepatic and plasma ceramide accumulation in dairy cows. Methods: Six nonpregnant, nonlactating Holstein cows were used in a study with a crossover design and treatments consisting of intravenous infusion of either saline (control) or triacylglycerol emulsion (TG; 20 g/h) for 16 h. The feeding level was set at 120% of energy requirements. Blood was collected at regular intervals and liver was biopsied at 16 h. Ceramides, monohexosylceramides (Glc/Gal-Cer), lactosylceramides (LacCer), and sphingomyelins (SMs) in plasma and liver were profiled. Hepatic expression of ceramide synthases was determined. Data were analyzed with the use of mixed models, regressions, and Spearman rank correlations. Results: After 16 h of infusion, plasma FFA concentrations were >5-fold and liver triacylglycerol concentrations were 4-fold greater in TG cows, relative to control. Plasma total and very long-chain ceramide (e.g., C24:0-ceramide) concentrations increased ~4-fold in TG over control by hour 16 of infusion, while C16:0-ceramide were not modified by TG. Infusion of TG increased plasma Glc/Gal-Cer (e.g., C16:0-Glc/Gal-Cer, 4-fold by hour 16) relative to control, but did not alter LacCer or SM concentrations. Hepatic ceramide concentrations increased with TG relative to control (e.g., C24:0-ceramide by 1.7-fold). Hepatic expression of ceramide synthase 2 was 60% greater after TG infusion compared with the control. Circulating ceramides were related to circulating FFA and hepatic triacylglycerol concentrations (e.g., C24:0-ceramide, ? = 0.73 and 0.80, respectively; P < 0.001). Conclusion: Hepatic ceramide synthesis is associated with elevations in circulating FFAs and hepatic triacylglycerol during the induction of hyperlipidemia in dairy cows. This work supports the emerging evidence for the role of ceramide during hepatic steatosis and insulin antagonism in cows. © 2018 Oxford University Press.

Genetic disruption of MC3Rs increases adiposity and blunts responses to fasting, suggesting that increased MC3R signaling could be physiologically beneficial in the long term. Interestingly, several studies have concluded that activation of MC3Rs is orexigenic in the short term. Therefore, we aimed to examine the short- and long-term effects of γ-MSH in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) on energy homeostasis and hypothesized that the effect of MC3R agonism is dependent on the state of energy balance and nutrition. Lentiviral gene delivery was used to induce a continuous expression of γ-Msh only in the ARC of male C57Bl/6N mice. Parameters of body energy homeostasis were monitored as food was changed from chow (6 weeks) to Western diet (13 weeks) and back to chow (7 weeks). The γ-MSH treatment decreased the fat mass to lean mass ratio on chow, but the effect was attenuated on Western diet. After the switch back to chow, an enhanced loss in weight (-15% vs -6%) and fat mass (-37% vs -12%) and reduced cumulative food intake were observed in γ-MSH-treated animals. Fasting-induced feeding was increased on chow diet only; however, voluntary running wheel activity on Western diet was increased. The γ-MSH treatment also modulated the expression of key neuropeptides in the ARC favoring weight loss. We have shown that a chronic treatment intended to target ARC MC3Rs modulates energy balance in nutritional state-dependent manner. Enhancement of diet-induced weight loss could be beneficial in treatment of obesity. © 2018 Society for Endocrinology Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.","Mice; Neuropeptides; Obesity; POMC; γ-MSH","gamma intermedin; glucose; insulin; lentivirus vector; triacylglycerol; uncoupling protein 1; gamma intermedin; Mc3r protein, mouse; melanocortin 3 receptor; adrenal gland; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; arcuate nucleus; Article; body composition; body weight loss; chow diet; controlled study; diet restriction; energy balance; fasting; fat mass; food intake; glucose tolerance test; human; human cell; interscapular brown adipose tissue; lipid storage; long term care; macronutrient; male; mouse; nonhuman; nutrition; nutritional status; obesity; priority journal; triacylglycerol blood level; viral gene delivery system; Western diet; white adipose tissue; animal; body weight; C57BL mouse; food deprivation; genetics; metabolism; motor activity; obesity; Adiposity; Animals; Arcuate Nucleus of Hypothalamus; Body Weight; Diet, Western; Food Deprivation; gamma-MSH; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Motor Activity; Obesity; Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 3; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053939598

Cidea and Cidec are lipid droplet (LD)-associated proteins that promote lipid storage in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT). Using ob/ob/Cidea 2 / 2 , ob/ob/Cidec 2 / 2 , and ob/ob/Cidea 2 / 2 / Cidec 2 / 2 mouse models and CIDE-deficient cells, we studied metabolic regulation during severe obesity to identify ways to maintain metabolic homeostasis and promote antiobesity effects. The phenotype of ob/ob/Cidea 2 / 2 mice was similar to that of ob/ob mice in terms of serum parameters, adipose tissues, lipid storage, and gene expression. Typical lipodystrophy accompanied by insulin resistance occurred in ob/ob/ Cidec 2 / 2 mice, with ectopic storage of lipids in the BAT and liver. Interestingly, double deficiency of Cidea and Cidec activated both WAT and BAT to consume more energy and to increase insulin sensitivity compared with their behavior in the other three mouse models. Increased lipolysis, which occurred on the LD surfaces and released fatty acids, led to activated b-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation in peroxisomes and mitochondria in CIDE-deficient adipocytes. The coordination among LDs, peroxisomes, and mitochondria was regulated by adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa).

Past studies focussed extensively on the estimation of state of charge and state of health of a single cell/battery. However, the focus on the estimation of state of entire battery module is hardly studied. During the actual operation of electric vehicle, the environmental conditions (road slope and climate) and factors such as abnormal voltage and temperature conditions causes the deviations among the battery modules from its equilibrium state. As a result, its power efficiency and the life-cycle decreases. One of the reasons of deviation is the defects in manufacturing of a battery module. For this purpose, the evaluation and estimation of state of battery modules is a priority to have information on which module among the given ones should be discharged first. Therefore, this study proposes the methodology for the evaluation of state of battery modules based on its current and temperature. Firstly, the rules are defined based on experiments to determine the priority for the discharge of each of the six modules. Dataset of 6000 samples obtained comprises of the 12 inputs (temperature and current) and 6 outputs (on-off state of switch). Each output represents the priority of module to be discharged. To analyze this multi-input multi-output dataset, the popular artificial intelligence algorithm namely, artificial neural network with three training algorithms (Levenberg, Scaled conjugate and Bayesian regularization), using a number of neurons from 2 to 20 in the hidden layer is used. It was found that the model obtained using Levenberg algorithm performs the best. © 2018 The Authors.

At the same time, the inflammatory balance is altered and cows exhibit an immune response primed for inflammatory response rather than tolerance. The mechanistic link that might be underlying the immunological effects due to the lack in nutrients is not fully understood. Studies in other species demonstrate an orchestrating role of nutrient-sensing kinases in the determination of immune phenotypes and immune cell proliferation and differentiation. Our primary objective was to investigate changes in energy storage and signaling through the protein kinase B (AKT)/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTOR) pathway in bovine immune cells in the transition period, as well as the association with cytokine expression profiles. A secondary objective was to test if supplementation with branched-chain amino acids alone or in combination with oral propylene glycol had any effect on the measured parameters. To assess cellular energy storage, glycogen concentration was measured by an enzymatic-fluorometric method in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of multiparous Holstein cows (n = 72) at 3 time points in the transition period (21 d before, 7 and 28 d after calving). At the same time points, phosphorylation of proteins in the AKT/mTOR pathway was assessed by immunoblotting in PBMC from 60 animals. Whole-blood leukocyte cytokine gene expression of IL12B, IL6, IL1B, TNF, and IL10 was measured in samples from 50 animals by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR with and without stimulation of samples with 10 ng/mL of lipopolysaccharide. Compared with glycogen concentration of prepartum PBMC, glycogen concentration decreased by 37% on d 7 postpartum. The activation of AKT/mTOR in bovine PBMC postpartum was reduced compared with prepartum values. Results of reverse-transcription quantitative PCR showed an increase in cytokine gene expression postpartum compared with prepartum values. Supplementation with branched-chain amino acids alone or in combination with oral propylene glycol did not alter glycogen storage, AKT/mTOR activity, or inflammatory balance as assessed by the measured parameters in this study. We conclude that the nutrient deficit of the immediate postpartum period is sensed by bovine immune cells, and that it affects their energy storage as well as cellular signaling pathways postpartum. Temporal associations with changes in cytokine gene expression are intriguing and warrant further investigation of the role of this pathway as a possible link between metabolism and immune phenotype postpartum. © 2018 American Dairy Science Association","AKT kinase; inflammation; mTOR kinase; transition","phosphotransferase; animal; bovine; cattle disease; diet; energy metabolism; female; immunology; inflammation; lactation; metabolism; milk; mononuclear cell; puerperium; signal transduction; Animals; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Female; Inflammation; Lactation; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Milk; Phosphotransferases; Postpartum Period; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050357663

Storage modulus E′ and loss modulus E″ of wood with six different levels of MC ranging from 0.6 to 22.0% were determined from − 120 to 40 °C and at multi-frequency range of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 Hz using a TA instruments® Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA 2980). The results showed that a distinct moisture dependency is exhibited by the orthotropic viscoelastic behaviour of Chinese fir wood. With the exception of some apparent activation energy (ΔE) for β-relaxation process, the E′ decreased and the E″ peak temperatures moved towards lower temperature and the ΔE for α-relaxation process became lower with MC increasing in all orthotropic directions, whereby individual decline of E′ and the E″ peak temperatures were affected by MC to different degrees. Besides, a little E″ peak at around 0 °C was only seen in L direction, which could be attributed to the melting of frozen water. Furthermore, the dynamic viscoelastic behavior of wood is also dependent on the measurement frequency. The findings suggest that the orthotropic structure and moisture content have an important influence on the viscoelastic performance in low temperature environment. © 2018, The Japan Wood Research Society.","Chinese fir wood; Low temperature; Moisture content; Orthotropic viscoelasticity; Tension","Activation energy; Moisture; Moisture determination; Relaxation processes; Viscoelasticity; Wood; Apparent activation energy; Chinese fir; Dynamic mechanical analyzer; Low temperature environment; Low temperatures; Tension; Visco-elastic behaviors; Viscoelastic properties; Temperature; Activation Energy; Moisture; Temperature; Tension; Viscoelasticity; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048820936

The modeling facilitates the analysis of transient input and extraction processes for the TES device which uses solid-liquid phase change to store thermal energy. We investigate sensible and latent heat transfer through the unit's matrix structure which contains phase change material (PCM) in the interstitial spacing. The heat transfer is driven by a temperature difference between fluid flow passages and the PCM matrix which experiences sensible heat transfer until it reaches the PCM fusion point; then it undergoes melting or solidification in order to receive, or reject, energy. To capture these physics, we establish a dimensionless framework to model heat transfer in the storage device much like effectiveness-number of transfer units (NTU) analysis methods for compact HX. Solution of the nondimensional governing equations is subsequently used to predict the effectiveness of the transient energy input and extraction processes. The TES is examined within the context of a larger subsystem to illustrate how a high efficiency design target can be established for specified operating conditions that correspond to a variety of applications. The general applicability of the model framework is discussed and example performance calculations are presented for the enhancement of a Rankine power plant via asynchronous cooling. © 2018 by ASME.",,"Extraction; Flow of fluids; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Phase change materials; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Virtual storage; Effectiveness number of transfer units; Extraction process; Governing equations; Operating condition; Performance calculation; Sensible and latent heat transfers; Solid liquid phase change; Temperature differences; Heat exchangers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046885617

To increase the storage density, multilevel cell (MLC) technique was recently introduced to STT-RAM designs at the cost of degraded access speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. Existing MLC STT-RAM cache architectures primarily focus on the performance and energy optimizations but ignore the crucial demand for reliability. In this paper, we propose 'TriZone' - a holistic design scheme for MLC STT-RAM cache to simultaneously meet the requirements of performance, energy, and reliability. Three cache block configurations, namely hard, soft, and mixed, are constructed with the hard-bit, soft-bit, and both hard-bit and soft-bit of MLC STT-RAM, respectively. By observing the difference of these cache blocks, a nonuniform strength ECC (NUS-ECC) is developed to guarantee the operational reliability of a cache block with a variable decoding delay adapting to the needs of error correction (e.g., the number of the erroneous bits). The whole MLC STT-RAM cache is then partitioned into three regions, each of which is composed of different cache blocks. In order to achieve the best tradeoff among performance, energy, and reliability, we then introduce the dynamic cache partitioning to determine the partition of this tri-way MLC STT-RAM cache according to the runtime characteristic of various applications. Experiment results show that compared with conventional performance-driven MLC STT-RAM cache design with pessimistic ECC, TriZone can improve the system performance and energy by averagely 11.7% (10.0%) and 13.3% (15.7%), respectively, for single-threaded (multiprogram) applications.

In this paper, an enthalpy based multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) was developed to calculate the transient phase change conjugate heat transfer with solar radiation inside the green building's PCM roof in the hot summer and cold winter areas of China. The effect of the PCM melting temperature on the variation of the roof internal temperature was investigated and the energy saving characteristic of the PCM roof under an intermittent energy utilization condition was also analyzed by comparing with the performance of the roof filled with sensible insulating materials (SIMs). Then, the life cycle incremental costs and incremental benefits of a PCM roof and SIM roof were studied by using the comprehensive incremental benefit model so that the green building roof could be economically evaluated. The results indicate that a temperature rise inside the roof during summer cooling time could be delayed due to the latent heat of the PCMs. It was also found that the melting temperature and the thickness of the PCM layer should be chosen appropriately for enhancing the energy saving amount of a PCM roof. Based on this, the PCM roof could have a better energy saving capability than the SIM roof. During the winter heating time, as the environment temperature and the room temperature are both below the PCM melting temperature, the PCM roof does not have a latent heat characteristic so that it performs like a SIM roof. Furthermore, due to the high price of PCMs, the incremental cost of green building is increased, which makes the PCM roof have a negative comprehensive incremental benefit. Under this circumstance, developing PCMs with a low price and stable chemical properties is a key scientific bottleneck for a wider application of PCM roofs in the architecture engineering field. © 2018 by the authors.","Comprehensive incremental benefit; Conjugate phase change heat transfer; Hot summer and cold winter area; Lattice Boltzmann method; PCM roof",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054090208

Additional processing steps such as solvent evaporation were required for earlier studies of electrolyte fabrication, which hindered the simultaneous production of electrode and electrolyte in an all-3D-printed battery. Here, a novel method is demonstrated to fabricate hybrid solid-state electrolytes using an elevated-temperature direct ink writing technique without any additional processing steps. The hybrid solid-state electrolyte consists of solid poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) matrices and a Li+-conducting ionic-liquid electrolyte. The ink is modified by adding nanosized ceramic fillers to achieve the desired rheological properties. The ionic conductivity of the inks is 0.78 × 10 −3 S cm−1. Interestingly, a continuous, thin, and dense layer is discovered to form between the porous electrolyte layer and the electrode, which effectively reduces the interfacial resistance of the solid-state battery. Compared to the traditional methods of solid-state battery assembly, the directly printed electrolyte helps to achieve higher capacities and a better rate performance. The direct fabrication of electrolyte from printable inks at an elevated temperature will shed new light on the design of all-3D-printed batteries for next-generation electronic devices. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, traditional supercapacitors are readily damaged, which leads to degraded performance or even failure. To make them more durable and efficient, healable flexible shape memory-based supercapacitors were unprecedentedly explored by a transfer process, in which the conductive nano-carbon networks were decorated with pseudocapacitance materials, followed by embedding them into a shape memory polymer matrix containing healing reagents. The composite exhibited flexibility, supercapacitance and self-healing capability originating from the shape memory effect and healing reagent. The morphologies, thermal, mechanical and capacitive properties, and the self-healability of the composite were investigated. In particular, the influence of the compositions on the healing efficiency was considered. The optimized composite exhibited good capacitance (27.33 mF cm-1), stability (only 4.08% capacitance loss after 1500 cycles) and healable property (up to 93% of the healing efficiency).

Here, by utilizing the air breakdown induced ionized air channel, a direct-current triboelectric nanogenerator (DC-TENG) is designed for harvesting contact-separation mechanical energy. During working process, the charges first transfer from bottom to top electrodes through an external circuit in contact state, then flow back via the ionized air channel created by air breakdown in the separation process. So a unidirectional flow of electrical charges can be observed in the external circuit. With repeating contact-separation cycles, continuous pulsed DC output through the external circuit can be realized. This working mechanism was verified by real-time electrode potential monitoring, photocurrent signal detection, and controllable discharging observation. The DC-TENG can be used for directly and continuously charging an energy storage unit and/or driving electronic devices without using a bridge rectifier. Owing to its simplicity in structure, the mechanism is further applied to fabricate the first flexible DC-TENG. This research provides a significant fundamental study for DC-TENG technology and may expand its application in flexible electronics and flexible self-charging power systems. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The proposed solution is the addition of new elements to the FRM network. The new elements include storage tanks, pipes, and pressure-reducing valves. To evaluate the constraint satisfaction model of mass and energy conservation, the hydraulic EPANET solver (HES) is used with an optimization model to minimize the total cost of changes in the network (new pipes, tanks, and valves). A genetic algorithm was used to evaluate the optimization model. The analysis of the results obtained by the genetic algorithm for the FRM network shows that adequate and balanced pressures were obtained by means of small modifications to the existing network, which entailed minimal costs. Simulations were performed for an extended period, which means that the pressure was obtained by simulation with HSE at one-hour intervals, during the algorithm execution, to verify adequate pressure at a specific point in the system, or to make corrections to ensure proper distribution, this with the aim of having a final optimized network design. © 2018 by the authors.","Constraint satisfaction model; Crossover of variable lengths; EPANET solver; Optimization model","Cost benefit analysis; Mathematical programming; Potable water; Tanks (containers); Constraint Satisfaction; Distribution systems; EPANET solver; Hydraulic networks; Mass and energy conservation; Optimization modeling; Pressure reducing valves; Variable length; Genetic algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053865324

The cause of these problems can be largely related to the electrode material|solid-state electrolyte (SSE) interface, which sets a significant barrier for Li+ ions to transport across. As a result, an in-depth fundamental understanding of the reaction and process occurring at the electrode material|SSE interface is of paramount importance to alleviate the interfacial impedance and enhance the performance of solid-state Li batteries. This Perspective focuses on the Li|SSE interface, points out the critical challenges for a reversible, dendrite-free, and high-rate Li electrode, recapitulates potential resolutions for these challenges, and highlights the significance of advanced research techniques having the ability to interrogate the buried Li|SSE interfaces. Solid-state lithium (Li) batteries are promising candidates to meet the demands for high-performance energy-storage devices in practical applications such as portable electronics, electrical vehicles, and smart grid integration of intermittent renewable energy sources. However, vexing issues such as poor power density, limited cycle life, and rapid performance degradation are frequently observed and are largely related to the imperfect electrode material|solid-state electrolyte interface that sets a high energy barrier or high impedance for Li+ ions to transport across. This perspective focuses on the Li electrode|solid-state electrolyte interface, outlines the reaction and process during the stripping/plating of Li, identifies the most critical challenges for a high-performance Li electrode, points out potential solutions for these challenges, and highlights the significance of advanced research techniques that can be used to interrogate the buried Li electrode|solid electrolyte interfaces. The lithium|solid-state electrolyte interface is a major bottleneck limiting the performance of solid-state lithium batteries. A number of interrelated factors such as physical contact, parasitic reaction, space charge layer, and dendrite growth affect the impedance and the stability of the interface.

In the context of material development for next-generation batteries, here we compare head-to-head organic battery electrode materials (OBEMs) with dominating/competing inorganic materials through analyses of charge storage mechanism, working potential, specific capacity, resource availability, and more. We show that from high-energy lithium batteries to aqueous and all-solid-state batteries, OBEMs can be designed to be sufficiently capable and offer unique feature sets unmatched by other materials. Future research directions toward practical application of OBEMs are discussed. Modern organic electrode materials will potentially enable the latest battery chemistries for meeting the cost, safety, and specific energy requirements of electric vehicles and grid storage. The moderate working potential and high specific capacity make them compatible with nonaqueous, aqueous (any pH), and sulfide solid electrolytes while achieving desirable specific energy. With proper design, the reversible ion-insertion reaction and adequate conductivity further lead to long cycle life and fast kinetics. Synthesis analysis reveals no concerns in resource availability for the targeted markets. They will accelerate the development of ultra-high-energy lithium batteries, high-stability/energy aqueous batteries, and solid-state batteries, which are not satisfactorily enabled by existing inorganic electrode materials.

However, many reported sodium batteries are based on conventional organic liquid electrolyte, which would lead to potential safety issues. Developing solid-state electrolyte (SSE) for sodium batteries is an effective way to solve such problems. Nevertheless, how to develop high-performance SSE and compatible interface for constructing solid-state sodium batteries is still challenging. In this review, we mainly focus on the development and recent advances of SSE (including all-solid-state and quasi-solid-state electrolyte) and interface engineering for sodium batteries. The structure-property correlations and design principles of different inorganic and organic SSE are discussed in depth. The comprehensive performance of SSE depends on the structural characteristics such as defects, crystallinity, and stability of bonds. The design principles mainly include increasing the density of mobile Na+ ions, reducing the energy barrier, immobilizing anions, adjusting the stability of bonds, adding specific buffer layers, and increasing interfacial contact area. Moreover, we discuss the interface between SSE and electrode because a suitable interface is the key prerequisite for high-performance solid-state sodium batteries. This review provides fundamental insights and future perspectives to design advanced SSE and concomitant interface for next-generation rechargeable solid-state sodium batteries. The recent boom in electronics and electric vehicles has raised the demand for rechargeable batteries. However, safety issues of rechargeable batteries based on liquid electrolyte such as ethers and carbonate esters are common due to the flammability of organic solvent and hazards of electrolyte leakage. In recent years, solid-state sodium batteries have attracted extensive attention because of their improved safety, considerable energy density, and low cost. Nevertheless, high-performance solid-state electrolyte and compatible interface are still absent and need to be further developed for constructing solid-state sodium batteries. The development and recent advances of solid-state electrolyte and concomitant interface issues for sodium batteries are systematically summarized in this review. We discuss the fundamental principles in the design of solid-state electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, high transference number, and high chemical/electrochemical stability. Furthermore, we highlight the design of interface between electrolyte and electrode, which is the key challenge in developing high-performance solid-state sodium batteries. Thus, future investigations of solid-state sodium batteries should focus on anode/electrolyte/cathode interface through the combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies. Meanwhile, large-scale production of high-performance solid-state electrolyte via a facile and scalable method with low cost is also necessary. This review introduces the development and recent progress of different types of solid-state electrolyte for sodium batteries, including β-alumina, NASICON, sulfide-based electrolyte, complex hydrides, and organic electrolyte. In particular, the transport mechanism, ionic conductivity, ionic transference number, chemical/electrochemical stability, and mechanical properties of solid-state electrolyte for sodium batteries are summarized. Meanwhile, the interface issues of anode/electrolyte/cathode (interfacial contact and chemical compatibility) are discussed in depth with the aim of constructing high-performance solid-state sodium batteries. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","interface; ionic conductivity; safety; sodium batteries; solid-state electrolyte","Accident prevention; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Anodes; Chemical stability; Costs; Interface states; Interfaces (materials); Ionic conduction in solids; Ionic conductivity; Safety engineering; Scalability; Secondary batteries; Sodium; Sulfur compounds; Comprehensive performance; Mechanical properties of solids; Organic liquid electrolytes; Quasi-solid state electrolytes; Sodium battery; Solid-state electrolyte; Structural characteristics; Structure-property correlation; Solid electrolytes; conductivity; electrolyte; sodium; solvent",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054737377

Here, an advanced graphene nanocage structure with the capability of hosting both cyclo-S8 and smaller sulfur molecules (S2–4) is reported. The cage inner cavity is partially filled with S8 to form a yolk–shell structure that enables free volumetric variation of S8 during (de)lithiation. In the graphene shell of the cage, S8 are downsized to S2–4 to activate extra sulfur loading sites within graphene layers. Importantly, the graphene shell exhibits inward volumetric variation upon (de)lithiation of the loaded S2–4, and the overall electrode strain is thus minimized. This prototyped design promises an ultimate solution to maximize sulfur loading in carbon matrices as well as to circumvent the polysulfide dissolution problem and boost the commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries in the future. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) is one of the most popular types of lithium-ion battery due to its low self-discharge and high energy density. However, LiCoO2 is toxic to the environment, thus a safer material is important to be studied. A non-toxic and thermally stable lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) could be a good alternative for battery material. Nevertheless, the low electrical conductivity of LiFePO4 (10-9 S.cm-1) should be enhanced by using a conductive polymer, such as polyaniline (PANI), to form a composite. This study aims to investigate the electrode capacity of the coin cell battery composite using galvanostatic cycle and to examine its voltage performance using the cyclic voltammetry methods. The cathode was prepared in powder form. The composite was assembled in the form of coin cell battery. It consists of lithium, lithium hexafluorophosphate-ethylene carbonate-dimethyl carbonate, and lithium iron phosphate-polyaniline-polyvinylidene fluoride as the anode, electrode, and cathode, respectively. It is found that the electrode capacity of [Li|1 M LiPF6/EC DMC|LiFePO4-PANI-PVDF] coin cell battery was 38 mA h g-1 with a working voltage of 3.6 - 4.0 V. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054354157

Lithium-ion battery have some advantages compared to other battery such as have large specific energy capacity, light weight and long-life span. One of the components that contribute to the quality of Lithium-ion batteries is the binder material. Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) is one of the most widely used binder materials other than PVDF. CMC can be synthesized from various organic materials such as empty bunches of palm, water hyacinth and salak-fruit seed. In this research, CMC is obtained from waste of salak-fruit seed (Salacca zalacca) and then used as anode binder in lithium-ion battery. The steps of CMC synthesis consist of cellulose isolation from salak-fruit seed, followed by alkalization process, carboxymethylation and finally the purification process. FTIR spectrum of CMC shows the successfully of CMC synthesis, the presence of strong absorption band at 1600 cm-1 and 1438 cm-1 is related to stretching vibration from the carboxyl group (COO-) and carboxyl group as it salts (COO-Na), respectively. The absorption in the region 1321-1400 cm-1 is due to symmetrical deformations of CH2 groups while broad absorption at around 3400 cm-1 is due to the stretching of the hydroxyl groups (-OH). Application CMC as binder of graphite anode with 5wt% CMC shows good surface profile and evenly distributed cavities with conductivity of about 0.815 S/cm. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054352325

Motivated by these, a risk-based two-stage robust unit commitment (RUC) model is proposed to analyze the admissibility of wind power. In this model, the electricity storage system (ESS) is utilized for managing the wind power uncertainty to reduce the risk loss. Different from a determined uncertainty set in the previous RUC, the proposed method can flexibly adjust the uncertainty set by optimizing the operational risks including the wind spillage risk and load shedding risk. Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) is adopted to describe the risk loss when the real wind power output is beyond the predefined uncertainty set. Meanwhile, the low-probability, high-influence events are taken into the account based on CVaR to determine the optimal acceptable wind generation considering the tradeoff between reliability and economics. The proposed model is solved effectively by the modified column and constraint generation method. Case studies on two benchmark systems illustrate that the ESS can reduce the risk loss of power system and improve the ability to accommodate the uncertainty of wind generation. © 2013 IEEE.","column and constraint generation method (C&CG); Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR); energy storage system (ESS); flexible uncertainty set; risk-based unit commitment; wind generation uncertainty","Electric energy storage; Electric load shedding; Electric power generation; Energy storage; Reliability; Standby power systems; Value engineering; Wind power; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Constraint generation; Energy storage systems; flexible uncertainty set; Indexes; Uncertainty; Unit-commitment; Wind farm; Wind generation; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053616056

However, security threats currently disturb the normal operations of V2G. There are two challenges for the security of V2G. On one hand, existing security schemes for V2G just consider the static security strategy, which cannot deal well with the problem of high dynamics and advanced persistent threat in V2G. On the other hand, existing V2G lacks a unified information modeling approach, which results in the difficulties of security and communications. To address above challenges, this paper proposes a smart software-defined security mechanism, SSDS, for V2G using transfer learning and IEC 61850 standards. First, as next generation networking technology, software-defined networking (SDN) is adopted to establish a dynamic security protection architecture for V2G, which can provide dynamic security strategy configuration capability. Second, IEC 61850 is introduced to model SSDS, including SDN controller and OpenFlow switch. Third, transfer learning-based security strategy constructing scheme is proposed for the security strategy updating dynamically. Simulation results in terms of network performance and security strategy constructing verify the efficiency as well as feasibility of the proposed security mechanism. © 2013 IEEE.","Machine learning; Security; Software architecture; Vehicles","Computer architecture; Dynamics; Electric power system protection; Electric substations; Learning systems; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Network protocols; Next generation networks; Software architecture; Vehicles; Iec 61850 standards; IEC standards; Information modelling; Next generation networking; Security; Security strategies; Software defined networking (SDN); Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle-to-grid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053610468

A major advantage of these systems is that the same SOC stack operates as both energy storage device (SOEC) and energy producing device (SOFC), based on the energy demand and production. SOEC and SOFC systems are now well-optimised as individual systems; this work studies the effect of using the bi-directionality of the SOC at a system level. Since the system performance is highly dependent on the cell-stack operating conditions, this study improves the stack parameters for both operation modes. Moreover, the year-round cumulative exergy method (CE) is introduced in the solid oxide cell (SOC) context for estimating the system exergy efficiencies. This method is an attempt to obtain more insightful exergy assessments since it takes into account the operational hours of the SOC system in both modes. The CE method therefore helps to predict more accurately the most efficient configuration and operating parameters based on the power production and consumption curves in a year. Variation of operating conditions, configurations and SOC parameters show a variation of Bi-SOC system year-round cumulative exergy efficiency from 33% to 73%. The obtained thermodynamic performance shows that the Bi-SOC when feasible can prove to be a highly efficient flexible power plant, as well as an energy storage system. © 2018 The Authors","Bi-directional solid oxide cells; Energy storage; Power production; Power-to-gas; Renewable energy; Year-round cumulative exergy analysis","Cells; Cytology; Energy storage; Exergy; Regenerative fuel cells; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Cumulative exergies; Power production; Power to gas; Renewable energies; Solid-oxide cells; Bismuth compounds; accuracy assessment; alternative energy; efficiency measurement; electrical power; energy efficiency; energy storage; equipment; exergy; fuel cell; numerical method; operations technology; parameter estimation; performance assessment; power plant; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048965211

The results of the optimizations showed strong reasoning for islands to invest in renewable energy technologies (particularly wind energy), as compared to conventional power generation. Levelized cost of systems for electricity generation decrease considerably with increasing renewable energy penetrations, to an optimal point in the range of 40–80% penetration. Furthermore, renewable electricity integration in the order of 60–90% could still be achieved with no added cost from the initial situation. Cost increases after these optimal points are attributed to the growing inclusion of storage, required to meet the higher renewable energy shares. However, with battery costs forecast to fall in the coming years, and a cost reduction of 50–70% already causing lithium-ion batteries to overtake pumped hydro as a cost-favorable storage option in this model, there is a real case for islands to begin their transition in a staged process; first installing wind and PV generation, and then - as storage costs decrease and their renewable energy capacities increase - investing in storage options. © 2018 The Authors","Cost optimization; Hybrid power plants; Island energy systems; Lithium-ion battery storage; Pumped-hydro storage; Renewable electricity systems","Cost reduction; Lithium-ion batteries; Photovoltaic cells; Wind power; Cost optimization; Electricity generation; Energy systems; Hybrid power plants; Renewable electricity; Renewable energy capacity; Renewable energy penetrations; Renewable energy technologies; Battery storage; cost analysis; electricity generation; equipment component; island; lithium; penetration; photovoltaic system; power plant; pumping; renewable resource; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048191477

There are significant uncertainties, however, in measured surface-energy budgets, especially for the heterogeneous Tibetan Plateau (TP) region where the observation conditions are harsh. In this study, summer (July-October 2014) surface flux data were obtained using the eddy covariance method from ten sites over the TP during the Third Tibetan Plateau Atmospheric Scientific Experiments. Data analysis was performed to assess the surface-energy balance ratio (SEBR= H + LE/(Rn-G)) and associated uncertainties across various land-cover types and elevation heights. Measured latent heat fluxes were positive during nighttime and exhibit substantially greater uncertainty than the sensible heat fluxes. The ten-site averaged SEBR was 74.2 ± 5.4%, largely on par with reported SEBR for other regions. SEBR values were similar among homogeneous sites, and the averaged SEBR (93.4%) for those sites was better than that (67.3%) for the heterogeneous sites. The soil heat storage term represents the most significant source of uncertainty (8.2%) than the canopy storage term (0.22%) to closing the surface energy budget. The SEBR showed a strong diurnal cycle and the midday (10:00∼15:00 local time) values were higher than those nearest sunrise and sunset times. The late-night SEBR (00:00∼6:00 local time) at sites located at higher elevations were more reliable than those at lower elevation sites, because of the frequent occurrence of neutral conditions (instead of stable or very stable conditions) at high terrains.

Green roofs are promoted as a climate adaptation measure to lower air temperatures and improve comfort in urban areas, especially during intensive dry and warm spells. However, there is much debate on the effectiveness of this measure, because of a lack of fundamental knowledge about evaporation from different green roof systems. In this study, we investigate the water and energy balance of different roof types on a rooftop in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Based on lysimeter measurements and modeling, we compared the water and energy balance of a conventional green roof with blue-green roofs equipped with a novel storage and capillary irrigation system. The roofs were covered either with Sedum or by grasses and herbs. Our measurements and modeling showed that conventional green roof systems (i.e., a Sedum cover and a few centimeters of substrate) have a low evaporation rate and due to a rapid decline in available moisture, a minor cooling effect. Roofs equipped with a storage and capillary irrigation system showed a remarkably large evaporation rate for Sedum species behaving as C3 plants during hot, dry periods. Covered with grasses and herbs, the evaporation rate was even larger. Precipitation storage and capillary irrigation strongly reduced the number of days with dry-out events. Implementing these systems therefore could lead to better cooling efficiencies in cities. © 2018 by the authors.","Blue-green roofs; Capillary irrigation; Latent heat flux; Lysimeter; Potential and actual evaporation; Sedums; Sensible heat flux; Urban areas; Water availability","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Cooling systems; Energy balance; Evaporation; Heat flux; Irrigation; Latent heat; Lysimeters; Soil surveys; Green roof; Sedums; Sensible heat flux; Urban areas; Water availability; Roofs; adaptive management; C3 plant; climate change; cooling; energy balance; evaporation; grass; greenspace; herb; irrigation system; lysimeter; measurement method; modeling; precipitation (climatology); roof; urban area; Amsterdam [North Holland]; Netherlands; North Holland; Poaceae; Sedum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053435504

Here, a physically cross-linked, polymer-supported gel electrolyte consisting of a lithium salt/ionic liquid solution featuring a fully zwitterionic (ZI) copolymer network is introduced for rechargeable lithium-based batteries. The ZI scaffold is synthesized using a 3:1 molar ratio of 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine and sulfobetaine vinylimidazole, and the total polymer content is varied between 1.1 and 12.5 wt%. Room-temperature ionic conductivity values comparable to the base liquid electrolyte (≈1 mS cm−1) are achieved in ZI copolymer-supported gels that display compressive elastic moduli as large as 14.3 MPa due to ZI dipole–dipole cross-links. Spectroscopic characterization suggests a change in the Li+ coordination shell upon addition of the zwitterions, indicative of strong Li+···ZI group interactions. Li+ transference number measurements reveal an increase in Li+ conductivity within a ZI gel electrolyte ((Formula presented.) nearly doubles). ZI gels display enhanced stability against Li metal, dendrite suppression, and suitable charge–discharge performance in a graphite|lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide cell.

Due to the randomness and fluctuation of the new energy output, the access to new energy has adversely affected the economic operation of micro-grid-containing power systems. However, if a reasonable ratio of the new energy is determined when developing the day-ahead scheduling strategy of the micro-grid, it can effectively ensure the economic benefits during the operation. This paper proposes a day-ahead scheduling optimization for micro-grid based on the cost-effective of user side. Various constraints related are taken into consideration, such as charging and discharging margins of storage devices, battery state of charge and generation capacity of the new energy, and the capacity of the electric transmission line. The model is constructed with the goal of minimizing the power supply costs. The prices of time-of-use electricity and the issues of energy exchange between the micro-grid and the external power grid are included as well. As for the method, Cplex is used for its good performance in solving mathematical programming models combined with the operation data of the micro-grid, hence, an optimized day-ahead scheduling of the micro-grid would be generated. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Electric lines; Electric power system economics; Electric power systems; Mathematical programming; Scheduling; Virtual storage; Battery state of charge; Day-ahead scheduling; Economic benefits; Economic operations; Energy exchanges; Generation capacity; Mathematical programming models; Optimization strategy; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054541883

The world is now moving towards renewable and sustainable methods of producing energy, among them the most abundant renewable energy resource is solar energy. As the lifetime and efficiency of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is more as compared to photovoltaic (PV) and considering the solar potential of Pakistan, the design of a 100 MW Concentrated Solar thermal power plant using Parabolic Trough Collectors and a 6-hour thermal energy storage is proposed.

The delicate structure of the underlying nanostars is otherwise extremely sensitive to atom migration. It has been revealed that the (101) crystal plane of anatase TiO2 grows epitaxially on the surface of gold, and TiO2 layer thickness and crystallinity can be controlled by varying synthesis conditions. TiO2-coated gold nanostars (AuNS@TiO2) displayed significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible-NIR illumination compared with reported TiO2-coated gold nanoparticles and commercially available TiO2 nanoparticles. The high photocatalytic activity is attributed to effective hot electron generation via absorption of radiation via localized surface plasmon resonance modes of the spikes and further injection to the conduction band of the TiO2 shell across the gold nanoparticle-TiO2 interface. Utilizing low-energy infrared light to drive photocatalytic reactions is an important goal for efficient H2 evolution from water. While traditional approaches deposit small metal clusters onto TiO2, we grow the semiconductor on the metal to enable more efficient light absorption mediated by the plasmonic nanomaterial. Gold nanostars exhibit strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the near infrared, with intense electric fields at the tips, which enables the generation of hot electrons. By epitaxially growing a conformal shell of crystalline TiO2 onto the nanostars via a low-temperature hydrothermal protocol, we have observed substantial enhancement in H2 generation, in line with our hypothesis that hot electrons can be efficiently generated at the nanostar tips and injected across the metal-semiconductor interface. Future studies targeting morphology- and LSPR-tunability promise to bring important insight into photoexcitation by low-energy wavelengths in hydrogen evolution. Hydrogen generation using TiO2 photocatalysts is a good candidate for chemical storage of solar energy. However, UV light is a poor match to the solar spectrum. This work demonstrates enhanced H2 evolution photocatalyzed via NIR irradiation by TiO2-coated gold nanostars with tunable LSPR bands. The low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis employed to synthesize the crystalline TiO2 shell preserves the delicate nanostar morphology, while the absence of surfactants allows for the generation of a defect-free epitaxial interface. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","anatase; epitaxial growth; gold nanostars; hydrogen; localized surface plasmon resonance; photocatalysis; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy; TEM; TiO2; UV-vis; XRD",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049482683

However, their unstable electrochemistry at high voltages due to complex multiphase evolution in the bulk structure and continuous degradation of the electrolyte-cathode interphase hampers their practical viability. Here, we reveal a dual-stabilization effect of the cation dopants on the evolution of the bulk structure and electrode-electrolyte interphase of a Li-substituted O3-type cathode upon Na (de)intercalation. The incorporation of Li into the transition-metal layer could mitigate the Jahn-Teller distortion of the Ni3+ ion and prevent the loss of active transition-metal ions so that the unfavorable high-voltage phase transition and the degradation of the electrolyte-cathode interphase are suppressed. As a result, the Li-incorporated cathode material displays a high reversible capacity with good high-voltage durability to facilitate its service in high-energy-density SIBs. The ever-growing demand for the use of renewable energy requires efficient grid-scale energy storage systems. Room-temperature sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a promising large-scale energy storage system as a result of the rich abundance of Na resources. As a key component in SIBs, cathode materials with high energy density and long cycle life are highly desired.

We first introduce the state-of-the-art engineering methods for achieving the desired surface or interface and correlate these structures with their catalytic performances.

To relieve our reliance on fossil fuels, renewable and clean energy generation, conversion, and storage technologies based on electrochemical processes have become a promising strategy for converting chemical energy into electrical energy. Rational surface and interface engineering of metallic electrocatalysts is essential to realizing high catalytic activity and selectivity. Several key catalytic reactions, including the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions, oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, methanol oxidation reaction, and electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction, are discussed. Starting from the established activity trends of exposed facets obtained from single-crystal electrodes, we aim to shed light on the underlying mechanisms and key factors that govern these electrocatalytic reactions. Guidelines for the design and synthesis of more efficient catalytic noble-metal materials are highlighted.

The present study utilizes large single crystals to eliminate the influence of kinetic factors such as particle-size distribution, crystal facet, grain boundary, and strain, allowing us to clearly demonstrate the strong correlation between a material's structural defects and chemical propagation and its crucial impact on electrode performance and stability. A new class of disordered rock-salt oxides is capable of delivering energy density much higher than those of current lithium (Li)-ion battery cathodes. Theoretical calculation predicted facile Li diffusion enabled by the formation of percolating network in the Li-excess oxides; however, fundamental knowledge regarding how Li diffuses within the network and what affects this process is lacking. Here, we provide experimental evidence of Li-diffusion pathways at multiple length scales and report the dominating effect of local chemistry on Li mobility. We reveal that the existence of local cation ordering redirects Li movement through non-equilibrium pathways and leads to the unusual persistent chemical heterogeneity observed at the subparticle level. The strong correlation between structural defects and the propagation of chemical reaction is clearly demonstrated, providing essential insights needed for further design and development of these cathode materials. Cathode performance is generally considered the bottleneck of further increasing energy in Li-ion battery technology. Novel Li-rich disordered rock salts have a lithium storage capacity much higher than those of the current cathodes, making them attractive as next-generation materials. The path to commercialization, however, is hindered by the lack of fundamental understanding in a material's properties and behavior. Here, we show how structural defects can be used to influence Li diffusion and kinetic properties, providing critical insights needed for the design and optimization of these new materials. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","chemical heterogeneity; disordered rock-salt oxide cathodes; lithium-ion battery; lithium-ion diffusion pathway; nanoscale X-ray spectro-microscopy; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy; short-range ordering",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048265191

However, the fabrication of chainmail catalysts usually involves complex chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or prolonged calcination in a furnace, and the slurry-based electrode assembly of the chainmail catalysts often suffers from inferior mass transfer and an underutilized active surface. In this work, a freestanding wood-based open carbon framework is designed embedded with nitrogen (N) doped, few-graphene-layer-encapsulated nickel iron (NiFe) alloy nanoparticles (N-C-NiFe). 3D wood-derived carbon framework with numerous open and low-tortuosity lumens, which are decorated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) “villi”, can facilitate electrolyte permeation and hydrogen gas removal. The chainmail catalysts of the N-C-NiFe are uniformly in situ assembled on the CNT “villi” using a rapid heat shock treatment. The high heating and quenching rates of the heat shock method lead to formation of the well-dispersed ultrafine nanoparticles. The self-supported wood-based carbon framework decorated with the chainmail catalyst displays high electrocatalytic activity and superior cycling durability for hydrogen evolution.

For example, at many major exhibitions, VR is used to mimic the real world through utilizing a number of on-spot sensory equipment to provide immersive user experiences. Despite the advantages that VR brings, the enormous amount of distributed VR videos and the high density of VR users may impose a heavy burden on base stations. On the other hand, the quality of experience (QoE) may seriously suffer from the transmission delay and monetary costs of VR videos. To address the above issues, a D2D-assisted VR video distribution system is designed, and a pre-caching algorithm based on QoE gain is proposed. More specifically, by observing the user residence time at a given node, a user can pre-cache VR videos at the nodes to be visited for improved QoE. To achieve better veracity and efficiency of the pre-caching algorithm, the probability of a user entering each node is calculated based on that user's interest and nodes' popularity. Furthermore, the set of candidate schemes can be greatly narrowed down to a range of feasible schemes according to the real-time popularity threshold, the available storage space, and the energy of the user's equipment. The scheme with maximized user's QoE can finally be selected from the candidate sets according to user's QoE gain.

However, the benefit of utilizing RE is limited by its highly intermittent and unreliable nature, resulting in low savings in grid energy. To minimize the grid energy cost, we propose to utilize data buffer of user equipments as well as energy storage at the base station (BS) to better adapt the BS resource allocation and hence its energy consumption to the dynamic nature of RE. We consider the scenario of downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access networks with non-ideal hybrid energy supply. To jointly optimize the energy consumption and the quality of service (QoS) of users, we adopt the weighted sum of users' utility of data rates and grid energy consumption as our performance metric. We propose a low-complexity online control scheme based on Lyapunov optimization framework. The proposed technique can provide asymptotically optimal performance bound without requiring the stochastic distribution information of RE arrival and channel state condition.

In such fast mode, generators have output dependent ramp rates and, distinguished from regular units, output and ramp rate dependent coal consumption costs. These fast generators cannot be properly described by using existing economic dispatch models, where generators usually have output dependent cost functions and constant ramp rate limits. This paper presents a new formulation and solution methodology of dynamic economic dispatch for wind-thermal power systems, to take into account ramping capabilities and costs of generators in their fast mode. In our model, the objective is to minimize a two-variable quadratic generator cost function depending on both output levels and ramp rates, and generator ramp rate limits are output dependent piece-wise linear functions. The model is solved by using existing quadratic programming methods, and is demonstrated by using numerical examples on the IEEE 30-bus system containing two 600MW thermal units with practical data. Results show that by using our model, unit ramping capabilities are better utilized in system dispatch to substantially save curtailed wind energy, and total generator costs are reduced. © 2018 ISEIS All rights reserved.","Economic dispatch; Generator cost; MW-dependent ramp rate; Quadratic programming; Wind utilization","coal combustion; cost analysis; economic analysis; linear programing; power generation; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065641703

However, limited energy density, which is bottlenecked by available high-density cathode materials, has become a critical issue to be solved. Recently, computational studies have played an increasingly important role in the search for the next-generation high-density cathode materials. Not only important insights on the battery chemistry have been revealed, but also novel material systems have been proposed. This review highlights recent progresses in the computational studies of cathode materials for lithium ion and lithium batteries. It starts from a brief introduction of the scientific background of lithium ion and lithium batteries, followed by a brief discussion of the working principles of batteries. Different computer simulation techniques are shown to originate from the same quantum mechanical treatment of many-body systems with different levels of simplifications. Progresses in computational studies of different cathode materials, including intercalation electrode, conversion compounds, sulfur, and organosulfides, are then presented in detail. Finally, the capabilities of computational techniques in the study of cathode materials are summarized, and major challenges are discussed. © 2018 Zhengzhou University","atomistic simulations; cathode; lithium ion battery","Cathode materials; Cathodes; Energy storage; Ions; Quantum theory; Battery chemistries; Computational studies; Computational technique; Electrochemical energy storage; Intercalation electrodes; Novel material system; Quantum-mechanical treatments; Simulation technique; Lithium-ion batteries",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063432175

Recently, Sn-based intermetallic compounds have attracted considerable research interests as the promising candidate anode materials for high-performance LIBs in consideration of the high theoretical capacity of Sn (994 mAh g−1) and low operating voltage (below 0.6 V vs Li+/Li). The fabrication of Sn-based intermetallic compounds is aiming at buffering the huge volumetric variation of Sn anode during lithiation/delithiation processes. Therefore, the rational construction of those anode materials with enhanced electrochemical performance is meaningful. This review is focusing on sum up the recent development in the structures, lithiation mechanism and electrochemical performances of various Sn-based intermetallic compounds as anode materials in LIBs. The developments of modified methods for further enhancement of lithium storage performances of Sn-based intermetallic compounds are also systematically summarized.

Seven flow rate tests varying from 1.5 to 7.5 l/min for charging cycle were performed on small-scale vertical cylindrical storage tank equipped with three primary inlet diffusers, an elbow, two-ring linear and radial circular diffusers. The storage tank with inlet diffusers was assessed using temperature distributions and performance measures including thermocline thickness(ht), the half-cycle figure of merit (FOM1/2) and equivalent lost tank height (ELH). Commercial finite volume code was used to predict temperature distributions in a stratified water tank model, temperature data acquired from experimental tests and simulation models were compared for validation purpose. The results suggested that the storage tank with two-ring linear circular diffuser produced better performance and higher stratification than two-ring radial circular diffuser for various flow rates by 1.4% FOM1/2, 20.6% ELH and 10.6% ht, and much better than an elbow diffuser by 1.7% FOM1/2, 24% ELH and 31.1% ht, furthermore, the degree of mixing was affected essentially the flow velocity which in turn causes an increase or decrease in thermocline thickness.

Herein, a simple and effective strategy to synthesize high-performance reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in-situ wrapped MnTiO3 nanoparticles (MnTiO3@rGO) by Sol-Gel method is designed. The MnTiO3 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed and wrapped by few-layer graphene. Due to high conductivity of rGO, MnTiO3@rGO nanoparticles show excellent rate performance, with a specific capacity of 286 mAh·g-1 being displayed at the higher rate of 5.0 A·g-1. Moreover, benefited from porous structure and flexible rGO shell, the MnTiO3@rGO anode delivers a remarkable long-term cycling stability.

In this paper, vanadium nitride (VN) nanofibers with mesoporous structure have been fabricated by a facile electrospinning method. Their crystal structures and morphology features were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The mesoporous structure of VN nanofibers, which can provide short electrolyte diffusion routes and conducting electron transport pathways, is beneficial to their performance as a supercapacitor electrode. Under a stable electrochemical window of 1.0 V, VN nanofibers possess an excellent mass specific capacitance of 110.8 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. Moreover, the VN nanofibers were further assembled into symmetric all-solid-state SCs, achieving a high energy density of 0.89 mW·h/cm3 and a high power density of 0.016 W/cm3 over an operating potential range from 0 to 1.0 V.

For this purpose, a photovoltaic/energy storage (PV/ES) power generation model was established and the variations in PCC power and voltage before and after the access of the energy storage system were simulated at different temperatures, access positions and capacities. Besides, the decrease in PCC voltage fluctuations was quantified according to the standard deviation of effective voltage. The simulation results reveal that the access of the energy storage system can effectively suppress the PCC voltage and power fluctuations caused by ambient temperature variation, and thus improve the PCC power quality; the same energy storage system has slightly different suppression effects on PCC voltage fluctuations depending on the access position of the PV plant and PV/ES system; the PCC voltage resistance grows significantly with the capacity expansion of the energy storage system.

Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the lipid deposition in liver and skeletal muscle and investigate the association with insulin sensitivity in postmenopausal and premenopausal women. Design and Setting: Single-center cross-sectional study of 55 healthy women between 45 and 60 years of age. We measured lipid deposition in the liver with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, intramuscular and intra-abdominal lipid deposition with MRI, body composition with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, and insulin sensitivity with the composite Matsuda Index. Outcome Measures: We studied the association between fat distribution, ectopic lipid deposition, and insulin sensitivity in pre- and postmenopausal women. Results: Postmenopausal women had an increased lipid deposition in the liver [0.68% (0.44 to 0.99) vs 0.49% (0.38 to 0.64), P = 0.01] and skeletal muscle [3% (2 to 4) vs 2% (1 to 3), P = 0.001] and had a 28% lower Matsuda insulin sensitivity index during an oral glucose tolerance test (6.31 ± 3.48 vs 8.78 ± 4.67, P = 0.05) compared with premenopausal women. Total fat mass and leg fat mass were stronger predictors of ectopic lipid deposition, and visceral fat mass was a stronger predictor of both ectopic lipid deposition and insulin resistance in postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women. Conclusions: For a given subcutaneous and visceral fat depot size, postmenopausal women show increased ectopic lipid deposition and insulin resistance compared with premenopausal women. It is suggested that lipid deposition in liver and skeletal muscle may represent important mechanistic links between the changes in fat depots and the increased incidence of insulin resistance seen after menopause. © 2018 Endocrine Society.",,"adult; Article; body composition; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat mass; female; human; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intra-abdominal fat; lipid storage; liver; major clinical study; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; oral glucose tolerance test; postmenopause; premenopause; priority journal; skeletal muscle; subcutaneous fat; glucose tolerance test; insulin resistance; lipid metabolism; lipidosis; metabolism; pathology; photon absorptiometry; physiology; postmenopause; Absorptiometry, Photon; Body Composition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Lipid Metabolism; Lipidoses; Liver; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Postmenopause; Premenopause",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054133593

Decision-makers should not only consider the cost of the system, but also consider the energy efficiency and environmental protection of the system. In order to help decision-makers choose the best DES, this paper designs seven different DESs based on specific examples, using five criteria: investment cost, operation cost, primary energy consumption, primary energy utilization, and yearly CO2 emission. Additionally, three methods of super-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) are used to evaluate the system priority and analyze the sensitivity under different decision-making scenarios. The results show that when decision-makers only consider cost factors, traditional systems are the best choice. However, renewable energy systems are the best choice when decision-makers consider energy efficiency and environmental protection rather than cost. Among them, the photovoltaic storage system is the best system in many decision-making scenarios, because of its comprehensive advantages in cost, energy efficiency, and environmental benefit. Simultaneously, the system's prioritization of different decision-making methods is different. In this paper, according to the Spearman correlation index test, the results achieved from TOPSIS and COPRAS are relevant and feasible. © 2018 MDPI AG.

A two discrete-time disturbance observers (DOBs)-based MPC strategy is investigated in this paper to solve this problem. The first DOB is used to improve the AC current quality and the second enhances the stability of the circulating current control. The distortion and fluctuation of grid voltage and inductance parameter variation are considered as lump disturbances in the discrete modeling of a MMC. Based on the proposed method, the output prediction is compensated by disturbance estimation to correct the AC current and circulating current errors, which eventually achieve the expected tracking performance. Moreover, the DOBs have a quite low computational cost with minimum order and optimal performance properties. Since the designed DOBs work in parallel with the MPC, the control effect is improved greatly under harmonics, 3-phase unbalance, voltage sag, inductance parameter mismatches and power reversal conditions. Simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed scheme. © 2018 MDPI AG.

However, it faces serious problem of wind curtailment, particularly in northeast China, where combined heat and power (CHP) units cover a large proportion of the district heat supply. Due to the inherent strong coupling between the power and the heat load, the operational flexibility of CHP units is severely restricted in winter to meet the heat supply demand, which imparts considerable stress on the wind power connection to the grid. To promote the integration of wind power and enhance the flexibility of CHP units, this paper presented a method of heat and power load dispatching by exploring the energy storage ability of electric heating boilers and district heating systems. The optimization results indicate that the proposed method can integrate additional wind power into the grid and reduce the coal consumption of CHP units over the optimized period. Furthermore, the thermal inertia of a district heating system is found to contribute more to the reduction of coal consumption, whereas the electric heating boilers contribute to lower wind curtailment. © 2018, The Author(s).","Combined heat and power; Electric heating boiler; Thermal inertia; Wind power integration","Boilers; District heating; Electric heating; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Wind power; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power units; District heat supply; District heating system; Operational flexibility; Power connections; Thermal inertia; Wind power integrations; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053493387

Morphological features, including hallucal opposability, toe length and the longitudinal arch, have traditionally been used to dichotomize human and great ape feet as being adapted for bipedal walking and arboreal locomotion, respectively. However, recent biomechanical models of human foot function and experimental investigations of great ape locomotion have undermined this simple dichotomy. Here, we review this research, focusing on the biomechanics of foot strike, push-off and elastic energy storage in the foot, and show that humans and great apes share some underappreciated, surprising similarities in foot function, such as use of plantigrady and ability to stiffen the midfoot.We also show that several unique features of the human foot, including a spring-like longitudinal arch and short toes, are likely adaptations to long distance running.We use this framework to interpret the fossil record and argue that the human foot passed through three evolutionary stages: First, a great ape-like foot adapted for arboreal locomotion but with some adaptations for bipedal walking; second, a foot adapted for effective bipedal walking but retaining some arboreal grasping adaptations; and third, a human-like foot adapted for enhanced economy during long-distancewalking and running that had lost its prehensility. Based on this scenario, we suggest that selection for bipedal running played a major role in the loss of arboreal adaptations. © 2018.

Methods: To determine the role of PARP activation in the incidence of metabolic dysfunction, PJ34, the PARP inhibitor, was administered to the oleic acid-treated hepatoma cells and high-fat diet-fed mice. The expression of genes was detected by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Lipid droplets in the cells and tissues were stained with Oil Red O. Results: PJ34 treatment aggravated oleic acid-induced lipid accumulation in hepatoma cells and induced SREBP1 expression by modulating the modification of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1). The high-fat diet-mice exhibited hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and lipid accumulation after 3 months of feeding. Although the serum level of lipid was not altered after PJ34 treatment, the expression level of lipogenic gene was up-regulated and the lipid accumulation was increased in the liver tissues of high-fat diet + PJ34-treated mice. In the high-fat diet + PJ34-treated mice, the insulin sensitivity was slightly changed and the levels of blood glucose and serum insulin were decreased compared with the mice fed with a high-fat diet alone. Conclusion: Taken together, PARP inhibition up-regulated the expression level of lipogenic gene and significantly induced lipid accumulation in the liver, which might worsen lipid metabolism disorders. These data will guide future research into the application of PARP inhibitors in the management of metabolic diseases. © 2018 The Author(s).","High fat state; Lipid synthesis; Metabolism; Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase","fat droplet; glucose; insulin; lipid; n (5,6 dihydro 6 oxo 2 phenanthridinyl) 2 dimethylaminoacetamide; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; oleic acid; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; transcription factor Sp1; glucose; insulin; lipid; N-(oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide hydrochloride; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase inhibitor; oleic acid; phenanthrene derivative; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; transcription factor Sp1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; drug effect; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; gene expression; glucose blood level; hyperglycemia; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid blood level; lipid diet; lipid storage; lipogenesis; liver cell; liver tissue; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein modification; upregulation; analysis; animal; blood; body weight; C57BL mouse; chemistry; genetics; liver; metabolism; promoter region; tumor cell line; Animals; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Cell Line, Tumor; Diet, High-Fat; Glucose; Insulin; Lipids; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Oleic Acid; Phenanthrenes; Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors; Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Sp1 Transcription Factor; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1; Up-Regulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052938088

EI is composed of multiple energy networks that provide energy support for each other, so it has a great demand for diverse energy storages (ESs). All of this may result in energy redundancy throughout the whole EI system. Hence, coordinating ESs among various energy networks is of great importance. First of all, we put forward the necessity and principles of energy storage coordination (ESC) in EI. Then, the ESC model is constructed with the aim of economic efficiency (EE) and energy utilization efficiency (EUE) respectively. Finally, a multi-agent particle swarm optimization (MAPSO) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem.

First, linear response functions of a cumulus ensemble constructed from cloud-system-resolving models are coupled with matrices expressing two-dimensional large-scale linear wave dynamics. For a radiative-convective equilibrium reference state, this model gives two branches of unstable modes: a propagating convectively coupled wave branch and a stationary branch related to storage of column-integrated moist static energy (MSE). The stationary branch is unstable only when radiative feedback is included, while the convectively coupled wave branch is less affected by radiative feedback. With a modular order-reduction procedure from control theory, the linear-response-function-based model is reduced to a system of six ordinary differential equations while still capturing the essential features of the unstable modes (eigenvalues and structures). The six-dimensional system is then split into a slow and a fast manifold. The slow manifold (again, reflecting column MSE storage) is essential for the stationary mode but not for the convectively coupled waves. The fast manifold is then transformed into a form similar to that of prior simple models of convectively coupled waves, thus placing those models and the insights derived from them on a firmer footing. The procedure also better quantifies the parameters of such simple models and allows the stability difference between different reference states to be better understood. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.","Convection; Instability; Large-scale motions","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Heat convection; Ordinary differential equations; Plasma stability; Stability; Cloud system-resolving models; Dimensional systems; Essential features; Large scale motion; Linear response functions; Linear Stability; Moist static energy; Radiative-convective equilibrium; Feedback; atmospheric convection; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric moisture; cumulus; parameterization; radiative forcing; wave propagation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052628578

It is a cornerstone in defining thermodynamic states of either saturated or unsaturated soils for quantifying water storage and movement in the subsurface and for mechanical stability of landscape. So far, it has been widely treated as identical to the free water density, that is, a constant of 0.997 g/cm3, but can be remarkably different from this value as it is subject to a wide range of variation in energy levels. Some experimental and theoretical evidence indicate that it can be as high as 1.680 g/cm3 and as low as 0.752 g/cm3. However, to date, there is no unanimous agreement upon a reliable experimental method to measure the soil water density or a unified theory to explain why and how the soil water density can deviate remarkably from the free water density. Consequently, the understanding of the soil water density is controversial and elusive, or some theories are contradictory to each other. In this review, the authors will (1) conduct critical reviews on the experimental and theoretical methodologies to identify their limitations, flaws, and uncertainties, (2) synthesize some recent findings on intermolecular forces, interfacial interactions, and soil water retention mechanisms to clarify molecular-scale physicochemical mechanisms governing the soil water density, and (3) propose a unified model to quantify soil water density variation. It is found that capillarity associated with surface tension tends to generate tensile stress in soil water and thereby decreases the soil water density, whereas adsorption stemmed from cation hydration, surface hydration, and interlamellar cation hydration tends to produce compressive stress thus increases the soil water density. Furthermore, the abnormally high water density greater than 1.15 g/cm3 is a result of cation and surface hydration that involves significant water structure change around exchangeable cations and mineral surface hydroxyls. The unified soil water density model, explicitly quantifying adsorptive and capillary water, could potentially reconcile the unresolved controversies. The critical reviews and the unified model also would allow us to further confine the upper and lower bounds of the soil water density. The upper bound is theoretically inferred to be around 1.872 g/cm3, whereas the lower bound is around 0.995 g/cm3; both are higher than that reported in the literature. With the unified model and measured soil water retention curves, it is demonstrated quantitatively that the soil water density significantly impacts the magnitude of various fundamental soil properties such as matric potential, specific surface area, and volumetric water content. The abnormally high soil water density has significant implications to the conventional concepts of matric potential and pore water pressure in soils and other earthen porous materials. ©2018.

Forage yield of corn stover was weighed and ensiled with two treatments: (1) hybrid sticky waxy corn stover (control), and (2) hybrid purple waxy corn stover (treatment). Samples were stored in mini-silos for periods of 0, 7, 14, 21, 42, 63, 84, and 105 d. The results showed that PS had significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) yields of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), gross energy (GE), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and total anthocyanins than that of the SS. Anthocyanin-rich purple corn stover silage (PSS) showed higher (P&lt;0.05) levels of DM and CP relative to the sticky corn stover silage (SSS). Although anthocyanin-rich PSS displayed a lower (P&lt;0.05) level of pelargonidin-3-glucoside (P3G), it had higher (P&lt;0.05) levels of peonidin (Peo) and pelargonidin (Pel) compared to the control. Delphinidin (Del) and malvidin (Mal) were not detected in SSS during the ensilage period; in PSS, Del was no longer detected after 7 d of ensilage. Specifically, total anthocyanins in anthocyanin-rich PSS decreased rapidly (P&lt;0.05) prior to 7 d of ensilage, and then remained at relatively stable (P&gt;0.05) constants. Compared to the anthocyanin-rich PSS, SSS displayed significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) pH value and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) content. Propionic acid (PA) at 0 d and butyric acid (BA) during the entire study period were not detected, whereas anthocyanin-rich PSS showed a higher (P&lt;0.05) level of lactic acid (LA) than that of the SSS. Compared with the SSS extract, anthocyanin-rich PSS extract showed a higher (P&lt;0.05) level of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity and displayed a lower (P&lt;0.05) half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value. Moreover, anthocyanin-rich PSS reduced (P&lt;0.05) gas production (GP), and displayed lower levels of immediately soluble fraction and ratio of acetic acid (AA) to PA at 12 h, but the other parameters were unaffected (P&gt;0.05) relative to the control. Taken together, the results indicated that: (1) anthocyanins could be stable in silage; (2) anthocyanin-rich PSS showed better silage fermentative quality and stronger antioxidant activity; and (3) anthocyanin-rich PSS had no negative effect on rumen fermentation parameters. © 2018 CAAS.

For preclinical assessment, a standardized model would allow comparisons of various pharmacotherapeutic candidates in efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmaco-metabolism, and adverse effects under a same system. The present study aims to characterize murine NASH models by comparing end-points of major abnormalities. NASH was induced by feeding high fructose/glucose in drinking water (HF/G), high-fat/calorie diet (HFCD), and in combination (HFCD-HF/G) in mice for 8 or 16 weeks. HF/G feeding caused a minimal fat accumulation and increase in free fatty acids (FFA). In contrast, HFCD-HF/G feeding resulted in a remarkable increase in body weight, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, macrosteatosis with a nearly seven-fold increase in triglyceride and FFA content, accompanied with marked hepatocellular injury, inflammatory responses, fibrosis, and insulin resistance, and represented as typical NASH in histopathology, metabolic, and adipokine profiles in a progressive manner. Meanwhile, mice fed HFCD displayed significant steatosis, necroptosis, fibrosis, insulin resistance, metabolic, and adipokine profiles, and the extent is less than those fed HFCD-HF/G. Significant MCP-1, CCR-2, and NLRP-1/3 activation were found in mice fed HFCD and HFCD-HF/G for 16 weeks, whereas gene expression of CPT-1 and ACOX-1 was down-regulated in these two groups in comparison to the controls. Nuclear receptors, such as SREBP-1c, FXR, LXR-α, PPAR-α, and PPAR-γ, were strikingly elevated in the HFCD-HF/G group. In conclusion, feeding HFCD-HF/G resulted in a reliable NASH model in mice with remarkable necroptosis, steatosis, fibrosis, and insulin resistance as well as a disordered profile of lipid metabolism and adipokine, and HFCD caused significant NASH features in histopathology and metabolic profiles only at a late stage. Whereas HF/G feeding barely led to minimal fat accumulation, some changes at molecular levels and metabolic disturbance in mice. © 2018, United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.",,"adipocytokine; cell nucleus receptor; chemokine receptor CCR2; cryopyrin; drinking water; fatty acid; liver X receptor; liver X receptor alpha; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; nucleotide binding oligomerization domain like receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; triacylglycerol; adipocytokine; cytokine; fructose; glucose; inflammasome; transcriptome; animal experiment; animal model; Article; body weight; clinical feature; comparative study; down regulation; gene expression; glucose intake; high calorie diet; high fat/high fructose diet; histopathology; inflammation; insulin resistance; intra-abdominal fat; lipid storage; liver cell damage; liver fibrosis; male; metabolism; mouse; necroptosis; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; priority journal; steatosis; subcutaneous fat; animal; C57BL mouse; caloric intake; disease model; genetics; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; liver; liver cirrhosis; metabolome; nonalcoholic fatty liver; obesity; pathology; Adipokines; Adiposity; Animals; Cytokines; Diet, High-Fat; Disease Models, Animal; Drinking Water; Energy Intake; Fructose; Glucose; Inflammasomes; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Metabolome; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Transcriptome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049134969

However, compared with other types of milk powders, few studies exist on the effect of key processing parameters on powder properties. In particular, it is important to understand if key processing parameters contribute to the poor solubility observed during storage of high-protein MPC powders. Ultrafiltration (UF) and diafiltration (DF) are processing steps needed to reduce the lactose content of concentrates in the preparation of MPC with a protein content of 80% (MPC80). Evaporation is sometimes used to increase the TS content of concentrates before spray drying, and some indications exist that inclusion of this processing step may affect protein properties. In this study, MPC80 powders were manufactured by 2 types of concentration methods: membrane filtration with and without the inclusion of an evaporation step. Different concentration methods could affect the mineral content of MPC powders, as soluble salts can permeate the UF membrane, whereas no mineral loss occurs during evaporation, although a shift in calcium equilibrium toward insoluble forms may occur at high protein concentration levels. It is more desirable from an energy efficiency perspective to use higher total solids in concentrates before drying, but concerns exist about whether a higher protein content would negatively affect powder functionality. Thus, MPC80 powders were also manufactured from concentrates that had 3 different final protein concentrations (19, 21, and 23%; made from 1 UF retentate using batch recirculation evaporation, a similar concentration method). After manufacture, powders were stored for 6 mo at 30°C to help understand changes in MPC80 properties that might occur during shelf-life. Solubility and foaming properties were determined at various time points during high-temperature powder storage. Inclusion of an evaporation step, as a concentration method, resulted in MPC80 that had higher ash, total calcium, and bound calcium (of rehydrated powder) contents compared to concentration with only membrane filtration. Concentration method did not significantly affect the bulk (tapped) density, solubility, or foaming properties of the MPC powders. Powder produced from concentrate with 23% protein content exhibited a higher bulk density and powder particle size than powder produced from concentrate that had 19% protein. The solubility of MPC80 powder was not influenced by the protein content of the concentrate. The solubility of all powders significantly decreased during storage at 30°C. Higher protein concentrations in concentrates resulted in rehydrated powders that had higher viscosities (even when tested at a constant protein concentration).

The battery thermal management (BTM) in CAHEVs is one of the crucial problems, because the lithium-ion batteries are highly temperature sensitive. Therefore, a practical and energy-efficient BTM strategy is required for both improving the operating temperature of batteries and saving energy. In this study, the dynamic programming (DP) is implemented for a BTM system in CAHEVs for achieving the optimal cooling/heating energy savings for batteries. To enhance the real-time capability, an iterative approach is proposed to approximate the optimum control strategy iteratively in a multidimensional search space. The proposed iterative DP strategy can improve the system performance and energy-efficiency by fully exploiting the future road information in CAHEVs combined with a model predictive control method. The hardware-in-the-loop validation of the proposed strategy is conducted on the UDDS and the WLTC drive cycles based on a Toyota Prius PHEV model. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed BTM strategy that leads to a considerable BTM energy reduction. © 2018 IEEE.","Battery thermal management (BTM); connected and automated hybrid electric vehicle (CAHEV); energy saving; iterative dynamic programming","Automation; Battery management systems; Digital storage; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Fuel economy; Hybrid vehicles; Iterative methods; Life cycle; Lithium-ion batteries; Model predictive control; Temperature control; Thermal management (electronics); Traffic congestion; Battery thermal managements; connected and automated hybrid electric vehicle (CAHEV); Hardware in the loops; Iterative Dynamic Programming; Multidimensional search; Operating temperature; Real time capability; Temperature sensitive; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048176028

Despite these changes and cross-cultural differences, the human diet can be characterized by several common elements. These include diverse, high quality foods, technological complexity to acquire and process food, and the establishment of home bases for storage, processing and consumption. Together these aspects of the human diet challenge any one individual to independently meet all of his or her daily caloric needs. Humans solve this challenge through food sharing, labor exchange and the division of labor. The cooperative nature of the human diet is associated with many downstream effects on our life history and physiology. This paper overviews the constellation of traits that likely led to a cooperative economy of food, and draws on ethnographic examples to illustrate its effects on human life history and physiology.

The development of flexible electronics and wearable devices require the relative materials being flexible. Besides, high temperature resistance is also desired because of the rising demand for high power devices and large electricity under elevated temperature. The polymer dielectrics for polymer capacitors are flexible but with relatively low working temperature normally less than 100 °C. Therefore, fabricating a dielectric material to satisfy the flexibility and high working temperature simultaneously is still a great challenge. Here we propose one solution by demonstrating a hand-exfoliated fluorophlogopite film with micrometer scale thickness. Among which, the mica film with a thickness of around 10 μm (Mica-10) exhibits the inorganic-like temperature stability even polymer-like flexibility. From 25 °C to 200 °C, Mica-10 has an energy density of around 11.27 J/cm3 with a variation within 2%, accompanied by a charge-discharge efficiency of around 95% at an electric field of 500 MV/m. Meanwhile, the thin thickness makes Mica-10 flexible, enabling its excellent flexibility and durability.

The series-stacked buffer (SSB) is a type of active energy decoupling buffer that allows a large voltage ripple on the energy buffering capacitor to improve the energy utilization ratio while actively regulating the dc-bus voltage with minimal ripple. This architecture has been demonstrated to achieve high efficiency, high power density, and excellent ripple control on the dc bus. This letter presents a set of design constraints for the SSB that describe the quantitative relation among passive components and load power level.

Without direct internal voltage/current measurements and individual control on each battery pack in the system, a networked battery system is inherently uncontrollable and unobservable. By employing bypass power electronics, we show that the networked system can be made controllable and observable by switching control. To coordinate switching control for integrated state of charge (SOC) estimation and control, this paper introduces switching control algorithms that use time division, duty cycle control, and periodic switching. It is shown that under noisy terminal voltage and current measurements, state estimation algorithms are convergent, and the control algorithms can achieve balanced SOC control during operation. The proposed hardware and methodology framework is useful for networked battery systems that can accommodate battery packs of different types, ages, and power/capacity ratings. Case studies using production batteries demonstrate convergence behavior for both state estimation and SOC consensus control under time-varying charging current profiles. The approach will be especially useful for managing battery storage systems to support power grids with renewable energy sources where the battery systems are required to operate continuously. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Controllability; networked battery systems; observability; smart grids; state estimation; state of charge (SOC) consensus","Charging (batteries); Control systems; Controllability; Electric current measurement; Electric power transmission networks; Estimation; Networked control systems; Observability; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Solar cells; State estimation; Switching; Voltage control; Voltage measurement; Battery storage system; Battery systems; Convergence behaviors; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; State estimation algorithms; State of charge; State of charge estimations (SOC); Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028989330

Both the source and relay are equipped with an energy buffer to store the harvested energy in the energy transfer stage. In addition, the relay is equipped with a data buffer and can temporarily store the received information. Considering the buffer-aided WPCCN, we propose two buffer-aided relaying protocols, which named as the buffer-aided harvest-then-transmit (HtT) protocol and the buffer-aided joint mode selection and power allocation (JMSPA) protocol, respectively. For the buffer-aided HtT protocol, the time-averaged achievable rate is obtained in closed form. For the buffer-aided JMSPA protocol, the optimal adaptive mode selection scheme and power allocation scheme, which jointly maximize the time-averaged throughput of system, are obtained by employing the Lyapunov optimization theory. Furthermore, we drive the theoretical bounds on the time-averaged achievable rate and time-averaged delay, then present the throughput-delay tradeoff achieved by the joint JMSPA protocol.

In the case where higher power quality is required, wind power often suffers restraints which will lead to loss coming from abandoned wind power. This paper proposes a novel dispatching scheme in which considerations are given to both power supply quality and sufficient wind power utilization, and then schedule a new power reference value obtained by calculating the Confidence level of wind power. The proposed scheme smooth the wind power curve injected into the micro grid with the help of energy storage, and then promotes the confidence level of wind power output by rolling correction, which is helpful to raise the dispatch curve in order to reduce wind power curtailment. Corresponding energy storage needed is calculated also, whose economy is taken into consideration for balance between energy storage investment and benefit from the reduction of wind power curtailment.

To alleviate the problems concerning the energy and environment, it is of tremendous urgency to develop and make effective use of them. Therefore, this paper proposes the evaluation model of DSER in urban power grid based on geographic information, and a variety of demand-side energy resources in a region is evaluated. Firstly, as for five kinds of DSER, revolving wind power generation (WG), photovoltaic power generation (PV), electric vehicle (EV), energy storage (ES), and flexible load, the commonality indexes and individuality indexes of all kinds of resources are selected based on geographic information. The commonality indexes are common indexes of all DSER, and the individuality indexes are unique indexes of all DSER. Then the weight of each subindex under the commonality and individuality indexes are determined by analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and entropy weight method, respectively. Finally, weighted overlay are made according to the weights and quantized values of each index, and a comprehensive score is obtained from the commonality indexes and individuality indexes upon various demand-side energy resources in the region. The result depicts that the proposed evaluation model of demand-side energy resources is of well practicability and effectiveness, which is beneficial to the planning of the city and the power grid. Most of all, such model provides a strong support for the long-term optimization planning and the medium-term optimization aggregation of DSER. © 2018 by the authors.","Commonality indexes; DSER; Evaluation model; Geographic information; Individuality indexes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052809950

In support of these advancements, heterogeneous platforms have been proposed to enhance the performance and efficiency in the cloud. These platforms include field programmable gate arrays and graphical processing units in addition to general-purpose processors. Furthermore, there is a strong interest in advancing active solid-state drives to support both storage and computation. In this paper, we present a generic formulation to support the modeling of such a heterogeneous cloud environment, without being specific to a particular cloud platform such as Spark or Hadoop. We represent the cloud as a collection of clients, middleware control nodes, and high performance compute nodes (HPN), where the HPNs represent the options of advanced compute technologies in a heterogeneous cloud. The objective of the paper is to present a simple and efficient formulation for scheduling applications in such a heterogeneous cloud. Consistent with recent software modeling of artificial intelligence applications, we propose to map applications into directed acyclic graph representations of tasks. The optimization problem is then formulated to infer the best scheduling of tasks on the HPNs, while minimizing the overall execution time and data communication delays between nodes. Unlike existing scheduling algorithms that assume equal performance across nodes, our formulation explicitly takes into account the different compute capabilities of the heterogeneous nodes. The resulting task scheduling is then evaluated to provide insights into the performance gains with the proposed advanced heterogeneous cloud computing environment. The results show improved performance when comparing the proposed task-scheduling algorithm with the genetic algorithm and heterogeneous earliest finish time algorithms. We also show the performance gains achieved with the optimal task scheduling on a heterogeneous cloud system as compared with a conventional CPU-only cloud system. © 2013 IEEE.","Distributed architectures; heterogeneous cloud system; optimization; reconfigurable hardware; scheduling and task partitioning","Application programs; Cloud computing; Directed graphs; Energy efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); General purpose computers; Genetic algorithms; Graphics processing unit; Job analysis; Middleware; Multitasking; Optimization; Program processors; Reconfigurable architectures; Reconfigurable hardware; Scheduling algorithms; Virtual storage; Cloud systems; Distributed architecture; Optimal scheduling; Processor scheduling; Resource management; Scheduling and task partitioning; Task analysis; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052661703

Normal-conducting rf accelerating cavities (hereafter, rf cavities or cavities) are adequate and often used for high-current storage rings with beam currents of a few amperes or higher and high-gradient accelerators with gradients of several tens of megavolts per meter or higher, where high-purity copper is currently considered to be the best material for cavity bodies based on a comprehensive evaluation of the electric conductivity, thermal conductivity, outgassing rate, rf breakdown field, ease of machining, and cost. For the above-mentioned former (high-current) and latter (high-gradient) types of accelerators, rf cavities are required to have continuously high stability, i.e., an extremely low cavity breakdown rate over a long period of time, and a high gradient with a sufficiently-low cavity breakdown rate, respectively. To satisfy these requirements, the cavity breakdown rate should be minimized; however, this is currently very difficult because the real source of cavity breakdowns, i.e., the cavity-breakdown trigger mechanism, is unknown. After fabricating rf cavities and before using them in accelerator operation, we perform a high-gradient test called rf conditioning, where we first feed a low rf power into the cavity, and gradually increase the input rf power and the accelerating field while maintaining certain cavity-related quantities, such as the vacuum pressure (light blue lines in Fig. 7) and cavity breakdown rate [1], at values lower than their corresponding reference values. In the early stages of rf conditioning, cavity breakdowns occur frequently with increases in vacuum pressure and/or vacuum arcs, even when the accelerating field is low. This process removes contaminations and microscopic defects in the cavity surface using an rf field. Once the accelerating gradient reaches its maximum expected value in the high-gradient test, almost no further increases in vacuum pressure occur, and the cavity breakdown rate usually decreases to an acceptable level at a gradient lower than the maximum achieved gradient unless the vacuum is broken or a long time passes without feeding a high rf power. Here rf cavities should be designed to ensure that the maximum expected gradient is sufficiently higher than the accelerator design requirement. However, the cavity breakdown rate rapidly increases as the accelerating gradient increases. Therefore, technology that enables a lower final cavity breakdown rate can contribute to developments of future accelerators with higher luminosities and/or higher energies. Various experimental breakdown studies have been performed and have provided measurements of various quantities, such as the cavity breakdown rate and its dependence on the accelerating gradient, the rf waveform when cavity breakdown occurs, the dark current before and after cavity breakdown occurs and its dependence on the accelerating gradient, and partial or total vacuum pressure increases during high-gradient tests (e.g., [24]). In particular, a large amount of breakdown studies have been performed on normal-conducting X-band accelerating structures using traveling or standing waves in pulsed operation, leading to the discovery of (1) a scaling law describing the cavity breakdown rate as a function of the gradient and rf pulse width (e.g., [5]); (2) the significant effect of the magnetic field and pulsed surface heating on the cavity breakdown rate [6,7]; and (3) a new local field quantity called the modified Poynting vector, which gives the high-gradient performance limit by cavity breakdown [5]. However, these measured quantities provide only indirect information about the cavity breakdown trigger, meaning it is difficult to use them to learn about the trigger. On another front, vacuum arc experiments using simple electrode setups, such as parallel plates and needle-plane electrodes, have been performed (e.g., [810]). We can learn a great deal about the breakdown characteristics of materials and surface processes from such experiments; however, there are significant differences between such setups and rf cavities regarding their electromagnetic field patterns and quality factors. In particular, rf cavities usually have a high quality factor of the order of thousands or higher for an accelerating field. After such high-gradient tests or vacuum arc experiments, microscopic inspections were often performed, in which microscopic craters, cracks, and/or suspicious objects were observed on surfaces exposed to high electric and/or magnetic fields (e.g., [10,11]). These are assumed to originate from the breakdowns; however, it is unclear if we can find any association with the cavity breakdown trigger in any way. To elucidate the cavity-breakdown trigger mechanism, we propose a method based on direct in situ observation of inner surfaces of an rf cavity through video recording of light images during a high-gradient test. This method has the following three features: (1) Exhaustive observation, meaning all cavity breakdown events are captured; (2) Multidirectional and wide-field observation to allow the observation of the origin of the cavity breakdown; and (3) Accompanying statistical quantitative analysis of the data obtained from the observation. Hereafter, this method is called the direct observation method. In this paper, through a breakdown study of an rf cavity developed for a positron damping ring (DR) at the SuperKEKB accelerator [12], we present our experimental findings obtained using the direct observation method, and demonstrate the usefulness of this method.

If a general strategy could be devised to yield nonlinear thermal transport, it would provide an avenue to controlling heat flow and realizing nonlinear thermal devices. Phase-change materials, which can exist in two states with distinct thermal conductivities, provide a unique opportunity to realize nonlinear thermal transport. In this work, we develop an analytical framework upon which we propose a material architecture for actualizing one type of nonlinear thermal transport, thermal rectification, where heat flux is biased in one direction. Our findings show that a heterojunction of two tunable phase-change materials can demonstrate strong thermal rectification. The magnitude of thermal rectification is analyzed as a function of the phase-change properties of each material, and we determine the fundamental heat-flux relations for each direction in these heterojunctions and criteria to separate the various phase situations that can occur. Finally, the analytical framework is applied to a junction comprising two phase-change materials, polyethylene and vanadium dioxide, and demonstrate a maximal theoretical rectification factor of approximately 140%.

In these battery applications, charge imbalance among battery cells/modules/packs becomes a common issue, which can reduce available battery capacity, accelerate battery degradation, and even cause some safety hazards. To tackle this issue, various battery charge equalization (BCE) systems have been proposed in recent decades, among which the module-based BCE system is widely viewed as a promising solution and has drawn increasing attention. In this paper, we study the module-based BCE systems by presenting a mathematical model that can characterize the charge transfer behavior in such systems, and then proposes computationally efficient algorithms to estimate the instantaneous battery cell state of charge (SOC), charge equalization time, and charging/discharging time, based on given system parameters and various initial battery cell SOCs.

In this paper, we introduce generic home energy management control system (HEMCS) to efficiently schedule the household load and integrate RESs. The HEMCS is based on the genetic algorithm, binary particle swarm optimization, wind-driven optimization (WDO), and our proposed genetic WDO algorithm to schedule appliances of single and multiple homes. For energy cost calculation, real-time pricing (RTP) and inclined block rate schemes are combined, because in case of only RTP, there is a possibility of building peaks during off-peak hours that may damage the entire power system. Moreover, to control the demand under the grid station capacity, the feasible region is defined and a problem is formulated using multiple knapsack. Energy efficient integration of RESs in SG is a challenging task due to time varying and their intermittent nature.

Increasing the inlet air temperature of turbine and reducing the compressor power consumption are essential to improving the efficiency of A-CAES. This paper proposes a novel solar-thermal-assisted A-CAES system (ST-CAES), which features a higher inhale temperature of the turbine to improve the system efficiency. Solar-thermal energy, as an external thermal source, can alleviate the inadequate temperature of the thermal energy storage (TES), which is constrained by the temperature of the exhaust air of the compressor. Energy and exergy analyses were performed to identify ST-CAES performance, and the influence of key parameters on efficiency were studied. Furthermore, exergy efficiency and the destruction ratio of each component of ST-CAES were investigated.

Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a metabolite of microorganisms under unfavourable growth conditions for their own energy storage and utilization. More and more researches have gradually uncovered the impacting factors on the microbial synthesis of PHA in the BNR and none-BNR system. This mini-review summarizes the impacting factors of carbon source types and dosage, nitrogen concentration and phosphorus recovery and temperature variation on the enrichment of PHA by microbial populations. Furthermore, the potential genomic reasons for promoting PHA synthesis are introduced.

Energy storage, especially to store the energy from fluctuating power is quite vital for smoothing out energy demands with peak/off-peak hour fluctuations. Thermal energy is a potential candidate to serve as an energy reserve. However, currently the development of thermal energy storage (TES) by traditional physical means is restricted by the relatively low energy density, high temperature demand, and the great thermal energy loss during long-period storage. Chemical heat storage is one of the most promising alternatives for TES due to its high energy density, low energy loss, flexible temperature range, and excellent storage duration. A comprehensive review on the development of different types of Mg-based materials for chemical heat storage is presented here and the classic and state-of-the-art technologies are summarized. Some related chemical principles, as well as heat storage properties, are discussed in the context. Finally, some dominant factors of chemical heat storage materials are concluded and the perspective is proposed for the development of next-generation chemical heat storage technologies. © 2018 by the authors.","Chemical heat storage; Hydrogen storage; Mg-based materials; Thermal energy storage",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051734739

Compared with its non-chlorinated analog, the PBT4T-Cl-based devices exhibited clear increases in open-circuit voltage and fill factor, achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 11.18% with simple synthesis, which is the highest PCE of the chlorinated polymer-based fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) reported to date. Grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy measurements revealed an optimized morphology of the spin-coated PBT4T-Cl blend films, which supported that chlorine substitution could promote the performance of PSCs. More importantly, the PBT4T-Cl-based devices showed superior stability, with a PCE of 8.16% after 50 days’ device storage. Through this research, the chlorination of low-band-gap polymers provides new insight into designing π-conjugated polymer semiconductors and realizing further enhancement of polymer solar cell efficiency as well as stability. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) could be fabricated on a large scale using solution processing at low cost, and thus are a promising energy source that can be exploited globally to contribute to worldwide electricity needs. Fluorination was applied successfully to PSCs, attributed to an enhanced VOC. However, fluorination has some defects, including lower reaction yield and the use of hazardous fluorination reagents. To balance the dilemma, chlorination has been explored in organic photovoltaics because chlorine is another electronegative halogen with much easier chemical synthesis and low raw-material cost. In this study, we developed a new chlorinated benzothidiazle-T4 polymer PBT4T-Cl with a high power conversion efficiency of over 11% and enhanced shelf stability benefiting from its improved intermolecular interactions through the halogen bonds. This research contributes a useful chlorination strategy for regulating the desirable photovoltaic properties of polymers. We reported a chlorinated polymer donor PBT4T-Cl that showed a high PCE of 11.18%. The results demonstrated chlorination of the thiophene moiety could fine-tune the HOMO level of the corresponding polymer as well as the carrier mobility and morphologies of the blend film, eventually improving its photovoltaic properties as a donor without thermal annealing. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","chlorination; open-circuit voltage; polymer solar cells; scale up; stability","Atomic force microscopy; Blending; Chlorination; Convergence of numerical methods; Conversion efficiency; Energy gap; Fluorination; Fullerenes; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Open circuit voltage; Organic solar cells; Polymer solar cells; Solar cells; Stability; Thiophene; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray scattering; High power conversion; Intermolecular interactions; Photovoltaic property; Polymer semiconductors; Polymer solar cell (PSCs); Power conversion efficiencies; Scale-up; Solar cell efficiencies; Conjugated polymers; annealing; chlorinated hydrocarbon; chlorination; fullerene; photovoltaic system; polymer; solar power; stability analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048231629

In this work, we report a fire-retardant localized high-concentration electrolyte consisting of 1.2 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in a mixture of flame-retardant triethyl phosphate/bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether (1:3 by mol) for 4-V class lithium metal batteries. This electrolyte enables stable, dendrite-free cycling of lithium metal anodes with high Coulombic efficiency of up to 99.2%. Moreover, it exhibits excellent anodic stability even up to 5.0 V and greatly enhances the cycling performance of lithium metal batteries. A Li||LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 battery using this electrolyte can retain &gt;97% capacity after 600 cycles at 1 C rate (ca. 1.6 mA cm−2), corresponding to a negligible capacity decay of &lt;0.005% per cycle. Therefore, this new electrolyte can enable safe operation of high-energy lithium metal batteries for practical applications. A safe electrolyte for 4-V class lithium metal batteries (LMBs) was reported by diluting a fire-retardant high-concentration electrolyte (HCE) with an electrochemically “inert” and poorly solvating fluorinated ether. Named localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE), it inherits the merits from the HCE but dramatically overcomes its disadvantages. The fire-retardant LHCE enables dendrite-free and stable cycling of a Li metal anode with high Coulombic efficiency of up to 99.2% and greatly enhances the cycling stability of Li||NMC622 batteries for more than 600 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performances of the LHCE is ascribed to the well-reserved, locally concentrated solvation structures and its improved interfacial reaction kinetics and stability. These findings open up a new avenue for developing highly stable and safe electrolyte systems for high-energy-density LMBs for practical applications. A fire-retardant localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE) inherits the merits from the high-concentration electrolyte (HCE) (non-flammability, wide electrochemical stability windows etc.) and dramatically overcomes the disadvantages (high viscosity, high cost, poor wettability) of HCE. Its unique properties lead to dendrite-free and high-Coulombic-efficiency cycling of Li metal anode that supports safe 4-V class Li||NMC622 batteries with excellent cycling stability. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","batteries; electrolytes; lithium metal anode; localized high-concentration electrolyte; nonflammable","Anodes; Ethers; Fires; Flame retardants; Lithium; Lithium batteries; Reaction kinetics; Secondary batteries; Solar cells; Stability; Bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide; Concentration electrolyte; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical stabilities; Energy storage systems; High energy densities; Lithium metal anode; Non-flammable; Electrolytes; electrode; electrolyte; energy storage; flame retardant; lithium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047253602

However, most current radiative cooling materials either work for nighttime (nocturnal) cooling only or have high cost issues. A novel scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial coated with silver has recently been developed and reported a 110 W/m2 cooling power on daily average. This metamaterial potentially provides passive cooling for both nighttime and daytime. Proposed is a hybrid diurnal radiative cooled-cold storage cooling system using this metamaterial for air conditioning purposes in single-family houses. Because single-family houses have a relatively low cooling load but high ratio of roof area to floor area, they are excellent end users of the hybrid radiative cooled-cold storage cooling system. The potential energy savings of the hybrid radiative cooled-cold storage cooling system in a typical two-floor single-family house with floor area of 204 m2 have been modeled using EnergyPlus for four locations in the U.S., including Orlando, FL, San Diego, CA, San Francisco, CA, and Denver, CO. In comparison with the electricity consumption of a split air conditioner alone, the hybrid radiative cooled-cold storage cooling system could save annual cooling electricity by 26% to 46% for the modeled locations, under a restriction of 8-year payback period. The corresponding simple payback periods for adoption of the hybrid radiative cooled-cold storage cooling system fall in a range of 4.8-8.0 years and the maximum acceptable incremental costs are $50.0/m2-$78.9/m2.

Facing the limited freshwater resources, alternative dry cooling technologies that reduce water consumption are becoming more prevalent. However, the performance of air cooled condensers (ACCs) is seriously deteriorated at ambient temperature. To address this challenge, a novel application of a Phase Change Material (PCM) based cooling system for supplementary cooling of ACCs is proposed. In order to evaluate the system cost, a solidification modeling approach called a Layered Thermal Resistance (LTR) model is extended to 3D in cylindrical coordinates for the first time. The LTR model efficiently estimates the behavior of a finned heat pipe module for the PCM-based cooling system. In the present work, a new nonlinear optimization problem is formulated, based on the LTR model, to estimate system cost and conduct sensitivity analysis. Overall, it is found that the material cost of the finned heat pipe-assisted PCM tank is around 30 $/kW for a 10-h solidification time requirement, which is a promising cost for the system to be accepted in the market. Based on the sensitivity analyses, it is found that the latent energy of the PCM has first-order impact on the system cost. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air cooled condensers; Cost optimal design; Efficient PCM simulation; Finned heat pipe embedded PCM; Latent energy storage","Cooling; Cooling systems; Cost estimating; Electric energy storage; Heat pipes; Heat storage; Nonlinear programming; Phase change materials; Sensitivity analysis; Solidification; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectric power; Water; Air-cooled condensers; Cost-optimal design; Cylindrical coordinates; Efficient PCM simulation; Fresh water resources; Latent thermal energy storages; Non-linear optimization problems; Solidification modeling; Cost benefit analysis; ambient air; cooling; cost analysis; energy storage; estimation method; numerical model; performance assessment; power generation; sensitivity analysis; simulation; solidification; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046685529

Recently, the problem of soft errors has become more prevalent due to several design factors, including aggressive device scaling and newer energy-efficient designs, thus significantly threatening the reliability of computer systems. Since the occurrence of soft errors is non-deterministic, detecting them and recovering from them can be quite challenging. A common way to detect soft errors is to execute two identical program instances and then compare their results. Although this approach is effective, it is not efficient as both non-trivial computation and memory resources must be invested to support such redundant executions. The introduction of hardware transactional memory (HTM) in modern chip multiprocessors (CMPs) provides an opportunity to leverage its redundant information to address the emerging reliability concerns including soft errors. In this work, we propose and implement a reliability-enhanced HTM system, called RE-HTM, which leverages redundancy to detect soft errors occurring in the L1 data cache and then recover from them. We then empirically evaluate RE-HTM and the results indicate that RE-HTM is more effective than the existing approach of running two redundant execution instances while incurring lower runtime overhead on protecting L1 data cache from soft errors. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, the potential for energy conservation assessment is still limited because of the complexity of the process. The aim of this paper is to propose an energy conservation potential assessment method in order to increase energy consumption transparency and help managers take appropriate energy conservation measures to reduce the energy consumption in the table grapes supply chain. The conservation potential assessment in three kinds of the supply chain modes (the normal chain, the cold insulation chain and the cold chain), were realized by integrating the actual energy consumption investigated with the unified energy consumption per unit energy factor that represents the energy consumption throughout the entire product lifecycle. According to the comprehensive analysis of the energy consumption compared with the energy conservation potential in actual supply chain of table grapes, the proposed energy conservation potential assessment method could provide a unified method for evaluating the energy conservation potential in different supply chain mode of table grapes. The energy conversation potential in cold insulation chain, which was about 0.985, was the highest and that in cold chain, which was about 0.935, was the smallest. However, the cold chain was still the optimal supply chain for the table grapes because of the characteristics of the longest storage shelf life and the lowest quality decay, and the cold chain energy consumption would be further reduced by adopting the more advanced refrigeration and preservation technologies. The proposed energy conservation potential assessment method could be extended for other supply chain applications to evaluate their own energy conservation potential, and thus, reduce their energy consumption. © 2018 by the authors.","Energy conservation potential; Energy consumption; Energy factor; Supply chain; Table grapes","assessment method; energy conservation; energy use; resource assessment; supply chain management; vine; Vitaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054932854

Considering that the successful operation of the intentional island needs allocation of new circuit breakers (CBs), this paper proposes an integrated optimization method for simultaneous allocation of CBs and distributed energy resources (PV and battery energy storage, DERs) in distribution networks. The proposed approach is established on a multi-objective optimization framework, which determines the positions and sizes of CBs and DERs in order to minimize the total cost and the outage risk of the system, while subject to the voltage stability constraint. As distinct from the previous works, the loss-of-load risk and the effects of the intentional islands on system reliability are especially considered in our paper. To achieve this, an efficient technique to calculate the system risk index that converges with limited computation efforts is developed. The proposed model is solved by using the multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm - NSGA-II. Simulations based on RBTS-BUS6 verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and methods.

Wound closure of leaves is one example. If polymers can be formed in a similar manner by introducing multiphase-separated morphologies, self-healing in a variety of commodity materials can be achieved. In these studies, we demonstrate the role of phase morphologies, interphases, and viscoelasticity-driven shape memory effects on self-healing. We synthesized phase-separated polycaprolactone-polyurethane fibrous thermoplastic polymers in which microphase separation facilitates the formation of stable interfacial regions between hard and soft segments. Self-healing can be repeated many times. This behavior is attributed to the shape memory effect, given that micron-scale interphase reduces chain slippage, enabling entropic energy storage during damage. Chemically identical but nanophase-separated copolymers do not exhibit this behavior. These studies show that self-healing can be achieved by morphology control and facilitated by thermal or other volume-induced transitions. Developments of self-healing polymers are primarily driven by the desire to prolong materials’ lifetime while maintaining their functions. Significant synthetic efforts have been made over the last two decades via the incorporation of dynamic bonds capable of reversible breaking and reforming. However, the role of physical network design in achieving self-healing properties in commodity polymers remains unclear. Inspired by the self-healing behavior of leaves, we built self-healing into polycaprolactone-polyurethane fibers by controlling morphological features. Favorable viscoelastic properties originating from interphase features facilitate shape memory effects and lead to autonomous damage closure and subsequent self-healing. The creation of morphology-controlled dynamic polymers can be utilized in numerous applications ranging from soft robotics to molecular actuators or morphology-induced information storage to thermomechanical sensing and other devices. This study demonstrates the role of phase morphology on inducing shape memory effects leading to the self-healing of polymers. Molecular events that occur during this process are established. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","phase-separated fibers; polycaprolactones; polyurethanes; SDG12: Responsible consumption and production; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy; SDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure; self-healing polymers; shape memory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048935580

The hydraulic wind turbine consists of the wind rotor, the variable pump, the hydraulic bladder accumulator, the variable motor, and the synchronous generator. The wind energy captured by the wind rotor is converted into hydraulic energy by the variable pump, and then the hydraulic energy is transformed into electrical energy by the variable motor and generator. In order to overcome the fluctuation and intermittence shortcomings of wind power, the hydraulic bladder accumulator is used as an energy storage system in this system to store and release hydraulic energy. A double-loop speed control scheme is presented to allow the wind rotor to operate at optimal aerodynamic performance for different wind speeds and hold the motor speed at the synchronous speed to product constant frequency electrical power regardless of the changes of wind speed and load power. The parameter design and modeling of 600 kW hydraulic wind turbine are accomplished according to the Micon 600 kW wind turbine. Ultimately, time-domain simulations are completed to analyze the dynamic response of the hydraulic wind turbine under the step change conditions of wind speed, rotor speed input, and load power. The simulation results validate the efficiency of the hydraulic wind turbine and speed control scheme presented, moreover, they also show that the systems can achieve the automatic matching among turbine energy, accumulator energy, and generator output energy. © 2018 by the authors.","Energy matching; Energy storage system; Hydraulic wind turbine; Speed control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059292658

Such batteries not only afford attractive attributes of cost, but also embody the advantages of the high-specific capacities of Zn anodes, as well as the wide potential window of nonaqueous electrolytes. To fully exploit these advantages, improved cathode materials are highly desired. In this manuscript, a new series of spinels, ZnNixMnxCo2–2 xO4, are reported as cathode materials for nonaqueous Zn-ion batteries. Full cells constructed using this new spinel (x = 1/2) as a cathode paired with a metal anode showed capacities over 200 cycles of 174 mAh g−1 and an open circuit potential of 2.05 V. The battery exhibits an energy density of 305 Wh kg−1, which is the highest energy density yet reported for a Zn-intercalation cathode. The data show that the Zn2+ ions reversibly intercalate into the spinel structure during the charge/discharge processes, a compositional transformation directly correlated with a multiply reversible conversion between Co4+/Co3+, Ni4+/Ni3+/Ni2+, and Mn4+/Mn3+ oxidation states within the lattice. The data suggest that Mn, Ni cosubstitution for Co in ZnCo2O4 is an efficient method to facilitate Zn-deintercalation and enhance discharge capacity, which may provide some guidelines for designing more attractive multivalent cathodes materials. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Based on the classic energy-efficient driving strategy approach, this paper studies the influence of the on-Board energy storage on the optimal train driving strategy. Firstly, this paper applies the dynamic programming algorithm to obtain the energy-efficient driving strategy for a single train in one interval, especially with considering the variety of conditions of line as well as the traction and braking characteristic of the vehicle. Then, based on the result of the energy-efficient driving strategy, an optimal control approach of the capacitor discharging in train operations is proposed in this paper to analyze the influence of the usage of regenerative energy of on-Board capacitor on the net energy consumption of the train. Furthermore, a numerical algorithm is designed to solve the problem of the optimal discharge strategy of the vehicle capacitor.

At the arrival of a permission, the storage operator has the option, but not the obligation, to transact. A nonlinear pricing structure incentivizes small transactions spread out among arrivals, instead of a single unscheduled massive transaction, which could stress the energy delivery system. The problem of optimizing storage operations to maximize the expected cumulated revenue over a finite horizon is modeled as a piecewise deterministic Markov decision process. Various properties of the value function and the optimal storage operation policy are established, first when permission times follow a Poisson process and then for permissions arriving as a self-exciting point process. The sensitivity of the value function and optimal policy to the permission arrival process parameters is studied as well. A numerical scheme to compute the optimal policy is developed and employed to illustrate the theoretical results. Current distribution systems cannot support simultaneous and identical actions of a large number of agents reacting to an identical signal. That motivates transactive market frameworks when their access to transactions is restricted. Therefore, the optimal policy of an agent under this restriction is important to study. Being able to act at random arrival of permissions and to act under a nonlinear pricing structure are salient characteristics differentiating this study from existing work on energy storage optimization.

The objective of this work is to use mass and energy integration to couple CLP with industrial facilities and power plants in order to enhance industrial symbiosis and reduce cost via the chemical conversion of CO2 into value-added products. Special attention is given to plants that generate large amount of CO2 and/or provide excess heat that can be used in driving CLP.

A groundwater flow model for Subei Lake basin, Ordos energy base, was developed and calibrated to predict groundwater levels’ variation and the impact of heavy groundwater pumping on the ecological environment for the period 2010–2039 under two different pumping scenarios. Results showed that rainfall infiltration and groundwater evapotranspiration were the major source/sink terms for the groundwater system. The obvious groundwater depression cone will be formed in the production field at the end of 30 years and the maximum drawdown will be 11.70 m if the waterworks maintains the present situation. However, recovery of groundwater level will be obvious and the groundwater depression cone will disappear as a result of the implementation of the water diversion project.

We have full confidence in the promising prospects of sharing idle energy with others in a community. However, it is a great challenge to share residents' energy with others in a community to minimize the total cost of all residents. In this paper, we study the problem of energy management and task scheduling for a community with renewable energy and residential cogeneration, such as residential combined heat and power system(resCHP) to pay the least electricity bill. We take elastic and inelastic load demands into accountwhich are delay intolerant and delay tolerant tasks in the community. The minimum cost problem of a non-cooperative community is extracted into a random non-convex optimization problem with some physical constraints. Our objective is to minimize the time-average cost for each resident in the community, including the cost of the external grid and natural gas. The Lyapunov optimization theory and a primal-dual gradient method are adopted to tackle this problem, which needs no future data and has low computational complexity. Furthermore, we design a cooperative renewable energy sharing algorithm based on State-action-reward-state-action (Sarsa) Algorithm, in the condition that each residence in the community is able to communicate with its neighbors by a central controller.

This paper applies a more comprehensive total cost of ownership (TCO) of HESS as the optimal target and proposes an optimal methodology integrating parameters and control strategy for the PEV with HESS. Through the integrated optimal methodology, the application value of HESS is analyzed under various types of driving cycles and the results indicate that the HESS can significantly improve the economic performance of PEVs under both urban and suburban driving cycles. Due to the poor adaptability of traditional control strategies to different driving cycles, a novel extreme learning machine (ELM) based controller is established. Firstly, a dynamic programming (DP) based controller is applied for the offline optimization of the HESS power allocation under several typical driving cycles. Then, an analytical method combining correlation analysis and mean impact value (MIV) is employed to deal with offline sample data from DP and obtain the characteristic variables of the ELM model. Ultimately, the instantaneous power allocation strategy of HESS is acquired by utilizing ELM to learn offline data of HESS. Comparative simulations between the ELM-based controller and the rule-based controller are conducted, and the simulation results show that compared to the rule-based controller (RBC), the ELM-based controller reduces the electricity consumption by 3.78% and battery life loss by 6.51%. © 2018 by the authors.","Hybrid energy storage system; Parameter matching; Power allocation; Pure electric vehicles","Digital storage; Dynamic programming; Electric energy storage; Hybrid vehicles; Learning systems; Secondary batteries; Electricity-consumption; Extreme learning machine; Hybrid energy storage systems; Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS); Parameter matching; Power allocations; Pure electric vehicles; Total cost of ownership; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052643565

In this context, energy storage is of paramount importance, making batteries a key element in the architecture of the electric vehicles. The state of the battery pack must be thoroughly monitored to prolong lifetime and extend vehicle range. For this, measurable physical quantities (i.e. terminal voltage, charge/discharge current, temperature) must be monitored and processed, while the inferred parameters (e.g. state-of-charge (SoC), state-of-health (SoH)) are computed and continuously updated.

Especially during the times of water scarcity, an improper water supply planning and operation result in a detrimental power generation or shut down processes. This paper aims to propose the cyber-physical cloud computing (CPCC), a mechanism of analysis and control physical process using cloud-based framework, in order to improve the efficiency of water management system in a biomass power plant. In this study, a 9.9 MW biomass power plant is implemented to investigate the performance of CPCC. The architecture of the proposed system consists of three physical tiers. The first tier is a tier of physical devices included with pressure, flow, pH sensors, water pumps and valves that are responsible for detecting the physical data and interacting with the water production process. The second tier is an edge computing device which functions as a controller, embedded server, data storage, gateway and switch to manage all operational tasks in an intranet area. The third tier is a cloud computing system which enables big data applications such as online monitoring and visualization of process operation, adaptive filtration fouling control, consuming water and total water cost analysis. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed system as the ability of an adaptive fouling control system to adjust backwash scheduling and chemical dosing so that achieving the target of purified water quality even during the fluctuation of raw water qualities. Subsequently, the water treatment system can achieve the capability for optimal total water cost operations under a target permeate flow rate and the percent of the recovery. Significantly, the data analytics in the CPCC reflect current operational requirements of water under local climate conditions, likewise contribute to the practical solution for sustainable water resource planning in the energy production. © 2018, Intelligent Network and Systems Society.","Adaptive fouling control; Biomass power plant; Cyber-physical cloud computing; Optimal energy consumption; Water management system",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049336017

However, hardware implementation of such algorithms using conventional CMOS devices is area expensive and energy inefficient. This is owing to the fundamental mismatch between the underlying neuromophic computations and the CMOS transistors along with energy consumption involved in synaptic memory-access operations. Hence, there is a need for novel 'neuro-mimetic' devices offering a direct mapping to synaptic and neuronal functionalities together with the possibility of providing in situ synaptic storage. Magnetic skyrmions have recently been proposed as a promising alternative for next-generation information carrier due to remarkably high stability, ultra-low depinning current density, and extremely compact size.

(3) With the geological resources (excluding hydrates) of 210×1012 m3 and the total proven rate of the resources less than 2% at present, the natural gas in China will see a constant increase in reserve and production; by 2030, the proven geological reserves of natural gas are expected to reach about (6 000− 7000)×108 m3 the production of conventional and unconventional natural gas each will reach about 1 000×108 m3 and the gas consumption will reach 5500×108 m3. The dependence on imported natural gas may be 64% by 2030, and 70% by 2050.

For effective risk assessment a critical factor is to determine which antibiotics can be expected in the different environmental compartments. After excretion, the first relevant compartment is manure storage. In the current study, the fate of a broad scope of antibiotics (n = 46) during manure storage of different livestock animals (calves, pigs, broilers) was investigated. Manure samples were fortified with antibiotics and incubated during 24 days. Analysis was carried out by LC-MS. The dissipation of the antibiotics was modelled based on the recommendations of FOCUS working group. Sulphonamides relatively quickly dissipate in all manure types, with a DT90 of in general between 0.2 and 30 days. Tetracyclines (DT90 up to 422 days), quinolones (DT90 100–5800 days), macrolides (DT90 18–1000 days), lincosamides (DT90 135–1400 days) and pleuromutilins (DT90 of 49–1100 days) are in general much more persistent, but rates depend on the manure type. Specifically lincomycin, pirlimycin, tiamulin and most quinolones are very persistent in manure with more than 10% of the native compound remaining after a year in most manure types. For all compounds tested in the sub-set, except the macrolides, the dissipation was an abiotic process. Based on the persistence and current frequency of use, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, flumequine and tilmicosin can be expected to end up in environmental compartments. Ecotoxicological data should be used to further prioritize these compounds. © 2018 The Author(s)","Antibiotics; Dissipation; Environment; Fate; Manure; Persistence; Reviewer suggestions","Agriculture; Amides; Antibiotics; Digital storage; Energy dissipation; Fertilizers; Mammals; Risk assessment; Current frequency; Environment; Environmental compartment; Fate; Livestock animals; Oxytetracyclines (OTC); Persistence; Reviewer suggestions; Manures; antibiotic agent; chlortetracycline; dapsone; doxycycline; flumequine; gamithromycin; josamycin; lincomycin; lincosamide; macrolide; nalidixic acid; natamycin; oxytetracycline; pirlimycin; pleuromutilin; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; sulfacetamide; sulfafurazole; sulfamethizole; sulfamethoxazole; sulfaphenazole; sulfathiazole; sulfonamide; tetracycline; tetracycline derivative; tiamulin; tilmicosin; tulathromycin; tylosin; tylvalosin; antiinfective agent; drug residue; antibiotics; cattle; dissipation; environmental fate; excretion; factor analysis; manure; persistence; risk assessment; agricultural land; Article; broiler; calf (bovine); controlled study; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; livestock; manure; nonhuman; persistent organic pollutant; pig; risk assessment; storage; analysis; animal; bovine; chicken; manure; pig; Animalia; Suidae; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cattle; Chickens; Drug Residues; Manure; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047409402

Additionally, the morphological and functional changes of the MPC powders were investigated and correlated with flowability. After 12 wk of storage at 25°C, the basic flow energy values significantly increased from 510 to 930 mJ as the protein content increased from 70 to 90% (wt/wt). Flow rate index was significantly higher for samples with high protein content. Dynamic flow tests indicated that MPC powders with high protein content displayed higher permeability. Shear tests confirmed that the samples stored at 25°C were more flowable than samples stored at 40°C. Likewise, the higher-protein content samples showed poor shear flow behavior. The results indicated that MPC powders stored at 25°C had less cohesiveness and better flow characteristics than MPC powders stored at 40°C. Overall, the MPC powders had markedly different flow properties due to their difference in composition and morphology.

Temperature transient analysis is emerging partly due to the advancement of the downhole temperature monitoring system. Among different flow regimes encountered during the production of a vertical well, the long-lasting boundary dominated flow is crucial since most oil in conventional reservoirs are recovered during this period. The production induced temperature response behaves transient for boundary dominated pressure response and can be analyzed for reservoir property estimation. In this work, we derive a novel temperature transient analytical solution to model sandface temperature signal under boundary dominated flow. Our approach to obtaining the analytical solution from the governing energy balance equation uses Laplace transform with the input of pseudo-steady state pressure equation. This solution can be integrated with previous temperature transient analytical solutions to model the temperature signal from a depletion drived production well. The temperature modeling results acquired from this analytical solution are validated against those from numerical simulation in multiple cases and present distinct behavior under boundary dominated flow. Compared to the heating Joule-Thomson effect in the transient period near the production well, a cooling effect is observed throughout the reservoir after pressure transient reaches the reservoir outer boundary. The magnitude of this cooling effect is proportional to production time. This finding shows the potential of using temperature data at observation wells away from the production well during boundary dominated flow. Further parametric analyses are conducted on eight reservoir, production, and fluid properties to investigate their impacts on the temperature modeling results. These parameters are categorized based on their sensitivities on periods of transient and boundary dominated flow, in which total compressibility and production drainage area are sensitive to the temperature signals under boundary dominated flow only. Unlike the drawdown test, we find that the buildup temperature behavior under boundary dominated flow is identical to that during the transient period. After presenting the forward temperature modeling results, we extend existing reservoir characterization procedures to incorporate the boundary dominated flow. Drainage area and the distance to the closest boundary from the production well can be estimated from the measured temperature data acquired at both production and observation wells. Decent accuracies of the estimations are achieved for the examples presented in this work. The effects of thermal conduction and heat loss may not introduce significant errors in both forward and inverse thermal modeling for the long-lasting boundary dominated flow period. The temperature transient analytical solution under radial boundary dominated flow introduced in this paper considerably extends the scope for temperature transient analysis. This solution enables observation well temperature transient analysis, which seems promising for field application during the boundary dominated flow period. The analytical solution presented herein helps to advance the temperature transient analysis over the whole well production period and forms a basis for future studies on variable rate temperature transient analysis (rate-temperature transient analysis). © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Analytical solution; Boundary dominated flow; Reservoir characterization; Temperature transient analysis","Analytical models; Digital storage; Equations of state; Inverse problems; Laplace transforms; Oil wells; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Thermoelectricity; Well stimulation; Boundary dominated flow; Energy balance equations; Pressure and temperature; Reservoir characterization; Temperature monitoring; Temperature transient analysis; Temperature transients; Total compressibilities; Transient analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047086571

However, its full potential is not utilized in present climate policies. Optimizing sequestration, while continuing to harvest wood for materials and energy, could reduce the economic burden of mitigation efforts. Optimal sequestration can be incentivized by subsidizing carbon storage according to its social value. We analyze the dynamic market-level impacts of implementing a forest carbon policy by using the Finnish Forest and Energy Policy model (FinFEP). We find that sizeable and immediate increases in carbon sinks can be obtained, even with low carbon prices. High carbon payments strongly increase the carbon sink in the short run, but this impact diminishes over time. Low payments have a milder but longer-lasting impact. Forest owners’ valuations of forest amenities also affect the magnitude and dynamics of harvest and carbon sequestration results. Thus, a realistic description of forest owner behavior is needed to assess the impacts of forest carbon policies. Moreover, we show that a market-level model is necessary for assessing the regional carbon sequestration impacts and costs. Relying on stand-level models with fixed timber prices may yield overly optimistic results. © 2018 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umeå","Bioenergy; Carbon rents; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Forest carbon policy; Forest owners’ preferences; Timber markets","Carbon capture; Climate change; Commerce; Costs; Dispensers; Timber; Bio-energy; Carbon sequestration; Forest carbons; Forest owners; Timber market; Forestry; bioenergy; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental policy; forest dynamics; timber market; Carbon; Chelation; Commerce; Costs; Dispensers; Energy; Forestry; Impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046170814

The micromorphology, chemical structure, crystalloid phase, thermal properties, supercooling degree, thermal conductivity and thermal reliability were investigated by SEM, XRD, FT-IR, DSC, self-designed device and hot-wire method. FT-IR spectra indicated that there was no chemical reaction during the preparation process. The supercooling tested by the self-designed device was just 0.3 °C which can be neglected. The melting and freezing temperature measured by DSC and step-cooling curve method were 88.89 °C and 83.5 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the latent heat was 69.39 J/g and the adsorptive capacity was 46.78% according the pure PCM used in this study.

A bitline of the proposed memory bit cell is shared with that of an adjacent bit cell leading to a reduction in the number of metals along the column direction. This results in higher integration density due to improved metal pitch limited region. The proposed memory can optimize the bit-cell area by aggressively reducing the size of write access transistor, since SOT-based switching operation of SOT devices translates to smaller size of write access transistor. Furthermore, the proposed SOT-MRAM still retains the advantages of SOT-MRAM such as low write energy dissipation, high read-disturb margin, and improved reliability of magnetic tunnel junction. In comparison with the conventional SOT-MRAM bit cells, our proposed MRAM bit cell can have 20% less bit-cell area. Even compared with the standard STT-MRAM, our proposed bit cell still achieves higher integration density.

In order to test these queues in the most relevant application context, replacing conventional memory buffers for NoCs, we perform design-space analysis over the different schemes in a network context and then analyze the best schemes with benchmark traffic. Our results indicate that the best shift-based buffer utilizes a dual-nanowire approach to ensure that reads and writes can be more effectively aligned with access ports for simultaneous access in the same cycle. Our approach provides a 2.93\times speedup over a DWM buffer using a traditional FIFO memory control scheme with a 23.4% savings in energy.

In this paper, a comprehensive controller considering the traffic information is proposed, which is composed of an adaptive rule-based controller (main controller) and a fuzzy logic controller (auxiliary controller). Through analyzing the dynamic programming (DP) based power allocation of HESS, a general law for the power allocation of HESS is acquired and an adaptive rule-based controller is established. Then, to further enhance the real-time performance of the adaptive rule-based controller, traffic information, which consists of the traffic condition and road grade, is considered, and a novel method combining a K-means clustering algorithm and traffic condition is proposed to predict the future trend of vehicle speed. On the basis of the obtained traffic information, a fuzzy logic controller is constructed to provide the correction for the power allocation in the adaptive rule-based controller. Ultimately, the comparative simulations among the traditional rule-based controller, the adaptive rule-based controller, and the comprehensive controller are conducted, and the results indicate that the proposed adaptive rule-based controller reduces battery life loss by 3.76% and the state of change (SOC) consumption by 3.55% in comparison with the traditional rule-based controller. Furthermore, the comprehensive controller possesses the most excellent performance and reduces the battery life loss by 2.98% and the SOC consumption of the battery by 1.88%, when compared to the adaptive rule-based controller. © 2018 by the authors.","Electric vehicle; Energy management; Hybrid energy storage system; Traffic information",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051054769

Instability in the vaneless space of the model pump-turbine is analyzed based on turbulence kinetic energy equation. The maximum value of turbulence kinetic energy production(Pk ) with MGV is doubled compared with the maximum value with SyV, which are in accordance with the increase of the amplitude of pressure fluctuation compared with SyV. The change of Pk is determined by the change of the normal stress term. The change of normal stress term will influence the amplitude of pressure fluctuation.

There are multiple retailers (sellers) and clusters (buyers) in our system model, which determine the transaction price and trading energy respectively and have a certain influence on the balance of energy supply and demand. Retailers make more profits by adjusting the price of electricity in matching algorithm M-1, depending on the energy they capture and the level of storage.

Micro-supercapacitors have great potentials due to its long lifetime and high power densities. Here we demonstrate low-cost and lithography-free fabrication of flexible micro-supercapacitive electrodes over large areas by friction-induced nanofabrication of silicon nanostructures array and electrodeposition of MnO2 nanostructures. The silicon nanostructures are fabricated by sliding a diamond tip on Si(100) surface under a given normal load combined with wet etching in potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. Since the scratched pattern shows lower etching rate than that of non-scratched surface in KOH solution, such pattern can served as an etching mask to protect the silicon below from etching to some degree. Hence, the hillock silicon nanostructures can be realized on Si(100) surface. After reverse moulding, metal film sputtering and MnO2 nanostructures integration, the flexible microelectrodes are fabricated and show good electrochemical performances.

However, it has major drawbacks of low calorific value and low bulk density. Low calorific value results smaller energy and the low bulk density develop problems during the handling, transportation, and storage. Combination of torrefaction and briquetting offer solutions for those problems. Torrefaction is the thermochemical process in the inert condition used to produce high calorie solid fuel. Meanwhile, briquetting is a densification process used to increase the bulk density of the powder material. In this research, the process employs starch material contained in MSW as the binder to create agglomeration among the particles. In order to understand the role of starch as binder, this study was initiated by performing binderless briquetting at low pressure employing starch material, rice, as binder and torrefied orange peel as the representative of MSW. The experiment was varied in various parameter such as the rice composition in the briquette, briquetting temperature and rice torrefaction temperature.

However, its practical implementation is hindered by the huge volume change and severe Na metal dendrite growth during electrochemical stripping/plating. Herein, the use of a chemically engineered porous copper (Cu) matrix as a stable host for metallic Na anode is presented. By treating the commercial Cu foam through a facile and cost-effective method, a composite matrix consists of cylindrical core–shell skeleton is achieved, facilitating uniform impregnation and confinement of Na within the matrix pores promoted by the chemical interaction between Na and the matrix. The unique matrix's surface characteristic can divert the Na deposition from the skeleton towards the Na reservoirs within the pores, suppressing the volume change and mossy/dendritic Na growth. A stable Na cycling behavior is demonstrated in carbonate electrolyte without any additives at a high capacity up to 3 mAh cm−2 with a current density up to 2 mA cm−2.

However, the sluggish kinetics of the nucleation and growth of the solid discharge product of Li2S/Li2S2 in the lower discharge plateau has been recently identified as a critical hurdle for attaining high specific capacity in Li–S batteries with high sulfur loadings under lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, a new strategy of breaking the charge-transport bottleneck by successful generation of experimentally verified stable Li2S2 and a reservoir of quasi-solid lithium polysulfides within the micropores of activated carbon fiber cloth as a high-sulfur-loading host is proposed. The developed Li–S cell is capable of delivering a highly sustainable areal capacity of 6.0 mAh cm−2 under lower electrolyte to sulfur ratios (&lt;3.0 mLE gS −1).

The potential of using ultrathin films is among the best merits of solid electrolytes for considerably reducing the weight and volume of each battery unit, thereby significantly enhancing the energy density. However, it is challenging to fabricate ultrathin membranes of solid electrolytes using the conventional techniques. Here, a new strategy is reported for fabricating sub-micrometer-thick membranes of β-Li3PS4 solid electrolytes via tiled assembly of shape-controlled, nanoscale building blocks. This strategy relies on facile, low-cost, solution-based chemistry to create membranes with tunable thicknesses. The ultrathin membranes of β-Li3PS4 show desirable ionic conductivity and necessary compatibility with metallic lithium anodes. The results of this study also highlight a viable strategy for creating ultrathin, dense solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivities for the next-generation energy storage and conversion systems. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Based on one actual direct current (DC) fast-charging station, a two-step strategy for the suppression of the peak charging power was developed in this paper, which combined charging optimization and a battery energy storage system (BESS) configuration. A novel charging strategy was proposed, with the PEBs fast-charging during operating hours and normal charging at night, based on a new charging topology. Then, a charging sequence optimization model was established, according to the operation characteristics analysis of the DC fast-charging station. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to optimize the charging sequence, which is disordered at present. Linear programming is used to configure the battery energy storage system in order to further decrease the peak charging power and satisfy the distribution capacity constraint. The two-step strategy was simulated by the dataset from the real station. The results show that the distribution capacity demand, charging load fluctuation, electricity cost, and size of the BESS were significantly decreased. © 2018 by the authors.","BESS; Charging topology; Pure electric buses; Sequence optimization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050402793

However, the 1:1:1 high-density (HD) FinFET 6T bitcell faces challenges in achieving a lower VMIN across process variation. The 6T bitcell VMIN improves either by increasing the size of the bitcell or by using combinations of peripheral assists (PAs) since a single PA cannot achieve the best VMIN across process variation. State-of-the-art works show some combinations of write and read PAs that lower the VMIN of 6T FinFET SRAMs. However, the better combinations of PA for 14nm HD 6T FinFET SRAMs are unknown. This work compares all the possible dual combinations of PAs and reveals the better ones. We show that in a usual column mux scenario the combination of negative bitline with VDD boosting and VDD collapse with VDD boosting in a proportion of 14% and 6% (total 20%), respectively, maximize the static VMIN improvement close to 191mV for ULP IoT and cognitive applications. We also show that a combination of wordline boosting with negative bitline and wordline boosting with VSS lowering achieve a 150mV and 25mV of dynamic VMIN improvement at the 5GHz frequency for the worst-case write and read corners, respectively, beating other combinations. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","14nm; Cognitive; FinFET; IoT; Low Power; Peripheral assists; SRAM; VMIN","Internet of things; Low power electronics; Static random access storage; 14nm; Cognitive; Low Power; Peripheral assists; VMIN; FinFET",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051566907

However, most graph processing applications suffer from large memory overhead due to random memory accesses. Such random memory access pattern provides little temporal and spatial locality which cannot be accelerated by the conventional hierarchical memory system. In this work, we propose GAS, a heterogeneous memory architecture, to accelerate graph applications implemented in message-based vertex program model, which is widely used in various graph processing systems. GAS utilizes the specialized content-addressable memory (CAM) to store random data, and determine exact access patterns by a series of associative search. Thus, GAS not only removes the inefficiency of random accesses but also reduces the memory access latency by accurate prefetching. We test the efficiency of GAS with three important graph processing kernels on five well-known graphs. Our experimental results show that GAS can significantly reduce cache miss rate and improve the bandwidth utilization as compared to a conventional system with a state-of-the-art graph-specific prefetching mechanism. These enhancements result in 34% and 27% reduction in energy consumption and execution time, respectively. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",,"Application programs; Associative storage; Big data; Energy utilization; Gases; Low power electronics; Random access storage; Associative Search; Band-width utilization; Conventional systems; Heterogeneous memory; Hierarchical memory; Memory access latency; Random memory access; Temporal and spatial; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051546378

To help improve performance, NAND flash utilizes various advanced commands to increase internal parallelism. Currently, these commands only parallelize operations across channels, chips, dies, and planes, neglecting the block level due to risk of disturbances that can compromise valid data by inducing errors. However, due to the triple-well structure of the NAND flash plane architecture, it is possible to erase multiple blocks within a plane, in parallel, without diminishing the integrity of the valid data. The number of page movements due to multiple block erases can be restrained so as to bound the overhead per GC. Moreover, more capacity can be reclaimed per GC which delays future GCs and effectively reduces their frequency. Such an Intra-Plane Parallel Block Erase (IPPBE) in turn diminishes the impact of GC on incoming requests, improving their response times. Experimental results show that IPPBE can reduce the time spent performing GC by up to 50.7% and 33.6% on average, read/write response time by up to 47.0%/45.4% and 16.5%/14.8% on average respectively, page movements by up to 52.2% and 26.6% on average, and blocks erased by up to 14.2% and 3.6% on average.

In this paper, a control strategy of battery storage involved in secondary frequency regulation is proposed. Through the analysis of the control mode based on area control error signal and the control mode based on area regulation requirement signal in AGC, the integrated control strategy was developed, and the switch timing and the output depth of the battery storage were defined. That is, when the system frequency is deteriorated and the frequency deviation Δ is large, according to the fuzzy logic method, the output power of the battery storage will be smoothened on the basis of the state of charge (SOC). When the system frequency is normal, the frequency deviation Δ will be small. The remaining frequency regulation capacity of generators can be used to improve the SOC. Furthermore, according to the defined frequency regulation evaluation indexes, MATLAB/Simulink was used to simulate the battery storage coordinating generators for secondary frequency regulation. A typical continuous disturbance was selected in the simulation. The results of the simulation showed that the proposed strategy could enhance the effect of frequency regulation, improve the SOC of the battery storage, and increase the utilization rate of the generator set. © 2013 IEEE.","ACE; ARR; Battery storage; fuzzy logic method; secondary frequency regulation; SOC","Battery storage; Charging (batteries); Computer circuits; Electric frequency control; Fuzzy logic; Gas generators; Mathematical models; MATLAB; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Solar cells; System-on-chip; Automatic generation control; Frequency deviation; Frequency regulations; Fuzzy logic method; Integrated control strategy; Renewable energy source; Secondary frequency regulation; State of charge; Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050618244

However, most of the works that have been done are theoretical and do not present experimental implementation. In this work we performed an experimental study of a gyroscope beam system (gyroelastic beam) focused systems on the deflection of cantilever beams or the control of flexural stresses. We first used a simple two-degree of freedom model to better understand the terms governing the design, construction and experimental evaluation of gyroelastic beam systems. We then performed experimental tests at different velocities of the gyroscopic actuator and measured the deflection of the system. The results showed that it is possible to have control of the deflection and the bending forces for this type of configurations which can be exported to helicopter blades or wind turbine blades. © 2018 Brazilian Association of Computational Mechanics.

This paper reports a nondestructive method for the decomposition study of the reasons of degradation for LiCoO2 batteries. The values of parameters of the multiphysics model are obtained in a four-pattern aging test and, then, the components of the capacity fade, overpotential rise, and heat behavior are quantitatively calculated by using the identified parameters and model simulation. The capacity fade is divided into three components due to the changes of parameter, the volume fraction of active material (s), and stoichiometric numbers (x0 and xend) during aging process. The overpotential rising is divided into three components according to the reaction overpotential and the terminal voltage equations in the multiphysics model. In addition, the heat generation is divided into three components and the heat exchange is divided into two components based on the thermal part of the multiphysics model. All the decomposition results are graphically shown, and the ratios of the degradation components are presented in tables. The proposed method is expected to extend the applications of the multiphysics model and bring a new idea to the primary diagnosis of lithium-ion battery. © 2013 IEEE.","Degradation analysis; energy storage; lithium-ion batteries; nondestructive method","Aging of materials; Cobalt compounds; Degradation; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Energy storage; Ions; Lithium compounds; Testing; Degradation analysis; Heating system; Identified parameter; Model simulation; Multi-physics modeling; Nondestructive methods; Prognostics and health managements; Terminal voltages; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050402285

The stimulator salvages input energy and stores it in a storage capacitor, and, when the voltage reaches a threshold, releases the energy as an output stimulus. The dynamics of the circuit are automatically enabled by a positive feedback, eliminating any stimulation control circuit blocks. The IC is fabricated in a 180&#x00A0;nm CMOS process and achieves a quiescent current consumption of 1.8 &#x03BC;A. The inductive coupling front-end is optimized as a loaded resonator, in which the input impedance of the custom rectifier directly loads the inductive loop antenna. The loaded quality factor and the rectifier&#x0027;s efficiency determine the reception sensitivity of the stimulator, while a balance should be achieved for the robustness of the system against dielectric medium variations by increasing the reception bandwidth. The finalized stimulator adopts a 4.9&#x00A0;mm &#x00D7; 4.9&#x00A0;mm inductive loop antenna and achieves an overall assembly dimension of 5&#x00A0;mm &#x00D7; 7.5&#x00A0;mm. Operating at the resonant frequency of 198&#x00A0;MHz, the stimulator works at a 14&#x00A0;cm distance from the transmitter in the air. An animal experiment was performed, in which a fully implanted stimulator excited the sciatic nerve of a rat that consequently triggered the movement of the limb.

These current efforts, largely focused on the C 3 model Arabidopsis thaliana or crop plants (e.g. rice, sorghum, maize, and wheat), could be intensified and broadened using model systems closely related to our food, feed, and energy crops and that allow rapid design-build-test-learn cycles. In this outlooking Opinion, we advocate for a concerted effort to expand our understanding and improve our ability to redesign carbon uptake, allocation, and utilization. We propose two specific research directions that combine enhanced photosynthesis with climate-smart metabolic attributes: (i) engineering pathways for flexible (facultative) C 3 -C 4 metabolism where plants will operate either C 3 or C 4 photosynthesis based on environmental conditions such as temperature, light, and atmospheric CO 2 levels; and (ii) increasing rhizospheric sink strength for carbon utilization, including strategies that allow for augmented transport of carbon to the soil for improved soil properties and carbon storage without jeopardizing aboveground crop biomass. We argue that such ambitious undertakings be first approached and demonstrated by exploring the full genomic potential of two model grasses, the C 3 Brachypodium distachyon and the C 4 Setaria viridis. The development of climate-smart crops could provide novel and bold solutions to increase crop productivity while reducing atmospheric carbon and nitrogen emissions. © The Author(s) 2018.

These technologies demand the use of batteries. Sunlight, an abundant clean source of energy, can alleviate the energy limits of batteries, while batteries can address photovoltaic intermittency. This perspective paper focuses on advancing concepts in PV-battery system design while providing critical discussion, review, and prospect. Reports on discrete and integrated PV-battery designs are discussed. Three key technical challenges, namely energy density, efficiency, and stability, toward further advancement of integrated PV-battery systems are discussed. We present a perspective on opportunities and future directions, highlighting key strategies on developing such PV-battery systems. Key focus should be on the development of innovative designs that incorporates high-capacity, efficient, and stable materials, emphasizing the demonstration of practical viability of such integrated PV-battery systems. Today's world is energy driven and batteries have become an integral part as an energy source considering the technological advances in consumer electronics to electric vehicles, renewables, and smart grids. Batteries are energy limited and require recharging. Recharging batteries with solar energy by means of solar cells can offer a convenient option for smart consumer electronics. Meanwhile, batteries can be used to address the intermittency concern of photovoltaics. This perspective discusses the advances in battery charging using solar energy. Conventional design of solar charging batteries involves the use of batteries and solar modules as two separate units connected by electric wires. Advanced design involves the integration of in situ battery storage in solar modules, thus offering compactness and fewer packaging requirements with the potential to become less costly. This advancement can be advantageous for consumer electronics where space, size, and packaging requirements hold greater value. Three major metrics, namely energy density, efficiency, and stability, have been addressed by presenting relevant challenges and potential opportunities. The integrated design is still in the early R&D phase. There is a need for innovative designs that explore high-capacity, efficient, and stable materials. Meanwhile, to demonstrate its practical viability, this integrated design should also focus on real-world applications such as wearables that demand specific requirements of energy and power. This perspective provides insights into battery-charging designs using solar energy. Advances in conventional-discrete-type and advanced-integrated-type systems are summarized. Three key challenges of such integrated-type systems, namely energy density, overall efficiency, and stability, are discussed while presenting potential opportunities to overcome them. Finally, the perspective provides some practical considerations that would guide future efforts. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","integration, solar charging; lithium-ion; perovskite solar cell; photo rechargeable battery; photocharging; redox flow battery; solar battery; solar rechargeable battery; wearables","Design; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Flow batteries; Lithium-ion batteries; Perovskite; Perovskite solar cells; Smart power grids; Solar cell arrays; Solar cells; Solar energy; System stability; Thermoelectricity; Wearable technology; Critical discussions; Enabling technologies; Lithium ions; Photocharging; Solar charging; Technical challenges; Technological advances; wearables; Charging (batteries); consumer-resource interaction; design; energy efficiency; ion; lithium; photovoltaic system; research and development; solar power",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046161595

The paper makes a simulation analysis of the hydrogen storage capacity of the calcium-decorated bilayer grapheme using the first principles based on density functional theory. The layer spacing between the double layers of grapheme was regulated by doping CA element. The optimal adsorption model of hydrogen storage of the bilayer grapheme was simulated using the vast package. Ultimately, the binding energy of hydrogen meets the U.S. department of energy's range of -0.2eV to -0.6eV. CA can adsorb on the interlayer of bilayer grapheme without clustering and have high hydrogen storage capacity. The empty pp. orbital of boron is used as a strong charge receptor, thus improving the adsorption capacity of CA on bilayer grapheme. The stability of the modified system and the excellent hydrogen storage performance are obtained through the simulation calculation. The system can adsorb up to 8 hydrogen molecules.

Considering the uncertainty of wind power, the restriction of pumped storage and storage battery, the new operation strategy can not only use the shifting mode of pumped storage, but also can use battery to stabilize the wind wave mode.

We propose a combined mode of WT and NPP, NPP adopts the operation mode of ″12-3-6-3″. When NPP operates in a fixed manner, WT outputs as much as possible, the task of peak-shaving is mainly completed by TPGU and PSPS. The wind power curtailment condition will only happen in the case of absence of peak shaving capacity. Taking the effects of the uncertainty of wind power, the operation mode of NPP and PSPS into account, and a scheduling model was established which the objective functions are both the maximum capacity of wind power consumption and the minimum system costs. The particle swarm algorithm was used to solve this model. We used the power network dispatching date of Chinese province to verify the effectiveness of the model.

While both enhancing the thermal conductivity and reducing the electrical conductivity of the polymer nanocomposites can reduce the thermal effects, it is found that reducing the electrical conductivity is more effective.

Carbon dioxide utilization is emerging as a complementary technology to carbon dioxide capture and storage for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and as a promising source of competitive advantage for European industry. Current carbon dioxide utilisation technologies are at different stages of maturity, with some being ready to implement immediately. Others are still under research or at a pilot or demonstration phase, requiring further development to reach commercial maturity. Thus, the profitability of such processes under current market conditions is still under evaluation. This study explores the conditions required for an environmentally and economically feasible methanol producing carbon dioxide utilisation system embedded in the energy system. The choice to produce methanol is based on its current mature commercial status and on growing global demand, which makes it an attractive product. The concept proposed considers only one system actor: a wind power producer with a typical operating wind power generation portfolio that invests in a new technology to maximise the total profit. The core of the business model is based on decisions for: (i) selling the wind power in the day-ahead or intraday bidding sessions of the power market or, (ii) producing methanol to be sold to third parties. Several scenarios are tested within the proposed business model to define optimum conditions. Limitations for the economic feasibility of the methanol plant integration into a market with an increasing integration of renewable energy are also highlighted. Results show that producing methanol instead of selling the wind power generated in the market is more profitable when the methanol plant size is three times smaller than a conventional and when power is generated by high speed winds. Under such conditions, the power market energy mix has high amounts of wind power and thus, already a significantly lower carbon dioxide emissions rate. Wind power supplied to the small methanol plant is less than 1% of the total wind energy produced. Furthermore, the wind producer could increase profits by up to 33% by integrating methanol production into their business strategy rather than selling all the energy produced in the power market. © 2018 The Authors","Carbon dioxide utilisation; Methanol production; Wind power-to-methanol business model","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Competition; Electric power generation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methanol; Profitability; Sales; Wind power; Business modeling; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon dioxide utilization; Economic feasibilities; Integration of renewable energies; Methanol production; Renewable energy source; Power markets; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; electricity generation; emission control; energy market; environmental economics; international agreement; methanol; numerical model; power generation; profitability; wind power; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045124936

Masterbatch approach was used to achieve more efficient dispersion of CNCs in PLA matrix. Modified CNCs (b-CNCs) were prepared using benzoic acid as a nontoxic material through a green esterification method in a solvent-free technique. Transmission electron microscopy images did not exhibit significant differences in the structure of b-CNCs as compared with unmodified CNCs. However, a reduction of 6.6–15.5% in the aspect ratio of b-CNCs was observed. The fracture surface of PLA-b-CNCs nanocomposites exhibited rough and irregular pattern which confirmed the need of more energy for fracture. Pristine CNCs showed a decrease in the thermal stability of nanocomposites, however, b-CNCs nanocomposites exhibited higher thermal stability than pure PLA. The average storage modulus was improved by 38 and 48% by addition of CNCs and b-CNCs in PLA, respectively.

The device uses a clockwork to recover the remaining kinetic energy after the motor is de-energized. When the motor is started again, the clockwork releases the elastic potential energy driving the motor to rotate to a certain speed, and then turns on the motor power, this can achieve the purpose of ""current reduction and torque protection"". The device has the advantages of high energy conversion efficiency and low cost, can be used without changing the overall layout of the original equipment and does not affect the normal operation of the motor, and is easy to promote. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Clocks; Computer aided design; Conversion efficiency; Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Manufacture; Potential energy; Continuous heating; Current reduction; Elastic potential energy; High energy consumption; High energy conversions; Motor power; Motor starting; Normal operations; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050563709

Thus, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 and its utilization in metal–CO2 batteries have attracted wide attention because the batteries can simultaneously accelerate CO2 fixation/utilization and energy storage/release. Here, rechargeable Al–CO2 batteries are proposed and realized, which use chemically stable Al as the anode. The batteries display small discharge/charge voltage gaps down to 0.091 V and high energy efficiencies up to 87.7%, indicating an efficient battery performance. Their chemical reaction mechanism to produce the performance is revealed to be 4Al + 9CO2 ↔ 2Al2(CO3)3 + 3C, by which CO2 is reversibly utilized.

The precise control of the interstitial lattice sites on the surface is able to modulate the movement of metal ions by suppressing the diffusion and dissolution of transition metal ions while maintaining the mobility of Li+, resulting in a very stable cathode with excellent cyclability and rate capability.Enhancing the energy density of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is becoming increasingly important to the ever-growing demand for energy storage. The major challenge comes from the paradox between the high energy density and the intrinsic instability of the electrode materials, causing concerns about the feasibility of the practical use of the LIBs with high energy density. Cathode materials are considered as the key component for LIBs and their degradation is proposed to originate from the unwilling electrode/electrolyte interface issues. Therefore, surface modification is believed to be critical for the stabilization of high-energy-density battery systems. This work provides a unique perspective on the modification of cathode materials by directly modulating the vacant lattice sites on the particle surface, opening up great opportunities for both the practical application of high-energy-density LIBs and fundamental studies in the surface modification of functional materials.Lithium-ion batteries with high energy density are being intensively pursued to meet the ever-growing demand for energy storage. However, the increase in energy density often comes with an elevated instability of electrode materials, causing major concerns about the reliability and safety of lithium-ion batteries. Here, we report a strategy for stabilizing cathode materials by modulating the vacant lattice sites on the particle surface. Using the high-voltage Li[Ni0.5Mn1.5]O4 as an example, we demonstrate that introduction of a 10-nm epitaxial surface layer with Al3+ in the empty 16c octahedral sites of the spinel Li[Ni0.5Mn1.5]O4 suppresses structural degradation during cycling by increasing the surface stability without interfering with the Li+ diffusion around the Al3+ sites. Control of the Al3+ concentration in the surface region was shown to be a facile process. The process was shown to stabilize long-term cycling of Li[Ni0.5Mn1.5]O4 to 5 V versus Li+/Li0. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","cathode; interstitial site; LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4; lithium-ion battery; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy; surface stabilization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046679437

However, the lack of low-cost cathodes with high energy density and long cycle life always limits its application. In this work, high-energy layered P2-type hierarchical K0.65Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 (P2-KFMO) microspheres, assembled by the primary nanoparticles, are fabricated via a modified solvent-thermal method. Benefiting from the unique microspheres with primary nanoparticles, the K+ intercalation/deintercalation kinetics of P2-KFMO is greatly enhanced with a stabilized cathodic electrolyte interphase on the cathode. The P2-KFMO microsphere presents a highly reversible potassium storage capacity of 151 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1, fast rate capability of 103 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1, and long cycling stability with 78% capacity retention after 350 cycles.

Unscented particle filter (UPF) algorithm is becoming a promising method for battery state estimation since it combines the latest measurement information to give the proposal distribution which is closer to the true posterior distribution. At the same time, UPF algorithm is able to represent the uncertainty involved in the estimation results, which makes great significance for battery SOH estimation. On the other hand, it is difficult to measure the battery actual capacity in practice despite the capacity is a direct indicator of battery SOH. In this paper, an on-line health indicator (HI) is extracted from the measurable parameters while battery is working. The mapping model between the extracted HI and battery SOH is established and applied as the observation in the state-space model. An on-line estimator based on UPF algorithm is developed for battery SOH assessment. The maximum estimation error based on battery cycling test data is less than 5%. This indicates that the proposed method has a good adaptability for lithium-ion battery degradation with non-linear and non-Gaussian characteristics. Additionally, the experiments on different types of lithium-ion battery show the good robustness and applicability of this approach. © 2013 IEEE.","Health indicator; Lithium-ion battery; On-line SOH estimation; Unscented particle filter","Digital storage; Estimation; Health; Ions; Lithium-ion batteries; Monte Carlo methods; State space methods; Battery energy storage system (BESS); Health indicators; Measurable parameters; Measurement information; Posterior distributions; Proposal distribution; State - space models; Unscented particle filters; Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049678645

This study examined the actual removal of nutrients by measuring the amounts of biomass removed (from a forest products perspective) combined with their respective nutrient concentrations (N, P, Ca, K and Mg), from a clear-felled area when using the dried-stacked and fresh-stacked methods. The most important finding is that the two methods were very similar regarding nutrients remaining at the clear-felled area. Of the nutrients remaining there, most were found to be well distributed between the harvester heaps. Both methods fulfilled the requirements of the Swedish Forest Agency. A sensitivity analysis showed that even if the dried-stacked method left more needles, or the fresh-stacked method extracted more logging residues, there would only be a small impact on the levels of nutrients removed. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the amount of logging residues remaining between the harvester heaps seems to be much more important for nutrients left behind, regardless of extraction method. With this in mind, it is highly probable that improvements to the extraction of logging residues, without increasing nutrient removal, can be made. © 2018 The Author(s).

All water cycle variables on the Earth are closely interconnected with each other through the process of energy and water circulation. Observing, understanding and predicting the storage, movement, and quality of water remains a grand challenge for contemporary water science and technology, especially for researches across different spatio-temporal scales. The remote sensing observing platform has a unique advantage in acquiring complex water information and has already greatly improved observing, understanding, and predicting ability of the water cycle. Methods of obtaining comprehensive water cycle data are also expanded by new remote sensing techniques, and the vast amount of data has become increasingly available and thus accelerated a new Era: the Remote Sensing Big Data Study of Global Water Cycle. The element inversion, time and space reconstruction, and scale conversion are three key scientific issues for remote sensing water cycle in such Era. Moreover, it also presents a huge opportunity of capitalizing the combinations of Remote Sensing and Big Data to advance and improve the global hydrology and water security research and development, and uncork the new bottlenecks. © 2018 The Author(s).

X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that a perovskite structure was obtained for all compositions. The effects of non-stoichiomotery content and temperature on dielectric properties and energy storage performance of PLZT2/95/5 ceramics were systematically investigated. The ceramics with all non-stoichiometric additions undergo two phase transitions during heating from 140 to 240°C: anti-ferroelectric-ferroelectric and ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions. With the y values increasing, both dielectric constant and transition temperature of the ceramics gradually increased.

In the previous work, we summarized the lessons learned in various high energy density materials (HEDM) programs, the different degrees of freedom in which to store energy in materials, and the fundamental limitations and orders of magnitude of the energies involved. That discussion focused almost exclusively on the topic of molar energy density (J/mol) from the perspective of the energy of oxidation of the elements and Fritz Zwicky's ""free atom limit."" In this study, we extend the analysis by considering a different, though equally important, aspect of the energy density calculation: the volumetric density of the energetic material. Specifically, we examine how the distances between individual atoms (i.e. intra- and inter-molecular bond lengths) are coupled to (in fact, approximately inversely proportional to) the energy stored in the bonds of the molecule. This relationship further limits the chemical energy that theoretically can be stored in a material below that predicted by the ""free atom limit.""

In this paper, a day-ahead optimal dynamic scheduling for a stand-alone microgrid containing wind, PV solar, fuel cell, diesel generator and energy storage system is implemented. The primary objective of the dynamic economic scheduling is to minimize the energy production cost, maximize the energy storage system economic benefit and enhance the utilization of the renewables in the microgrid. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization approach is proposed to solve the economic scheduling problem. Fluctuations of the load demands and renewables in the microgrid are considered and relevant predictions have been made to surmount these fluctuations. The proposed economic scheduling strategy has been tested on a case study microgrid in stand-alone mode (Goldwind Microgrid System, Beijing, China). Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed approach can solve the day-ahead scheduling problem in a reasonably fast computation time. To validate and compare the performances of the proposed strategy, simulation results were also obtained using Pattern Search (PS) optimization technique. Comparisons of simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GA-based dynamic economic scheduling in attaining a minimum total cost of energy production within a short computation time. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economic analysis; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Genetic algorithms; Renewable energy resources; Van de Graaff generators; Day-ahead scheduling; Economic scheduling; Energy productions; Energy storage systems; Genetic-algorithm optimizations; Micro-grid systems; Optimization techniques; Stand-alone modes; Scheduling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050023568

Due to the randomness of the localized field supported by silver and gold nanopatterns in conventional structures, the quantitative analysis of the target in the practical application of SERS sensing is a challenge. Here, a superabsorbing metasurface with hybrid Ag–Au nanostructures is proposed. A two-step process of deposition plus subsequent thermal annealing is developed to shrink the gap among the metallic nanoparticles with no top-down lithography technology involved. Because of the light trapping strategy enabled by the hybrid Ag–Au metasurface structure, the excitation laser energy can be localized at the edges of the nanoparticles more efficiently, resulting in enhanced sensing resolution. Intriguingly, because more hot spots are excited over a given area with higher density of small nanoparticles, the spatial distribution of the localized field is more uniform, resulting in superior performance for potential quantitative sensing of drugs (i.e., cocaine) and chemicals (i.e., molecules with thiol groups in this report). Furthermore, the final coating of the second Au nanoparticle layer improves the reliability of the chip, which is demonstrated effective after 12 month shelf time in an ambient storage environment. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Although degradation of SSPs by the aspartic proteases isolated from seeds has been documented in vitro, there is still no genetic evidence for involvement of aspartic proteases in seed germination. Here we report that the aspartic protease ASPG1 (ASPARTIC PROTEASE IN GUARD CELL 1) plays an important role in the process of dormancy, viability and germination of Arabidopsis seeds. We show that aspg1-1 mutants have enhanced seed dormancy and reduced seed viability. A significant increase in expression of DELLA genes which act as repressors in the gibberellic acid signal transduction pathway were detected in aspg1-1 during seed germination. Seed germination of aspg1-1 mutants was more sensitive to treatment with paclobutrazol (PAC; a gibberellic acid biosynthesis inhibitor). In contrast, seed germination of ASPG1 overexpression (OE) transgenic lines showed resistant to PAC. The degradation of SSPs in germinating seeds was severely impaired in aspg1-1 mutants. Moreover, the development of aspg1-1 young seedlings was arrested when grown on the nutrient-free medium. Thus ASPG1 is important for seed dormancy, seed longevity and seed germination, and its function is associated with degradation of SSPs and regulation of gibberellic acid signaling in Arabidopsis. © 2018 The Author(s).","ABA; Aspartic protease; Gibberellic acid; Seed dormancy; Seed germination; Seed longevity; Seed storage protein","Arabidopsis protein; gibberellic acid; gibberellin; paclobutrazol; seed storage protein; triazole derivative; Arabidopsis; dormancy; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; germination; growth, development and aging; metabolism; mutation; physiology; plant seed; seedling; signal transduction; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Germination; Gibberellins; Mutation; Plant Dormancy; Plants, Genetically Modified; Seed Storage Proteins; Seedlings; Seeds; Signal Transduction; Triazoles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050992169

Although the production of most persistent organic pollutants (POPs) was banned years ago, these toxicants persist in the environment due to their resistance to biodegradation and widespread distribution in various environmental forms (e.g., vapor, sediment, and water). As a result, human exposure to these toxicants is inevitable. Largely due to their lipophilicity, POPs bioaccumulate in adipose tissue, resulting in greater body burdens of these environmental toxicants with obesity. POPs of major concern include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDDs/PCDFs), and polybrominated biphenyls and diphenyl ethers (PBBs/PBDEs), among other organic compounds. In this review, we (i) highlight the physical characteristics of toxicants that enable them to partition into and remain stored in adipose tissue, (ii) discuss the specific mechanisms of action by which these toxicants act to influence adipocyte function, and (iii) review associations between POP exposures and the development of obesity and diabetes.

While PCM provides energy and density advantages over conventional DRAM memory, it faces endurance challenges. Such challenges are exacerbated when employing memory encryption as the stored data is essentially randomized, losing data locality and reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of energy and endurance aware encoding techniques. This results in increasing dynamic energy consumption and accelerated wear out. In this paper we propose counter advance, a technique to leverage the process of encryption to improve reliability and lifetime while maintaining low-energy and low-latency operation. Counter advance is compatible with standard error-correction codes (ECC) and error correction pointers (ECP), the standard for mitigating endurance faults in PCM. Counter advance achieves the same fault tolerance using three ECP pointers for a 10-4 cell failure rate compared to the leading approach to consider energy savings and reliability for encrypted PCM (SECRET) using five ECP pointers. At a failure rate of 10-2 , counter advance can achieve an uncorrectable bit error rate (UBER) of 10-10 , compared to &lt; 10-4 for SECRET, using six ECP pointers. This leads to a lifetime improvement of 3.8× while maintaining comparable energy consumption and access latency. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","and error correction; Emerging memories; reliability; stuck-At faults","Bit error rate; Computer architecture; Dynamic random access storage; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Error correction; Failure analysis; Fault tolerance; Microprocessor chips; Phase change materials; Phase change memory; Program processors; Reliability; Emerging memory; Encoding techniques; Lifetime improvement; Memory technology; Phase change memory (pcm); Server applications; Stuck-at faults; Uncorrectable bit error rates; Cryptography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050749186

The generation system usually supplies a storage system with the capability to store the produced energy for satisfying a user’s future demand. In this paper, the main objective is to determine the best strategies of energy consumption and optimal storage capacities for residential users, which are both closely related to the energy cost of the users. Energy management with storage capacity optimization is studied by considering the cost of renewable energy generation, depreciation cost of storage and bidirectional energy trading. To minimize the cost to residential users, the non-cooperative game-theoretic method is employed to formulate the model that combines energy consumption and storage capacity optimization.

A kinematic wave approach is combined with heat storage and transfer schemes to develop a model for pervious and impervious pavements. The resulting framework is a numerical prognostic model that can simulate the temperature fields in the subsurface and runoff layers to capture the rapid cooling of the surface, as well as the thermal pollution advected in the runoff. Extensive field measurements are conducted over several types of experimental pavements in Arizona to probe the physics and then to validate the model. The experimental data and the model results are in good agreement, and their joint analysis elucidates the physics of the rapid heat transfer from the subsurface to the runoff. A demonstrative application of the model over a (hypothetical) parking lot, with impervious or pervious asphalt, is then presented. It illustrates that the rate of ground surface temperature cooling for the impervious pavement is lower than the pervious one (where infiltration is very effective at removing heat). Finally, the analysis of the energy budgets unravels the relative importance of the various physical mechanisms in transferring heat from the subsurface to the runoff and the atmosphere. This transfer is dominated by terms associated with water flux and subsurface heat extraction, while latent, sensible, and radiative heat fluxes are minor contributors. The findings underline the importance of including rainfall-induced cooling in geophysical models that seek to study urban heat islands or urban precipitation modification. ©2018.

Distributed batteries equipped in demand-side can not only contribute to the reliability and security of the grid, but also make profits by participating in the electricity market, especially when distributed batteries are combined and operated by an aggregator. Considering the well-operated mechanism of performance based regulation (PBR) in the U.S. electricity market, it becomes increasingly lucrative for batteries to participate not only in energy markets for energy arbitrage, but also in ancillary service markets to provide regulation and peak-load shaving services. In this study, distributed batteries are operated and coordinated by the aggregator, which simultaneously submits offers to the energy and the ancillary service markets as an individual entity. An optimal decision model is formulated for the aggregator to determine the operation and bidding strategy for the distributed batteries by considering the characteristics of batteries, including the terms of capacity, efficiency and degradation cost.

However, current thick electrodes suffer from uncontrollable geometries and architectures, which lead to ion diffusion limitations, and poor mechanical properties. Here, designed, superelastic polypyrrole (PPy)-coated graphene aerogel (GA) electrodes are fabricated via 3D printing and polymer self-assembly methods. This resilient GA template (up to 90% compression) can be printed into any desired shape including engineered 3D architectures with periodic macropores, which promote the uniform deposition and adhesion of PPy onto the support. The coated PPy thin film increases the specific gravimetric capacitance of the GA electrode from 14 to 395 F g−1 with 90% retention after 5000 charging–discharging cycles. The capacitance remains the same value after 100 times compression cycles. It also improves the compressive strength by one order of magnitude from 0.14 to 2.4 MPa. Areal capacitance and energy density of the PPy–GA electrode are 2 F cm−2 and 0.78 mWh cm−2, respectively, which to the best of the knowledge break the record for compressible electrodes, respectively.

The storage system can provide stabilization services and is pivotal for backup power for emergencies. With a continuous rise in fuel prices and increasing environmental issues, the energy from renewable resources is gaining more popularity. The main drawbacks of some renewable sources are their intermittent energy generation and uncertain source availability, which has increased interest in energy storage systems (ESSs). This paper investigates the economic feasibility when ESSs are introduced in the electric grid with an expansion of a storage system as well as more percentage of the renewable energy integration and less percentage of fuel consumption by conventional power sources. The Artificial Neural Network is implemented to validate the forecasted load model. The uncertainties associated with the renewable energy system are handled by a chance-constrained model and solved by a genetic algorithm (GA) in MATLAB; selection criteria of GA for optimization process is also discussed in detail.

As memory capacity increases, refresh penalty has become increasingly worse as more rows have to be refreshed. In this work, we propose an effective refresh approach called Compression-Aware Refresh (CAR) to efficiently mitigate refresh overheads. We apply a data compression technique to store data in a compressed format so that the resultant sparse banks need only be partially refreshed. Because of compression, data blocks which are originally distributed across all the constituent chips of a rank only need to be stored in a subset of those chips, leaving banks in the remaining chips not fully occupied. As a result, the memory controller can safely skip refreshing memory rows which contain no useful data without compromising data integrity. Such a compression-aware refresh scheme significantly reduces the refresh and thus improves overall memory performance and energy efficiency. To further take advantage of data compression, we adopt a rank subsetting technique to enable accesses to only those occupied chips for memory requests accessing compressed data blocks. Evaluations using benchmarks from SPEC CPU 2006 and the PARSEC 3.0 on recent DDR4 memory systems have shown that CAR achieves up to 1.66x performance improvement (11.7 percent on average) and up to 45.9 percent energy reduction (27.3 percent on average), and reduce memory traffic by up to 99.9 percent for zero cache lines intensive workloads with an average of 66.3 percent across all benchmarks. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","compression; DRAM refresh; energy; performance","Automobiles; Benchmarking; Compaction; Data compression; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Vehicle performance; Benchmark testing; DRAM refresh; energy; Memory management; performance; Performance evaluations; Random access memory; Cache memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048699667

An integrated photovoltaic-electrochemical (EC)-storage system offers a solution, but the thermodynamic efficiency of the 'ideal' integrated system and the optimum configuration needed to realize the limit is known only for a few simple cases. Moreover, these limits are often derived through complex numerical simulations. In this paper, we show that a simple, conceptually transparent and physically intuitive analytical formula can precisely describe the of a 'generalized' PV-EC integrated system. An M-cell PV module of N-junction bifacial tandem cells is illuminated under S-suns and mounted over ground of albedo R. There are K-EC cells in series, each defined by their reaction potential, exchange current, and Tafel slope. We derive the optimum thermodynamic limit (N,M,K,R,S) for all possible combinations of a PV-EC design. For a setup with optimal-(M,K) and large N, under 1-sun illumination and albedo = 0, the ultimate limit is ∼ 52%. A comparison of our results with experimental results published by various groups worldwide suggests opportunities for further progress toward the corresponding thermodynamic limit. © 2011-2012 IEEE.","Electrochemical (EC) devices; energy storage; fuels; photovoltaic (PV) systems; water-splitting","Cathodes; Cells; Current density; Cytology; Energy storage; Fuel storage; Fueling; Integrated control; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic cells; Solar radiation; Thermodynamics; Electrochemical (EC) devices; Electrochemical systems; Optimum configurations; Photovoltaic systems; Seasonal variability; Thermodynamic efficiency; Thermodynamic limits; Water splitting; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048496847

These soft structures are inherently compliant and enable large strains in components not typically found in robotics. Such capabilities have inspired robotic engineers to incorporate soft technologies into their designs. One goal in soft robotics is to endow robots with new, bioinspired features that permit morphologically adaptive interactions with unpredictable environments. Here, we review three key elements of bioinspired soft robots from a mechanics vantage point, namely, materials selection, actuation, and design. Soft materials are necessary for safe interaction and overall actuation of bio-inspired robots. The intrinsic properties of materials in soft robots allow for an “embodied intelligence” that can potentially reduce the mechanical and algorithmic complexity in ways not possible with rigid-bodied robots Finally, soft robotics can be combined with tissue engineering and synthetic biology to create bio-hybrid systems with unique sensing, dynamic response, and mobility.

This research aims to provide useful meaning to the general DOE safety target by establishing a link between the safety-related characteristics of candidate storage materials and satisfaction of DOE safety target. Accordingly, a science-based framework has been developed and consists of standardized materials tests (based on internationally accepted ASTM and United Nations testing protocols), novel risk mitigation strategies, and subscale system demonstration. The examined storage materials include NaAlH4, AlH3, 2LiBH4 + MgH2, 3Mg(NH2)2·8LiH, NH3BH3, and activated carbon (Maxsorb AX-21). The scope of safety tests covers conditions that the storage material may encounter during postulated accident scenarios such as dust cloud explosion, materials reactivity in air and other fluids, hot-surface contact, mechanical impact, and fast depressurization. The generated results uncovered potential fire and explosion risks under accidental conditions. The generated insights can be useful for assigning realistic probability values needed for quantifying risk scenarios, characterizing material's hazard class, and supporting current and new hydrogen safety codes and standards. For risk mitigation, this study showed that powder compaction could be effective in suppressing pyrophoricity of hydride powders such as NaAlH4. Also, the study has experimentally demonstrated that adding (NH4)H2PO4 as a flame retardant to the hydride powder before compaction could suppress sensitivity of hydrides like NaAlH4 to ignite due to mechanical impact. The results also revealed that Maxsorb AX-21 to be a safer hydrogen storage medium compared to the examined hydrides which exhibited potential safety concerns under certain accident conditions. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers","On-board storage; Powder compaction; Pyrophoricity; Risk assessment; Risk mitigation; Water reactivity","Accidents; Activated carbon; Air; Aluminum compounds; Compaction; Explosions; Fuel cells; Hydrides; Lithium compounds; Magnesium compounds; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Safety testing; Sodium compounds; Hydrogen storage medium; On board storage; Powder compactions; Pyrophoricity; Risk mitigation; Risk mitigation strategy; Standardized materials; U.S. Department of Energy; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047383776

Root-derived C inputs affect both soil microbial contribution to and degradation of soil organic matter resulting in differing soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, storage, and stabilities under different vegetation regimes. Here, we measured biomarker amino sugars and neutral sugars and used diffuse reflectance mid-infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to explore microbial C contributions, degradation ability, and SOC stability, respectively, under four potential bioenergy crops, M.×giganteus (Miscanthus × giganteus), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a mixed prairie, and a maize (Zea mays L.)–maize–soybean (Glycine max(L.) Merr.) (MMS) rotation over six growing seasons. Our results showed that SOC concentration (g/kg) increased by 10.6% in mixed prairie over the duration of this experiment and SOC storage (Mg/ha) increased by 17.0% and 15.6% in switchgrass and mixed prairie, respectively. Conversion of row crops to perennial grasses maintained SOC stability and increased bacterial residue contribution to SOC in M.×giganteus and switchgrass by 20.0% and 15.0%, respectively, after 6 years. Degradation of microbe-derived labile SOC was increased in M.×giganteus, and degradation of both labile and stable SOC increased in MMS rotation. These results demonstrate that microbial communities under perennial grasses maintained SOC quality, while SOC quantity increased under switchgrass and mixed prairie. Annual MMS rotation displayed decreases in aspects of SOC quality without changes in SOC quantity. These findings have implications for understanding microbial control over soil C quantity and quality under land-use shift from annual to perennial bioenergy cropping systems. © 2018 The Authors.

Inspired by the high capacity of silicon anode, we here report for the first time a theoretical first-principles investigation into the scientific feasibility of using siligraphene (g-SiC5 and g-SiC2) as a high-capacity anode material for LIBs. The results show that siligraphene working as an LIB anode possesses the advantages of high stability from graphene and high capacity from silicene. While the pristine graphene offers limited Li storage capacity due to the weak Li/graphene interaction, the fundamental Li-Si chemistry ensures a strong Li adsorption in siligraphene and thus allows more Li to be stored. The monolayer siligraphene g-SiC5 and g-SiC2 can be lithiated into Li5SiC5 and Li5Si2C4 respectively, offering a respective theoretical capacity of 1520 mAh/g and 1286 mAh/g. On the other hand, the unique two dimensional honeycomb structure of siligraphene promotes a high electron and Li-ion conductivity to achieve fast cycling rate with negligible volume expansion. The mechanisms on how Si in siligraphene enhances Li/siligraphene interaction are particularly discussed.

These devices are already collecting zettabytes (1021) of data. However, the current IoT framework suffers from limited sensor energy, communication bandwidth, and server storage. These limitations impede the ability to send all the sensor data to the server all the time. Compact smart sensors provide a way to address this challenge. As opposed to the conventional sense-and-transmit sensors, emerging smart sensors can collect data, extract features, derive local inferences, and transmit only inference outcomes and possibly some raw data associated with rare events instead of all the raw data. This can dramatically cut down on the amount of sensor data transmitted, and hence its communication energy and network traffic. However, edge or server inference models trained with conventional machine learning approaches do not account for the fact that the smart sensors in the system have already performed a local inference. These approaches need all the sensor data and hence only cater to the traditional sense-and-transmit paradigm. This undoes the energy benefits brought about by smart sensors. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical inference model for IoT applications based on hierarchical learning and local inferences. Our model is able to take advantage of inference already performed on smart sensors, while at the same time accommodating conventional sense-and-transmit sensors in the IoT system. It also generalizes sensor-level inference to inference at other edge nodes by exploiting the intrinsically sensor/edge-grouped IoT data structure. We train classifiers hierarchically, aligned with the sensor-edge-server IoT paradigm. We verify our approach with seven IoT applications, demonstrating that the model is accurate, efficient, and generally applicable. We derive four edge-level inference models and four server-level inference models for these applications. For the four edge-level inference models, we reduce the number of bits transmitted from the sensor by 3.2 ×-42.7 × while at the same time also improving the classification accuracy by 0.3-6.7 percent. For the four server-level inference models, we reduce the number of edge-to-server bits transmitted by 17 × - 60 ×, with classification accuracy change in the -0.4- +0.1 percent range. © 2015 IEEE.","Energy efficiency; hierarchical inference; hierarchical learning; internet-of-things; machine learning; smart sensors","Artificial intelligence; Data acquisition; Data structures; Deep learning; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Feature extraction; Green computing; Hierarchical systems; Intelligent robots; Learning systems; Servers; Smart sensors; Support vector machines; Computational model; hierarchical inference; Hierarchical learning; Intelligent sensors; Robot sensing system; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044714191

In this study, we hypothesized that stimulation (i.e., permeability enhancement) in the Fenton Hill reservoir occurred through a mixed-mechanism process that involved propagation of hydraulic splay fractures encouraged by the stress changes induced as natural fractures opened and failed in shear. We used a hydromechanical fractured reservoir numerical model to validate the efficacy of the mixed-mechanism stimulation conceptual model. Our modeling results were consistent with the observations recorded during the Fenton Hill field experiments in three distinct ways: (1) a marked increase in injectivity occurred at a threshold injection pressure, (2) the near wellbore injectivity enhancement following each stimulation treatment was reversible, and (3) seismicity propagated in a direction that was inconsistent with the orientation of the maximum principal stress, despite injection having occurred at pressures significantly above the fracturing pressure. The modeling results demonstrate that several independent hydromechanical observations could be replicated by the mixed-mechanism stimulation conceptual model. In contrast, the observations could not be explained by a pure mode-I hydraulic fracture propagation nor by pure shear stimulation. Distinct fracture sets are activated through the mixed-mechanism stimulation process; the natural fractures provide most of the heat transfer surface area, and the tensile splay fractures form the bulk of the fluid storage volume. Future EGS projects could take advantage of mixed-mechanism stimulation to design wellbore completion and reservoir engineering and strategies to increase effective transmissivity, improve heat mining efficiency, and extend useful reservoir lifetime. © 2018 The Authors","Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS); Hydraulic fracture propagation; Induced seismicity; Renewable energy; Reservoir geomechanics; Shear stimulation","Boreholes; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Heat transfer; Hydraulic fracturing; Induced Seismicity; Oil field equipment; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Enhanced geothermal systems; Heat transfer surface area; Hydraulic fracture propagation; Injectivity enhancement; Maximum principal stress; Permeability enhancement; Renewable energies; Reservoir geomechanics; Fracture; alternative energy; enhanced geothermal system; fracture propagation; geomechanics; heat transfer; hydraulic fracturing; induced seismicity; numerical model; stress change; Fenton Hill; New Mexico; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043464822

A set of frequent patterns that represent basic functions are pre-stored in Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) and reused. The primary limitation to using associative memory in modern parallel processors is the large search energy required by TCAMs. In TCAMs, all rows that match, except hit rows, precharge and discharge for every search operation, resulting in high energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a new Multiple-Access Single-Charge (MASC) TCAM architecture which is capable of searching TCAM contents multiple times with only a single precharge cycle. In contrast to previous designs, the MASC TCAM keeps the match-line voltage of all miss-rows high and uses their charge for the next search operation, while only the hit rows discharge. We use periodic refresh to control the accuracy of the search. We also implement a new type of approximate associative memory by setting longer refresh times for MASC TCAMs, which yields search results within 1-2 bit Hamming distances of the exact value. To further decrease the energy consumption of MASC TCAM and reduce the area, we implement MASC with crossbar TCAMs. Our evaluation on AMD Southern Island GPU shows that using MASC (crossbar MASC) associative memory can improve the average floating point units energy efficiency by 33.4, 38.1, and 36.7 percent (37.7, 42.6, and 43.1 percent) for exact matching, selective 1-HD and 2-HD approximations respectively, providing an acceptable quality of service (PSNR > 30 dB and average relative error <10 percent). This shows that MASC (crossbar MASC) can achieve 1.77X (1.93X) higher energy savings as compared to the state of the art implementation of GPGPU that uses voltage overscaling on TCAM. © 2013 IEEE.","Approximate computing; associative memory; GPUs; non-volatile memory; ternary content addressable memory","Associative processing; Associative storage; Digital arithmetic; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Green computing; Hamming distance; Logic gates; Memory architecture; Program processors; Quality control; Quality of service; Approximate computing; Associative memory; GPUs; Non-volatile memory; Ternary content addressable memory; Ternary content adressable memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043267537

Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is an effective cryptographic primitive developed to thwart access-pattern-based attacks in DRAM-based systems. However, in emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) systems, the increased writes due to encryption of multiple data blocks on every Path ORAM (state-of-the-art efficient ORAM) access impose significant energy, lifetime, and performance overheads. LEO (Low overhead E ncryption ORAM) is an efficient Path ORAM encryption architecture that addresses the high write overheads of ORAM integration in NVMs, while providing security equivalent to the baseline Path ORAM. LEO reduces NVM cell writes by securely decreasing the number of block encryptions during the write phase of a Path ORAM access. LEO uses a secure, two-level counter mode encryption framework that opportunistically eliminates re-encryption of unmodified blocks, reducing NVM writes. Our evaluations show that on average, LEO decreases NVM energy by 60 percent, improves lifetime by 1.51 × , and increases performance by 9 percent over the baseline Path ORAM. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","memory security; non-volatile memory; Oblivious RAM","Computer architecture; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage; Memory architecture; Nonvolatile storage; Orbits; Random access storage; System-on-chip; Cryptographic primitives; Data confidentiality; Emerging non-volatile memory; Memory access patterns; Non-volatile memory; Number of blocks; Random access memory; State of the art; Cryptography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040935122

To develop an efficient prediction model, driving cycles are first grouped and distinguished as three different driving patterns. For each driving pattern, characteristic parameter data that could better featured driving cycles are extracted effectively and used to train NN. The predictive information combined with its error is subsequently used for power distribution. Then, to deal with different dynamics of battery and supercapacitor systems, a frequency splitter is used and its frequency is further optimized by a particle swarm optimization algorithm to minimize the total cost including battery degradation and system energy for each driving pattern. Based on these efforts, a real-time predictive power management control strategy is finally proposed. To verify its effectiveness, simulation has been conducted to compare with the state-of-the-art control strategy under a speed profile composing of five standard driving cycles.

The growing disparity between the CPU clock rate and off-chip memory access speed is known as the Memory Wall. This problem has been actively studied in the past two decades. It is addressed by placing memory closer to the processor, such as stacking the memory directly on top of a CMP, thereby significantly reducing the interconnect latency between them. However, previous 3D-stacked memory architectures use through-silicon via (TSV)-based three-dimensional (3-D) integration, which bonds multiple dies with TSVs that have diameters in the 1-5 $\mu \text{m}$ range. Unlike TSV-based 3-D integration, monolithic 3-D integration builds device tiers sequentially on a single substrate. Different tiers are connected using monolithic inter-tier vias (MIVs), which have a diameter (around 50 $\text{nm}$) that is the same as that of a local via. Main memory typically consists of DRAM, which is volatile and thus requires periodic refresh to maintain the stored data. This increases both the energy consumption and access latency. However, various nonvolatile RAMs (NVRAMs) have emerged as possible universal memory technologies, which promise low power, fast read access, high density, and nonvolatility. In this paper, we present an efficient memory interface for monolithic 3D-stacked RAM (both DRAM and NVRAMs such as resistive RAM and nanotube RAM). It takes advantage of the tremendous bandwidth made available by MIVs to implement an on-chip memory bus in order to hide the latency of large data transfers. We propose a multientry row-based write buffer to increase the buffer hit rate and reduce the number of memory core accesses. We decouple read and write accesses using extra interconnects available through MIVs to increase memory throughput. We also present an adaptive power-down policy to maintain balance between energy efficiency and performance. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture can achieve both high performance and energy efficiency, and is thus attractive for low-power/high-performance computing. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Chip multiprocessor (CMP); energy efficiency; Memory Wall; monolithic three-dimensional (3-D) integration; nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM); NRAM; on-chip memory; RRAM","Adaptive systems; Bandwidth; Data transfer; Dynamic random access storage; Electronics packaging; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Green computing; Integrated circuit interconnects; Integrated circuit manufacture; Integration; Memory architecture; Multiprocessing systems; RRAM; Storage allocation (computer); System-on-chip; Three dimensional displays; 3-D integration; Chip Multiprocessor; Memory management; Memory wall; Non-volatile memory; NRAM; NVRAM; On chip memory; Random access memory; Stacking; Three dimensional integrated circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029180892

The likely overheating and subsequent damage of surrounding tissue, however, severely limit its utilization in vivo. Herein, cooling-triggered shapeshifting is achieved by designing dual-network hydrogels that integrate a permanent network for elastic energy storage and a reversible network of hydrophobic crosslinks for “freezing” temporary shapes when heated. Upon cooling to 10 °C, the hydrophobic interactions weaken and allow recovery of the original shape, and thus programmable shape alterations. Further, multiple temporary shapes can be encoded independently at either different temperatures or different times during the isothermal network formation.

Booming data volume demands significant computational resources and creates challenges for 'Sequence Alignment', which is the most fundamental application in bioinformatics. Consequently, many researchers exploit both software and hardware methods to accelerate the most widely used sequence alignment algorithm-Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). However, prior work suffers from moving huge DNA databases from the storage to computational units. Such data movement is both time and energy consuming. Based on the observation that the bottlenecks of BLAST involve a large amount of comparison operations, we propose a 3D Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) based DNA Alignment Accelerator Architecture (RADAR) which performs most computational operations locally without moving DNA databases. To improve the storage density for various lengths of DNA sequences without damaging the performance, we propose a dense data mapping scheme to handle DNA sequences efficiently and a Tail Bits Duplication (TBD) technique to enable fully parallel computation for RADAR.

This evolution is caused by several drivers including: decarbonization, electrified transportation, deregulation, growing electricity demand, and active consumer participation. Many of these changes will occur at the periphery of the grid, in the radial distribution system, and its potentially billions of demand-side resources. Such spatially distributed energy resources naturally require equally distributed control and electricity market design approaches to enable an increasingly active 'smart grid.' In that regard, this paper serves to highlight lessons recently learned from the literature and point to seven open long-term challenges facing the future design of electricity markets. They are: 1) simultaneously manage the technical and economic performance of the electricity grid; 2) span multiple operations time scales; 3) enable active demand side resources; 4) activate the power grid periphery; 5) promote synergies with interdependent infrastructures; 6) respect organizational jurisdictions; and 7) promote resilient self-healing operation.

The continuous demand of wind energy production led the interest of the wind industry towards bigger turbines. This upscaling trend has imposed bigger (not quasi-static) loads that are significantly influencing the fatigue life of the wind turbine components and the tonalities generated by the drive train. To tackle noise and vibration problems and validate complex models it is of high interest to continuously track the modal parameters of the machines under different operating conditions. This allows a better design of the new prototypes and the reduction of the risk of premature component failures, followed by a possible decrease of the cost of the energy. To do so Operational Modal Analysis represents a powerful tool. One limitation affecting this methodology when applied to rotating machines comes from the presence of harmonics. Their predominance in the spectrum masks the modal content in the signal, making the extraction of the modal parameters impossible. The objective of this research is then to achieve a combination of automatic methodologies for dealing with the harmonics and automatic OMA techniques in order to be able to autonomously process a continuous stream of data. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Digital storage; Rotating machinery; Torque; Wind power; Wind turbines; Component failures; Continuous demand; Different operating conditions; Noise and vibration; Operational modal analysis; Renewable energies; Rotating machine; Wind energy production; Modal analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049652037

Interactive dynamics between load and distributed generators in a distribution network carry significant impact on voltage variation and transient during load power disturbances. It is shown in this paper that the traditional static power flow analysis, in which load dynamic behavior is not counted, is not sufficient to model and predict voltage excursion after a power disturbance. To capture the behavior of load types and dynamics, this paper employs Hammerstein model structures to represent such behavior and explore their real-time identification. This is especially important for voltage quality management since the load dynamics depend on active and reactive load power, and hence change substantially due to load/generator power perturbations, electric vehicle charging activities, and subsystem load type varieties. Identification algorithms are introduced and their convergence properties are established. The algorithms are applied to a generic grid structure first, then evaluated on a 33-Bus system with multiple dynamic loads. © 2013 IEEE.","distributed generators; Hammerstein models; load dynamics; system identification; Voltage management","Data storage equipment; Distributed power generation; Dynamic loads; Electric automobiles; Electric load flow; Electric load management; Electric machine control; Electric potential; Gas generators; Heuristic algorithms; Identification (control systems); Interactive computer systems; Model structures; Quality management; Real time systems; Religious buildings; Voltage control; Distributed generators; Hammerstein model; Load dynamics; Load modeling; Micro grid; Power system dynamics; Vehicle dynamics; Voltage management; Electric power system control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048894660

The insufficient supply of forage especially high-quality feed blocks the further promotion of animal husbandry. In China, the area of grassland accounts for 42% of the total land area, which is critical for animal husbandry. However, a gap exists between grass and livestock. Grass products such as silage and hay, are the bridge connecting grass cultivation and animal husbandry. Besides, processing technology of grass products is able to solve the question that the excess utilization of the winter-spring pasture and the imbalance of forage grass with the livestock. Therefore, we proposed that grass products processing is the key factor of promoting the development of farming and animal husbandry, it can adjust the balance of grass supply of all years, and guarantee the modern development of animal husbandry. Although great improvement has already been obtained in the processing technology of grass products, the level still is quite low compared with developed countries. Firstly, there is a lack of systematic research related to processing technology, which directly causes the low quality of grass products and weak market competition. Secondly, the machinery equipment associated with forage harvesting and processing in our country are heavily dependent on imports, its high price limits the mechanized production of grass. The physical and chemical characteristics of grass can be improved through processing modulation of grasses, contributing to the efficiency of their storage, transportation and feeding. Of the many kinds of grass products, we highlighted the importance of silage and its additives. Additives are natural or industrial products added in rather large quantities to the forage or grain mass. Additives control or prevent certain types of fermentation, thus reducing losses and improving silage stability. In order to assist in the fermentation process, various silage additives have been used to improve the nutrient and energy recovery in silage, often with subsequent improvements in animal performance. The purpose for applying additives to the silage is to ensure that the growth of lactic bacteria predominates during the fermentation process, producing lactic acid in quantities high enough to ensure good silage. Therefore, this review is made to focus on some practical aspects of the fermentation process and the uses of some common silage additives that include microbial inoculants, enzymes, and propionic acid. Overall, we summarized the current research achievements and existing issues in the processing of grass products at home and abroad regarding concepts, significances, current situations, main theories and technologies in this review. By analyzing problems, we propose the concept of grass processing especially the silage processing technique, and provide a theoretical guidance for upgrading grass products in China, which we consider an important guidance significant for forage production with high quality in the future. © 2018, Science Press.

The purpose of this research is to determine the technical, systematic and financial requirements needed to allow a city or community to become independent of the utilization of traditional energy and develop a reliable program for a clean and environment-friendly energy supply.

This method uses the actual data to analyze and compare the main, optimized and desired scenarios of HES designs. The results show that optimized design can minimize the cost of the energy generated while reliably matching local electricity demand.

While the efforts of developing SIBs have benefited from the knowledge learned in LIBs, thanks to the apparent proximity between Na-ions and Li-ions, the unique physical and chemical properties of Na-ions also distinctly differ themselves from Li-ions. It is expected that SIBs have drastically different electrode material structure, solvation–desolvation behavior, electrode–electrolyte interphase stabilities, ion transfer properties, and hence electrochemical performance of batteries. In this review, the authors comprehensively summarize the current understanding of the anode solid electrolyte interphase and cathode electrolyte interphase in SIBs, with an emphasis on how the tuning of the stability and ion transfer properties of interphases fundamentally determines the reversibility and efficiency of electrochemical reactions. Through these carefully screened references, the authors intend to reveal the intrinsic correlation between the properties/functionalities of the interphases and the electrochemical performance of batteries. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Herein, ceria oxygen storage material was introduced into a sulfur-resistant titania by a co-precipitation method, and the sulfur resistibility and catalytic activity of prepared TiO2-CeO2 composite in the oxidation of diesel soluble organic fraction (SOF) were studied. Catalytic performance testing results show that the CeO2 modification significantly improves the catalytic SOF purification efficiency of TiO2-CeO2 catalyst. SO2 uptake and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) results suggest that the ceria doping does not debase the excellent sulfur resistibility of bare TiO2, the prepared TiO2-CeO2 catalyst exhibits obviously better sulfur resistibility than the CeO2 and commercial CeO2-ZrO2-Al2O3. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra indicate that cerium ions can enter into the TiO2 lattice and not form complete CeO2 crystals. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) testing results imply that the addition of CeO2 in TiO2-CeO2 catalyst can significantly enhance the surface oxygen concentration and oxygen storage capacity of TiO2-CeO2. © 2018 by the authors.

Solar drying is the most useful method of keeping food staff safe in terms of both energy and time. Our work aims to contribute to the optimization of solar convective drying at the pulp of carob widely produced in Morocco by an experimental approach in an indirect forced convection solar dryer. In this paper, the effect of air temperature on the drying kinetics of carob pulp was investigated in convective solar drying. The relative humidity of air was varied from 15% to 45.5%. This kinetic measurement is carried out at four temperature values of drying air (50, 60, 70 and 80 °C) and also for one value of drying air flow rate Dv (0.0833 ± 0.002 m3 s-1). Four models have been used to adjust experimental curves. In conclusion, the experimental study shows that solar drying is adapted for the valorisation of carob pulp.

Exploring efficient non-precious-metal electrocatalysts is necessary for the widespread application of this energy storage model. Two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin solids with a special atomic and electronic structure are full of unlimited potential in the pursuit of high-efficiency electrocatalysts and have been identified as a perfect platform for establishing clear structure-property relationships. Hence, in this review, we first clear up the fundamental relationship between intrinsic charge and spin ordering and electrocatalytic properties. Then, on this basis, we summarize recent attempts to regulate electrical behavior and spin ordering in 2D ultrathin solids to optimize electrocatalytic water-splitting performance. In addition, we highlight the coupling relationship among lattice, charge, and spin ordering in ultrathin electrocatalysts. Finally, we also present some personal perspectives on the challenges and future research directions in this promising area. Electrocatalytic water splitting represents a conceptually simple method of efficiently realizing electrical energy storage and conversion. The development of low-cost electrocatalysts to replace Pt and/or Ru catalysts is widely recognized as being necessary for widespread application of this energy storage model. 2D ultrathin solids with a special arrangement of atoms and confined electronic structure have gained significant interest and possess unrivaled structure superiority in electrocatalytic water-splitting applications.

We also discuss some personal perspectives on where the field is headed.

This poses a serious problem for the grid, as most distribution transformers were installed during the pre-EV era, and thus were not sized to handle large loads from EVs. In parallel, smart grid technologies have emerged that actively regulate demand to prevent overloading the grid’s infrastructure, in particular by optimizing the use of grid-scale energy storage.

Leakage-resilient cryptography has led to better implementation of many cryptographic primitives that can be proven secure against attackers who can obtain limited sensitive information about private keys, randomness, and other internal states, and therefore prevents from breaking the security. In this paper, to tolerate the sensitive information leakage in mIoT, we first present a leakage-resilient public-key encryption mechanism that is semantically secure against adaptively chosen-ciphertext attacks in the presence of key leakage under standard decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. Our construction employs a special universal hashing in multiplicative group to provide an efficient strong extractor, and a key derivation function to derive one or more symmetric keys from a single value. Also, the plaintext space of the scheme is extended to the full domain field of group so as to provide a larger space for the message. We emphasis that our scheme can be deployed in mIoT since the limited power and energy budgets, the communication and computation cost, and the leakage attack are taken into account. Using the first scheme as a building block, we also give a protocol construction to achieve the security resilient to randomness leakage and key leakage. Our schemes feature with a shorter key size and a larger plaintext space. Concretely, the private-key contains only four elements in the finite field, and the allowable key-leakage rate is 25%, which provides a higher leakage rate than Naor Segev (leakage rate is 16.7%) and its variants.

In this paper, a HEMS expressed as a bi-level model is provided to investigated capacity allocation strategy of the photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage system (BESS) in a smart household considering: 1) the impact of electricity price mechanisms which include the time-of-use pricing (TOU), the real-time pricing (RTP), and the stepwise power tariff (SPT); 2) the effect of subsidies of PV; and 3) the uncertainty in the PV output and seasonal load profiles. Then, the hybrid approach which combines the cataclysmic genetic algorithm and the DICOPT solver in GAMS is employed to find an optimal solution. Finally, six cases with different price mechanisms and approaches, as well as the sensitivity analysis of optimal solution to subsidies are presented. Results indicate that, with the subsidies, only the PV system needs to be equipped in a household under the SPT, while the PV system and BESS need to be equipped together under the RTP and TOU.

Among them, water stable pillared MOFs with dual ligands have been reported to exhibit high supercapacitor (SC) performance. Herein, the “One-for-All” strategy is applied to synthesize both positive and negative electrodes of a hybrid SC (HSC) from a single pillared MOF. Specifically, Ni-DMOF-TM ([Ni(TMBDC)(DABCO)0.5], TMBDC: 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, DABCO: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]-octane) nanorods are directly grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) (denoted as CFP@TM-nanorods) with the help of triethylamine and function as the positive electrode of HSC under alkaline electrolyte. Meanwhile, calcinated N-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanorods (CFP@TM-NPCs) are produced and utilized as the negative counter-electrode from a one-step heat treatment of CFP@TM-nanorods. After assembling these two electrodes together to make a hybrid device, the TM-nanorods//TM-NPCs exhibit a wide voltage window of 1.5 V with a high sloping discharge plateau between 1-1.2 V, indicating its great potential for practical applications. This as-described “One-for-All” strategy is widely applicable and highly reproducible in producing MOF-based electrode materials for HSC applications, which shortens the gap between experimental synthesis and practical application of MOFs in fast energy storage. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Lithium ion hybrid capacitors are constructed with battery-type anodes and capacitor-type cathodes, which enables the direct integration of the high energy from lithium ion batteries and high power and long lifetime from supercapacitors, making lithium ion hybrid capacitor one of the most promising energy storage devices. In the past two decades, tremendous efforts have been put into the search for suitable battery-type anode materials with improved Faradaic reaction kinetics so that it can match with the fast non-Faradaic charging rate of the capacitive cathodes. This review aims to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive summary of the battery-type anode materials for high-performance lithium ion hybrid capacitors. To date, a large variety of battery-type anode materials have been explored with smart material design strategies, such as carbonaceous materials, metal oxides, alloys, sulfides, nitirdes, and Mxenes, etc., which will be discussed in detail.

Herein, graphene oxide was reduced by a one-pot hydrothermal process in the presence of an electrochemically active phosphotungstic acid to produce three-dimensional porous phosphotungstic acid/reduced graphene oxide composites. Phosphotungstic acid molecules were found to be uniformly anchored on the surface of reduced graphene oxide sheets through the electrostatic interaction to prevent the reduced graphene oxide sheets from restacking. Meanwhile, phosphotungstic acid has the capability of undergoing fast reversible multi-electron redox reactions and hence providing the pseudocapacitance. As expected, phosphotungstic acid/reduced graphene oxide composites display the specific capacitance as high as 456.7 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and 363.8 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, which are much larger than those obtained in reduced graphene oxide (162.4 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and 190.6 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1). The retention also maintains 82.9% of initial specific capacitance after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. Such excellent electrochemical performance comes from the three-dimensional porous architecture and synergistic interaction between the pseudocapacitive phosphotungstic acid and electric double-layer capacitive graphene. © 2018 Zhengzhou University","electrodes; energy materials; nanocomposites; supercapacitors","Capacitance; Energy storage; Redox reactions; Reduced Graphene Oxide; Supercapacitor; Charge/discharge cycle; Electric double layer; Electrochemical performance; Hydrothermal process; Multi-electron redoxes; Porous architectures; Specific capacitance; Synergistic interaction; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055187736

Insufficient adipose lipid storage is associated with many pathological conditions including hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we observed the overexpression of SUMO-specific protease 2 (Senp2) in adipose tissues during obesity. Adipocyte Senp2 deficiency resulted in less adipose lipid storage accompanied by an ectopic fat accumulation and insulin resistance under high-fat diet feeding. We further found that SET domain bifurcated 1 (Setdb1) was a SUMOylated protein and that SUMOylation promoted Setdb1 occupancy on the promoter locus of Pparg and Cebpa genes to suppress their expressions by H3K9me3. Senp2 could suppress Setdb1 function by de-SUMOylation. In adipocyte Senp2-deficiency mice, accumulation of the SUMOylated Setdb1 suppressed the expression of Pparg and Cebpa genes as well as lipid metabolism-related target genes, which would decrease the ability of lipid storage in adipocytes. These results revealed the crucial role of Senp2-Setdb1 axis in controlling adipose lipid storage. © 2018 The Author(s).","H3K9me3; Lipid storage; Pparg and Cebpa; Senp2; Setdb1","CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; histone 3 lysine 9; histone H3; membrane protein; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; SET domain bifurcated 1; SUMO 2 protein; SUMO specific protease 2; unclassified drug; CCAAT enhancer binding protein; CEBPA protein, mouse; cysteine proteinase; histone lysine methyltransferase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; Senp2 protein, mouse; SETDB1 protein, mouse; adipocyte; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; Cebpa gene; controlled study; desumoylation; enzyme regulation; gene locus; gene overexpression; gene targeting; glucose tolerance test; histone modification; insulin resistance; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; Pparg gene; promoter region; protein deficiency; protein domain; protein expression; protein function; sumoylation; 3T3-L1 cell line; adverse event; animal; gene deletion; genetics; lipid metabolism; metabolism; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipose Tissue; Animals; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Diet, High-Fat; Gene Deletion; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Mice; PPAR gamma; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Sumoylation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051015301

This paper explores the potential of parallel springs in robot limb design. We start by adding what we call the exhaustive parallel compliance matrix (EPCM) to the design. The EPCM is a set of parallel springs, which includes a parallel spring for each joint and a multijoint parallel spring for all possible combinations of the robot's joints. Then, we carefully formulate and compare two performance metrics, which improve various aspects of the system performance. Each performance metric is analyzed and compared, their strengths and weaknesses being rigorously presented. The performance benefits associated with this approach are dramatic. Implementing the spring matrix reduces the sum of square power (SSP) exerted by the actuators by up to 47%, the peak power requirement by almost 40%, the sum of squared current by 55%, and the peak current by 55%. These results were generated using a planar robot limb and a gait trajectory borrowed from biology. We use a fully dynamic model of the robotic system including inertial effects. We also test the design robustness using a perturbation study, which shows that the parallel springs are effective even in the presence of trajectory perturbation. © 2018 by ASME.",,"Energy efficiency; Joints (anatomy); Robotics; Robots; Stiffness matrix; Compliance matrixes; Design robustness; Energy-efficient design; Generation technologies; Parallel springs; Performance benefits; Performance metrices; Performance metrics; Machine design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050889279

When the doubly fed wind power generation unit does not reserve spare capacity to participate in the system frequency regulation, the system frequency will produce two drops in different degrees when the wind power exits frequency modulation and enters the speed recovery stage. To solve this problem, based on the complementary advantages of wind turbines and energy storage systems in power transmission and frequency modulation, a wind storage combined frequency modulation strategy based on sectional control is proposed in this paper. Based on the TOP wind power frequency modulation strategy, the wind power output reference value is determined according to the linear relationship between the output and the speed of the wind turbine, and the auxiliary wind power load reduction is controlled when the wind power exits frequency modulation into the speed recovery stage, so that the wind turbine is recovered to run at the optimal speed. Then, according to the system frequency and the wind turbine operation state, set the energy storage system frequency modulation output. Energy storage output active support is triggered during wind speed recovery. And then when the system frequency to return to the normal operating frequency range, reduce energy storage output or to exit frequency modulation. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Drops; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Recovery; Speed; Storage (materials); System stability; Wind effects; Wind power; Wind turbines; Coordinated control strategy; Doubly-fed wind power generations; Energy storage systems; Large-scale wind power; Linear relationships; Modulation strategy; Operating frequency; Power fluctuations; Frequency modulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050717238

Accurate imaging of the internal structure of volcanic systems is critical to better understand magma storage processes and to quantify mass and energy transport mechanisms in the crust. To improve the three-dimensional velocity structure of Axial Seamount, we combined 469,891 new traveltime arrivals, from 12 downward extrapolated seismic profiles, with 3,962 existing ocean-bottom-seismometers traveltime arrivals, into a joint tomographic inversion. Our approach reveals two elongated magma reservoirs, with melt fraction up to 65%, representing an unusually large volume of melt (26–60 km3), which is likely the result of enhanced magma supply from the juxtaposition of the Cobb hot spot plume (0.26–0.53 m3/s) and the Axial spreading segment (0.79–1.06 m3/s). The tomographic model also resolves a subsided caldera floor that provides an effective trap for ponding lava flows, via a “trapdoor” mechanism. Our model also shows that Axial's extrusive section is thinnest beneath the elevated volcano, where anomalously thick (11 km) oceanic crust is present. We therefore suggest that focused and enhanced melt supply predominantly thickens the crust beneath Axial Seamount through diking accretion and gabbro crystallization. Lastly, we demonstrate that our three-dimensional velocity model provides a more realistic starting point for relocating the local seismicity, better resolving a network of conjugate outward and inward dipping faults beneath the caldera walls.©2018.

Then the wind turbine and the lithium battery Energy Storage System (ESS) provide primary frequency reserves together. Different control strategies of ESS have been proposed based on the different methods for selecting valid reserves.

In general, an electric vehicle propulsion system consists of an electric energy supply system and a traction system; interconnected to each other through a high voltage DC-link. This paper is concerned with the traction system; which constitutes a Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motor, its voltage source inverter and drive system, in order to tackle this obstacle. It deals with the four quadrants of the speed-torque profile of the motor, with special emphasis on regenerative braking. © 2017 IIETA.","And regenerative braking; BLDC motor; Drive system; Electric vehicle; Four quadrant operation; Rechargeable energy storage system",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049509254

The effects of vacancies on crystal GST were investigated by ab initio calculations. Based on analysis of the vacancy formation energy, the GST structure with Ge vacancy (VGe) was found to be the most stable. Thereafter, the influence of VGe defects on crystal GST structure was deliberated by analyzing the band structure, electron density difference, total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) of GST structure. The results reveal that VGe can promote the Fermi level enter into the valence band, which makes the GST material exhibit more pronounced properties of P-type semiconductors. Nevertheless, VGe shows a slight effect on the chemical bond characters. When VGe concentration maintained at 20% in the GST structure, the band gap is the widest about 0.45eV. Moreover, VGe can result in the electrons in s orbital of Ge, Sb and p, d orbitals of Te make a contribution to the valence band, while electrons in p and d orbitals of Ge, Sb are more favorable to conduction band. © 2018 Author(s).",,"Antimony; Calculations; Crystal structure; Digital storage; Energy gap; Germanium; Phase change materials; Tellurium compounds; Valence bands; Ab initio calculations; First-principles study; P type semiconductor; Partial density of state; Recording information; Reversible phase transition; Total density of state; Vacancy formation energies; Antimony compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049247797

Greater energy consumption due to growing cities is a concern for scholars as well as governments all over the world. In the European Union, Denmark's renewable energy policy provides tax exemptions for passive air conditioning and renewable energy sources to foster public participation. To meet its energy provision objectives under this condition, cities need instruments to reduce energy consumption. The building of a community centre in Nordhavn (Denmark) was chosen as such an instrument due to its flexibility and possible exposure to solar radiation as an endless source of energy. An experimental design for the building envelope was developed to test its thermal performance when including a thermal storage wall. Design research was conducted using 3D modelling. Testing was done on a simulation of the building made with the Ecotect software application to provide comparable results for thermal performance supported by qualitative-descriptive methods. It was concluded that including a thermal storage wall in the building model corresponds well with the objectives of the design. Based on the result of the test, in the context of, the thermal storage wall is capable of contributing to passive air conditioning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air conditioning; Application programs; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Smart city; Software testing; Taxation; Walls (structural partitions); Building envelopes; Public participation; Reduce energy consumption; Renewable energy policy; Renewable energy source; Software applications; Thermal Performance; Thermal storage wall; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048418823

However, some manufacturers store blue cheese at 4°C and the effect of lower storage temperature on blue cheese final properties is unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of storage temperature and time on blue cheese mechanical behaviors. Blue cheeses were stored at 4 or 10°C for 77 days after production. Composition and small- and large-strain rheological behaviors were evaluated every 2 weeks of storage. Storage time had significant impact on blue cheese rheological behaviors; storage temperature did not. Large-strain compressive force and viscoelastic moduli decreased with storage time, and the extent of nonlinear viscoelastic behavior increased. These results indicated that sample microstructure likely weakened and was more easily deformed as storage time increased. Overall, blue cheese can be stored at 4–10°C without significant changes to its composition or mechanical behavior. Practical applications: The results of this work can be used by blue cheese manufacturers to better understand the impact of storage time and temperature on blue cheese end quality. Manufacturers can take advantage of the effects of storage time on blue cheese mechanical behaviors to determine how long to age blue cheese to achieve the desired texture. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","blue cheese; compression; LAOS; storage; viscoelastic behaviors","Compaction; Energy storage; Rheology; Viscoelasticity; Compressive forces; LAOS; Mechanical behavior; Nonlinear viscoelastic behaviors; Rheological behaviors; Storage temperatures; Visco-elastic behaviors; Viscoelastic moduli; Manufacture; cheese; cold; flow kinetics; food handling; food storage; human; viscosity; Cheese; Cold Temperature; Food Storage; Food Technology; Humans; Rheology; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048361151

Recently, some low-cost and resourceful two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and layered oxides, have attracted increasing attention in electrocatalysis applications in virtue of their comparable catalytic activity and long-term stability to conventional noble metal-based catalysts (e.g. Pt/C, RuO2, IrO2, etc.). However, the intrinsic activity of some 2D materials still cannot meet the increasing requirement for highly efficient and reliable eletrocatalysts for future energy conversion and storage systems. In this context, designing elctrocatalysts with sufficient amount of active sites accessible for electrolyte, high activity of each active sites, and excellent conductivity is of great significance. To this end, defect engineering is a powerful strategy for tailoring the physical and chemical properties of 2D materials for efficient electrocatalysis. In this article, an overview of recent progress on defect engineering in 2D eletrocatalysts for HER, ORR and OER is presented. The effects of defects on the structure and tuned properties of 2D materials in eletrocatalysts applications are also summarized.

Well crystalline particles with different morphologies and crystallite size in the range of 2 nm–10 nm were obtained by using Urea and Soduim Borohydride as reducing agents, and deploying Dioctyl Sulfosuccinate Sodium Salt (AOT) and Cetyl Trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as the surfactants. Samples have been characterised by X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, specific surface area, porosity, and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. Preliminary studies on the potential electrochemical properties of the as-produced nanoparticles were investigated using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiostatic charge-discharge in aqueous KOH electrolyte. The surfactant and reducing agents used in the synthesis procedure of SnO2 nanoparticles influenced the particle size and the morphology, which in turn influenced the capacitance of the SnO2 nanoparticles. The SnO2 electrode material showed pseudocapacitor properties with a maximum capacitance value of 1.6 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1, an efficiency of 52% at a current of 1 mA and a maximum capacitance retention of about 40% after 10 cycles at a current of 1 mA.

The information presented in this study suggests that cis-bifenthrin (cis-BF) could activate pregnane X receptor (PXR) mediated pathway and lead to the lipid accumulation of human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. Cells were incubated in the control or different concentrations of cis-BF for 24 h. The 1 × 10−7 M and 1 × 10−6 M cis-BF exposure were found to induce cellular triglyceride (TG) accumulation significantly. This phenomenon was further supported by Oil Red O Staining assay. The cis-BF exposure caused upregulation of PXR gene and protein. Correspondingly, we also observed the increased expression of downstream genes involved in lipid formation and the inhibition of the expression of β-oxidation. As chiral pesticide，cis-BF was further conformed to behave enantioselectivity in the lipid metabolism. Rather than 1R-cis-BF, HepG2 cells incubated with 1S-cis-BF exhibited a significant TG accumulation. 1S-cis-BF also showed a higher binding level, of which the KD value was 9.184 × 10−8 M in the SPR assay, compared with 1R-cis-BF (3.463 × 10−6 M).

From this dynamic model, nonlinear Hamiltonian surface shaping and power flow control method is applied and shown to stabilize. From this approach the energy flow in the system is used to show the energy storage device requirements and limitations for the system.

Non-volatile memories (NVMs) have drawn significant attention as potential DRAM replacements because they represent information using resistance rather than electrical charge. Spin-torque transfer magnetoresistive RAM (STT-MRAM) is one of the most promising NVM technologies due to its relatively low write energy, high speed, and high endurance. However, STT-MRAM suffers from its own scaling problems. As the size of the storage element decreases with technology scaling, STT-MRAM retention error rates are expected to increase, which will require multi-bit error-correcting code (ECC) and periodic scrubbing. We introduce the Sanitizer architecture, which mitigates the performance and energy overheads of ECC and scrubbing in future STT-MRAM based main memories. To reduce the scrubbing rate, a coarse-grained, multi-bit ECC mechanism with a 12.5 percent storage overhead is used. To avoid fetching multiple blocks from memory and performing costly ECC checks on every read, the memory regions that will likely be accessed in the near future are predicted and proactively scrubbed. Compared to a conventional STT-MRAM system, Sanitizer improves performance by 1.22 × and reduces end-to-end system energy by 22 percent. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","hierarchical ECC; main memory; retention errors; STT-MRAM","Capacitance; Computer architecture; Data storage equipment; Dynamic random access storage; Electric resistance; Error correction; Errors; Leakage currents; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Memory architecture; Microprocessor chips; MRAM devices; Random errors; Error correction codes; Hierarchical ECC; Magnetic tunneling; Main memory; Non-volatile memory; Random access memory; STT-MRAM; Random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037628242

Burst error correcting Hamming codes have most commonly been used to correct MBUs in SRAM cell since they have low redundancy and low decoder latency. But with technology scaling, the number of bits being affected increases, thus requiring a need for increasing the burst size that can be corrected. However, this is a problem because it increases the number of syndromes exponentially thus increasing the decoder complexity exponentially as well. In this paper, a new burst error correcting code based on Hamming codes is proposed which allows much better scaling of decoder complexity as the burst size is increased. For larger burst sizes, it can provide significantly smaller and faster decoders than existing methods thus providing higher reliability at an affordable cost. Moreover, there is frequently no increase in the number of check bits or a very minimal increase in comparison with existing methods. A general construction and decoding methodology for the new codes is proposed. Experimental results are presented comparing the decoder complexity for the proposed codes with conventional burst error correcting Hamming codes demonstrating the significant improvements that can be achieved. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Burst error correction; Hamming codes; Low complexity decoder; Multiple bit upsets; SRAM","Block codes; Decoding; Error correction; Radiation hardening; Random errors; VLSI circuits; Burst error correcting codes; Burst error corrections; Decoder complexity; Hamming code; High energy radiation; Low complexity decoder; Multiple bit upset; Static random access memory; Static random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049488452

In this article, three-dimensional nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials (NDPC-X, in which X represents the pyrolysis temperature) were fabricated by simultaneous carbonization and activation of polypyrrole-coated paper towel protected by a silica layer followed by acid etching. The material had a high specific surface area (1,123.40 m2/g). The as-obtained NDPC-900 displayed outstanding activity as a catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as well as an electrode with a high specific capacitance in a supercapacitor in an alkaline medium. The NDPC-900 catalyst for the ORR exhibited a more positive reduction peak potential of −0.068 V (vs. Hg|HgCl2) than that of Pt/C (−0.121 V), as well as better cycling stability and stronger methanol tolerance. Moreover, the NDPC-900 had a high specific capacitance of 379.50 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, with a retention rate of 94.5% after 10,000 cycles in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte when used as an electrode in a supercapacitor. All these results were attributed to the effect of a large surface area, which provided electrochemically active sites.

To address these issues, the power exchange unit (PEU) and energy storage unit (ESU) are added into hybrid single/three-phase microgrid, and a power coordinated control method with frequency support capability is proposed for hybrid single/three-phase microgrid in this study. PEU is connected with three single-phase microgrids to coordinate power exchange among three phases and provide frequency support for hybrid microgrid. Meanwhile, a power coordinated control method based on the droop control is proposed for PEU to alleviate three-phase power imbalance and reduce voltage fluctuation of hybrid microgrid. Besides, ESU is injected into the DC-link to buffer the system power fluctuation when DGs or loads suddenly change. The hierarchical control method is proposed for ESU to stabilise the DC-link voltage and reasonably allocate the net exchanged power of PEU. Considering the collaboration between PEU and ESU, the state of charge of ESU is proposed to adjust the power transmission coefficient of PEU.

It also enables bunch of shared computing-storage resources to end users at anytime and anywhere. Due to the complexity and openness of the Internet, assorted challenges are there. Hence, security and privacy are the dominant concerns. Therefore, a strong privacy protection authentication protocol is desired. Very recently, Cheng et al. proposed a cloud-based authentication protocol and claimed that their protocol was against mentioned weaknesses in their paper. However, the analysis shows that Cheng et al.'s protocol is insecure against message confidentiality and patient's anonymity. Then, a novel energy-efficient and traceable authentication protocol (ETAP) is proposed. The ETAP not only mitigates the weaknesses, but has other advantages. First, the ETAP realizes authentication with extremely low computational cost between stakeholders. Second, the ETAP can enable patients to enjoy the remote services with privacy protection. Finally, the ETAP is proven to be safe against passive and active attacks under the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem assumption in random oracle model. Hence, these features make the ETAP very suitable for computation-limited mobile devices (such as smartphone and PAD) compared with other related existing protocols. © 2013 IEEE.","authentication; energy-efficient; Medical cloud computing; privacy protecting; provably-secure","Authentication; Cloud computing; Data privacy; Medical computing; mHealth; Mobile security; Network architecture; Network protocols; Patient treatment; Servers; Authentication protocols; Elliptic curve discrete logarithm problems; Energy efficient; Medical services; Passive and active attacks; Privacy protecting; Provably secure; Security and privacy; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047648301

To overcome this challenge, it is necessary to develop new electrically conductive materials that exhibit superflexibility and can be folded or crumpled without plastic deformation or damage. Herein, a graphene film with engineered microvoids is prepared by reduction (under confinement) of its precursor graphene oxide film. The resultant porous graphene film can be single folded, double folded, and even crumpled, but springs back to its original shape without yielding or plastic deformation akin to an elastomeric scaffold after the applied stress is removed. Even after thermal annealing at ≈1300 °C, the folding performance of the porous graphene film is not compromised and the thermally annealed film exhibits complete foldability even in liquid nitrogen.

By employing the unique crossbar structure, ReRAM can be constructed with extremely high density. However, the crossbar ReRAM faces some serious challenges in terms of performance, reliability, and energy consumption. First, ReRAM's crossbar structure causes an IR drop problem due to wire resistance and sneak currents, which results in nonuniform access latency in ReRAM banks and reduces its reliability. Second, without access transistors in the crossbar structure, write disturbance results in serious data reliability problem. Third, the access latency, reliability, and energy use of ReRAM arrays are significantly influenced by the data patterns involved in a write operation. To overcome the challenges of the crossbar ReRAM, we propose a novel circuit architecture co-optimization framework for improving the performance, reliability, and energy use of ReRAM-based main memory system, called CACF. The proposed CACF consists of three levels, including the circuit level, circuit architecture level, and architecture level. At the circuit level, to reduce the IR drops along bitlines, we propose a double-sided write driver design by applying write drivers along both sides of bitlines and selectively activating the write drivers. At the circuit architecture level, to address the write disturbance with low overheads, we propose a RESET disturbance detection scheme by adding disturbance reference cells and conditionally performing refresh operations. At the architecture level, a region partition with address remapping method is proposed to leverage the nonuniform access latency in ReRAM banks, and two flip schemes are proposed in different regions to optimize the data patterns involved in a write operation.

However, practical application of Li-S batteries is hindered by the nonconductive nature of sulfur (S) and continuous capacity fading during cycling. Here, a simple but effective strategy is proposed to fabricate high-performance Li-S batteries by in situ polymerization of polyaniline (PANi)/S/carbon nanofiber (CNF) cathode. Compared to traditional carbon black/S cathodes and other cathode materials with PANi polymer, this effective three-dimensional (3D) cathode design has several advantages: (i) the interconnected and highly conductive CNF/PANi network structure facilitates the electron transfer between the insulating S and conductive CNF mat; (ii) the CNF/PANi network structure, with abundant oxygen and nitrogen heteroatoms, offers strong adsorption for the polysulfides; (iii) the 3D architecture of CNF/S/PANi helps accommodate the volume change of S during cycling and maintain the structural integrity of the cathode; (iv) the easy and simple fabrication process minimizes the time and energy costs; and (v) the freestanding composite cathode without additional polymer binder contributes to higher energy density of Li-S batteries. With all the advantages mentioned above, Li-S cells present a high S utilization with stable cycling performance for over 300 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.08% cycle−1. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Therefore, a novel virtual inertia control strategy is proposed in this paper. Combining with the potential inertia advantages of virtual synchronous generator (VSG) technology, the poor compatibility between the virtual inertia principle and the energy storage control algorithm is analyzed in detail. In order to improve the control precision, this paper focuses on the analysis of frequency response characteristics of alternating current (ac) side and then regulates the ac frequency more directly and accurately by the virtual inertia generated from the energy storage device and the grid-connected inverter. Thus, additional droop characteristic, particular control algorithm of energy storage device, and power given module are designed, respectively, to make the system provide virtual inertia power support actively under multi disturbance operation. The novel virtual inertia control strategy can effectively deal with all kinds of wind speed and ac load mutation and restrain the frequency variation on ac side. Finally, the correctness and feasibility of the proposed scheme are verified by the simulation results. © 2013 IEEE.","energy storage device; frequency stability; microgrid; virtual inertia; Virtual synchronous generator","Electric frequency control; Electric generators; Electric impedance measurement; Electric inverters; Energy storage; Frequency response; Frequency stability; Gas generators; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Rotors; Wind; Alternating current; Droop characteristics; Frequency response characteristic; Frequency variation; Grid connected inverters; Micro grid; Micro-grid systems; virtual inertia; Synchronous generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047611347

This algorithm enables lower cost operation of the SSG by utilizing the time of use electricity-pricing concept and thus is called the Fuzzy Low-cost Operation (FLO) algorithm. After applying the FLO algorithm to the SSG, the BSPM can strategically handle fluctuating PV production by intelligently alternating between absorbing power during high solar irradiation periods and discharging power to the load during peak consumption times. The FLO algorithm also empowers the SSG's DSPM to decrease the peak load by using SERT's building energy management system to disconnect noncritical load as desired, for example lighting, air conditioners, and dummy heater load (used for research testing purposes). Research results show that the FLO algorithm successfully decreased SERT's annual electricity bill by 17.58%, equivalent to a grand total of $9148 in annual savings. Of 17.58% in savings, 5.78% came from modifications to the BSPM and 11.81% came from modifications to the DSPM.

Regarding the population growth, the modern lifestyle requiring more comfort and the increase of the use rate of electronic devices, the energy consumption will continue to increase in the future. In this context, the introduction of renewable energy systems, along with energy efficiency, is becoming a key factor in reducing the energy bill of buildings. This study focuses on the design and dynamic simulation of an air heating system for the mean categories of the tertiary sector where the area exceeds 750 m3. Heating system has been designed via a dynamic simulation environment (TRNSYS) to estimate the produced temperature and airflow rate by one system consisting of three essential components: vacuum tube solar collector, storage tank and water-to-air finned heat exchanger. The performances estimation of this system allows us to evaluate its capacity to meet the heating requirements in Ifrane city based on the prescriptive approach according to the Moroccan Thermal Regulation. The simulation results show that in order to maintain a comfort temperature of 20°C in a building of 750m3, the places requires a thermal powers of approximately 21 kW, 29 kW and 32 kW, respectively, for hotels, hospitals, administrative and public-school. The heat generation is ensured by a solar collector areas of 5 m2, 7 m2 and 10 m2, respectively, for hotels, hospitals, administrative and public-school spaces, a storage tank of 2 m3 and a finned heat exchanger with 24 tubes. The finned tube bundles have been modelled and integrated into the system design via a Matlab code. The heating temperature is adjusted via two controllers to ensure a constant air temperature of 20°C during the heating periods. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","heat exchanger; heating system; Solar energy; tertiary buildings; vacuum tube collectors","Electron tubes; Energy utilization; Heat exchangers; Heating; Heating equipment; Hospitals; Intelligent buildings; MATLAB; Population statistics; School buildings; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar water heaters; Sustainable development; Tanks (containers); Heating system; Renewable energy systems; Simulation environment; Solar air heating system; Solar collector areas; Tertiary building; Total energy consumption; Vacuum tube collectors; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050612558

Safe and durable battery is of a great significance for this type of mobility, hence the increasing interest of research activity oriented to battery studies, in order to assure safe operating mode and to control the battery in case of any abnormal functioning conditions that could damage the battery if not properly managed. Lithium-ion technology is considered the most suitable existing technology for electrical storage, because of their interesting features such as their relatively long cycle life, lighter weight, their high energy density, However, there is a lot of work that is still needed to be done in order to assure safe operating lithium-ion batteries, starting with their internal status monitoring, cell balancing within a battery pack, and thermal management. Tasks that are accomplished by the battery management system (BMS) which uses the state of charge (SOC) as an indicator of the internal charge level of the battery, in order to avoid unpredicted system interruption. Since the state of charge is an inner state of a the battery which cannot be directly measured, a powerful estimation technique is inevitable, in this paper we investigate the performances of tow estimation strategies; kalman filtering based observers and sliding mode observers, both strategies are compared in terms of accuracy, design requirement, and overall performances. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Charging (batteries); Intelligent buildings; Kalman filters; Lithium-ion batteries; Sliding mode control; Sustainable development; Battery Management Systems (BMS); Comparative studies; Estimation strategies; Estimation techniques; High energy densities; Lithium-ion technology; Sliding mode observers; State-of-charge estimation; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050607027

Consequently, the charging infrastructure should be developed in the same time. Among this substructure, Charging stations photovoltaic-assisted are attracting a substantial interest due to increased environmental awareness, cost reduction and rise in efficiency of the PV modules. The intention of this paper is to review the technological status of Photovoltaic-Electric vehicle (PV-EV) charging stations during the last decade. The PV-EV charging station is divided into two categories, which are PV-grid and PV-standalone charging systems. From a practical point view, the distinction between the two architectures is the bidirectional inverter, which is added to link the station to the smart grid.

Here, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM-D) is used to demonstrate a new strain-accommodation mechanism, in high-strain NaFePO4/PVdF electrodes, via relaxation of the binder network surrounding the intercalation particles. Complete mechanical degradation of the polymer network occurs during long-term cycling of NaFePO4 electrodes in aqueous solutions (hard and tough behavior). In contrast, in aprotic solutions, a softened binder easily accommodates the high transformation strain, ensuring excellent electrode cycling performance (soft and tough behavior). Quantification of the high-frequency viscoelastic properties of an operating composite electrode linked to the binder's fracture toughness ensures fast and facile screening of the optimal polymeric binder/electrolyte solution combinations. This methodology should be extremely important for optimization of cycling performance of Li-Si anodes undergoing huge volume changes during cycling. Almost all practical composite battery electrodes experience volume changes during cycling, deteriorating their cycling performance. A new key element that the EQCM-D methodology introduces into the energy storage field is a general platform for quantification of high-frequency viscoelastic characteristics of high-strain composite electrodes correlated with their low-frequency resilience and toughness moduli. Fast relaxation ensures effective high-strain accommodation by softened binder in aprotic solution. In contrast, with excessively stiff binder in aqueous solution, the strong electrode/binder interactions tracked dynamically reflect the initial and advanced stages of the mechanical degradation of the polymeric binder up to its complete destruction. The discovered correlation between the fracture toughness of the binder and its high-frequency viscoelastic behavior will serve for a rational design of extremely strained composite alloy-type electrodes such as the Li-Si anode. Tough and brittle characters of the binder in composite battery electrodes stabilize/deteriorate their long-term cycling performance, respectively. Instead of performing conventional long-time cycling tests of battery electrodes followed by their postmortem analysis, the proposed accelerated EQCM-D diagnostic easily distinguishes between the stable and failed cycling modes of strained electrodes by characteristic coupled shifts in the recorded resonance frequency and resonance bandwidth changes on multiple harmonics (EQCM-D signatures). © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","composite electrode; EQCM; in situ mechanical characterizations; LiFePO4; lithium-ion battery; NaFePO4; polymer binder; PVdF; QCM-D; sodium-ion battery","Anodes; Binders; Deterioration; Fracture; Fracture toughness; Iron compounds; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Metal ions; Polymers; Quartz crystal microbalances; Silicon alloys; Sodium compounds; Sodium-ion batteries; Solutions; Viscoelasticity; Composite electrode; EQCM; LiFePO4; Mechanical characterizations; NaFePO4; Polymer binders; PVdF; Electrochemical electrodes; aqueous solution; composite; electrode; ion; lithium; polymer; sodium; viscoelasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045914234

However, the practical performance of the sulfur cathode is plagued by fast capacity decay and poor cycle life, both of which can be attributed to the intrinsic dissolution/shuttling of lithium polysulfides. Here, a new built-in magnetic field–enhanced polysulfide trapping mechanism is discovered by introducing ferromagnetic iron/iron carbide (Fe/Fe3C) nanoparticles with a graphene shell (Fe/Fe3C/graphene) onto a flexible activated cotton textile (ACT) fiber to prepare the ACT@Fe/Fe3C/graphene sulfur host. The novel trapping mechanism is demonstrated by significant differences in the diffusion behavior of polysulfides in a custom-designed liquid cell compared to a pure ACT/S cathode. Furthermore, a cell assembled using the ACT@Fe/Fe3C/S cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of ≈764 mAh g−1, excellent rate performance, and a remarkably long lifespan of 600 cycles using ACT@Fe/Fe3C/S (whereas only 100 cycles can be achieved using pure ACT/S). The new magnetic field–enhanced trapping mechanism provides not only novel insight but unveils new possibilities for mitigating the “shuttle effect” of polysulfides thereby promoting the practical applications of Li–S batteries. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

When applied to a state-of-the-art La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) cathode in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), the catalyst coating reduced the cathodic polarization resistance from 2.57 to 0.312 Ω cm2 at 600°C. Oxygen molecules adsorb and dissociate rapidly on the NPs due to enriched surface oxygen vacancies and then quickly transport through the PBCC film, as confirmed by density functional theory-based computations. The synergistic combination of the distinctive properties of the two separate phases dramatically enhances the ORR kinetics, which is attractive not only for intermediate-temperature SOFCs but also for other types of energy conversion and storage systems, including electrolysis cells and membrane reactors for synthesis of clean fuels. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an important but sluggish step in many chemical and energy transformation processes; energy loss due to ORR is still significant in the most advanced fuel cells, more so at lower operating temperatures. To make energy conversion and storage devices economically competitive and commercially viable, however, several materials challenges must be overcome, one of which is the creation of durable, low-cost materials and nanostructures of high electrocatalytic activity for ORR at operating temperatures. Here we report our rationally designed multi-phase catalyst, dramatically enhancing the kinetics of oxygen reduction of the state-of-the-art solid oxide fuel cell cathode. It is readily applicable to other energy storage and conversion systems, including metal-air batteries, supercapacitors, electrolyzers, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysis.

The estimation accuracy of the SoE relies on the model fidelity, which means that the model parameters are required to be identified online to mitigate the aging effect. However, since the SC model is naturally nonlinear and high dimensional, it is typically difficult to identify the model parameters online. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a generalized extended state observer (GESO) for SC SoE estimation based on an online identified model. A nonlinear mathematical model for SC is established based on the three branch equivalent circuit models, where the model parameters are online estimated with a designed modified recursive least square. A GESO is designed to estimate the SoE of SC in real time. A laboratory test bed has been built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experiment results show that the proposed method provides a better SoE estimation accuracy than the existing methods. © 2013 IEEE.","extended state observer; online parameter identification; state-of-energy (SoE); Supercapacitor","Circuit simulation; Equivalent circuits; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; State estimation; Computational model; Extended state observer; Integrated circuit modeling; Observers; On-line parameter identification; state-of-energy (SoE); Supercapacitor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046999197

The 2D nanochannel structure and low frictional water flow inside micrometer-thick graphene oxide (GO) laminates make them attractive candidates for large-scale energy storage systems. Through the design of large size differences between charge carriers and redox species, GO membranes can achieve high rejection and high ionic conductivity in various solutions. Furthermore, tailoring the degree of oxidation or using bacterial cellulose as the hybrid component shows the flexibility to tune the microstructure and ionic transport of GO-based membranes. As a separator, GO membranes can achieve a rejection of &gt;95% for a number of active species, and the ionic conductivity can reach 1.7 × 10−2 S cm−1 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolytes. Redox flow batteries with GO-based separators show a charge-discharge profile similar to that of commercial Nafion 212 and achieve a stable cycling performance with a high Coulombic efficiency of ∼98%. The increasing development of large-scale energy storage technology is largely driven by the critical need for efficient storage of renewable energy generated from intermittent resources. The redox flow battery (RFB) is regarded as a promising technology for potential grid-scale storage. However, membranes separating the catholyte and anolyte are still a limiting factor for further development of next-generation RFBs. Here, graphene oxide (GO)-based membranes show potential as a new class of RFB separators because of their precise size-exclusion properties, mechanical and chemical stability, and flexible functionalization. This work systematically studied the ion-transport behavior of three types of GO-based membranes by controlling hydrophilic microstructures. Because of their precise ion selectivity and high ionic conductivity in aqueous solutions, GO-based membranes represent a new type of low-cost yet high-performance separators for large-scale energy storage systems. Two-dimensional architectures and tunable physicochemical properties of graphene oxide (GO) offer an exciting opportunity to develop a new class of flow battery membranes by controlled stacking of GO nanosheets. In this study, a 2D nanochannel structured membrane for a redox flow battery using GO sheets as building blocks with tunable interlayer space achieved stable cycling in selected alkaline electrolytes. This work also opens a new avenue toward achieving low-cost yet effective separators for large-scale electrochemical energy storage. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","2D microstructure; energy storage; graphene oxides; membrane; redox flow battery; separator",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046012117

However, the development of sodium-ion batteries is hindered by the lack of suitable cathode materials that have sufficient specific energy density and cycle life. Here, we report layered NaVOPO4 as a cathode material that exhibits high voltage (∼3.5 V versus Na/Na+), high discharge capacity (144 mAh g−1 at 0.05 C), and remarkable cyclability with 67% capacity retention over 1,000 cycles. The excellent performances result from the high Na+ ion diffusion rate in the two-dimensional path and the reversible transformation behavior of (de)sodiation. Particularly, this layered structure and its synthetic procedure can be extended to other alkali-metal intercalation materials, leading to other metal-ion battery systems, which opens a new avenue for large-scale energy storage systems with the development of high-energy-density and long-life cathodes for electric storage applications. The growing demand for large-scale energy storage is driving the development of alternative cation batteries beyond lithium, considering the limited resources of Li in the Earth's crust and its uneven distribution. Sodium-ion batteries have become a topic of emerging interest for large-scale energy storage. The wide availability and low cost of sodium resources confer an overwhelming advantage over commercial lithium-ion batteries. Developing advanced sodium storage cathodes with robust structure and enhanced energy density is a great challenge for energy chemists in the pursuit of efficient storage systems. Here, we report a NaVOPO4 cathode with layered structure by facile synthesis routes. The two-dimensional Na+ diffusion path enables an electrode with extraordinary structural stability and outstanding electrochemical performance. The synthetic method could provide inspiration for material synthesis and development at low cost and on a large scale. Sodium-ion batteries have attracted enormous attention as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries because of the abundant resources and low cost of sodium.

Herein, macromolecularly interconnected 3D graphene/nanostructured CPH is synthesized via self-assembly of CPHs and graphene oxide macrostructures. The 3D hybrid hydrogel shows uniform interconnectivity and enhanced mechanical properties due to the strong macromolecular interaction between the CPHs and graphene, thus greatly reducing aggregation in the fiber-shaping process. A proof-of-concept all-gel-state fibrous supercapacitor based on the 3D polyaniline/graphene hydrogel is fabricated to demonstrate the outstanding flexibility and mouldability, as well as superior electrochemical properties enabled by this 3D hybrid hydrogel design. The proposed device can achieve a large strain (up to ≈40%), and deliver a remarkable volumetric energy density of 8.80 mWh cm−3 (at power density of 30.77 mW cm−3), outperforming many fiber-shaped supercapacitors reported previously.

Taking overpotential as a direct criterion, we illustrate in theory and experiment that the adsorption energies of charged species such as Li++e- and H++e- are a central parameter to describe catalytic activities related to electricity-in/electricity-out efficiencies. The essence of catalytic activity is revealed to relate with electronic coupling between catalysts and charged species. Based on adsorption energy, some activity descriptors such as d-band center, eg-electron number and charge-transfer capacity are further defined by electronic properties of catalysts that directly affect interaction between catalysts and charged species. The present review is helpful for understanding the catalytic mechanisms of these electrocatalytic reactions and developing accurate catalytic descriptors, which can be employed to screen high-activity catalysts in future high-throughput calculations and experiments. © The Author(s) 2017.

EVs are viewed as one of the novel solutions to land transport systems, as they reduce overdependence on fossil energy. With the current growth of EVs, it calls for innovative ways of supplementing EVs power, as overdependence on electric power may add to expensive loads on the power grid. However lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for EVs have high capacity, and large serial/parallel numbers, when coupled with problems like safety, durability, uniformity, and cost imposes limitations on the wide application of lithium-ion batteries in EVs. These LIBs face a major challenge of battery life, which research has shown can be extended by cell balancing. The common areas under which these batteries operate with safety and reliability require the effective control and management of battery health systems. A great deal of research is being carried out to see that this technology does not lead to failure in the applications, as its failure may lead to catastrophes or lessen performance. This paper, through an analytical review of the literature, gives a brief introduction to battery management system (BMS), opportunities, and challenges, and provides a future research agenda on battery health management. With issues raised in this review paper, further exploration is essential. © 2018 by the authors.

In this article, working principles of the new kind of expansion air engine are described. A mathematical model of the working processes is set up by analysis of the air engine. The characteristics of the expansion air engine are obtained by using the simulation technology. Results show that, first of all, with the same supply pressure, the efficiency of the new kind of expansion air engine is higher than that of the single stage expansion air engine by approximately 15%, which is about 1.31–1.56 times of that of the single stage air engine. Simultaneously, the output power of the new kind of air engine is higher than that of the single stage expansion air engine. Second, the efficiency and output power are mainly impacted by the closing angle of valve 1. Third, the bigger the cylinder diameter ratio is, the higher the efficiency is. Finally, the efficiency and output power can reach to the highest value in suitable orifice port shape. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","air efficiency; Expansion air engine; modeling simulation; orifice port; performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047985870

The mechanism of magnetic vortex polarity reversal is uncovered by a quantitative analysis of exchange energy density, magnetostatic energy density, and their total energy density. The simulation results indicate that the magnetic vortex polarity is reversed through the nucleation-annihilation process of topological vortex-antivortex pair.

Recent studies suggest that in the postingestive state, FGF21 may regulate energy intake and discourage consumption of alcohol and sugars, most likely through effector circuits in the central nervous system.

Using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) B-knockout and inducible VEGF downregulation mouse models, we have shown that VEGFB inactivation caused expansion of white adipose, whitening of brown adipose, an increase in fat accumulation, and a reduction in energy consumption. At the same time, expression of the white adipose-associated genes was increased and brown adipose-associated genes decreased. VEGF repression, in contrast, induced brown adipose expansion and brown adipocyte development in white adipose, increased energy expenditure, upregulated brown adipose-associated genes, and downregulated white adipose-associated genes. When VEGFB-knockout and VEGF-repressed mice are crossed together, VEGF and VEGFB can counteractively regulate large numbers of genes and efficiently reverse each other's roles. These genes, under counteractive VEGF and VEGFB regulations, include transcription factors, adhesion molecules, and metabolic enzymes. This balancing role is confirmed by morphologic and functional changes.

In this study, cobalt-nickel phosphide/N-doped porous carbon polyhedron electrocatalysts (CoNiP/NC) were prepared by a facile two-step carbonization method and subsequent phosphorization calcination in an Ar atmosphere using cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as precursors. Among the electrocatalysts obtained by controlling the carbonization and phosphorization temperature, the CoNiP/NC700 catalyst, where 700 refers to the calcination temperature (°C), exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity for the OER with an onset overpotential of approximate 220 mV and an overpotential of approximate 300 mV in alkaline solution at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. The CoNi/NC and Co/NC Samples were also tested for comparison and CoNiP/NC exhibited the better electrocatalytic activity at all the temperatures tested. The superior electrocatalytic activity of the phosphorization hybrid material can be attributed to the superior synergistic effect of Co, Ni, P and C due to their strong electron coupling interactions. The interconnected amorphous carbon anchored the active Co compounds to avoid aggregation and maintained conducting channels for electron transfer.

Based on the case study, self-tuning algorithms are used to search for optimal parameters during the operation of the VSG in order to minimize the amplitude and rate of change of the frequency variations. The performances of the proposed self-tuning (ST)-VSG, the frequency droop method, and the CP-VSG are evaluated by comparing their effects on attenuating frequency variations under load variations.

However, its integration at the demand side will cause rapid power fluctuations of the tie-line in the residential region. The traditional generators are generally difficult to manage rapid power fluctuations due to their insufficient efficiency requirements and low responding speed. With an effective control strategy, the demand side resources (DSRs) including DGs, electric vehicles and thermostatically-controlled loads at the demand side, are able to serve as the energy storage system to smooth the load fluctuations. However, it is a challenge to properly model different types of DSRs. To solve this problem, a unified state model is first developed to describe the characteristics of different DSRs. Then a load curve smoothing strategy is proposed to offset the load fluctuations of the tie-line of the residential region, where a control matrix deduced from the unified state model is introduced to manage the power outputs of different DSRs, considering the response order and the comfort levels. Finally, a residential region with households is used to validate the load curve smoothing strategy based on the unified state model, and the results show that the power fluctuation rate of the tie-line is significantly decreased. Meanwhile, comparative study results are shown to demonstrate the advantages of the unified state model based load curve smoothing strategy. © 2018, The Author(s).","Demand side resource (DSR); Distributed generation (DG); Electric vehicle (EV); Load curve smoothing; Power fluctuation; Thermostatically-controlled load (TCL)","Distributed power generation; Electric machine control; Electric vehicles; Housing; Renewable energy resources; Comparative studies; Demand side resources; Efficiency requirements; Energy storage systems; Load curves; Power fluctuations; Renewable energies; Thermostatically controlled loads; Curve fitting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046631866

However, the integration of LSWFs presents challenges to the volt/var control (VVC) of power grids. In this regard, various VVC methods for power grids with connections of LSWFs have been proposed from different viewpoints. This paper provides a comprehensive review on VVC for power grids with connections of LSWFs. First, the challenges presented by LSWFs to VVC are investigated with regard to the uncertainty of power flow and voltage, conflicts of VVCs among interconnected power grids, operation of discrete devices, voltage stability, and reactive power market. Second, an overview on current research regarding VVC methods for LSWFs connected power grids is presented, where the VVC methods are classified into three categories: Decentralized VVC, centralized VVC, and hierarchical VVC. The three categories of VVC methods are analyzed and compared in terms of their advantages, disadvantages, and applications. In addition, drawbacks of current research are concluded.

To this end, a novel two-scale stochastic control framework is put forth for smart-grid powered coordinated multi-point (CoMP) systems. Taking into account renewable energy sources, dynamic pricing, two-way energy trading facilities, and imperfect energy storage devices, the energy management task is formulated as an infinite-horizon optimization problem minimizing the time-averaged energy transaction cost, subject to the users' quality of service requirements. Leveraging the Lyapunov optimization approach as well as the stochastic subgradient method, a two-scale online control (TS-OC) approach is developed for the resultant smart-grid powered CoMP systems. Using only historical data, the proposed TS-OC makes online control decisions at two timescales, and features a provably feasible and asymptotically near-optimal solution.

Following the 1996 Western Systems Coordinating Council system blackout, North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) in North America enforced a number of policies and standards to guide the power industry to periodically validate power grid models and calibrate poor parameters with the goal of building sufficient confidence in model quality. The PMU-based approach using online measurements without interfering with the operation of generators provides a low-cost alternative to meet NERC standards. This paper presents an innovative procedure and tool suites to validate and calibrate models based on a trajectory sensitivity analysis method and an advanced ensemble Kalman filter algorithm. The developed prototype demonstrates excellent performance in identifying and calibrating bad parameters of a realistic hydro power plant against multiple system events. © 2017 IEEE.","Dynamic state estimation; ensemble Kalman filter; model validation; parameter calibration; phasor measurement unit; power system dynamics","Bandpass filters; Electric energy storage; Electric power system stability; Kalman filters; Phasor measurement units; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic systems; System stability; Units of measurement; Dynamic state estimation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; Model validation; Parameter calibration; Power system dynamics; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045973130

Methods: The paper begins with a brief description of the gut microbiota environment, distribution, and its unique symbiotic relationship with the host. The way that enviromental factors influence microbiota composition and subsequent impact on the host are then described. Next, the mechanisms linking gut dysbiosis with obesity are discussed, and finally current challenges and limitations in understanding the role of gut microbiota in control of obesity are presented. Results: Gut microbiota has been implicated in regulation of fat storage, as well as gut dysbiosis, thus contributing to the development of obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. However, the underlying mechanisms of these processes are far from being clear and will require complex preclinical and clinical interdisciplinary studies of bacteria and host cell-to-cell interactions. Conclusions: There is a need for a better understanding of how changes in gut microbiota composition can impact energy balance and thus control weight gain.

A source will have captured CO2 requiring suitable storage and affordable transportation between source and storage. Capture, transport, and storage are the links of the CCS value chain. For this study, capture costs were modeled for six hypothetical sources (various industrial and power-generation facilities) with annual CO2 capture rates ranging from 0.65 to 3.90 million tonnes (Mt). Seven storage reservoirs located in the Appalachian, Illinois and Gulf Coast Basins—and of various quality with respect to CO2 storage—were modeled: two within the Rose Run Formation, three within the Mount (Mt.) Simon Formation, one in the Lower Tuscaloosa Formation, and one in the Frio Formation. Storage costs were calculated with the FE/NETL CO2 Saline Storage Cost Model for the seven selected storage reservoirs under dome and regional dip structural settings. For transportation, a dedicated pipeline system and a trunkline pipeline system were modeled. Transportation costs from source to storage reservoirs were evaluated using the FE/NETL CO2 Transport Cost Model. A source may not always be able to find suitable proximal storage. Low CCS costs reflect a source's mass of captured CO2 finding suitable storage within an affordable transportation distance. Economies of scale are present in each link of the CCS value chain. These economies of scale are limited with respect to storage or the distance captured CO2 can be transported to storage. © 2018 The Authors","Capture; CCS costs; Dedicated pipeline; Source-to-sink matching; Storage; Transport; Trunkline","Carbon dioxide; Chains; Costs; Economics; Energy storage; Mass transportation; Pipelines; Piping systems; Water pipelines; Capture; Comparative analysis; Source to sinks; Storage reservoirs; Transport; Transportation cost; Transportation distance; Trunkline; Carbon capture; carbon sequestration; comparative study; cost analysis; pipeline; source-sink dynamics; transport process; Appalachians; Gulf Coast [United States]; Illinois; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044770594

However, the structural design of these materials is still highly needed to further develop their applications in energy storage fields. In this work, peanut skin is choosen as the precursor to construct graphene-like nanosheets on the surface of porous carbon framework via a sulfuric acid-assisted hydrothermal process with following activation technique. Electrochemical results reveal this unique structure could provide high rate capacity (243 mAh·g−1 at 5 A g−1) and stable cycling performance (681 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles) in Li-ion battery and promising Na-ion storage cycling performance (233 mAh·g−1 at 0.5 A·g−1 after 450 cycles) as anodes materials. Further contrastive research indicates these promoted performance are mainly attributed to the graphene-like nanosheets in this composite structures. These sheets remarkbly enhance both of the intercalation and surface adsorption of Li-ion with high charge transfer ability, finally facilitating both of the pseudocapacitance and diffusion controlled process during the charge/discharge test.

Although both the geological structure and the physical properties of most of them have been extensively studied and characterized, there is limited data on the assessment of the CO2 storage capacity, especially in the offshore fields. The purpose of this study is to develop a high-level quantitative assessment of the CO2 volume that can be stored in depleted oil and gas fields in the Federal offshore regions of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), both on a field-by-field and on a reservoir-by-reservoir basis. In this study, we simulated CO2 storage in 461 of the depleted oil and gas reservoirs (73 fields) among 3514 reservoirs (675 fields) in the GOM (2013 BOEM Reserves database). Based on the simulation results, we improved the Department of Energy (DOE) CO2 Storage Resource Estimate Equation to make more refined and accurate estimates of storable CO2 volumes. Newly revised efficiency factor (ERoil/gas) correlates better with hydrocarbon recovery factor (HCRF), which is found to be a strong indicator of the CO2 storage capacity of the reservoir. The higher HCRF results in higher ERoil/gas. The further investigations resulted in an improved, material balance-based correlation—which is called the Production-CO2 Storage Correlation—between cumulative production (free gas, oil and water) at reservoir conditions and CO2 storage volume at standard conditions. This relationship, which is unique for all three types of reservoirs (gas, oil and combination), allows for making direct estimates of CO2 storage volume using only existing production data. Application of these correlations to all of the depleted fields (3514 reservoirs) yields CO2 storage capacities of 4748 MMtons, and the CO2 storage capacity in all 1295 depleted and active fields (13,289 reservoirs) in the GOM calculated to be 21.57 Billion tons. If a 5000 psia surface injection pressure constraint was applied, these volumes would be reduced to 4075 MMtons for all depleted fields only and to 15.80 Billion tons for all depleted and active fields in the GOM. The production-CO2 storage correlations can be used to make more accurate CO2 storage volume estimates in all onshore and offshore depleted oil and gas fields. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 storage; Depleted oil and gas fields; Gulf of Mexico; Storage efficiency factor; Volumetric storage","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Gas industry; Gases; Hydrocarbon refining; Natural gas fields; Offshore gas fields; Offshore oil well production; Oil fields; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Petroleum reservoirs; Proven reserves; Storage (materials); Well stimulation; CO2 storage; Cumulative production; Geological structures; Gulf of Mexico; Oil and gas fields; Oil and gas reservoir; Quantitative assessments; Storage efficiency; Offshore oil fields; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; gas field; hydrocarbon reservoir; oil field; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044152192

To address the load fluctuations, model predictive control has been explored as an effective solution. However, the load torque of the propulsion system, knowledge of which is essential for model predictive control, is difficult to measure and includes multi-frequency fluctuations. To deal with this issue, an adaptive model predictive control is developed so that the load torque estimation and prediction can be incorporated into model predictive control.

The strength of solving problems using CNN comes from the fact that it deals with nonlinear dynamic systems. In this paper, feasible criteria for adaptive hardware approximation, automated method to switch between high and low precisions, is proposed to efficiently reduce energy consumption of a digital CNN. Two different criteria, state- and sign-dependent control, are presented and compared by simulating discrete-time CNN with various applications: image processing, associative memory, and scientific computing. Simulation results show that the state-dependent control is better suited for automatically introducing approximate computing in CNN accelerator. Even further, this control method allows more aggressive power reduction by stopping the computations for those cells in the saturation region of CNN dynamics for applications like associative memory. As a result, adaptive hardware approximation is effective in reducing energy consumption of a digital CNN compared with simply injecting predetermined approximation for entire CNN computations. The experimental results also show that the acceptable level of energy reduction differs from the application, equivalently the type of CNN. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Adaptive precision; approximate computing; cellular nonlinear network (CNN); energy-efficient hardware","Associative processing; Associative storage; Computer aided software engineering; Dynamical systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hardware; Image processing; Memory architecture; Nonlinear dynamical systems; Adaptive precision; approximate computing; Associative memory; Cellular nonlinear networks; Energy efficient; Reduce energy consumption; Reducing energy consumption; Scientific and engineering applications; Nonlinear networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041403247

Although lipid storage is their most obvious function, LDs are far from inert as they participate in maintaining lipid homeostasis through lipid synthesis, metabolism, and transportation. Furthermore, they are involved in cell signaling and other molecular events closely associated with human disease such as dyslipidemia, obesity, lipodystrophy, diabetes, fatty liver, atherosclerosis, and others. The last decade has seen a great increase in the attention paid to LD biology. Regardless, many fundamental features of LD biology remain obscure. In this review, we will discuss key aspects of LD biology including their biogenesis, growth and regression.

The number of sensors in microseismic monitoring systems is usually very large, which will result in a huge amount of data being produced if the Nyquist sampling theorem is used to acquire microseismic signals. To reduce the data storage costs and accelerate the transmission speed, we propose a distributed compressed sensing (CS) scheme for microseismic monitoring signals in this paper. The distributed compressed sensing scheme begins when it detects the first break time in the microseismic signal. The data recoding of the first break time is coded and transmitted together with the measured values of CS. Depending on the correlations between the microseismic signals, the first break time of the signals are aligned to that of the reference signal. Furthermore, we make use of the distributed CS to reduce the amount of data to be transmitted and to increase the reconstruction accuracy. Simulation results show that, compared with the sampling scheme based on the Nyquist sampling theorem, the independent CS scheme or the traditional distributed CS scheme, our proposed scheme improves the accuracy in the first break time detection and the reconstruction accuracy, and the scheme reduces the energy consumption at the same time. © 2013 IEEE.","Compressed sensing; first break time; microseismic signal; signal reconstruction; signal sampling","Compressed sensing; Correlation methods; Data mining; Data reduction; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Mathematical models; Microseismic monitoring; Monitoring; Seismology; Sensors; Signal reconstruction; Distributed Compressed Sensing; First breaks; Microseismic signals; Nyquist sampling theorem; Reconstruction accuracy; Sparse matrices; Transmission speed; Underground engineering; Signal sampling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046335722

In order to improve the operation performance of a dc MG in both steady and transient states, in this paper a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) interfaced by a three-port converter (TPC) is studied. Particularly, a battery and an ultra-capacitor (UC), which form the HESS, are connected at the source side of the TPC, respectively. Aiming at a phase-shifting controlled full-bridge isolated TPC, in addition to conventional droop control loop, a frequency division-based control method is proposed to achieve rational power sharing between the battery and UC. Due to the characteristics of TPC, virtual inductance and virtual capacitance loops are implemented using the input currents at the battery and UC ports. The frequency division between the battery and UC in the HESS is quantitatively analyzed by using the frequency domain small-signal analysis considering the characteristics of power exchange in the phase-shifting controlled TPC.

Owing to the unreliable nature of such ambient energy sources, these systems suffer from supply voltage degradation and power interruptions. Therefore, the computational scheme for such energy-harvesting systems is divided into small incremental steps along with nonvolatile memory elements that conserve the data between subsequent power interruptions. Toward that end, we propose a new nonvolatile flip-flop (NVFF) that exhibits better energy efficiency and denser area compared to previous designs. The NVFF utilizes a single spin Hall effect-based magnetic tunnel junction (SHE-MTJ) because of its favorable device characteristics, like high spin injection efficiency and decoupled read-write paths. We also propose a new restore mechanism, wherein a CMOS inverter is used as a gain element to attain reliable restore operation with single SHE-MTJ per NVFF. A detailed device-circuit simulation, including variational analysis, proves the reliability of the proposed NVFF. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","magnetic tunnel junctions; nonvolatile flip-flop; nonvolatile memory; spin Hall effect; Spintronic memory and logic","Circuit simulation; Computation theory; Crystal symmetry; Electric inverters; Electric resistance; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Flip flop circuits; Internet of things; Logic gates; Magnetic devices; Metals; Nonvolatile storage; Restoration; Tunnel junctions; Device characteristics; Energy harvesting systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Magnetic tunnel junction; Magnetic tunneling; Non-volatile; Non-volatile flip-flops; Non-volatile memory; Spin Hall effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045993940

Modern systems keep data partitions in memory for pipelined operators, and persist data across stages with wide dependencies on disks for fault tolerance. While processing can often scale well by splitting jobs into smaller tasks for better parallelism, all-to-all data transfer—called shuffle operations—become the scaling bottleneck when running many small tasks in multi-stage data analytics jobs. Our key observation is that this bottleneck is due to the superlinear increase in disk I/O operations as data volume increases. We present Riffle, an optimized shuffle service for big-data analytics frameworks that significantly improves I/O efficiency and scales to process petabytes of data. To do so, Riffle efficiently merges fragmented intermediate shuffle files into larger block files, and thus converts small, random disk I/O requests into large, sequential ones. Riffle further improves performance and fault tolerance by mixing both merged and unmerged block files to minimize merge operation overhead. Using Riffle, Facebook production jobs on Spark clusters with over 1,000 executors experience up to a 10x reduction in the number of shuffle I/O requests and 40% improvement in the end-to-end job completion time. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Big-Data Analytics Frameworks; I/O Optimization; Shuffle Service; Storage","Data handling; Data transfer; Digital storage; Energy storage; Fault tolerance; Big Data Analytics; Data analytics; Job completion; Large scale data; Large-scale data processing; Merge operations; Production jobs; Shuffle Service; Big data",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052023490

In this Perspective, chemical fixation of CO2 (CFC) is evaluated as a progressive abating strategy by a proposed “golden triangle” principle. We derive several simple equations to describe partially the relationships between energy and CO2 arising from fossil fuel combustions in the power sector upon energy/mass-balance analyses of related electrochemical reductions of CO2 (ERCs) as a route to CFC. Mitigation coefficients are obtained as figures of merit to quantify the intrinsic abatement capabilities of various reduction products, identifying privileged ERCs that may allow fossil fuel power, the current and expected dominant source of electricity at least before 2040, to drive the ERCs for emission abatements. The challenges for large-scale deployments of the ERCs as a substantial emission-abating strategy are discussed upon sensitivity analysis of mitigation efficiency for selected privileged ERCs. Limiting the average global temperature rise to well below 2°C relative to the pre-industrial levels by 2100 via substantial emission abatements of greenhouse gases, especially CO2, is one of the greatest global challenges in this century. A failure to meet that target has been widely projected to cause prohibitively severe socioeconomic damage due to adverse climate changes resulting from fast global warming. However, even with the current emission abatement plans being executed as promised in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change—a formidable challenge by itself—the estimated remaining carbon budget to meet the temperature target still has a high probability to be exhausted before 2040, leaving slim chances to avoid a future of fast global warming. Progressive strategies with a practical balance of mitigation efficiency, storage stability, and economic cost are urgently needed for substantial CO2 emission abatements from fossil fuel combustions. It is foreseeable that the rapidly exhausting trend of the remaining CO2 emission budget should dramatically increase the socioeconomic costs for CO2 emissions in a short time span, leading to situations whereby mitigation efficiency and storage stability become a higher priority. Strategic planning and technological preparations in advance of such situations require a progressive view of the CO2 issues, which may create the time required for gradual growth and deployments of decarbonized energies to eventually achieve the temperature-control target. Progressive strategies with a practical balance of mitigation efficiency, storage stability, and economic cost are urgently needed for substantial CO2 emission abatements from fossil fuel combustions. We derived simple equations to quantify electrochemical fixations of CO2 upon unit-energy-centric mass-balance analyses. Mitigation coefficients are obtained as figures of merit for various fixation products, identifying privileged fixations that may allow fossil fuel power, the current and expected dominant source of electricity at least before 2040, to drive the ERCs for emission abatements. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","chemical fixations; CO2; electrochemical reductions; quantitative analysis","Bioassay; Budget control; Chemical analysis; Costs; Electrolytic reduction; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Sensitivity analysis; Chemical fixation; Electrochemical reductions; Fossil fuel combustion; Global temperatures; Large-scale deployment; Mass balance analysis; Mitigation efficiency; Pre-industrial levels; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; combustion; electrochemistry; emission control; fixation; fossil fuel; global warming; greenhouse gas; international agreement; mass balance; quantitative analysis; reduction; temperature",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044766419

However, Li dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase have hindered its practical applications. Structured current collectors have been widely proposed to settle these issues, whereas the pre-filling of Li metal into structured anode is challenging. We proposed a coralloid silver-coated carbon fiber-based composite Li anode (CF/Ag-Li) through Ag electroplating and molten Li infusion. The molten Li can be infused into the carbon fiber framework due to the lithiophilic nature of Ag. In addition, a dendrite-free morphology and extraordinary electrochemical performance are achieved in Li-LiFePO4 and Li-sulfur cells. The CF/Ag-Li|Li symmetrical cells can cycle for 160 cycles at 10.0 mA cm−2 and 10.0 mAh cm−2. The CF/Ag-Li|S cells exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 785 mAh g−1 and a large capacity retention rate after 400 cycles at 0.5C. With the rapid development of electric vehicles and portable electronics such as mobile phones and laptops, the widely used lithium (Li)-ion batteries are having many difficulties in meeting the growing demands for high-energy-density energy-storage systems. Li metal, with an ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity of 3,860 mAh g−1 and the lowest negative electrochemical potential (−3.040 V versus standard hydrogen electrode), has become one of the most promising anode materials for next-generation batteries. Unfortunately, the practical application of Li metal anode has been hindered by its low cycling efficiency, short lifespan, and potential safety hazards. Herein we propose a Li-containing composite electrode based on coralloid carbon fibers that exhibited extraordinary electrochemical performance in full cells of Li-S and Li-LiFePO4 batteries. Such proof of concept on Li-infused structured electrodes sheds fresh light on the dendrite-free plating of Li metal anodes in working rechargeable batteries.

In contrast, a mutant that can no longer synthesize the main carbon storage compound glycogen showed higher energy charge. The overflow of organic acids in this mutant under nitrogen depletion could also be triggered under high light in nitrogen-replete conditions, with an energy input level dependency. These findings suggest that energy charge in cyanobacteria is tightly linked to growth and carbon partition and that energy management is of key significance for their application as photosynthetic carbon dioxide-assimilating cell factories.

It is a kind of environmental-friendly cementitious material due to its energy-saving, carbon emission reducing, and waste-utilization. It mainly composes of phosphogysum (PG) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GFS), with a small amount of cement. In Vietnam, the Diammonium Phosphate DAP - Dinh Vu fertilizer plant in Dinh Vu industrial zone in the northern port city of Hai Phong - has discharged millions of tons of solid waste containing gypsum after 9 years of operation. The waste has changed the color of the water, eroded metal and destroyed fauna and floral systems in the surrounding area. Notably, according to the environmental impact assessment, the gypsum landfill area is supposed to be 13 hectares and the storage time reaches up to five years. This paper presents the experimental results on SSC using a high amount of Dinh Vu phosphogypsum and GFS in comparison with those of ordinary Portland cement (PC). The results show that the setting time of SSC is much longer than that of Portland cement but the compressive strength of SSC can be obtained 45-50 MPa at the age of 28 days, similar to that of the control sample using 100% PC40, and 69MPa at the age of 90 days. This value even exceeds the compressive strength of the PC40 cement. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Blast furnaces; Compressive strength; Energy conservation; Environmental impact assessments; Gypsum; Planning; Portland cement; Slags; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Carbon emissions; Cementitious materials; Diammonium phosphates; Environmental-friendly; Fertilizer plant; Ground granulated blast furnace slag; Industrial zones; Ordinary Portland cement; Setting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046110057

However, its utilization is impeded by the lack of an efficient storage device. A new building block approach is proposed for an exhaustive search of optimal hydrogen uptakes in a series of low density boron nitride (BN) nanoarchitectures via extensive 3868 ab initio-based multiscale simulations. By probing various geometries, temperatures, pressures, and doping ratios, these results demonstrate a maximum uptake of 8.65 wt% at 300 K, the highest hydrogen uptake on sorbents at room temperature without doping. Li+ doping of the nanoarchitectures offers a set of optimal combinations of gravimetric and volumetric uptakes, surpassing the US Department of Energy targets. These findings suggest that the merger of energetic affinity and optimal geometry in BN building blocks overcomes the intrinsic limitations of sorbent materials, putting hybrid BN nanoarchitectures on equal footing with hydrides while demonstrating a superior capacity-kinetics–thermodynamics relationship. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

With high nickel content, the cathodes are of great interest for delivering the desired specific energy and energy density. However, the cells still suffer from fast capacity decay and low thermal-abuse tolerance to high voltage. At the highly delithiated state, the damage in the cell is mainly from severe parasitic reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction in the cathode and oxidization of the organic electrolyte. These side reactions rapidly weaken the system's rate capacity and cyclability. Solutions are being sought to provide safe operation and practical application. Three strategies have proven to be encouraging choices: surface coating, a core-shell structure, and a concentration gradient structure. For each strategy, the material architecture, fabrication procedure, operation principle, advances, and challenges are discussed in this review. The prospects for further developments are also summarized. In order to meet the increasing demand for electric vehicles, a powerful lithium-ion battery is required to deliver high capacity and energy density. Among all the components in a lithium-ion cell, nickel-rich cathodes have been widely developed as a dominant element determining the overall cell performance. The capacity delivered by the cathode is highly dependent on the nickel content. Although such cathodes indeed guarantee high capacity and energy density, thermal stability and cyclability are still poor because of structural instability and parasitic reactions. The poor cycle life cannot meet the requirement for thousands of cycles or 15 years of calendar life. With the aim of achieving high capacity with satisfactory battery lifetime, stabilization of the nickel-based cathode has become a globally competitive topic. The most encouraging strategies and prospects for further developments are summarized in this review. The cycling stability and rate capacity of a nickel-rich lithium battery are effectively improved through stabilization of the cathode by coating protection, structure modification, electrolyte optimization, and other strategies. Both electrochemical and kinetic investigations have confirmed the improved stability to be attributed to suppression of the parasitic reaction between the cathode components and electrolyte. The enhanced electrochemical performance makes the corresponding energy storage systems applicable for the global electric-vehicle market. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","electrical vehicle; high capacity; high power; Li-ion battery; nickel-based cathode",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045206754

Graphene oxide (GO) and its reduced form r-GO can be used to create water-based formulations to form smooth and continuous coatings on hair. This not only avoids the use of toxic, small molecular ingredients in common hair dyes but also renders new properties of hair for enhanced comfort, such as greatly improved antistatic performance and heat dissipation. After drying, the graphene hair dyes can form a strongly adhering coating on hair surfaces, which can resist repetitive washing with shampoo, and thus reach the performance requirement of permanent hair dyes. The color of the GO coating can be gradually darkened or patterned to create the effect of gradient dyeing, and the lightness of the resulting r-GOcoating can be adjusted through the loading level to produce different shades. Replacing toxic molecular ingredients with graphene-based sheets can lead to safer hair dyes. Multifunctional hair dyes that leverage graphene's high surface area, flexibility, electrical and thermal conductivity, and antibacterial and barrier properties can be created to render tunable hair color as well as enhanced human comfort, health, and aesthetics. The waste from graphene-coated hair can be recycled and repurposed for the creation of functional materials for other electronic or energy storage devices. Other than fashion and aesthetics, graphene-based hair dyes could also potentially benefit the development of electronics interfacing with the body, as well as livestock farming and the development of humanoid robots. Graphene-based materials are found to be excellent hair dyes that also render hairs with new properties such as antistatic and enhanced thermal dissipation. Water-based graphene hair dyes can be sprayed or brushed onto hair and dried to yield a uniform colorization effect comparable with that of commercial hair dyes. Graphene coating on hair can resist repetitive washing with shampoo and thus reach the performance of permanent hair dyes. The color of the coating can be tuned to create different shades of dark to black colors or even gradient colors. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","antistatics; black pigment; coating; cosmetics; functional textile; graphene; graphene oxide; hair dye; ombre dyeing; thermal dissipation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045185005

Analysis of the electrode-electrolyte interfaces after charge-discharge cycling showed that a sodium-metal anode that wets the solid electrolyte can be plated and stripped reversibly dendrite free and that the dissolution of the cyano-perovskite Na2MnFe(CN)6 cathode that occurs with an organic-liquid electrolyte is eliminated with the utilization of the solid electrolyte. This demonstration indicates that a high-energy-density and low-cost sodium rechargeable battery can be competitive for large-scale electric energy storage where both the anode and cathode problems are solved in an all-solid-state battery. The dependence of modern society on the combustion of fossil fuels is not sustainable. Solar and wind energy can be harvested and converted to electric power that can be transported to stationary sites for storage. Storage of electric power in a rechargeable battery would be the best solution, and a battery with a metallic-sodium anode and a cyano-perovskite Na2MnFe(CN)6 cathode would offer low-cost storage of electric power provided that its cycle life can be greatly improved. We demonstrate that this improvement is possible if a solid Na+ electrolyte can replace the organic-liquid electrolyte into which the Na2MnFe(CN)6 cathode dissolves over repeated charge-discharge cycling, and dendrite-free plating of a sodium-metal anode provides low impedance. Dissolution of the Na2MnFe(CN)6 cathode and the growth of sodium dendrites are eliminated in an all-solid-state sodium battery with a ceramic solid electrolyte contacting the sodium-metal anode and the Na2MnFe(CN)6 cathode. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","cathode dissolution; interfacial chemistry; NASICON; Prussian blue cathodes; sodium batteries; sodium dendrites; sodium-metal anodes; solid electrolytes; solid-electrolyte interphase; solid-state batteries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043770473

This gas comes from energy activities and industries like petroleum industries. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the practical technology to reduce and storage CO2. In Thailand, one of the main potential sites for storage is the Gulf of Thailand. However, the research on this issue is very rare in Thailand. Consequently, this work is aiming on the potential study of CO2 geological storage in formations in the Gulf of Thailand by using simulation. The CO2 storage capacity, pressure buildup and plume migration have been estimated. Also, this study has been simulated with various conditions. CO2 injection is used from 1,000-4,000 tons per day with the depth from 2,200-2,330 meters and the results are studied for 50 years as a monitoring period. The results present that with the formation characteristics, CO2 storage in this area has potential. Moreover, pressure buildup and plume migration are illustrated for the period of 50 years.

In a typical REMG, micro pumped storage units are built that rely on a tall building to convert energy by pumping water up to store energy and releasing the stored water to generate energy. Because of the fluctuation of renewable energy (RE) and the perturbation of the load demand, frequency deviation, and tie-line power interchange are inevitable. In this paper, the LFC controller optimization problem for the REMG is investigated, and the optimal controllers for multi-areas in the REMG are designed. To solve the optimization problem of LFC, a novel meta-heuristic algorithm called artificial sheep algorithm (ASA) is applied in the task of LFC optimization. In the experiments, RE scenarios of different seasons, the impact of PHES, and the control robustness are studied. The results not only prove the feasibility of the proposed REMG but also show the effectiveness of the optimized controllers in maintaining frequency stability under various conditions. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial sheep algorithm; controller optimization; load frequency control; micro pumped storage unit; Renewable energy integrated micro-grid","Controllers; Electric control equipment; Electric load management; Energy storage; Hydroelectric power; Optimization; Press load control; Tall buildings; Controller optimization; Frequency deviation; Load frequency control (LFC); Load-frequency control; Micro grid; Optimization problems; Optimized controllers; Pumped-storage units; Electric frequency control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045350435

Nowadays, as the data-intensive and I/O intensive applications are widely used, more attention is paid to the local storage-based clouds which can offer much better I/O performance at relatively low price compared with the shared storage. However, it will obviously increase the migration cost (e.g., energy and time). Meanwhile, there is few suitable resource demand estimation method for local storage-based clouds at present, which plays an important role in system's migration efficiency. And we find out that in this specific storage architecture, almost all the existing server consolidation algorithms do not have a suitable resource demand estimation method and a live migration scheme. To solve this problems, this paper designs and implements Combining Three (C3), a cloud architecture for local storage, C3 significant modules: Prediction, consolidation, and migration. It was proved in statistical analysis that ARIMA may be the most suitable prediction model for the server workload, which motivates us to propose the resource estimation predictor. Also, we improve the existing consolidation method by adjusting the sorting index and fit degree during migration. Then, we propose a live migration scheme for local storage environment as the third module of C3.

Additionally, with the interconnection of distributed electrical and thermal grids, system operational flexibility and energy efficiency can be affected as well. Therefore, by adding a portable energy system and a heat storage tank to the traditional distributed system, this paper proposes a newly defined distributed network to deal with the aforementioned problems. Simulation results show that by adding a portable energy system, fossil fuel energy consumption and daily operation cost can be reduced by 8% and 28.29%, respectively. Moreover, system peak load regulating capacity can be significantly improved. However, by introducing the portable energy system to the grid, system uncertainty can be increased to some extent. Therefore, chance constrained programming is proposed to control the system while considering system uncertainty. By applying Particle Swarm Optimization-Monte Carlo to solve the chance constrained programming, results show that power system economy and uncertainty can be compromised by selecting appropriate confidence levels α and β. It is also reported that by installing an extra heat storage tank, combined heat and power energy efficiency can be significantly improved and the installation capacity of the battery can be reduced. © 2018 by the authors.","Chance constrained programming; Decoupling heat and power; Microgrid; Monte Carlo simulation; Particle swarm optimization; Portable energy resources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045037723

However, how fat absorption is controlled and contributes to obesity remains unclear. Here, we show that inhibition of endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) increases the abundance of triacylglycerol synthesis enzymes and fat absorption in small intestine. The C2-domain protein AIDA acts as an essential factor for the E3-ligase HRD1 of ERAD to downregulate rate-limiting acyltransferases GPAT3, MOGAT2, and DGAT2. Aida −/− mice, when grown in a thermal-neutral condition or fed high-fat diet, display increased intestinal fatty acid re-esterification, circulating and tissue triacylglycerol, accompanied with severely increased adiposity without enhancement of adipogenesis. Intestine-specific knockout of Aida largely phenocopies its whole-body knockout, strongly indicating that increased intestinal TAG synthesis is a primary impetus to obesity. The AIDA-mediated ERAD system may thus represent an anti-thrifty mechanism impinging on the enzymes for intestinal fat absorption and systemic fat storage. How fat is absorbed in the intestine and contributes to obesity is not well understood. Here, Luo et al. show that the ERAD-pathway protein AIDA downregulates triacylglycerol synthesis rate-limiting enzymes in the small intestine by enhancing their degradation. Deficiency of AIDA leads to increased intestinal fat absorption and severe obesity. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","AIDA; DGAT2; ER-associated degradation; fat absorption; fat storage; GPAT3; HRD1; MOGAT2; triacylglycerol synthesis","acylglycerol palmitoyltransferase; acyltransferase; aida protein; carrier proteins and binding proteins; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2; glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase; insulin; triacylglycerol; ubiquitin protein ligase E3; unclassified drug; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight; C2 domain; cellular distribution; controlled study; endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation; energy expenditure; enzyme synthesis; esterification; fat intake; fatty liver; female; gene knockout; hypertriglyceridemia; inguinal white adipose tissue; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin tolerance test; intestine absorption; intestine mucosa; lipid absorption; lipid diet; lipid storage; lipogenesis; LoxP site; lung gas exchange; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; priority journal; protein degradation; retroperitoneal white adipose tissue; small intestine; white adipose tissue; animal; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; enzymology; intestine absorption; metabolism; obesity; Animals; Dietary Fats; Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation; Esterification; Intestinal Absorption; Intestine, Small; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043368331

Most of the newly installed generation capacity is being connected to the grid via power electronic converters, thus can be seen as a non-synchronous generation. The theory of power system operation and control relies heavily on the characteristics of synchronous machines and conventional network structure. Therefore, the effective integration process of the new technologies must include the composition of new physical models for converter dominated large power systems as well as innovative solutions to ensure the secure operation in the future. The focus of this paper is a holistic analysis of the reducing power system inertia to frame up new constraints for system operators through simulation studies on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers standard 118 bus test system. The different system states and scenarios offer a comparison opportunity between stability preservation possibilities. Minimum inertia constraint calculation methodologies and various objective functions are being discussed.

The researched hybrid AC/DC microgrid is composed of both AC and DC subgrids connected by multiple parallel BPCs. In the literature, the storages of a hybrid microgrid are considered to allocate in only the AC subgrid or DC subgrid, which reduces the reliability of the whole system, especially during the islanded mode. Besides, the SOC management has not been considered in BPCs' operating strategy. This paper considers a hybrid microgrid topology which has energy storages in both AC side and DC side. This ensures the reliability while increasing the complexity of the control strategy at the same time. Further, a distributed coordination control method for multiple BPCs based on SOC was proposed to enhance the reliability of hybrid microgrid.

To address this challenge we construct a novel and collaborative framework that employs object placement cross-layer communication and page-level management to effectively distribute application objects in the DRAM hardware to achieve desired power/performance goals. Thiswork describes the design and implementation of our framework,which is the first to integrate automatic object profiling and analysis at the application layer with fine-grained management of memory hardware resources in the operating system. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by employing it to control memory power consumption more effectively. First we design a custom memoryintensive workload to show the potential of this approach to reduce DRAM energy consumption. Next we develop sampling and profiling-based analyses and modify the code generator in the HotSpot VM to understand object usage patterns and automatically control the placement of hot and cold objects in a partitioned VM heap. This information is communicated to the operating system which uses it to map the logical application pages to the appropriate DRAM modules according to user-defined provisioning goals. The evaluation shows that our Java VM-based framework achieves our goal of significant DRAM energy savings across a variety of workloads without any source code modifications or recompilations. © 2018 ACM.","DRAM; Energy; Memory management; Optimization; Power","Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Optimization; Application objects; Collaborative framework; Cross-layer communications; Design and implementations; Energy; Memory management; Power; Source code modification; Dynamic random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047135307

A question that is currently for most grids rather theoretical, although interesting in introducing a long-term perspective, pertains to what an energy supply from exclusively renewable energy resources could look like. This question has to be answered individually for each grid. The objective of the present paper is to scrutinize the specific challenges that a 100% renewable energy scenario brings for the Java-Bali grid. This objective is achieved by designing power generation time series such that they match a given load time series. An important challenge for a 100% renewable energy supply is the very high dependency on solar energy, which generates an enormous primary power generation fluctuation on both a daily and an annual timescale. In particular the seasonal fluctuations come along with high storage demand, which is the greatest challenge involved in a 100% renewable energy supply. There are strategies that may be used to considerably reduce the storage demand: the installed photovoltaic (PV) capacity can be increased, bioenergy can be used for seasonal balancing, and special long-term storage can be added. These options are considered in the present paper. © IJTech 2018.","Energy Scenario; Java-Bali grid; Storage; Time series analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046869759

Utility companies desire a solution for electric grid traffic congestion, which will work in synchrony with the industry’s transition towards future integrated distribution systems. This shift in the complexity of the supply side, combined with the unpredictable fluctuations in the demand side gives rise to the electric grid network congestion problem, resulting in unpredictable or planned outage. In recent times, advent of mega size Lithium-Ion batteries has proven to be size and cost efficient to absorb and smoothen out such varying levels of demand on the supply side, thereby addressing the congestion problems effectively. However, the networks are diverse in size and complexity and for a given network, one needs to determine the optimal number and location of such battery storage farms within a network. This report explores how Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to effectively determine the optimal locations of the battery farms in solving the electric grid traffic congestion problem. © 2018, Engineering and Technology Publishing.

The huge MAEs originate from the p-orbital degeneracy around the Fermi level in a symmetry-matched surface ligand field and the lifting of this degeneracy when spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is taken into account. Especially, we developed a simplified quantum mechanical model for the design principles of giant MAEs of supported magnetic adatoms and dimers.

Objective: We investigated the role of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in mediating the beneficial actions of CA on metabolic syndrome. Methods: Male 7-wk-old wild-type (WT) mice and FGF21 knockout (FGF21KO) mice were fed an HFD for 12 wk followed by a 4-wk period in which the mice were fed the HFD alone or supplemented with 0.5% CA. Body composition, gross energy efficiency, glucose tolerance, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and hepatic triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations were measured. Results: CA administration improved glucose tolerance and decreased total body fat accretion, gross energy efficiency, fasting blood glucose concentrations, and HOMA-IR in bothWT mice and FGF21KO mice. The extent of the effect of CA on glucose tolerance, fasting blood glucose concentrations, and HOMA-IR was similar in both mouse strains, whereas the extent of the effect of CA on total body fat accretion and gross energy efficiency was 4.2- to 4.4-fold greater in FGF21KO mice than in WT mice. Further analyses showed that CA decreased hepatic TG concentrations in WT mice (49%) but had no effect on hepatic TG concentrations in FGF21KO mice. CA decreased the activation state of hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and adipose tissue hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in WT mice but was not effective in decreasing the activation of ACC1 and HSL in FGF21KO mice. Conclusions: FGF21 signaling is required for the beneficial effect of CA on hepatic TG accumulation in mice fed an HFD. We propose that FGF21 signaling potentiates the ability of CA to decrease the activation of ACC1 and HSL, key enzymes controlling the supply of long-chain fatty acid precursors for hepatic TG synthesis. © 2018 American Society for Nutrition.

In this paper, the frequency inertia response control of a DFIG system under variable wind speeds was investigated. First, a DFIG system topology with rotor-side supercapacitor energy storage system (SCESS-DFIG) was introduced. Then a control strategy for frequency inertia response of SCESS-DFIG power grid under fluctuating wind speed was designed, with two extended state observers (ESOs) which estimate the mechanical power captured by the DFIG and the required inertia response power at the grid frequency drops, respectively. Based on one inconstant wind speed model and the SCESS-DFIG system model adopting the control strategy established, one power grid system consisting of three SCESS-DFIGs with different wind speed trends and a synchronous generator was simulated. The simulation results verified the effectiveness of the SCESS-DFIG system structure and the control strategy proposed. © 2018 by the authors.","Damp control; Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); Extended state observer (ESO); Frequency inertia response; Supercapacitor","Electric fault currents; Electric generators; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Speed; State estimation; Supercapacitor; Wind effects; Wind power; Doubly fed induction generators; Doubly Fed Induction generators (DFIG); Extended state observer; Fluctuating wind speed; Frequency inertia response; Frequency regulations; Grid-side converter; Supercapacitor energy storages; Asynchronous generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045400183

The launch velocity is limited by the length of the jumping legs and the maximum power that the jump apparatus can provide for pushing against the ground. The effect of air resistance is determined by the insect mass-to-area ratio. Both limitations are highly dependent on body size, making high jumps a challenge for smaller insects. We studied both effects in the tiny Encyrtid wasp Anagyrus pseudococci. Males are smaller than females (mean body length 1.2 and 1.8 mm, respectively), but both sexes take off in a powerful jump. Using highspeed cameras, we analyzed the relationship between take-off kinematics and distance traveled through the air. We show that the velocity, acceleration and mass-specific power when leaving the ground places A. pseudococci among the most prominent jumpers of the insect world. However, the absolute distance moved through the air is modest compared with other jumping insects, as a result of air resistance acting on the small body. A biomechanical model suggests that air resistance reduces the jump distance of these insects by 49% compared with jumping in the absence of air resistance. The effect of air resistance is more pronounced in the smaller males, resulting in a segregation of the jumping performance between sexes. The limiting effect of air resistance is inversely proportional to body mass, seriously constraining jumping as a form of moving through the air in these and other small insects. © 2018 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd | Journal of Experimental Biology.","Ballistics; Drag; Elastic energy storage; Locomotion; Miniaturization; Parasitoids; Power; Sexual dimorphism","air; acceleration; animal; biological model; biomechanics; female; host parasite interaction; locomotion; male; physiology; wasp; Acceleration; Air; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Host-Parasite Interactions; Locomotion; Male; Models, Biological; Wasps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045318711

Here, we report the discovery of pinched, polarization-vs.-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops in the lead-free tungsten bronze ferroelectrics Ba4Sm2Ti4Nb6O30 and Ba4Eu2Ti4Nb6O30, while a broad, single P-E hysteresis loop was observed in the analogue compound Ba4Nd2Ti4Nb6O30. Pinched P-E loops are similar to antiferroelectric hysteresis loops, but in perovskites, they are mostly caused by an extrinsic, internal bias field due to defects, which block domain wall motion. We show that the pinched P-E loops are caused by an intrinsic effect, i.e., by the electric-field-induced phase transition from a non-polar incommensurate to a polar commensurately modulated crystal structure. The in situ electron diffraction results show the coexistence of commensurate polar structural modulation and incommensurate non-polar modulation during the ferroelectric transition and within the ferroelectric phase below the transition temperature. This phase coexistence is the reason for the small remanent polarization. An external electric field transforms the incommensurate component into a commensurate one, and the polarization increases. This new mechanism for pinched P-E hysteresis loops in ferroelectrics not only indicates a new direction for the development of Pb-free ferroelectric materials for energy storage but also significantly contributes to the physical understanding of ferroelectricity in materials with a tungsten bronze structure. © The Author(s) 2018.",,"Barium compounds; Bronze; Crystal structure; Domain walls; Electrooptical effects; Energy storage; Europium compounds; Ferroelectric materials; Ferroelectricity; Hysteresis; Hysteresis loops; Modulation; Niobium compounds; Perovskite; Polarization; Samarium compounds; Tungsten; Anti ferroelectrics; Electric field-induced phase transition; External electric field; Ferroelectric transition; Internal bias field; Situ electron diffractions; Structural modulations; Tungsten bronze structure; Phosphorus compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045112215

However, the optimization of renewable energies integrated CCHP (RECCHP) systems (i.e., optimal component configurations) is far from being well addressed, especially in isolated mode. This study aims to fill this research gap. A multi-objective optimization model characterizing the system reliability, system cost, and environmental sustainability is constructed. In this model, the objectives include minimization of annual total cost (ATC), carbon dioxide emission (CDE), and loss of energy supply probability (LESP). The decision variables representing the configuration of the RECCHP system include the number of photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines (WTs), the tilt angle of PV panels, the height of WTs, the maximum fuel consumption, and the capacity of battery and heat storage tanks (HSTs). The multi-objective model is solved by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, namely, the preference-inspired coevolutionary algorithm (PICEA-g), resulting in a set of Pareto optimal (trade-off) solutions. Then, a decision-making process is demonstrated, selecting a preferred solution amongst those trade-off solutions by further considering the decision-maker preferences. Furthermore, on the optimization of the RECCHP system, operational strategies (i.e., following electric load, FEL, and following thermal load, FTL) are considered, respectively. Experimental results show that the FEL and FTL strategies lead to different optimal configurations. In general, the FTL is recommended in summer and winter, while the FEL is more suitable for spring and autumn. Compared with traditional energy systems, RECCHP has better economic and environmental advantages. © 2018 by the authors.","CCHP; FEL; FTL; Isolated-mode; Multi-objective optimization; Renewable energy","Carbon dioxide; Cooling systems; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Evolutionary algorithms; Free electron lasers; Fuel storage; Global warming; Heat storage; Pareto principle; Photovoltaic cells; Sustainable development; Wind turbines; CCHP; Decision maker preferences; Environmental sustainability; Integration of renewable energies; Isolated modes; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective optimization models; Renewable energies; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044862751

Quantifying the value proposition for individual customers currently requires an optimization model, the development of which can be costly in human and computing resources. We disclose here a simple econometric model to predict revenue from retail peak-shaving. Geared toward electric utilities, third-party storage providers, and consumers, this model eliminates the need to formulate a model in specialized optimization software. The model is based on a predictive metric that is derived from the building's load profile. During model fitting, we discovered that the revenue estimates generated are independent of the power capacity of the battery if the maximum power-to-energy ratio of the storage is held constant.

The characteristics that affect the most energy-efficient bias scheme are demystified. The write energy of a crossbar array is modeled in terms of the array size, number of selected cells, and nonlinearity factor. For a specific array size and selector technology, the number of selected cells during a write operation can affect the choice of bias scheme. The effect of leakage current due to partially biased unselected cells is explored. Furthermore, an energy-efficient write operation based on a hybrid bias scheme is proposed to reduce the write energy.

Many reservoirs have experienced changes in environmental conditions (e.g., climate and sediment yield) and societal conditions (e.g., water/energy demand and ecological flows) since construction. These changes may challenge the potential for reservoirs to meet their operational targets (OTs) (management goals). Historic daily reservoir data and OTs were collected for 233 reservoirs. Analyses were developed to identify when and where reservoirs may be systematically departing from OTs in terms of the frequency and magnitude of departure. Fifty-six percent of reservoirs consistently met operating targets, 30% were borderline, and 13% experienced frequent and large magnitude departures. Fifty-two percent of reservoirs with large departures were due to shortages and were located in the South Pacific and Southwestern divisions.

Among the myriad strategies for TES, thermochemical hydration/dehydration reactions are arguably the most promising due to their high energy densities, simplicity, cost effectiveness, and potential for reversibility at moderate temperatures. The present study uses first-principles calculations to identify TES materials that can out-perform known compounds. High-throughput density functional theory calculations were performed on metal halide hydrates and hydroxides mined from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. In total, 265 hydration reactions were characterized with respect to their thermodynamic properties, gravimetric and volumetric energy densities, and operating temperatures. Promising reactions were identified for three temperature ranges: low (&lt;100 °C), medium (100-300 °C), and high (&gt;300 °C). Several high-energy-density reactions were identified, including the dehydration of CrF3·9H2O, a compound that appears to be unexplored for TES. Correlations linking TES performance with dozens of chemical features for hydrates and hydroxides were quantified using a Pearson correlation matrix. These analyses reveal property-performance relationships involving energy densities and the thermodynamics of hydration. In salt hydrates, the thermodynamics depend strongly on the water capacity of the hydrate. In hydroxides, thermodynamic properties are largely determined by the ionicity of the cation-hydroxide bond, which is in turn influenced by the cation's electronegativity and polarizing power.

The strategy involves retention of charge in the DC bus following a blackout and 'Hot-Swapping' between direct flux control mode and conventional grid-connected mode, which does not require resetting of any controller dynamic states and avoids the need for energy storage. An autonomous synchronisation mechanism enabled by remote synchrophasors is also proposed. A blacked-out system, which includes a wind farm and a voltage source converter (VSC)-HVDC connected to a network unaffected by blackout, is used as the study system. Transmission line charging and load pickup is performed using the wind farm in flux control mode while the VSC-HVDC system conducts the same process for another portion of the system. The proposed 'Hot-Swapping' and autonomous synchronisation approach is applied to connect the two parts of the grid and switch the wind farm to grid connected mode of operation. The results are demonstrated in a hybrid co-simulation platform where the aforementioned system is modelled in EMT-type software and the rest of the network is represented in a phasor framework. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,"Computer software; DC power transmission; Electric fault currents; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; HVDC power transmission; Outages; Phasor measurement units; Restoration; Wind power; Co-simulations; Controller dynamics; Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); Flux control; Grid-connected modes; Innovative systems; Voltage-source converter-hvdc; VSC-HVDC transmission systems; Asynchronous generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044027983

However, due to the intermittency of PV and the particularity of rural residents' power load, the problem of low voltage in the evening peak remains to be resolved. This paper proposes to solve the problem by accessing residential energy storage. Firstly, the influence of access location and capacity of energy storage on voltage distribution in rural distribution network is analyzed. Secondly, the relation between the storage capacity and load capacity is deduced for four typical load and energy storage cases when the voltage deviation meets the demand.

Because of the high energy density of pulsed loads, stable operation of an IPS with multiple types of pulsed loads faces great challenges. This paper proposes an optimal operation planning of IPS with multiple pulsed loads while considering stability constraints. To mitigate the negative effect of pulsed loads, energy storage devices are used to buffer the required energy. The stability constraints are derived from a proposed analytical criterion whose feasibility is guaranteed by fully studied principles. A critical point-based particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the optimal planning problem. The case studies on a typical IPS with multiple pulsed loads verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.","Isolated power systems; multiple pulsed loads; transient stability constraints","Buffer storage; Electric load management; Electric power system planning; Electric power system stability; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Planning; Transient analysis; Uninterruptible power systems; IP networks; Isolated power system; Load modeling; Power system stability; Pulsed load; Transient stability constraints; Stability criteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044845378

A straightforward solution to keep the electricity grid reliable is the connection of large-scale electricity storage to this grid. Current battery storage technologies, while providing promising energy and power densities, suffer from a large environmental footprint, safety issues, and technological challenges. In this paper, the acid base flow battery is re-established as an environmental friendly means of storing electricity using electrolyte consisting of NaCl salt. To achieve a high specific energy, we have performed charge and discharge cycles over the entire pH range (0–14) at several current densities.

The 33-m-diameter Z machine generates a peak electrical power as high as 85 TW, and delivers as much as 25 MA to a physics load. The circuit model is used to design and analyze experiments conducted on Z. The model consists of 36 networks of transmission-line-circuit elements and resistors that represent each of Zs 36 modules. The model of each module includes a Marx generator, intermediate-energy-storage capacitor, laser-triggered gas switch, pulse-forming line, self-break water switches, and tri-plate transmission lines. The circuit model also includes elements that represent Zs water convolute, vacuum insulator stack, four parallel outer magnetically insulated vacuum transmission lines (MITLs), double-post-hole vacuum convolute, inner vacuum MITL, and physics load. Within the vacuum-transmission-line system the model conducts analytic calculations of current loss. To calculate the loss, the model simulates the following processes: (i) electron emission from MITL cathode surfaces wherever an electric-field threshold has been exceeded; (ii) electron loss in the MITLs before magnetic insulation has been established; (iii) flow of electrons emitted by the outer-MITL cathodes after insulation has been established; (iv) closure of MITL anode-cathode (AK) gaps due to expansion of cathode plasma; (v) energy loss to MITL conductors operated at high lineal current densities; (vi) heating of MITL-anode surfaces due to conduction current and deposition of electron kinetic energy; (vii) negative-space-charge-enhanced ion emission from MITL anode surfaces wherever an anode-surface-temperature threshold has been exceeded; and (viii) closure of MITL AK gaps due to expansion of anode plasma. The circuit model is expected to be most accurate when the fractional current loss is small. We have performed circuit simulations of 52 Z experiments conducted with a variety of accelerator configurations and load-impedance time histories. For these experiments, the apparent fractional current loss varies from 0% to 20%. Results of the circuit simulations agree with data acquired on 52 shots to within 2%. © 2018 authors.

Stable dispersions of hydrophilic hGO sheets in water (≈100 mg mL−1) can be readily achieved. The shear-thinning behavior of the aqueous hGO ink enables extrusion-based printing of fine filaments into complex 3D architectures, such as stacked mesh structures, on arbitrary substrates. The freestanding 3D printed hGO meshes exhibit trimodal porosity: nanoscale (4–25 nm through-holes on hGO sheets), microscale (tens of micrometer-sized pores introduced by lyophilization), and macroscale (&lt;500 µm square pores of the mesh design), which are advantageous for high-performance energy storage devices that rely on interfacial reactions to promote full active-site utilization. To elucidate the benefit of (nano)porosity and structurally conscious designs, the additive-free architectures are demonstrated as the first 3D printed lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) cathodes and characterized alongside 3D printed GO-based materials without nanoporosity as well as nanoporous 2D vacuum filtrated films.

For heat storage, the salt is dehydrated with the available heat, and for heat recovery, the salt is rehydrated. There are many salt hydration transitions and for selecting the most suited ones with respect to the envisaged use cases, temperatures of dehydration and rehydration are needed, as well as the heat storage density. Estimation of these properties requires entropy and enthalpy changes of the transitions. Collections of hydration entropies and enthalpies have been published, but not all data seems reliable for various reasons, and it is often hard to access original sources and experimental conditions. For the necessary data validation, we propose the use of Trouton's rule, known to hold for the evaporation of classes of fluids. Besides data validation, Trouton's rule is useful for predicting heat storage densities and vapor pressures when only the transition enthalpy is known. We discuss the validity of Trouton's rule for salt hydration and ammoniation transitions by theoretical and experimental evidence on the available extensive data collections. © 2018 by the authors.","Heat storage; Hygroscopic salts; Salt ammoniates; Salt hydrates; Thermochemical heat storage; Thermochemical materials; Trouton; Trouton's rule",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045749139

The paraffin wax is considered as a PCM, filled in a shell which is thermally isolated with the external environment, while the water plays a role of a HTF and flows inside the tube at the moment of charging and discharging cycle. The heat transfer between HTF and PCM is performed by conduction and forced convection, this transfer allows to change the physical state of PCM solid-liquid to obtain a quantity of storable heat in order to create a thermal battery. Enthalpy formulation is used to analyze the heat transfer during melting and solidification process. A good agreement was found between our numerical predictions and the results of the literature. On the other hand, we have investigated the effect of geometrical parameters (tube length and shell diameter) and Reynolds number on the charging and discharging cycles. The obtained results reveal that the tube length and the shell diameter are the most influential parameters on the time of storage system.

Additional products and by-products of this pathway include nitrite (NO2 –), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), several of which are pollutants. How these species are generated during nitrification is not entirely clear, but pathways toward their generation have drawn substantial research effort. The cumulative evidence shows several parallel biological pathways comprising the net nitrification process. Bacteria were long thought to mediate all nitrification transformations; however, archaeal nitrifiers are now recognized. Furthermore, nitrification was thought to require two distinct microbial classes: NH3 oxidizers to oxidize NH3 to NO2 –, and NO2 – oxidizers that oxidize NO2 – to NO3 –. Comammox bacteria, which effect complete oxidation of NH3 to NO3 –, were recently discovered. This Perspective summarizes the current understanding of nitrification biochemistry and highlights exciting opportunities for future research. Mechanistic details concerning interconversions of simple fixed nitrogen compounds (NHyOx) are essential to sustainable agriculture as well as the storage of energy in species such as ammonia. Control over nitrogen speciation in agricultural contexts is key to ensuring assimilation versus environmental dispersion. One approach could involve more effective inhibitors of nitrification, whose enzymes facilitate production of nitrogen oxyanions with low soil dwell times. However, without understanding the mechanisms used by these enzymes, rational inhibitor design is precluded. A simultaneous benefit of this acquired mechanistic detail are insights key to controlled, reversible cycling of nitrogen-based redox agents in fuel cells. Nitrification comprises oxidative steps of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle that convert NH3 to NO3 –. Appreciable knowledge gaps persist with respect to the mechanisms underlying these transformations. A molecular understanding of the metalloenzymes responsible for these chemically challenging nitrogen transformations and the accompanying energy transduction pathways showcase considerable opportunities in fuel cell technologies, energy storage media, and potent catalysts for synthetic chemists. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","biochemistry; bioinorganic chemistry; electron transfer; heme; nitric oxide; nitritification; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide","Agriculture; Ammonia; Bacteria; Biochemistry; Biogeochemistry; Energy storage; Enzymes; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen; Nitrogen compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Bioinorganic chemistry; Electron transfer; heme; nitritification; Nitrogen cycles; Nitrous oxide; Nitrification; bacterium; biochemistry; enzyme; iron; nitric oxide; nitrification; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; Archaea",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043786008

Two-dimensional (2D) materials, especially graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), are widely accepted as ideal candidates for thermal management materials due to their high intrinsic thermal conductivity and good mechanical flexibility. In this review, we introduce phonon dynamics of solid materials and thermal measurement methods at nanoscale, and highlight the unique thermal properties of 2D materials in relation to sample thickness, domain size, and interfaces. In addition, we discuss recent achievements of thermal management applications in which 2D materials act as heat spreader and thermal interface materials based on their controlled growth and self-assembly. Finally, critical consideration on the challenges and opportunities in thermal management applications of 2D materials is presented. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, especially graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), have attracted great interest in thermal management as they exhibit superior thermal properties, in addition to other unique advantages of being atomically thin and mechanically flexible. Therefore, 2D materials are poised to potentially solve the increasingly severe heat dissipation problems in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Developing 2D material-based thermal interface materials with desired thermal properties has been extensively investigated. In this review, we focus on recent progress of integration of 2D materials into three-dimensional (3D) structures and their use as thermal interface materials as well as heat spreaders. We first present the mechanism of thermal transport in 2D materials and advanced thermal characterization methods. The utilization of 2D materials with various composite forms for building phonon conduits is then reviewed. It is noteworthy that 3D structures constructed by purely 2D materials possess the highest thermal conductivity among all 3D composites. Finally, we summarize the challenges and opportunities, including interfacial engineering, 3D structure construction, and 2D device fabrication, for future research and development of thermal management in electronics. Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer superior heat transfer properties because of their unique phonon behaviors. In this review, we highlight recent progress on the development of phonon dynamics, thermal measurement methods, and thermal management applications of 2D materials with controlled growth and self-assembly.

With the large-scale wind power grid-connected operation, the contradiction between wind power utilization and peak load regulation of power grid has been more prominent. To this point, starting with the power structure and power grid installation situation of Liaoning power grid, the distribution and the space-time output characteristics of wind farm, the prediction accuracy, the curtailment and the off-grid situation of wind power are analyzed.

Finding out how to make an alternative energy-efficient scheduling solution when renewable and non-renewable energy drives production is of great importance. In this paper, a multi-objective flexible flow shop scheduling problem that considers variable processing time due to renewable energy (MFFSP-VPTRE) is studied. First, the optimization model of the MFFSP-VPTRE is formulated considering the periodicity of renewable energy and the limitations of energy storage capacity. Then, a hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with variable local search (HNSGA-II) is proposed to solve the MFFSP-VPTRE. An operation and machine-based encoding method is employed. A low-carbon scheduling algorithm is presented. Besides the crossover and mutation, a variable local search is used to improve the offspring's Pareto set. The offspring and the parents are combined and those that dominate more are selected to continue evolving. Finally, two groups of experiments are carried out. The results show that the low-carbon scheduling algorithm can effectively reduce the carbon footprint under the premise of makespan optimization and the HNSGA-II outperforms the traditional NSGA-II and can solve the MFFSP-VPTRE effectively and efficiently. © 2018 by the authors.","Flexible flow shop scheduling problem; Low-carbon scheduling; Renewable energy; Variable local search; Variable processing time","alternative energy; building; carbon footprint; efficiency measurement; energy efficiency; energy storage; experimental study; genetic algorithm; manufacturing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043976870

Developing unique nanostructures of active components (e.g., metal oxides) and carbon materials is essential for their application in next generation electrode materials for fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Herein, a general approach for the production of 1D porous nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon fibers embedded with active ORR components, (M/MOx, i.e., metal or metal oxide nanoparticles) using a facile two-step electrospinning and annealing process is reported. Metal nanoparticles/nanoclusters nucleate within the polymer nanofibers and subsequently catalyze graphitization of the surrounding polymer matrix and following oxidation, create an interconnected graphite–metal oxide framework with large pore channels, considerable active sites, and high specific surface area. The metal/metal oxide@N-doped graphitic carbon fibers, especially Co3O4, exhibit comparable ORR catalytic activity but superior stability and methanol tolerance versus Pt in alkaline solutions, which can be ascribed to the synergistic chemical coupling effects between Co3O4 and robust 1D porous structures composed of interconnected N-doped graphitic nanocarbon rings.

During charging, electrons are stored in a concentrated water solution of 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone, which rapidly receives electrons with inexpensive carbon electrodes without the assistance of any metal electrocatalyst. Electrons are withdrawn from a second water solution of a food additive, potassium ferrocyanide. When these two solutions flow along opposite sides of a cation-conducting membrane, this flow battery delivers a cell potential of 1.21 V, a peak galvanic power density of 300 mW cm−2, and a coulombic efficiency exceeding 99%. Continuous cell cycling at 100 mA cm−2 shows a capacity retention rate of 99.76% cycle−1 over 150 cycles. Various molecular modifications involving substitution for hydrogens on the aryl ring are implemented to block decomposition by nucleophilic attack of hydroxide ions. These modifications result in increased capacity retention rates of up to 99.96% cycle−1 over 400 consecutive cycles, accompanied by changes in voltage, solubility, kinetics, and cell resistance. Quantum chemistry calculations of a large number of organic compounds predict a number of related structures that should have even higher performance and stability.

In the ever-changing environment of cells, lipids, like other cellular components, are regularly recycled to uphold the housekeeping processes required for cell survival and organism longevity. The ways in which lipids are recycled, however, vary between different phyla. For example, animals and plants have evolved distinct lipid degradation pathways. The major cell recycling system, autophagy, has been shown to be instrumental for both differentiation of specialized fat storing-cells, adipocytes, and fat degradation in animals. Does plant autophagy play a similar role in storage and degradation of lipids?

This article will briefly analyze the current global warming problem and propose a method that we apply algae cultivation to absorb carbon and use shellfish to sequestrate it. Despite the importance of decreasing CO2 emissions or developing carbon-free energy sources, carbon sequestration should be a key issue, since the amount of carbon dioxide that already exists in the atmosphere is great enough to cause global warming. Algae cultivation would be a good choice because they have high metabolism rates and provides shellfish with abundant food that contains carbon. Shellfish's shells, which are difficult to be decomposed, are reliable storage of carbon, compared to dead organisms like trees and algae. The amount of carbon that can be sequestrated by shellfish is considerable. However, the sequestrating rate of algae and shellfish is not high enough to affect the global climate. Research on algae and shellfish cultivation, including gene technology that aims to create ""super plants"" and ""super shellfish"", is decisive to the solution. Perhaps the baton of history will shift to gene technology, from nuclear physics that has lost appropriate international environment after the end of the Cold War.

Vitamin B12, vitamin D3, protein were analyzed using spectrophotometric, fat using babcock method, total lactic acid bacteria using total plate count, pH with pH meter, and viscosity using ostwald method. During 15 days in refrigerated storage, there was no significant difference (p&gt;0,05) of vitamin B12 concentration, protein, fat, and viscosity of kefir. Storage time of the final product caused the decrease of vitamin D3 concentration between day 9 and 15 (p=0,038), pH (p=0,023), and total lactic acid of kefir (p=0,0001). Total lactic acid bacteria increased until 9 days of storage (6161 ± 1.296x107cfu / ml), but decreased to 24% on day 15 (150 ±7.78x107cfu/ml). pH kefir tends to fluctuate during storage with the highest pH value of 4,38 on day-3, and lowest 4.13 on day-9. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","fortification; goat milk; kefir; storage; vitamin B12 and vitamin D3","Bacteria; Coastal zones; Energy storage; Lactic acid; Microbiology; Nutrition; Proteins; Viscosity; Completely randomized designs; fortification; Goat milks; kefir; Lactic acid bacteria; Nutritional qualities; Refrigerated storages; Vitamin D3; Dairy products",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043694426

This review surveys the recent development of several types of in situ and in operando microscopy and their utilization in studying batteries. The article is organized mainly by the in situ and in operando techniques used (X-ray microscopy, electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, etc.) rather than the chemical reactions that govern battery behavior. We compare different methodologies to illustrate their advantages and disadvantages in the study of different systems and problems and, at the end of the article, discuss generalized principles for the selection of methodologies and possible future directions. The demand for high-performance energy storage systems has increased dramatically over the past few decades, leading to a paradigm shift from traditional fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources. As energy storage components for electric vehicles and mobile electronic devices, batteries have been a well-studied interdisciplinary topic across chemistry, material science, and engineering. Monitoring the phenomena inside batteries—e.g., volume and pressure changes, side reactions, temperature effects, and material transport during the operation process—with powerful tools and methodologies allows for rapid advances in battery design and paves the way for battery optimization. This article reviews the recent applications (mostly from 2015 to 2017) of in situ and in operando microscopy in battery-related studies and gives insights on possible future directions. Using different microscopy techniques to probe the processes inside batteries during operation allows researchers to gather real-time information and have a comprehensive understanding of the phenomena and reactions, promoting battery performance to a higher level.

However, to date, only limited reversible Al-S chemistry has been demonstrated. This paper demonstrates a highly reversible room-temperature Al-S battery with a lithium-ion (Li+-ion)-mediated ionic liquid electrolyte. Mechanistic studies with electrochemical and spectroscopic methodologies revealed that the enhancement in reversibility by Li+-ion mediation is attributed to the chemical reactivation of aluminum polysulfides and/or sulfide by Li+ during electrochemical cycling. The results obtained with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations suggest the presence of a Li3AlS3-like product with a mixture of Li2S- and Al2S3-like phases in the discharged sulfur cathode. With Li+-ion mediation, the cycle life of room-temperature Al-S batteries is greatly improved. The cell delivers an initial capacity of ∼1,000 mA hr g−1 and maintains a capacity of up to 600 mA hr g−1 after 50 cycles. Batteries represent an indispensable technology for electrifying the transportation sector and for storing electricity produced from renewable sources. Ambient-temperature non-aqueous sulfur battery chemistries are becoming increasingly appealing for these applications. Although lithium-sulfur batteries have been extensively investigated in recent years, aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) chemistry is more attractive from an economical, sustainability, and safety point of view. However, because of a lack of effective electrolytes, only limited reversibility has been realized so far with Al-S chemistry. This paper presents a lithium-ion mediation strategy for enhancing the reversibility of Al-S chemistry at ambient temperatures. A lithium-ion-mediated ionic liquid electrolyte remarkably improves the electrochemical performance of Al-S batteries. Based on a series of experimental and computational simulation analyses, the relevant mechanisms are presented. Manthiram and colleagues have validated a Li+-ion mediation approach to enhance the electrochemical reversibility of ambient-temperature aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) battery chemistry. They systematically investigated the relevant mechanisms with combined experimental and theoretical methodologies.

The processor may stall for a considerable interval while waiting to access the data stored in the cache blocks in LLC, if there are no independent instructions to execute. To provide accelerated service to the critical loads requests from LLC, this paper concentrates on leveraging the additional capacity offered by replacing SRAM-based L2 with spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-MRAM) to accommodate frequently accessed cache blocks in exclusive read mode in favor of reducing the overall read service time. Our proposed technique improves the temporal locality while preventing cache thrashing via sufficient accommodation of the frequently read reused fraction of working set that may exhibit distant re-reference interval in L2. Our experimental results show that the proposed technique can reduce the L2 read miss ratio by 51.7% on average compared to conventional STT-MRAM L2 design across PARSEC and SPEC2006 workloads while significantly decreasing the L2 dynamic energy consumption. © 2013 IEEE.","critical loads; energy overhead reduction; last level cache; Non-volatile memory; read service time; STT-MRAM retention relaxation","Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; MRAM devices; Random access storage; Static random access storage; Critical load; Energy overheads; Last-level caches; Non-volatile memory; Service time; STT-MRAM; Cache memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043367738

At the downstream phase, State - owned Electricity Company (PLN) through PT. Dizamatra Powerindo is the developer. The gross capacity of the power plant is 13.3 MW, consisting 1 unit of Monoblock (2 MW) developed by PGE and 2 units (2×5.65 MW) operated through Energy Sales Contract by PLN. During the development phase of a geothermal power plant, there is a chance to reduce the utility power in order to increase the overall plant efficiency. Reducing the utility power can be attempted by utilizing the wet bulb temperature fluctuation. In this study, a modeling process is developed by using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software version 9.430. The possibility of energy saving is indicated by condenser pressure changes as a result of wet bulb temperature fluctuation. The result of this study indicates that the change of condenser pressure is about 50.8% on the constant liquid/gas (L/G) condition of the wet bulb temperature of 15°C to 25°C. Further result indicates that in this power plant, Cooling Tower Fan (CTF) is the facility that has the greatest utility load, followed by Hot Well Pump (HWP). The saving of the greatest utility load is applied trough Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) instrumentation. The result of this modeling has been validated by actual operations data (log sheet). The developed model has also been reviewed trough Specific Steam Consumption (SSC), resulting that constant L/G condition allows the optimum condition on of the wet bulb temperature of 15°C to 25°C. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Short rectangular reservoirs reveal a straight jet from inlet to outlet with identical recirculation zones on both sides. In longer reservoirs, the main jet reattaches to the side of the reservoir leading to small and large recirculation zones. Previous studies have found an empirical geometric relation describing the switch between these two flow patterns. In this study, we demonstrate, with a simple analytical model, that this switch coincides with a maximization of energy dissipation in the shear layer between the main jet and recirculation zones: short reservoirs dissipate more energy when the flow pattern is symmetric, while longer reservoirs dissipate more energy with an asymmetric pattern. This approach enables the prediction of the flow patterns without detailed knowledge of small scale processes, potentially useful in the early phase of reservoir design. © 2017 The Author(s).

The Cloud computing enables customers to outsource the large and complex tasks to the cloud data centers for the execution and result generations. Cloud data centers host the incoming tasks by providing resources, such as CPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth. As the large data centers provide the basic resources to hosted tasks, they also consume a huge amount of energy, which leads to higher operating cost and CO2 traces. Therefore, research community felt the need to provide energy-efficient solutions that reduce the impact of the aforementioned issues. Consequently, researchers proposed many solutions, and majority of them are based upon the concept of consolidation. Consolidation techniques place the incoming tasks on minimum possible servers, thus increasing the resource utilization and decreasing energy consumption. In this paper, we use the same workload consolidation concept and present two techniques that reduce energy consumption while ensuring the negotiated quality-of-service. Moreover, we enhanced two existing techniques by improving the energy efficiency and introducing service level agreement (SLA) awareness to minimize the overall SLA violations. Performance evaluation of the proposed techniques is done based on fluctuating workloads, and results show that our techniques outperform existing techniques in terms of energy efficiency, SLA compliance, and performance assurance at the network level. Moreover, correctness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated by modeling and verifying them with the help of high-level Petri Nets, SMT-Lib, and Z3 solver. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud computing; energy efficiency; resource allocation; resource management; SLA awareness","Cloud computing; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Green computing; Natural resources management; Petri nets; Quality of service; Random access storage; Resource allocation; Consolidation techniques; Performance assurances; Performance evaluations; Reduce energy consumption; Resource management; Service Level Agreement (SLA); SLA Awareness; Workload consolidation; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042881802

Understanding the fundamental electrode degradation mechanisms is important for battery performance improvements. The complex electrochemical processes inside a working battery are being explored to a limited extent. Various advanced material characterization techniques have been used to monitor dynamic conditions for optimizing battery materials. State-of-the-art atomic force microscopy methods have been applied to energy storage systems, specifically lithium-ion batteries. Atomic force microscopy is an ideal tool to provide localized morphological, chemical, and physical information at nanoscale for the in-depth understanding of the electrochemical processes, reaction mechanisms, and degradation of battery materials. Here, we review recent progress in the development and application of atomic force microscopy for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.

However, sensor nodes have limited energy in their primary power storage unit, and this energy may be quickly drained if the sensor node remains operational over long periods of time. Therefore, the idea of harvesting ambient energy from the immediate surroundings of the deployed sensors, to recharge the batteries and to directly power the sensor nodes, has recently been proposed. The deployment of energy harvesting in environmental field systems eliminates the dependency of sensor nodes on battery power, drastically reducing the maintenance costs required to replace batteries. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art in energy-harvesting WSNs for environmental monitoring applications, including Animal Tracking, Air Quality Monitoring, Water Quality Monitoring, and Disaster Monitoring to improve the ecosystem and human life. In addition to presenting the technologies for harvesting energy from ambient sources and the protocols that can take advantage of the harvested energy, we present challenges that must be addressed to further advance energy-harvesting-based WSNs, along with some future work directions to address these challenges. © 2018 ACM.","Energy harvesting; Energy scavenging; Self-powered devices; Wireless sensor networks","Air quality; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Energy harvesting; Water quality; Wireless sensor networks; Air quality monitoring; Energy scavenging; Environmental fields; Environmental Monitoring; Harvesting energies; Self-powered; Water quality monitoring; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052696239

Among those, chemical treatments for the production of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) dictate the current technologies for mass production of graphene powder. However, such conventional chemical reduction methods are rather ineffective in removing oxygen-containing functional groups from graphene oxide (GO), with resultant RGO products containing high level of structural defects. This leads to significantly damaged crystallinity and drastically lowered electric and thermal conductivity, which is probably the main bottleneck to limit the performance of RGO-based materials. Great efforts such as thermal reduction, microwave-irradiation reduction, or other novel reduction methods (e.g., photoreduction) have been developed to repair defects in RGO materials. This perspective review is to outline the latest advances toward effective reduction of GO for significantly enhanced properties. We demonstrate that effectively repaired RGO with large specific surface area and highly improved crystallinity is key to highly improved electric and thermal conductivity, thus leading to significantly enhanced properties essential for chemical energy storage devices. © 2018 Zhengzhou University","chemical energy storage; defects in graphene; graphene; graphene oxide; reduction of graphene oxide","Chemical vapor deposition; Crystallinity; Energy storage; Exfoliation (materials science); Graphene oxide; Microwave irradiation; Repair; Thermal conductivity; Chemical reduction methods; Chemical treatments; Current technology; Electrochemical energy storage; Enhanced properties; Large specific surface areas; Oxygen-containing functional groups; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Reduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050882497

Sharing a large capacity battery across a group of homes in a community can not only alleviate the economic deterrents but also exploit the fact that users' activity patterns do not necessarily overlap. However, battery sharing induces competition for battery capacity between the users in general as they may want to maximize their own cost savings by occupying more battery capacity when the electricity price is low. Importantly, users might have privacy concerns when they communicate with the shared battery controller. The privacy aware management of such a shared battery is the focus of this paper. A game theoretical framework is proposed to capture the competitive behaviors of users sending messages through a communication network to an independent battery controller with an infinite horizon limiting average signaling game formulation. The privacy requirement serves as a constraint on messaging behaviors. The battery controller manages the charging and discharging based on the received, albeit incomplete, information transmission. With such a framework, we study the battery sharing when users are cooperative and completely private. When the privacy requirement is relaxed, the competitive behaviors of users sending messages to the battery controller is studied. A credit-based battery management strategy is designed for the battery controller to ensure an equilibrium of the game and achieves the social optimality. However, the credit-based battery management requires long time established observations and may also 'coerce' users to share their energy demands accurately with the controller. We, therefore, propose a class of stationary suboptimal privacy preserving battery management strategy in which the message set being restricted to be completely private or partially private. In addition, we demonstrate that by changing the size of the message set, different pairs of preserved privacy and cost savings can be achieved. Through numerical simulations on real electricity pricing and usage data, we demonstrate the cost effectiveness of battery capacity sharing and the tradeoff between privacy and cost mitigation. © 2015 IEEE.","Demand response; energy management; non-stationary strategy; smart grids; stochastic game; storage sharing","Controllers; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Data privacy; Deregulation; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric load management; Energy management; Game theory; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Smart power grids; Solar cells; Stochastic systems; Demand response; Games; Nonstationary; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; Stochastic game; Storage sharing; Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049534103

These negative power flows alter the traditional radiative pattern of power distribution and cause operational safety problems such as overvoltage and massive transmission losses. Exploiting the reverse flow within certain areas as well as the different outwarding power characteristics of different substations with the aim of ensuring power supply quality would reduce the need to install energy storage systems. Here, a grid partitioning method is proposed that considers the complementary characteristics as well as electrical distances of different substations. A planning model is proposed considering the potential profitability of installing renewable power generation and clustering outwarding power and transmission losses. The uncertainty of renewable power generation and load is considered using worst-case scenarios to form a robust optimization model. The effectiveness of cluster planning is confirmed, and the robustness of the planning schemes is evaluated by applying the proposed model to a real-world 35-110 KV distribution network in Anhui Province, China. © 2018 Author(s).",,"Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Electric power systems; Optimization; Wave transmission; Cluster partitioning; Complementary characteristics; Energy storage systems; Large-scale distribution; Power characteristic; Power supply quality; Renewable power generation; Robust optimization models; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045943779

The coaxial-output RSPFL consists of a coaxial-output electrode (COE) and a rolled strip line (RSL). The COE is characterized by quasi-coaxial structure, making the output pulse propagate along the axial direction with a small output inductance. The RSL is rolled on the COE, whose transmission characteristics are analyzed theoretically. It shows that the RSL can be regarded as a planar strip line when the rolling radius of the strip line is larger than 60 times of the thickness of the insulation dielectric layer of RSL. CST modeling was carried out to simulate the discharging characteristic of the coaxial-output RSPFL. It shows that the coaxial-output RSPFL can deliver a discharging pulse with a rise time <6 ns when the impedance of the RSL matches that of the COE, which confirms the theoretical analysis. A prototype of the coaxial-output RSPFL was developed. A 49-kV discharging pulse on a matched load was achieved when it was charged to 100 kV. The discharging waveform has a pulse width of 32 ns, with a rise time of 6 ns, which is consistent with the simulation waveform. An energy-storage density of 1.9 J/L was realized in the coaxial-output RSPFL. By the method of multi-stage connection in series, a much higher output voltage is convenient to be obtained. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2018.","Coaxial output; multi-layer films; pulse-forming line; rolled strip line","Condensed matter physics; Molecular physics; Particle accelerators; Co-axial structures; Coaxial output; Discharging characteristics; Energy storage density; Higher output voltages; Pulse forming lines; Rolled strips; Transmission characteristics; Strip telecommunication lines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045854265

It represents the best solution for the most complex problems facing the world in the last decades. These problems are known as the shortage of energy, or lack of electricity, which logically are the results of the continuous increasing demand. Therefore, the researchers do their best to overcome all expected roadblocks facing the development, where the most applicable solutions to solve these problems are introduced. In this paper, the HPGS includes; wind turbine (WT), photovoltaic (PV), storage battery (SB), gas turbine (GT), and utility grid (UG). The GT of this system is fueled directly from the natural gas distribution network considering all operational conditions of it, which may be affected by fueling the natural gas for the GT. So, the natural gas distribution network is becoming an important component of the HPGS, and it is included in the HPGS for the first time.

The conclusions are drawn as follows: (1) The peak of carbon emission in China's power sector will range from 4.0 GtCO2 to 4.8 GtCO2, which implies an increment of 0.5–1.3 billion or 14%–35% from the 2015 levels. (2) Introducing carbon price is an effective way to inhibit coal power and promote non-fossil fuels and Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage applications (CCUS). The carbon emission reduction effects will gradually increase with carbon price. When the carbon price attains to CN¥150 t−1CO2, the CO2 emission can decrease by 36% than that without carbon price. (3) CCUS is one of important contributing factor to reduce CO2 emission in power sector. Generally speaking, the development of non-fossil fuels and energy efficiency improvement are two main drivers for carbon mitigation, but once the carbon price reaches up to CN¥106 t−1CO2, the CCUS will be required to equip with thermal power units and its contribution on carbon emission reduction will remarkably increase. When carbon price increases to CN¥150 t−1CO2 in 2050, the application of CCUS will account for 44% of total emission reduction. (4) In the scenario with carbon price of CN¥150 t−1CO2, power sector would be decarbonized significantly, and the CO2 intensity will be 0.22 kgCO2 (kW h)−1, but power sector is far from the goal that achieving net zero emission. In order to realize the long-term low greenhouse gas emission development goal that proposed by the Paris Agreement, more efforts are needed to be put to further reduce the carbon emission reduction of power sector. Based on the above scenario analysis, the study proposes four recommendations on the low-carbon development of China's power sector: (1) improve the energy efficiency proactively and optimize the energy structure of power sector gradually; (2) promote the low-carbon transition of power sector by using market-based mechanism like carbon emission trading scheme to internalize the external cost of carbon emission; (3) give more emphasis on and support to the CCUS application in power sector. © 2018 National Climate Center (China Meteorological Administration)","Carbon peak; Carbon pricing; Policy recommendations; Power sector; Scenario analysis; TIMES model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045364697

Typically, the drying of biotherapeutics is accomplished through freeze-drying, however, the removal of water by lyophilization possesses several drawbacks, including lengthy drying times, low energy efficiency, and the high cost of purchasing and maintaining the equipment. Furthermore, freeze-drying is a batch process which may be challenging to adapt and implement with the recent push for continuous manufacturing. These limitations have led to the search for next-generation drying technologies that can be applied to the manufacture of biotherapeutic products. Several alternative drying methods to freeze-drying have been developed and implemented in industries outside of pharmaceuticals, such as food and agriculture, and some are at an advanced state.

To this end, after deriving the mathematical model of a radial 4-degree-of-freedom rotor–bearing system, a novel cross-feedback-based modal decoupling controller is designed for vibration suppression caused by gyroscopic coupling, parameter coupling, and imbalance force.

However, the existence of switching nonlinearity and control delay can cause serious stability problem to the DAB converters. Thus, this paper, studies the stability of a digitally controlled DAB converter with an output voltage closed loop controller. Firstly, to accurately study the stability in a DAB converter, a discrete-time model established in a whole switching period is obtained. The model considers the output capacitor ESR, the digital control delay, and sample-and-hold process. By using this model, the stabilities of the DAB converter versus the proportional controller parameter and the output capacitor ESR are analyzed and the critical values are predicted accurately. Moreover, the stability boundary of the proportional controller parameter and the output capacitor ESR is also obtained. The result shows that the value of the output capacitor ESR can have a great effect on the stability region of the proportional controller parameter. Finally, the theoretical analyses are verified by the simulation and experimental results. © 2017, The Author(s).","Discrete time modeling; Dual active bridge (DAB); Dynamics; Stability analysis","Digital control systems; Dynamics; Power converters; Stability; Closed loop controllers; Digital control delays; Discrete-time model; Distributed power systems; Dual active bridge converter; Dual active bridges; Proportional controller; Stability analysis; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044165012

It can be seen in a variety of fields such as carbon geo-sequestration, unconventional gas development, enhanced oil recovery, geothermal energy extraction, and energy geological storage systems. In CO2 geosequestion, limited degree of thermal fracturing due to the cooling effects of cold CO2 injection will enhance well injectivity, especially for those storage formations of low permeability. Thermal fracturing can therefore potentially enhance the injection efficiency and make positive impact on commercialization of CO2 geological storage. However, excessively developed fractures could break down the caprock and cause potential CO2 leakage into overlying rock formations. Risk analysis has to be done based on thermal fracturing simulation in order to maintain caprock integrity. Simulation of thermal fracturing during cold CO2 injection involves the coupled processes of heat transfer, mass transport, rock deforming as well as fracture propagation. To model such a complex coupled system, a fully coupled finite element framework for thermal fracturing simulation is presented. This framework is based on the theory of non-isothermal multiphase flow in fracturing porous media. It takes advantage of recent advances in stabilized finite element and extended finite element methods. The stabilized finite element method overcomes the numerical instability encountered when the traditional finite element method is used to solve the convection dominated heat transfer equation, while the extended finite element method overcomes the limitation with traditional finite element method that a model has to be remeshed when a fracture is initiated or propagating and fracturing paths have to be aligned with element boundaries. © 2017 Southwest Petroleum University","Cold CO2 injection; Coupled processes; Petroleum geomechanics; Poromechanics; Thermal fracturing; Thermoporoelasticity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044152682

Especially the accurate detection of liquid level of LNG tanks is regarded as an important issue to ensure a safe and stable operation of LNG-fueled ships and a key parameter to keep the proper functioning of marine fuel storage system, supply system and safety control system. At present, detection of LNG tank liquid level mainly adopts differential pressure detection method. Liquid level condition could be found from the liquid level reference tables. However in practice, since LNG-fueled vessels are generally not in a stationary state, liquid state within the LNG tanks will constantly change, the detection of storage of tanks only by reference to the tables will cause deviation to some extent. By analyzing the temperature under different pressure, the effects of temperature change on density and volume integration calculation, a method of calculating the liquid level and storage of LNG tanks is put forward making the calculation of liquid level and actual storage of LNG tanks more accurately and providing a more reliable basis for the calculation of energy consumption level and operation economy for LNG-fueled vessels. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Accident prevention; Energy utilization; Environmental engineering; Fuel tanks; Liquids; Natural gas transportation; Safety engineering; Tanks (containers); Temperature; Different pressures; Differential pressures; Effects of temperature; Energy consumption levels; Safety control systems; Safety operations; Volume integrations; Waterborne transport; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043706959

These wastes offer significant benefits in terms of revenue from tipping fees and feedstock for co-digestion in anaerobic digesters that produce biogas, which can be beneficially used as fuel. The number of treatment plants receiving and beneficially using trucked-in wastes currently in operation or under investigation is increasing rapidly across the North America as utilities strive to remove this material from normal wastewater to avoid sewer system clogging, maintenance and backups, avoid the oxygen demand of these wastes in secondary treatment systems, and to capture and beneficially reuse the energy that is contained within the material. Historically, trucked-in wastes have been discharged to the head end of treatment plants or to an upstream manhole in the incoming interceptor sewer to enable the material to be mixed with raw wastewater prior to treatment through the liquid stream of the WRRF. However, this approach results in loss of material and degradation of the energy value of the FOG wastes and HSW and also creates collection and maintenance issues in the preliminary and primary treatment systems. To prevent degradation of the material and retain maximum energy for the CHP system, receiving stations are being constructed for direct off-loading of the wastes to processing and storage facilities prior to their transfer to anaerobic digesters at a relatively uniform rate to minimize the potential for digester upsets while at the same time to increase biogas production.

Task caching refers to the caching of completed task application and their related data in edge cloud. Then, we investigate the problem of joint optimization of task caching and offloading on edge cloud with the computing and storage resource constraint. We formulate this problem as mixed integer programming which is hard to solve.

It is widely used in various energy storage systems, such as electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, uninterruptible power supply and grid-scale energy storage system of electricity generated by renewable energy. Lead acid battery which operates under high rate partial state of charge will lead to the sulfation of negative electrode. Lead carbon battery, prepared by adding carbon material to the negative electrode of lead acid battery, inhibits the sulfation problem of the negative electrode effectively, which makes the problem of positive electrode become more prominent. As a result, more and more researchers are working on ways to improve the performance of the positive electrode, such as adding additives to positive active material. In this paper, the positive additives are divided into conductive additive, porous additive and nucleating additive from two aspects: the chemical properties of the additives and the effect on the performance of the lead-acid battery.

This study analyzed the structural characteristics of Dalian's street trees and estimated the monetary value of structural and functional benefits by i-Tree Streets. Dalian's street trees encompassed 28 species and were dominated by Ginkgo biloba, Platanus acerifolia and Sophora japonica, comprising 64.1% of a total of 57,699 trees. The age structure of street trees was distributed somewhat unevenly, with 18% young trees, 56% maturing trees, 25% mature trees and 1% old trees. These trees provide annual functional benefits valued at US$4.9 million and delivered a benefit-cost ratio of 3.2:1. The largest values associated with energy savings and property value were $1.7 million ($29/tree) and $1.5 million ($25/tree), respectively. The net carbon reduction benefits were valued at $935,205 ($16/tree). Smaller benefits resulted from air quality improvement ($381,088 or $7/tree) and stormwater runoff($459,457 or $8/tree). The structural benefits were valued at $130 million, with the value of $4.5 million for carbon storage. These findings suggested that the benefits produced by street trees were worth the management costs.

However, erasure codes often suffer from a time-consuming coding process which makes them nearly impractical. The opportunity to solve this problem probably rely on the parallelization of erasure-code-based application on the modern multi- /many-core processors to fully take advantage of the adequate hardware resources on those platforms. However, the complicated data allocation and limited I/O throughput pose a great challenge on the parallelization. To address this challenge, we propose a general multi-threaded parallel coding approach in this work. The approach consists of a general multi-threaded parallel coding model named as MTPerasure, and two detailed parallel coding algorithms, named as sdaParallel and ddaParallel, respectively, adapting to different I/O circumstances. MTPerasure is a general parallel coding model focusing on the high level data allocation, and it is applicable for all erasure codes and can be implemented without any modifications of the low level coding algorithms. The sdaParallel divides the data into several parts and the data parts are allocated to different threads statically in order to eliminate synchronization latency among multiple threads, which improves the parallel coding performance under the dummy I/O mode. The ddaParallel employs two threads to execute the I/O reading and writing on the basis of small pieces independently, which increases the I/O throughput. Furthermore, the data pieces are assigned to the coding thread dynamically. A special thread scheduling algorithm is also proposed to reduce thread migration latency. To evaluate our proposal, we parallelize the popular open source library jerasure based on our approach. And a detailed performance comparison with the original sequential coding program indicates that the proposed parallel approach outperforms the original sequential program by an extraordinary speedups from 1.4x up to 7x, and achieves better utilization of the computation and I/O resources. © 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Data allocation; Erasure codes; Multiple threads; Parallelism; Performance evaluation; Storage; Thread affinity","Digital storage; Energy storage; Forward error correction; Multiprocessing systems; Scheduling algorithms; Data allocation; Erasure codes; Multiple threads; Parallelism; Performance evaluations; Thread affinity; Codes (symbols)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042642237

Donor milk has to meet the highest safety standards, but its processing and storage is expensive. The recommended storage time of pasteurized donor milk is 3 months. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the frozen storage time of pasteurized donor milk can be extended beyond 3 months without compromising its safety and quality. Methods: For this prospective observational study breast milk samples of 34 unique women, collected between November 2014 and June 2015, were provided by the Dutch Human Milk Bank. Samples were Holder pasteurized within 3 months after expression and stored at -20°C. Analysis of both bacterial growth (by inoculation of milk on a blood and a cysteine-, lactose-, and electrolyte-deficient agar) and fat, crude protein, carbohydrate and energy content of milk (analyzed by infrared spectroscopy) was done monthly during the first 6 months and every 2 months thereafter, up to 1 year postpasteurization. Results: Thirty of 306 (9.8%) follow-up samples showed bacterial growth when cultured. None of the samples showed sequential contamination with the same strain up to 8 months of frozen storage. No significant decreases in macronutrients and energy content were observed over 8 months. Conclusion: Pasteurized human donor milk can be stored safely for 8 months at -20°C, without compromising its macronutrient and energy content. This longer storage time will reduce disposal of expired donor milk and subsequently reduce costs. © Copyright 2017 by European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.","breast milk; macronutrients; microbial; milk bank; preterm","Article; bacterial growth; breast milk; breast milk expression; donor milk; female; follow up; food analysis; food safety; freezing; human; infant feeding; macronutrient; milk bank; observational study; pasteurization; prematurity; priority journal; prospective study; sample; adult; chemistry; cryopreservation; microbiology; milk bank; procedures; time factor; Adult; Cryopreservation; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Milk Banks; Milk, Human; Pasteurization; Prospective Studies; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042453800

Now the service lives of sensors are limited mainly because of their battery power storage. So the life cycle of the whole network can be extended if the service life of each sensor in the network is prolonged. In this paper, the Strip Clustering Scheme (SCS) is proposed to replace the Conventional Scheme (CS). This method includes region division, cluster head node selection, link construction, data fusion and transmission. Adopting SCS can reduce a lot of redundant data and the total energy consumption of the network by data fusion. In addition, adopting SCS can also extend the monitoring area without increasing the communication range of the Access Point (AP), and facilitate further expansion of the network as a result. Based on the numerically simulated results, CS method can be used for the WSN within 75 m, and SCS method is more suitable when the monitoring range is larger than 75 m.

The pronounced impact of a thin oxide coating on the dispersion of metal NPs on a carbon substrate is presented. Al2O3-supported Pt NPs are compared to the direct synthesis of Pt NPs on bare carbon surfaces. Pt NPs with an average size of about 2 nm and a size distribution ranging between 0.5 nm and 4.0 nm are synthesized on the Al2O3 coated carbon nanofiber, a significant improvement compared to those directly synthesized on a bare carbon surface. First-principles modeling verifies the stronger adsorption of Pt clusters on Al2O3 than on carbon, which attributes the formation of ultrafine Pt NPs.

We adopt a ‘global’ approach consistent with focus on the first law of thermodynamics – namely that the metabolic energy provided by dietary foodstuffs has only three possible fates: the performance of work (be it microscopic or macroscopic), the generation of heat, or storage – primarily in the form of adipose tissue. Quantification of the energy expended, in the form of fat metabolised, during selected endurance events, reveals the inherent limitation of over-reliance on exercise as a primary agent of weight loss. This result prompts examination of various (non-exercise based) possibilities of increasing the rate of heat loss. Since these, too, give little cause for optimism, we are obliged to conclude that obesity can be prevented, or weight loss achieved, only if exercise is supplemented by reduction of food intake. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","ATP; caloric intake; exercise; heat; weight loss; work","absorption; adipose tissue; body weight loss; enthalpy; exercise; food intake; heat loss; human; obesity; Review; thermodynamics; upper gastrointestinal tract; animal; digestion; gastrointestinal tract; metabolism; obesity; physiology; Animals; Digestion; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Obesity; Thermodynamics; Weight Loss",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041706934

Obviously, compared to the BT NPs/PVDF composite, the dielectric properties of BZT-BCT NFs/PVDF composites are improved at given volume fraction. The electric modulus formalism indicated that the BZT-BCT NFs could effectively enhance the interfacial polarization of the BZT-BCT NFs/PVDF composites than that of the BT NPs/PVDF composite. In addition, the BZT-BCT NFs with large aspect ratio can make the composites polarize at a higher field strength, thus the composites obtain higher polarization strength. The energy density of 3 vol% BZT-BCT NFs/PVDF composite is 3.08 J/cm3 at 240 kV/mm, which is 2.01 times higher enhancement than the BT NPs/PVDF composite (1.53 J/cm3 at 180 kV/mm).

However, due to the immature fabrication technology, commonly occurring Stuck-At-Faults (SAFs) seriously degrade the computational accuracy of an RRAM-based computing system (RCS). In this paper, we present a fault-tolerant framework for RCS. A mapping algorithm with inner fault tolerance is proposed to convert matrix parameters into RRAM conductances in RCS and tolerate SAFs by fully exploring the available mapping space. Two baseline redundancy schemes are proposed to ensure that RCS is effective when the percentage of faulty RRAM cells is high. To reduce the number of redundant RRAM cells when the SAFs follow a non-uniform distribution or an unknown distribution, a distribution-aware redundancy scheme and a re-configurable redundancy scheme are proposed to provide dynamic fault tolerance. Simulation results show that, the baseline redundancy schemes can improve the recognition accuracy of the MNIST data set to almost the same as the RRAM-fault-free case, with an energy overhead of approximately 30%. When SAFs follow a non-uniform and an unknown distribution, the distribution-aware and re-configurable schemes can reduce the number of redundant RRAM cells from more than 200% to less than 40% and 60%, respectively, without reducing the recognition accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.","artificial neural networks; fault tolerance; Neural network hardware; nonvolatile memory; resistive RAM","Conformal mapping; Fabrication; Fault tolerance; Mapping; Matrix algebra; Metals; Neural networks; Random access storage; Redundancy; RRAM; Sensors; Circuit faults; Computational accuracy; Fabrication Technologies; Fault tolerant systems; Matrix vector multiplication; Non-uniform distribution; Random access memory; Recognition accuracy; Fault tolerant computer systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035814409

A subset of the robot joints are conventional, in the sense that external power is used for actuation. Other joints are energetically self-contained passive systems that use (ultra)capacitors for energy storage. Two different electrical interconnections are considered for the regenerative drives, a distributed and a star configuration. The latter allows for direct electric energy redistribution among joints, a novel idea shown in this paper to enable higher energy utilization efficiencies. Closed-form expressions are found for the optimal manipulator parameters (link masses, link lengths, etc.) and drive mechanism parameters (gear ratios, etc.) that maximize regenerative energy storage between any two times, given motion trajectories. A semi-active virtual control strategy previously proposed is used to achieve asymptotic tracking of trajectories. Optimal solutions are shown to be global and unique. In addition, closed-form expressions are provided for the maximum attainable energy. This theoretical maximum places limits on the amount of energy that can be recovered.

However, continuously varying renewable sources, such as wind power or solar energy, require that the power system can manage the variability and uncertainty of the power generation. One solution to increase flexibility of the system is to use various forms of energy storage, which can provide flexibility to the system at different time ranges and smooth the effect of variability of the renewable generation. In this paper, we investigate three questions connected to investment planning of energy storage systems. First, how the existing flexibility in the system will affect the need for energy storage investments. Second, how presence of energy storage will affect renewable generation expansion and affect electricity prices. Third, who should be responsible for energy storage investments planning. This paper proposes to assess these questions through two different mathematical models. The first model is designed for centralized investment planning and the second model deals with a decentralized investment approach where a single independent profit maximizing utility is responsible for energy storage investments. The models have been applied in various case studies with different generation mixes and flexibility levels. The results show that energy storage system is beneficial for power system operation. However, additional regulation should be considered to achieve optimal investment and allocation of energy storage. © 2018 by the authors.","Energy storage; Power system planning; Stochastic processes; Wind power generation","electricity; energy planning; energy storage; numerical model; operations technology; power generation; price determination; resource allocation; solar power; stochasticity; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042566241

Especially, in the residential sector, more than 80% of electrical energy is being consumed because of consumer negligence. This brings the challenging task of maintaining the balance between the demand and supply of electric power. In this paper, we focus on the problem of load balancing via load scheduling under utility and rooftop photovoltaic (PV) units to reduce electricity cost and peak to average ratio (PAR) in demand-side management. For this purpose, we adopted genetic algorithm (GA), binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), wind-driven optimization (WDO), and our proposed genetic WDO (GWDO) algorithm, which is a hybrid of GA and WDO, to schedule the household load. For energy cost estimation, combined real-time pricing (RTP) and inclined block rate (IBR) were used. The proposed algorithm shifts load from peak consumption hours to off-peak hours based on combined pricing scheme and generation from rooftop PV units. Simulation results validate our proposed GWDO algorithm in terms of electricity cost and PAR reduction while considering all three scenarios which we have considered in this work: (1) load scheduling without renewable energy sources (RESs) and energy storage system (ESS), (2) load scheduling with RESs, and (3) load scheduling with RESs and ESS. Furthermore, our proposed scheme reduced electricity cost and PAR by 22.5% and 29.1% in scenario 1, 47.7% and 30% in scenario 2, and 49.2% and 35.4% in scenario 3, respectively, as compared to unscheduled electricity consumption. © 2018 by the authors.","Demand-side management; Energy storage system; Heuristic techniques; Inclined block rate; Load scheduling; Real-time pricing tariff; Rooftop photovoltaic units","Cost estimating; Cost reduction; Demand side management; Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Housing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Renewable energy resources; Block rate; Energy storage systems; Heuristic techniques; Load scheduling; Photovoltaic; Real time pricing tariffs; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048621689

The increased rate of harmful greenhouse gas emissions due to conventional electrical power generation severely affects the whole global atmosphere. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emissions are responsible for a significant share of global warming. Developing countries participate in this environmental distortion to a great percentage. Two different suggested strategies for renewable electrical energy scheduling are discussed in this paper, to attain a sustainable green port by the utilization of two mutual sequential clean renewable energies, which are biomass and photovoltaic (PV) energy. The first strategy, which is called the eco-availability mode, is a simple method. It is based on operating the renewable electrical energy sources during the available time of operation, taking into consideration the simple and basic technical issues only, without considering the sophisticated technical and economical models. The available operation time is determined by the environmental condition. This strategy is addressed to result on the maximum available Biomass and PV energy generation based on the least environmental and technical conditions (panel efficiency, minimum average daily sunshine hours per month, minimum average solar insolation per month). The second strategy, which is called the Intelligent Scheduling (IS) mode, relies on an intelligent Reconfigured Whale Optimization Technique (RWOT) based-model. In this strategy, some additional technical and economical issues are considered. The studied renewable electrical energy generation system is considered in two scenarios, which are with and without storage units. The objective (cost) function of the scheduling optimization problem, for both scenarios, are developed. Also, the boundary conditions and problem constraints are concluded. The RWOT algorithm is an updated Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). It is developed to accelerate the rate of reaching the optimal solution for the IS problem. The two strategies simulation and implementation are illustrated and applied to the seaport of Damietta, which is an Egyptian port, located 10 km to the west of the Nile River (Damietta Branch). The scheduling of PV and biomass energy generation during the different year months is examined for both strategies. The impact of renewable electrical energies generation scheduling on carbon dioxide emission and consequently global warming is discussed. The saving in carbon dioxide emission is calculated and the efficient results of the suggested models are clarified. The carbon dioxide emission is reduced to around its fifth value, during renewable energy operation. This work focuses on decreasing the rate of growth of carbon dioxide emission coming from fossil fuel electrical power generation in Egypt, targeting, sustainable green seaports, through three main contributions in clean renewable electrical energies scheduling. The contributions are: 1-presenting the eco-availability mode for minimum gifted biomass and PV energy generation, 2-developing and progressing the IRWOT scheduling strategy for both scenarios (with and without storage unit), 3-defining the scheduling optimization problem boundary conditions and constraints. © 2018 by the authors.","Biomass energy; Carbon oxides emissions; Damietta seaport; Energy scheduling; Global warming; Green energy; Intelligent Scheduling (IS); Photovoltaic energy; Reconfigured Whale Optimization Technique (RWOT); Sustainable development","Biomass; Boundary conditions; Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Ecology; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Optimization; Planning; Ports and harbors; Sustainable development; Thermoelectric power; Bio-mass energy; Carbon oxide; Damietta seaport; Green energy; Intelligent scheduling; Optimization techniques; Photovoltaic energy; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047090445

The objective is to compute optimized schedules for shiftable home appliances. This is based on the demand response (DR) synergized with renewable energy sources and energy storage system optimal dispatch (DRSREOD). An improved algorithm for a DRSREOD-based HEMS is proposed in this paper. This heuristic-based algorithm considers DR, photovoltaic availability, the state of charge and charge/discharge rates of the storage battery and the sharing-based parallel operation of more than one power source to supply the required load. The HEMS problem has been solved to minimize the cost of energy ( CE ) and time-based discomfort ( TBD ) with conflicting tradeoffs. The mixed scheduling of appliances (delayed scheduling for some appliances and advanced scheduling for others) is introduced to improve the CE and TBD performance parameters. An inclining block rate scheme is also incorporated to reduce the peak load. A set of optimized tradeoffs between CE and TBD has been computed to address multi-objectivity using a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) with Pareto optimization (PO) to perform the tradeoff analysis and to enable consumers to select the most feasible solution. Due to the rapid increase in demand for electricity, developing countries are facing large-scale load shedding (LS). An innovative algorithm is also proposed for the optimal sizing of a dispatchable generator (DG) that can supply the DRSREOD-based HEMS during LS hours to ensure an uninterrupted supply of power. The proposed MOGA/PO-based algorithm enables consumers to select a DG of the optimal size from among a number of optimal choices based on tradeoffs between the DG size, CE , and TBD. © 2013 IEEE.","advanced and delayed scheduling; Demand response; dispatch of renewables and energy storage systems; generator sizing and load shedding; home energy management system; multi-objective genetic algorithm and Pareto optimization","Automation; Battery management systems; Battery storage; Charging (batteries); Developing countries; Domestic appliances; Electric energy storage; Electric load dispatching; Electric load shedding; Electric power plant loads; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy management; Energy management systems; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Demand response; Energy storage systems; Home energy management systems; Load-shedding; Pareto optimization; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042724363

Much fossil fuel is consumed in industrial production and human life. As a result, carbon dioxide emissions have been increasing, and the greenhouse effects thereby generated are posing serious threats to environment of the earth. These years, increasing average global temperature, frequent extreme weather events and climatic changes cause material disasters to the world. After scientists' long-term research, ample evidences have proven that emissions of greenhouse gas like carbon dioxide have brought about tremendous changes to global climate. To really reduce carbon dioxide emissions, governments of different countries and international organizations have invested much money and human resources in performing research related to carbon dioxide emissions.

Moench) stems of four cultivars were analyzed to determine changes in contents of water, total sugars, main soluble sugars and the enzyme activity. From early November 2016 to late January 2017, the decrease in the total sugar content and the contents of sucrose, glucose and fructose slowed down, and the enzyme activities (sucrose synthase and sucrose phosphate synthase) involving sucrose metabolism in the stem remained stable. However, these indicators decreased significantly after the end of January 2017. Low temperatures and a dry environment were conducive to the storage of the sweet sorghum stems. During the winter (from early November 2016 to late January 2017) in northern China, the sweet sorghum plants can be stored naturally in the field via regulating sowing dates, which saves a lot of storage space and production costs for bioethanol company. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Energy resources; Enzymes; Sugar (sucrose); Sugars; Dry environment; Low temperatures; Natural conditions; Sorghum bicolor; Sucrose synthase; Sucrose-phosphate synthase; Sweet sorghum stems; Yellow River delta; Enzyme activity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043308352

However, a series of issues especially for the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and their “shuttle effect” greatly limit their widely commercial applications. Starting from a brief overview of conventional methods to solve these problems, the achievements spotlighted in this review mainly show that the diffusion of LiPSs can be effectively suppressed by forming strong “chemical anchor” between LiPSs and host materials. The synthetic methods and characterization techniques are reviewed according to different types of chemical bonding between LiPSs and the host materials. Theoretical calculation methods are also summarized here to further understanding the role of these “chemical anchors.” Proposing with some perspectives and future research efforts, this review is hoped to provide an in-depth understanding and offer avenues in the rational design of Li–S batteries with long cycle life and high energy/power density in the near future. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this review, we present and discuss a universal origin of inductive effect associated with metal substitution in Ni, Co, Fe, Mn-based complexes, (hydr-)oxides, and lithium intercalation compounds by alignment of the electron levels of metal complex redox with partially filled metal d-state and oxygen p-state of oxides on the absolute energy scale. Increased redox potentials of metal complexes and oxides are shown to correlate with the increased electronegativity of the substituting metal, which results in the enhancement of the ORR/OER activity. Such observations provide new insights into potential strategies to optimize ORR/OER catalytic activity by tuning the redox properties of metal sites. This review aims to bridge the fields of inorganic molecular chemistry, electrocatalysis, lithium-ion batteries, and chemical physics of oxides by introducing a unifying concept linking the electronic structures and electrochemical properties of transition metal oxides and complexes. In this work, by reviewing broad literature on the redox behavior of a number of Ni, Co, Fe, and Mn (hydr-)oxides, Li-intercalation compounds, and organometallic complexes, we demonstrate the effect of the foreign metal substitution on their redox potentials and rationalize the trends by aligning the redox couples of metal complexes with the metal d and oxygen p bands of metal oxides on the absolute electron energy scale. The higher Lewis acidity of the metal substituent compared with parent metal leads to the anodic shift of the redox transition potential due to the inductive effect, which is also shown to correlate with oxygen reduction and evolution activity. This study opens up a new perspective for the design of transition metal compounds with tunable redox properties in order to control the thermodynamics and kinetics of the key electrochemical reactions in energy transformation and storage devices, such as electrolyzers, metal-air and metal ion batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors. Surveying and rational tuning of redox properties across a wide range of materials from transition metal oxides to organometallic complexes enable guidance of the design and discovery of materials to catalyze reactions critical to efficient (electro-)chemical energy storage. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","activity trends; electrocatalysis; inductive effect; Li-ion; metal redox; oxygen evolution reaction; oxygen reduction reaction; transition metal oxides","Acidity; Battery storage; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Chemical bonds; Electric batteries; Electrocatalysis; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrolytic cells; Electrolytic reduction; Electron energy levels; Electronegativity; Electronic structure; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hydraulic servomechanisms; Intercalation; Intercalation compounds; Iron compounds; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Manganese; Metal complexes; Metal ions; Metals; Nickel; Organometallics; Oxygen; Redox reactions; Reduction; Secondary batteries; Thermodynamics; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Tuning; Virtual storage; Electrochemical capacitor; Electrochemical reactions; Inductive effects; Lithium intercalation compounds; Oxygen evolution reaction; Oxygen reduction and evolution; Oxygen reduction reaction; Thermodynamics and kinetics; Transition metal oxides; catalysis; ion; metal; oxidation; oxide; reaction kinetics; reduction; thermodynamics; trend analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042510973

Unfortunately, conventional energy generators are not capable of responding to environmental changes, while traditional energy storage devices lack special functionalities apart from supplying electricity. Benefiting from exceptional physicochemical properties, graphene-based materials help to address the aforementioned issues. In this review, we highlight recent key advances in graphene-based smart energy generation and storage systems. In terms of smart energy generation, we focus on graphene-derived electric generators that can controllably produce electricity in response to external stimuli, such as moisture, flowing liquid, friction, pressure force, and heat. As for energy storage, smart batteries and supercapacitors with made-to-measure graphene materials are summarized to show impressive features of deformability, wearability, printability, stimuli response, self-healing, integration, and miniaturization. Beyond these, we also discuss the challenges ahead for these graphene-related smart energy generation/storage devices and their future development trend. With the success of smart electric devices, intelligent energy generation and storage that can interact with and be responsive to external stimuli are highly demanded. As a two-dimensional (2D) monolayer of carbon atoms packed into a honeycomb lattice, graphene has the potential to revolutionize sensors, electronics, biomedicine, energy storage, and conversion devices, owing to its excellent electronic and mechanical properties. In the present review, we highlight recent advances in graphene-based smart energy generation and storage devices. Progress in tailoring the properties of graphene is summarized first, including microscopic structure modification, functionalization, and self-assembly of graphene. Then, graphene-based smart electric generators that can produce electricity in response to moisture, flowing liquid, friction, pressure force, and heat are systematically reviewed, as well as graphene-based smart batteries and supercapacitors with special features, such as deformability, wearability, stimuli response, self-healing, integration, and miniaturization. Finally, insights into the challenges and future development of graphene-based smart energy generation and storage are tentatively proposed.

However, the rapid capacity fading of high-sulfur-loading cathodes caused by the shuttle of soluble polysulfide intermediates between two electrodes heavily hinders the development of high-energy-density Li-S batteries. We develop in this work a powerful functional separator to suppress the polysulfide shuttle by coating two-dimensional nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets on one surface of a commercial polypropylene separator. The high surface area, high content of nitrogen dopants, and close-packing laminar structure of the two-dimensional porous carbon nanosheets make them ideal to fabricate a lightweight and thin separator for high-energy-density Li-S batteries. The separator reported in this work endows the high-sulfur-loading cathodes made of commercial carbon materials with significantly enhanced performances that are comparable with or even superior to the state-of-the-art sulfur composite cathodes, opening up new opportunities for designing practical high-energy-density Li-S batteries. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are attractive high-energy-storage devices to meet the increasing energy consumption needs of society. Unfortunately, the polysulfides formed during the charge/discharge process are highly soluble in the electrolyte and can migrate between the two electrodes, leading to rapid capacity decay. Although recent advances in the sulfur composite cathodes have endowed Li-S batteries with enhanced performance, the high cycling stability at the expense of low sulfur loading offsets the energy density advantage of Li-S batteries. We now invent in this work a separator with lightweight nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets coated on a commercial separator to effectively intercept the migration of polysulfides. The developed separator endows the sulfur cathodes made of commercial carbon materials with performances comparable with or superior to the state-of-the-art sulfur cathodes, offering new opportunities to fabricate high-energy-density Li-S batteries for practical applications. The performance degradation of high-sulfur-loading cathodes caused by the migration of polysulfide intermediates from cathode to anode seriously impedes the practical use of lithium-sulfur batteries. This work presents a lightweight, porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet modified commercial separator with a high polysulfide-entrapping ability, which can significantly improve the capacities, rate capabilities, and cycling stability of the high-sulfur-loading cathodes made of commercial carbon materials.

They exhibit a wide range of electronic and crystallographic structures. The former varies from metallic conductors to excellent insulators. The latter often have layer structures or have open tunnel structures that can act as the hosts for the intercalation of a wide range of metal cation and other guest species. They are fascinating materials with almost infinitely variable properties, with the crystal structure controlling the identity and the amount of the guest species that may be intercalated and subsequently removed. The electronic structure controls not only the degree of electron transfer to the host, but also defines the degree of the electrostatic interactions a mobile ion experiences; thus, a metallic host will provide a minimizing of those interactions, whereas in an ionic lattice the interactions will be much greater and the mobile ion will experience a much higher activation energy for motion. This becomes more important for multivalent cations such as Mg2+.Today's lithium batteries are limited in capacity, because less than one lithium ion is reversibly intercalated per transition metal redox center. There may be an opportunity to increase the storage capacity by utilizing redox centers that can undergo multielectron reactions. This might be accomplished by intercalating multiple monovalent cations or one multivalent cation.In this Account, we review the key theoretical and experimental results on lithium and magnesium reversible intercalation into two prototypical materials: titanium disulfide, TiS2, and vanadyl phosphate, VOPO4. Both of these materials exist in two or more phases, which have different molar volumes and/or dimensionalities and thus are expected to show a range of diffusion opportunities for battery active guest ions such as lithium, sodium, and magnesium. One major conclusion of this Account is that reversibly intercalating two lithium ions into a host lattice while maintaining its crystal structure is possible. A second major conclusion is that theoretical studies are now sufficiently mature that they can be relied upon to predict the key free energy values of simple intercalation reactions, i.e., the energy that might be stored. This could help to focus future choices of battery couples. In hindsight, theory would have predicted that magnesium-based intercalation cells are not a viable electrochemical option, relative to lithium cells, from either power or energy density considerations. However, the fundamental study of such reactions will lead to a better understanding of intercalation reactions in general, and of the critical importance of crystal structure in controlling the rates and degree of chemical reactions. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042321447

Unfortunately, the ever-increasing size of LSTM model leads to inefficient designs on FPGAs due to the limited on-chip resources. The previous work proposes to use a pruning based compression technique to reduce the model size and thus speedups the inference on FPGAs. However, the random nature of the pruning technique transforms the dense matrices of the model to highly unstructured sparse ones, which leads to unbalanced computation and irregular memory accesses and thus hurts the overall performance and energy efficiency. In contrast, we propose to use a structured compression technique which could not only reduce the LSTM model size but also eliminate the irregularities of computation and memory accesses. This approach employs block-circulant instead of sparse matrices to compress weight matrices and reduces the storage requirement from (k2) to (k). Fast Fourier Transform algorithm is utilized to further accelerate the inference by reducing the computational complexity from (k2) to (klogk). The datapath and activation functions are quantized as 16-bit to improve the resource utilization. More importantly, we propose a comprehensive framework called C-LSTM to automatically optimize and implement a wide range of LSTM variants on FPGAs. According to the experimental results, C-LSTM achieves up to 18.8X and 33.5X gains for performance and energy efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art LSTM implementation under the same experimental setup, and the accuracy degradation is very small. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Block-circulant matrix; Compression; FFT; FPGA; LSTM; RNNs","Compaction; Energy efficiency; Fast Fourier transforms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Inference engines; Logic gates; Matrix algebra; Signal receivers; Accuracy Improvement; Activation functions; Block-circulant matrices; Compression techniques; Fast Fourier transform algorithm; LSTM; Resource utilizations; RNNs; Long short-term memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052102073

However, they suffer from serious degradation of cycling performance after exposing to air during their storage. Here we selected LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as a typical Ni-rich positive material to study the influence upon exposure to ambient air on surface chemical composition and electrochemical performance. TEM confirms the existence of amorphous surface layer after contacting with atmosphere and the thickness is about 3-4 nm. The fresh LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 sample has capacity retention of 94.6% and 93.3% after 50 cycles at 0.2C and 1C, respectively, comparing to the 91.7% and 82.4% of the exposed sample. The charge-discharge curves and electrochemical impedance spectra indicate that exposure to air lead to increased impedance and polarization, which seriously affects LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cycling properties.

Moreover, the currently used evaporation-condensation preparation method raises serious safety concerns, and ball-milled P/C also gives poor performance because of interparticle adhesion. Here, we present a mild solution synthesis of unique hierarchical P/CNTs@rGO, which not only achieves maximum conductivity in red P agglomerates but also provides volume variation space to relieve the pulverization issues. Even at a high P content of 70 wt %, P/CNTs@rGO still exhibits a specific capacity of 2,189.1 mA hr g−1 for lithium-ion batteries and 2,112.9 mA hr g−1 for sodium-ion batteries. These values are very close to the theoretical specific capacity. More importantly, it achieves an unprecedented gravimetric capacity of 1,532.4 mA hr g−1 on the basis of the mass of the whole electrode, as well as excellent cycling performance for 500 cycles, representing the best Li-storage performance among red-P-based electrodes to date. With ever-increasing demands for large-capacity batteries, red phosphorus (P), which has a high theoretical specific capacity (∼2,600 mA hr g−1) and low material cost, holds great interest for the next generation of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, red P suffers from poor cycling performance, and the currently used preparation methods raise either serious safety concerns or significant particle aggregation. Here, we report a unique P/CNTs@rGO hierarchical structure to fully explore ball-milled commercial red P as anodes for LIBs and SIBs. The self-standing hierarchical structure not only improves the conductivity of the agglomerates to resolve the interparticle adhesion issues of ball-milled P but also provides extra space to relieve the material pulverization. More importantly, the P/CNTs@rGO electrode, without using polymer binders and metallic current collectors, offers an ideal platform for pushing the gravimetric capacity of the whole electrode to the upper experimental limit. Red phosphorus (P), which has a high theoretical specific capacity (∼2,600 mA hr g−1), low cost, and commercial availability, has been severely limited by large volume variation and poor electrical conductivity for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Here, we fabricate a self-standing P/CNTs@rGO hierarchical structure to effectively resolve the critical issues associated with red P.

COFs are typically isolated as microcrystalline powders, which are unsuitable for many applications that would leverage their tunable structures, such as optoelectronic devices and nanofiltration membranes. Here, we report the interfacial polymerization of polyfunctional amine and aldehyde monomers with a Lewis acid catalyst, Sc(OTf)3. Immiscible solutions segregate the catalyst from the monomers, confining polymerization to the solution interface. This method provides large-area, continuous COF films (several cm2) with a thickness tuned from 100 μm to 2.5 nm. Relatively thick films were crystalline, whereas the films that are a few nanometers thick were presumably amorphous. The COF films were transferred onto polyethersulfone supports, and the resulting membranes showed enhanced rejection of Rhodamine WT, a model water contaminant. The large area, tunable pore size, and tailored molecular composition show promise for nanofiltration applications. Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline polymers with grid-like structures. COFs show promise for applications such as energy storage devices and water-purification membranes. However, their typical microcrystalline, insoluble powder form complicates or precludes their use for these applications. Here, we have formed COFs at oil-water and air-water interfaces, which provide continuous films of these materials of arbitrary size and controlled thickness. These COF films can be transferred to both solid substrates and membrane supports, and preliminary composite membranes showed rejection of model organic pollutants. This approach indicates a way forward for accessing COF films on any substrate and will enable molecular design approaches to be rationally applied to nanofiltration membranes and other applications. Interfacial polymerization with COF monomers and Sc(OTf)3 afforded large-area (several cm2) free-standing films with tunable thickness (2.5 nm to 100 μm). When the films were thick (∼100 μm), they exhibited X-ray diffraction corresponding to the expected crystalline structure. The films were integrated into the thin-film composite membranes for water nanofiltration, where they showed enhanced rejection of model pollutant Rhodamine WT. © 2017","2D polymer; COF; interfacial polymerization; nanofiltration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041545419

DEFC uses ethanol in the fuel cell instead of the more toxic methanol. Ethanol is more attractive than methanol by many reasons. Ethanol is a hydrogen-rich liquid and it has a higher specific energy (8.0 kWh/kg) compared to that of methanol (6.1 kWh/kg). Ethanol can be obtained in great quantity from biomass through a fermentation process from renewable resources such as sugar cane, wheat, corn, and even straw. The use of ethanol would also overcome both the storage and infrastructure challenge of hydrogen for fuel cell applications. The experimental apparatus on the micro direct ethanol fuel cell for measuring the cell performance has been set for this research. The objective is to study the micro direct ethanol fuel cell performance for applying with the portable electronic devices. The cell performance is specified in the terms of cell voltage, cell current and power of the cell at room operating temperature and 1 atm for the pressure and also includes the ethanol fuel consumption. The effect of operating temperature change on the electrical production performance is also studied. The steady-state time for collecting each data value is about 5-10 minutes.

Moreover, Indonesia is a tropical region with relatively high temperatures. Fish storage age can be prolonged with a decrease in temperature. Frozen fish can even be stored for several months. Fish freezing means preparing fish for storage in low-temperature cold storage. The working fluid used in cold storage to cool low-temperature chambers and throw heat into high-temperature environments is refrigerant. So far refrigerant used in cold storage is Hydrochloroflourocarbons (HCFC) that is R-22. Chlor is a gas that causes ODP (Ozone Depleting Potential), while Flour is a gas that causes GWP (Global Warming Potential). Government policy began in 2015 to implement Hydrochloroflourocarbons Phase-Out Management Plan. Hydrocarbon (HC) is an alternative substitute for R-22. HC-22 (propane ≥ 99.5%) has several advantages, among others: environmentally friendly, indicated by a zero ODP value, and GWP = 3 (negligible), thermophysical property and good heat transfer characteristics, vapor phase density Which is low, and good solubility with mineral lubricants. The use of HC-22 in cold storage is less than R-22. From the analysis results obtained, cold storage system using HC-22 has better performance and energy consumption is more efficient than the R-22. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cold storage; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Fish; Fisheries; Global warming; Heat transfer; Refrigerants; Refrigeration; Temperature; Thermodynamic properties; Environmental-friendly; Global warming potential; Heat transfer characteristics; High-temperature environment; Mineral lubricants; Ozone depleting potentials; Refrigeration technology; Technology application; Cold working",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043792622

Implementing the technology for such application at a hotel was found that hot water capacity generated from the heat recovery system could satisfy domestic hot water demand of the hotel. The gas boilers installed in order to back up the system have never been used. The hot water supply, however, was found to be instable with hot water supply temperature fluctuated ranging from 45 °C to 62 °C. The temperature fluctuations reaches 17 °C, which is considered instable and can reduce hot water usage comfort level. This research is aimed to optimize the thermal energy storage in order to minimize the temperature instability of heat recovery hot water supply system. The research is a case study approach based on cooling and hot water demands of a hotel in Jakarta-Indonesia that has applied water cooled chillers with heat recovery systems. The hotel operation with 329 guest rooms and 8 function rooms showed that hot water production in the heat recovery system completed with 5 m3 thermal energy storage (TES) could not hold the hot water supply temperature constantly. The variations of the cooling demand and hot water demands day by day were identified. It was found that there was significant mismatched of available time (hours) between cooling demand which is directly correlated to the hot water production from the heat recovery system and hot water usage. The available TES system could not store heat rejected from the condenser of the chiller during cooling demand peak time between 14.00 and 18.00 hours. The extra heat from the heat recovery system consequently increases the temperature of hot water up to 62 °C. It is about 12 K above 50 °C the requirement hot water temperature of the hotel. In contrast, the TES could not deliver proper temperature of hot water during peak hot water demand and on that time between 06.00 and 10.00 hours, the hotel also experiences a low cooling demand. Subsequently, the temperature of hot water supplied drops down as low as 45 °C. The study was found that optimization on the TES can significantly minimize temperature variation of the hot water supplied to the hotel appliances. A TES of 30 m3 storage capacity is considered the optimum capacity which can reduce the temperature fluctuation from 17 K down to 3 K. The study also found that maintaining the storage temperature relatively lower than the condenser temperature could increase hot water production of the heat recovery system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air conditioning; Cooling; Cooling systems; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Heat storage; Hot water distribution systems; Hotels; Temperature; Temperature distribution; Thermal energy; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Water supply; Water supply systems; Central air-conditioning systems; Condenser temperature; Energy-saving technologies; Heat recovery hot water supply systems; Temperature fluctuation; Temperature instability; Temperature variation; Water-cooled chillers; Water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043761847

The existing works focus on the monitor and control of the state of networked energy storage devices. However, optimizing the security of demand response (DR) management with given energy states under IoE circumstance is rarely studied. Due to the connection to the Internet, the DR management in IoE faces a number of unique cyber-physical security challenges. First, as distributed energy resources have a large number of stakeholders and any illegal skip-level energy access may cause disastrous results, it requires fog computing paradigm to enforce a more secure DR management. Second, in the localized energy networks of IoE, a corrupt DR participator can maliciously read and write DR strategies by using collusion attacks (e.g., reputation-based cheating and unfair competing). To address these issues, we propose a fog computing-enabled secure demand response (FSDR) scheme for IoE against collusion attacks using consensus and access control encryption. In FSDR, the fog node was reconstructed as a sanitizer to randomly transfer encrypted energy states and DR strategies with homomorphic operations. Moreover, a simulated annealing-based consensus algorithm was presented to examine the validity of the energy states and DR strategies. In addition, we establish the mathematical models of collusion attacks and attack defense approaches. The performance evaluation validated its efficiency. © 2013 IEEE.","Access control encryption (ACE); Consensus; Demand response (DR); Fog computing; Internet of Energy (IoE)","Access control; Electric load management; Electron energy levels; Energy resources; Fog; Internet; Network security; Simulated annealing; consensus; Consensus algorithms; Cyber-Physical securities; Decentralized energy; Demand response; Distributed Energy Resources; Edge computing; Homomorphic operations; Cryptography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041533203

In this paper, a novel common grounded H-type bidirectional converter characterized by a good dynamic response, a low inductor current ripple, and a wide voltage conversion ratio is proposed. In addition, it can avoid the narrow pulse of pulse width modulation (PWM) voltage waveforms when a high voltage conversion ratio is achieved.

And high-power density is the future development trend of these machines, which demands that the rotor characterizes slender and high rotating speed and operates above the critical speeds. However, it is a big challenge for a flexible rotor to pass the bending critical speeds and operate above the critical speeds steadily and reliably. Based on above reasons, this article presented the design, modeling, and analysis framework of a flexible rotor test rig with active magnetic bearing (AMB). Special attention was paid to the flexible rotor dynamic model development, dynamic analysis, and model-based robust control design. First, the main structure features were illustrated in detail, including the key dimensions and parameters of the AMB components and rotor. Then models of components including power amplifier and displacement sensor were developed. The finite element method based on Timoshenko beam theory was applied to the rotor dynamics model. The dynamic analysis of the rotor is the foundation of the controller design. Hence, modal analysis had been done, obtaining rotor dynamic properties via synthesis of natural frequency, mode shapes, and Campbell plots.

However, the development of advanced science and technology has spurred demands for green and sustainable energy storage materials. Biomass-derived carbon, as a type of electrode materials, has attracted much attention because of its structural diversities, adjustable physical/chemical properties, environmental friendliness and considerable economic value. Because the nature contributes the biomass with bizarre microstructures, the biomass-derived carbon materials also show naturally structural diversities, such as 0D spherical, 1D fibrous, 2D lamellar and 3D spatial structures. In this review, the structure design of biomass-derived carbon materials for energy storage is presented. The effects of structural diversity, porosity and surface heteroatom doping of biomass-derived carbon materials in supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries are discussed in detail.

Supercapacitors (SCs) have received wide attention as critical devices for electrochemical energy storage because of their rapid charging–discharging capability and long life cycle. Various transition metal oxides (TMOs), such as MnO2, NiO, Co3O4, and CuO, have been extensively studied as electrode materials for SCs. Compared with carbon and conducting polymers, TMO materials can achieve higher specific capacitance. For further improvement of electrochemical performance, hierarchically nanostructured TMO materials have become a hot research area for electrode materials in SCs. The hierarchical nanostructure can not only offer abundant accessible electroactive sites for redox reactions but also shorten the ion diffusion pathway. In this review, we provide an overall summary and evaluation of the recent progress of hierarchically nanostructured TMOs for SCs, including synthesis methods, compositions, structures, and electrochemical performances. Both single-phase TMOs and the composites based on TMOs are summarized. Furthermore, we also prospect the developing foreground of this field. In this view, the important directions mainly include: the nanocomposites of TMOs materials with conductive materials; the cobalt-based materials and the nickel-based materials; the improvement of the volume energy density, the asymmetric SCs, and the flexible all-solid-state SCs. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","hierarchical nanostructure; supercapacitors; transition metal oxides","Carbon; Conducting polymers; Conductive materials; Copper oxides; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Energy storage; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Life cycle; Manganese oxide; Nanocomposites; Nanostructures; Nickel oxide; Redox reactions; Supercapacitor; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Discharging capabilities; Electroactive sites; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical performance; Environmental problems; Hierarchical Nanostructures; Specific capacitance; Volume energy density; Transition metal oxides",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042728216

Herein, we report an application of nanotube-like hard carbon (NTHC) anode material prepared by high-temperature carbonization (1150°C) of polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes for high-performance SIHCs. As a result, the assembled sodium ion half-cell with NTHC shows a high reversible capacity of 419.5 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 and a good rate performance of 74.6 mA h g−1 at 2.5 A g−1 in a potential window of 0–2 V (vs. Na/Na+).

However, improving their electrochemical performance from electrode materials to assembled devices still remains huge challenges. Here, we for the first time synthesized two-dimensional (2D), ultrathin, mesoporous polypyrrole-based graphene nanosheets uniformly anchored with redox polyoxometalate (mPPy@rGO-POM) by soft template approach. Further, using a layer-by-layer deposition and mask-assisted technique, the compactly stacked and sandwich-like hybrid film (mPGM) based on pseudocapacitive mPPy@rGO-POM nanosheets and electrochemically exfoliated graphene was directly fabricated as binder- and additive-free interdigital electrodes for all-solid- state planar micro-supercapacitors (mPGM-MSCs). Notably, the resulted mPGM-MSCs exhibited outstanding areal capacitance (115 mF cm–2), remarkably enhanced volumetric capacitance (137 F cm–3 at 1 mV s–1) in comparison with MSCs based on the films of mPPy@rGO without POM anchoring (95 F cm–3), and non-porous polypyrrole-graphene (68 F cm–3). Further, mPGM-MSCs disclosed robust mechanical flexibility with ~96% of capacitance retention at a highly bending angle of 180°, and impressive parallel or serial interconnection for boosting capacitance or voltage output.

The Weather Research and Forecasting Model was used to investigate the UHI effect and the effectiveness of cool and green roof mitigation strategies in the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou metropolitan area during an extreme heat wave episode in the summer of 2013. Both urban land-cover change and anthropogenic heat releases exacerbated high temperatures in the urban area. Notably, urban land-cover change and anthropogenic heat release were responsible for 64% and 36% of the UHI intensity, respectively. Both cool and green roofs decreased near-surface air temperatures. The most dramatic decrease in near-surface air temperature occurred in the late morning; nocturnal air temperature decreased slightly because of the decrease in urban heat storage associated with the cool roof strategy. In addition, the UHI mitigation strategies affected the entire urban boundary layer. The decrease in the potential temperature and static stability created a stable urban boundary layer in which turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) decreased simultaneously. Analysis of an urban belt near a large water body showed that the decrease in the surface skin temperature difference between land and the water body weakened the daytime lake breeze. This effect was observed in both the inflow in the boundary layer and the return flow above the boundary layer, and it decreased the heat and moisture exchange between the lake and land boundary layers. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.","Heat islands; Land surface model; Urban meteorology","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layers; Heat storage; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Lakes; Landforms; Roofs; Weather forecasting; Anthropogenic heat release; Heat island; Land surface modeling; Near surface air temperature; Surface skin temperature; Turbulent kinetic energy; Urban meteorology; Weather research and forecasting models; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; boundary layer; extreme event; greenspace; heat island; high temperature; kinetic energy; land surface; metropolitan area; roof; weather forecasting; China; Jiangsu; Suxichang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042456455

In nature, water oxidation occurs at the oxygen-evolving center of photosystem II, and leads to the generation of oxygen, protons, and electrons. The last two are used for fixation of carbon dioxide to give carbohydrates. In artificial processes, the coupling of water oxidation to evolve O2 and water reduction to evolve H2 is known as water splitting, which is an attractive method for solar energy conversion and storage. Because water oxidation is a thermodynamically uphill reaction and is kinetically slow, this reaction causes a bottleneck in large-scale water splitting. As a consequence, the development of new and efficient water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) has attracted extensive attention. Recent efforts have identified a variety of mononuclear earth-abundant transition-metal complexes as active and stable molecular WOCs. This review article summarizes recent progress in research on mononuclear catalysts that are based on first-row transition-metal elements, namely manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper. Particular attention is paid to catalytic mechanisms and the key O-O bond formation steps. This information is critical for designing new catalysts that are highly efficient and stable.

Hence, how to plan the hybrid power system and allocate its profit becomes necessary. In this paper, the cooperative game theory is introduced to discuss this problem. We first design the basic structure of EI, and point out the object of this study-coal power plant-wind farm-photovoltaic power station-energy storage provider (CWPE) alliance. Subsequently, average allocation strategy (AAS), capacity-based allocation strategy (CAS) and Shapley value allocation strategy (SAS) are proposed, and then the modified disruption propensity (MDP) index is constructed to judge the advantages and disadvantages of the three schemes. Thirdly, taking a certain area of A Province as an example, the profits of CWPE under three strategies are calculated respectively. Finally, by analyzing individual rationality and collective rationality of cooperative game and the MDP index of the three profit allocation schemes, we find that SAS is the most stable. © 2018 by the authors.","Coal power plant-wind farm-photovoltaic power station-energy storage provider (CWPE); Cooperative game; Energy Internet (EI); Profit allocation; Shapley value","cost-benefit analysis; energy planning; equipment; game theory; planning process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041506649

Due to the unreliable nature of ambient energy sources, these devices experience frequent intervals of power loss, leading to sudden reboots. Tolerating such power supply disruptions require the ability to rapidly checkpoint/save system state when power loss is imminent and restore it at the start of the next power cycle to continue computations in a seamless manner. A typical microcontroller used in these systems consists of a fast nonvolatile SRAM and a nonvolatile FLASH storage. Prior work has shown how emerging nonvolatile memory technologies such as STT-MRAM can improve the energy efficiency of these systems, either by using STT-MRAM as a drop-in replacement for FLASH (henceforth referred to as the SRAM+STT-MRAM memory configuration) or using STT-MRAM as unified memory (henceforth referred to as the unified STT-MRAM memory configuration). However, both these configurations have significant drawbacks. Using the SRAM+STT−MRAM configuration leads to high checkpointing overhead due to the inefficient write operations of STT-MRAM whereas using the unified STT-MRAM configuration is inefficient due to executing every program instruction directly from STTMRAM. This paper proposes a novel Spin Hall Effect-based nonvolatile-SRAM (SNVRAM) bit-cell that combines the nonvolatility of spin devices with the speed and energy efficiency of conventional 6T SRAM cells. We explore the use of the proposed SNVRAM to replace the SRAM in a transiently powered system to mitigate the drawbacks of the aforementioned memory configurations. Simulation results using a set of evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the SNVRAM+STT−MRAM configuration leads to significant memory energy benefits of 2.6× and 2.8× on average, compared to the SRAM+STT−MRAM and unified STT-MRAM memory configurations, respectively. © 2017 IEEE.","Intermittently powered systems, NVSRAM","Crystal symmetry; Energy efficiency; Flash memory; Hall effect devices; Integrated circuit design; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Microprocessor chips; Nonvolatile storage; Spin Hall effect; Static random access storage; Switches; Check pointing; Memory management; Non-volatile memory; NVSRAM; Random access memory; MRAM devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037551227

A low-power local processor is proposed, which can perform signal processing to convert raw magnetic sensor signals to user-defined commands, on the sTDS wearable headset, rather than sending all raw data out to a PC or smartphone. The proposed sTDS significantly reduces the transmitter power consumption and subsequently increases the battery life. Assuming the sTDS user issues one command every 20 ms, the proposed local processor reduces the data volume that needs to be wirelessly transmitted by a factor of 64, from 9.6 to 0.15 kb/s. The proposed processor consists of threemain blocks: serial peripheral interface bus for receiving raw data from magnetic sensors, external magnetic interference attenuation to attenuate external magnetic field from the raw magnetic signal, and a machine learning classifier for command detection. A proof-of-concept prototype sTDS has been implemented with a low-power IGLOO-nano field programmable gate array (FPGA), bluetooth low energy, battery and magnetic sensors on a headset, and tested. At clock frequency of 20 MHz, the processor takes 6.6 ?s and consumes 27 nJ for detecting a command with a detection accuracy of 96.9%. To further reduce power consumption, an application-specified integrated circuit processor for the sTDS is implemented at the postlayout level in 65-nm CMOS technology with 1-V power supply, and it consumes 0.43 mW, which is 10× lower than FPGA power consumption and occupies an area of only 0.016 mm2. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","ASIC; assistive technology; field programmable gate array (FPGA); low-power; machine learning classifiers; paralysis; tongue drive system","Application specific integrated circuits; Artificial intelligence; Computer control systems; Data reduction; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Headphones; Learning systems; Logic gates; Magnetic sensors; Magnetism; Magnetometers; Receivers (containers); Signal processing; Signal receivers; Smartphones; Wearable computers; Wearable sensors; Wearable technology; Assistive technology; Drive systems; Low Power; paralysis; Power demands; Tongue; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); communication aid; disabled person; electronic device; human; tongue; wireless communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Disabled Persons; Humans; Tongue; Wearable Electronic Devices; Wireless Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035749452

As model neutral lipid binding protein, we use apoLp-III, an amphipathic α-helix bundle protein. This domain is also found in proteins from the perilipin family and in apoE. Protein binding to the monolayer is studied by the decrease in the oil/water surface tension. Previous work used POPC (one of the major lipids found on lipid droplets) to form the phospholipid monolayer on the triolein surface.

There is a tradeoff between efficiency and power density that is mediated by heat transfer within the compression/ expansion chamber. This paper considers the optimal control for the compression and expansion processes that provides the optimal tradeoff between efficiency and power. Analytical Pareto optimal solutions are developed for the cases in which hA, the product of the heat transfer coefficient and heat transfer surface area, is either a constant or is a function of the air volume. It is found that the optimal trajectories take the form ""fast-slow-fast"" where the fast stages are adiabatic and the slow stage is either isothermal for the constant-hA assumption, or a pseudo-isothermal (where the temperature depends on the instantaneous hA) for the volume-varying-hA assumption.

Achieving consistency across these scenarios has presented a significant challenge, especially for combination products that contain more than one drug. This study characterized the delivered dose and aerosol properties of glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate metered dose inhaler (GFF MDI; Bevespi Aerosphere™). GFF MDI, a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, glycopyrrolate (18 μg, equivalent to glycopyrronium 14.4 μg), and a long-acting β2-agonist, formoterol fumarate (9.6 μg; equivalent to formoterol fumarate dihydrate 10 μg), is formulated using innovative co-suspension delivery technology, which suspends micronized drug crystals with spray-dried phospholipid porous particles in hydrofluoroalkane propellant. In this study, delivered dose uniformity was assessed through the labeled number of doses, and aerosol properties, such as percent fine particle fraction (FPF) and mass median aerodynamic diameter, were determined by cascade impaction. GFF MDI achieved reproducible dose delivery and an FPF greater than 55%, whether formulated and delivered as a monocomponent or dual FDC. The performance of GFF MDI was maintained across various manufacturing batches, under extended storage, and with variations in flow rate. Furthermore, unlike a GFF drug crystal-only suspension, drug delivery remained consistent for GFF MDI when simulated patient-handling errors were applied, such as reduced shake energy and delays between shaking and actuation. These results demonstrate that co-suspension delivery technology overcomes well-known sources of variability in MDI drug delivery. © 2017, The Authors.","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); co-suspension delivery technology; dose consistency; metered dose inhaler (MDI); respiratory drug delivery","fluorinated hydrocarbon; formoterol fumarate plus glycopyrronium bromide; phospholipid; propellant; bronchodilating agent; formoterol fumarate; glycopyrronium; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; aerosol; Article; crystal; drug delivery system; drug formulation; drug manufacture; drug stability; drug storage; flow rate; in vitro study; particle size; priority journal; reliability; shelf life; simulation; suspension; administration and dosage; chronic obstructive lung disease; double blind procedure; drug delivery system; human; inhalational drug administration; invention; metabolism; metered dose inhaler; pharmacokinetics; procedures; reproducibility; standards; suspension; Administration, Inhalation; Aerosols; Bronchodilator Agents; Double-Blind Method; Drug Delivery Systems; Formoterol Fumarate; Glycopyrrolate; Humans; Inventions; Metered Dose Inhalers; Muscarinic Antagonists; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Reproducibility of Results; Suspensions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030867389

In this paper, we reviewed the multiscale modeling studies on lithium-sulfur batteries: (1) the atomistic simulations were employed to seek alternative materials for mitigating the shuttle effect; (2) the growth kinetics of Li2S film and corresponding surface passivation were investigated by the interfacial model based on findings from atomistic simulations; (3) the nature of Li2S2, which is the only solid intermediate product, was revealed by the density functional theory simulation; and (4) macroscale models were developed to analyze the effect of reaction kinetics, sulfur loading, and transport properties on the cell performance. The challenge for the multiscale modeling approach is translating the microscopic information from atomistic simulations and interfacial model into the meso-/macroscale model for accurately predicting the cell performance. © 2018 by ASME.","cathode microstructure; Li2S precipitation; Lithium-Sulfur batteries; mesoscale modeling approach; performance prediction; polysulfide trapping","Cathodes; Density functional theory; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Film growth; Growth kinetics; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Lithium sulfur batteries; Polysulfides; Precipitation (chemical); Reaction intermediates; Reaction kinetics; Sulfur; Atomistic simulations; Cathode microstructure; Density functional theory simulations; Electrochemical reactions; Experimental techniques; Meso-scale modeling; Performance prediction; Physico-chemical interactions; Lithium batteries",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030764832

Firstly, the model was established considering the constraint conditions of the cycles, depth, power of the charge-discharge of the ESS, the typical daily load curves, as well. Then, dynamic programming method was used to real-time solve the model in which the difference of power Δs, the real-time revised energy storage capacity Sk and the permission error of depth of charge-discharge were introduced to optimize the solution process.

One of the promising ways for thermal energy storage system is application of phase change materials (PCMs). In this study, a two-dimensional numerical model is presented to investigate the heat transfer enhancement during the melting/solidification process in a triplex tube heat exchanger (TTHX) by using fluent software. The thermal conduction and natural convection are all taken into account in the simulation of the melting/solidification process. As the volume fraction of fin is kept to be a constant, the influence of proposed fin arrangement on temporal profile of liquid fraction over the melting process is studied and reported. By rotating the unit with different angle, the simulation shows that the melting time varies a little, which means that the installation error can be reduced by the selected fin arrangement. The proposed fin arrangement also can effectively reduce time of the solidification of the PCM by investigating the solidification process. To summarize, this work presents a shape optimization for the improvement of the thermal energy storage system by considering both thermal energy charging and discharging process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Energy storage; Energy utilization; Environmental engineering; Fins (heat exchange); Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Heat transfer coefficients; Melting; Phase change materials; Shape optimization; Solidification; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Discharging process; Heat Transfer enhancement; Latent thermal energy storages; Reduce energy consumption; Solidification process; Thermal energy storage systems; Tube heat exchangers; Two dimensional numerical models; Heat transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042779077

With the rapid development of nuclear power industry, China's NPPs(NPPs) will not be able to meet the problem of the production of spent fuel. Currently the world's major nuclear power countries use dry storage as a way of spent fuel storage, so in recent years, China study on additional spent fuel dry storage system mainly. Part of the PWR NPP is ready to apply for additional spent fuel dry storage system. It also need to safety classificate to spent fuel dry storage facilities in PWR, but there is no standard for safety classification of spent fuel dry storage facilities in China. Because the storage facilities of the spent fuel dry storage are not part of the NPP, the classification standard of China's NPPs is not applicable.

However, the reactivity and long-term stability of potassium superoxide remains ambiguous in K-O2 batteries. Parasitic reactions are explored and the use of ion chromatography to quantify trace amounts of side products is demonstrated. Both quantitative titrations and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry confirm the highly reversible single-electron transfer process, with 98 % capacity attributed to the formation and decomposition of KO2. In contrast to the Na-O2 counterparts, remarkable shelf-life is demonstrated for K-O2 batteries owing to the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of KO2, which prevents the spontaneous disproportionation to peroxide.

The use of vehicles with fossil fuels is one of the contributors to pollution and global warming. Another reason why dependence on it should be reduced is the lack of Indonesia's petroleum reserves compared to other OPEC countries. Researchers are trying to anticipate this by developing electric vehicles capable of operating without pollution. Implementation of electric vehicles has begun with the electric train, tram, electric bus, and others. Vehicles with rails get electricity supplies from the grid along the tracks, but the type of freely moving vehicle without a rail requires another way to get electricity supplies. Electric vehicles with power storage (battery) have an advantage in the roaming area if supported by proper recharging techniques. In electric vehicles, the battery is recharged by the direct charging process or swapped with other one (swapping). If the vehicle has high mobility, such as public transport (bus) then the shortest charging time may be very important. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Buses; Charging (batteries); Climate change; Electric automobiles; Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Petroleum deposits; Pollution; Proven reserves; Trolley cars; Vehicles; Direct charging; Electric trains; Electricity supply; High mobility; Petroleum reserve; Power consumption analysis; Power storage; Public transport; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041642502

Using data that are very close to reality about coal fired power production costs, along with data about power plants' technical constraints, this paper studies the effect of wind power on Fujian's provincial electricity market. Firstly, the paper analyzes the relationship between wind speed and wind power output and the effects of short-term power output fluctuation on frequency modulation and voltage regulation. Secondly, under supposition of the production costs following quadratic functions, the paper analyzes the effects of changes in wind power output on the electricity supply costs under optimal power flow. Thirdly, using the bidding model in the Australian Electricity Market Operator for reference and supposing that, in a competitive market, coal fired power plants can bid 6 price bands according to their capacity, the paper analyzes effects of wind power on electricity prices under optimal power flow, the stabilizing effects of PSHP and the minimum PSHP capacity needed to stabilize the electricity market. Finally, using a daily load curve, this paper simulates the electricity prices' fluctuation under optimal power flow and PSHP's stabilizing effect. The results show that, although PSHP has a large external social welfare effect, it can hardly make a profit.

However, many challenges still need to be overcome before their practical application, especially those that are related to the interfacial instability of Li metal anodes. Here, we reveal for the first time that the thickness of the degradation layer on the metallic Li anode surface shows a linear relationship with Li areal capacity utilization up to 4.0 mAh cm−2 in a practical LMB system. The increase in Li capacity utilization in each cycle causes variations in the morphology and composition of the degradation layer on the Li anode. Under high Li capacity utilization, the current density for charge (i.e., Li deposition) is identified to be a key factor controlling the corrosion of the Li metal anode. These fundamental findings provide new perspectives for the development of rechargeable LMBs. Applications of high-energy-density rechargeable Li metal batteries have been hindered by safety concerns and short cycle life. So far, the research has been conducted with low to medium capacity utilization of the Li metal anode, which is inappropriate in practical battery systems. Here, we investigate the degradation of a Li metal anode in a liquid electrolyte and the long-term cycling stability of Li metal batteries by manipulating Li capacity utilization and charge current density up to practical levels. Higher Li capacity utilization causes more corrosion of the bulk Li metal anode, but the expansion rate of used Li metal anode stays the same at different Li capacity utilization. The increase in charge current density causes more severe corrosion of the Li metal anode, which greatly accelerates cell failure, indicating the charge current density plays a key role in Li metal batteries. These fundamental findings provide practical guidance for the design of next-generation Li metal batteries. Effects of Li capacity utilization up to 4.0 mAh cm−2 and charge current density on the stability of Li metal anodes and Li metal batteries were investigated. The thickness of degradation layer on Li anode surface shows a linear relationship with Li capacity utilization.

We consider that two small base stations (SBSs) use the band from two spectrum owners to provide the uplink wireless transmission service and that two SBSs use a common renewable power supplier (RPS) to forward the uplink traffic. The wireless traffic will be forwarded to a gateway or macrobase station via the backhaul link. We study the system under a decentralized scenario, where SBSs (wireless operator), the spectrum owner, and the green energy supplier interact with each other. We formulate the interaction as a Stackelberg leader-followers game. The operator acts as the Stackelberg leader by choosing the energy and spectrum prices that it will pay to the RPS and the owner, respectively. Then, the RPS and the owner simultaneously determine the renewable energy storage and bandwidth allocation. We prove that for any set of resource prices, there exists a unique Pareto-optimal equilibrium in the followers' resource allocation game. We also show that the wireless network operator's optimal resource prices lie in one of two regions - one that leads to energy and spectrum allocation balance and one that does not. Furthermore, in the centralized system, we present a characterization of the unique optimal solution. The proposed scheme enables the SBSs to jointly decide to use green energy over backhaul links while properly allocating spectrum resources for wireless uplinks. Finally, the results show that the proposed scheme achieves a system performance comparable to that of a centralized solution. © 2013 IEEE.","cognitive radio networks; game theory; Pareto-optimal equilibrium; renewable energy allocation; Spectrum access","Base stations; Costs; Energy policy; Game theory; Gateways (computer networks); Heterogeneous networks; Pareto principle; Wireless networks; Cognitive radio network; Green energy suppliers; Pareto-optimal; Renewable energies; Renewable energy storages; Renewable power suppliers; Spectrum access; Wireless transmissions; Cognitive radio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040947005

All of these visions have one thing in common, i.e., delay sensitivity and instant response. Various new technologies designed to work at the edge of the network, such as fog computing, cloudlets, mobile edge computing, and micro data centers have emerged in the near past. We use the name “edge computing” for this set of emerging technologies. Edge computing is a promising paradigm to offer the required computation and storage resources with minimal delays because of “being near” to the users or terminal devices. Edge computing aims to bring cloud resources and services at the edge of the network, as a middle layer between end user and cloud data centers, to offer prompt service response with minimal delay. Two major aims of edge computing can be denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users’ request at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and uploading the processed information to cloud.

However, it has been established that revenue-maximizing grid-level energy storage tends to increase system emissions in current US electricity grids. In this work, we consider storage operational strategies that value both revenue and CO2 emissions to understand the tradeoffs between these two criteria. We use actual electricity prices and marginal emissions factors in a linear programming model that optimizes operation between annual revenue and CO2 emissions to find the Pareto Frontier for 22 eGRID sub-regions. We find that, in many US regions, marginal storage-induced CO2 emissions can be decreased significantly (25–50%) with little effect on revenue (1–5%). Electricity grids with larger flexibility in daily electricity prices and in marginal emissions factors have more potential to reduce annual storage CO2 emissions at low cost to storage operators. These results show that negative environmental effects of storage operation can be reduced or eliminated at low cost through voluntary or regulatory shifts in operational patterns. © 2017 The Authors","CO2; Electricity system; Energy storage; Marginal emissions","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost reduction; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Linear programming; Electricity demands; Electricity system; Emerging technologies; Linear programming models; Operational flexibility; Operational patterns; Operational strategies; Storage operations; Electric energy storage; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cost analysis; electricity generation; energy market; linear programing; smart grid; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032976668

To facilitate the practical realization of the sodium-ion technology, the energy density of sodium-ion batteries needs to be boosted to the level of current commercial Li-ion batteries. An effective approach would be to elevate the operating voltage of the battery, which requires the use of electrochemically stable cathode materials with high voltage versus Na+/Na. This review summarizes the recent progress with the emerging high-voltage cathode materials for room-temperature sodium-ion batteries, which include layered transitional-metal oxides, Na-rich materials, and polyanion compounds. The key challenges and corresponding strategies for these materials are also discussed, with an emphasis placed on the intrinsic structural properties, Na storage electrochemistry, and the voltage variation tendency with respect to the redox reactions.

The power consumption characteristics of modern power systems are designed to be more flexible and easily controllable, which will also affect the sizing of power generation system. This paper presents a methodology for the joint capacity optimization of a typical residential standalone microgrid (MG) employing RE sources, i.e., solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines (WTs), diesel generators (DGs), and battery energy storage system (BESS). The MG supplies a residential community load comprising of typical residential load plus electric vehicles (EVs) charging load. The realistic mathematical models of PV, WT, diesel generation system, BESS, and EV load are formulated to improve the capacity optimization methodology, which involves various realistic constraints associated with the RE sources, diesel generation system, BESS, and EV load. The labyrinthine optimization problem is formulated and solved innovatively to 1) minimize the cost; 2) reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions; and 3) curtail dump energy. All three objectives have special significance in designing a standalone MG, for example, cost is related to the economics, GHG emissions deal with global warming, and dump energy is related to the stability and economics of the system. The optimization problem is solved for different possible combinations of PV, WT, DG, and BESS to determine the best possible combination to serve the load effectively and economically. In addition, the impact of load shifting on the sizes of distributed generators and BESS in terms of per-unit cost and GHG emissions is analyzed using the concept of controllable loads. This study could be assumed as a powerful roadmap for decision makers, analysts, and policy makers. © 2013 IEEE.","electric vehicles; hybrid generation; Microgrid; optimization; renewable power","Costs; Decision making; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Gas generators; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Optimization; Power generation; Reliability; Solar cells; Solar power generation; System stability; Wind turbines; Battery energy storage systems; Eco-friendly technologies; Hybrid generation; Micro grid; Power generation systems; Power system stability; Renewable Power; Residential communities; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041206334

Due to the low predictive nature, conventional unit commitment with a deterministic optimization algorithm is no long suitable for grids with high RES scale. This paper proposes a coordinated multi-time scale robust scheduling framework for isolated system with energy storage units. The framework decomposes the adjustable dispatch process into three coordinated stages and specifies the operational policy of thermal and hydraulic units. We formulate mathematical models for each dispatch stage and add additional constraints for inter-stage coordination. Then, we develop a multi-stage robust solution based on Bender's decomposition and a cutting plane algorithm. Finally, we test the proposed framework with real data from Nanji Island, China. Compared with traditional scheduling, robust schedule approach can significantly improve the 'robustness' of grids and allow higher RES penetration level. © 2013 IEEE.","Adjustable robust optimization; high RES penetration; isolated island; multi-time scale framework; renewable energy resources; seawater pumped storage system","Digital storage; Energy resources; Energy storage; Forecasting; Gas generators; Optimization; Random processes; Robustness (control systems); Scheduling; Standby power systems; Stochastic systems; Time measurement; Uranium compounds; High RES Penetration; Isolated islands; Multi-time scale; Pumped Storage; Robust optimization; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041011805

Nevertheless, deliberate construction of tunable porous solids with high porosity and high stability remains challenging. Here, we present the successful deployment of reticular chemistry to address this demand: we constructed Cr-soc-MOF-1, a chemically and hydrolytically stable chromium-based metal-organic framework (MOF) with underlying soc topology. Prominently, Cr-soc-MOF-1 offers the requisite thermal and chemical stability concomitant with unique adsorption properties, namely extraordinary high porosity (apparent surface area of 4,549 m2/g) affording a water vapor uptake of 1.95 g/g at 70% relative humidity. This exceptional water uptake is maintained over more than 100 adsorption-desorption cycles. Markedly, the adsorbed water can be fully desorbed by just the simple reduction of the relative humidity at 25°C. Cr-soc-MOF-1 offers great potential for use in applications pertaining to water vapor control in enclosed and confined spaces and dehumidification. The ability to design and construct advanced adsorbent materials with the requisite hydrolytic stability and concurrent ultra-high porosity, affording exceptional adsorbed water uptake with distinct S-shape adsorption-desorption isotherms, will permit the successful deployment of made-to-order adsorbents for water-adsorption-related applications such as moisture control, dehumidification, adsorption-based desalination, and adsorption heating and cooling pumps. Successful positioning of these applications offers great potential to address various United Nations Sustainable Development Goals pertaining to affordable clean water, prosperous health, and reliable and sustainable energy-efficient air-conditioning technologies. Here, we unveil a hydrolytically stable and highly porous MOF, Cr-soc-MOF-1, as a unique adsorbent material for water adsorption applications. Prominently, Cr-soc-MOF-1 captures twice its weight and can address many acute societal and industrial challenges. Hydrolytically stable and highly porous Cr-soc-MOF-1 can capture 200 wt % of water. The exceptional water uptake is maintained over more than 100 adsorption-desorption cycles.

This report describes a general approach for preparing cobalt and iron oxide nanoparticles cosupported on nitrogen-doped carbon materials as an efficient oxygen electrode catalyst with an improved catalytic activity toward OER and ORR; these nanoparticles were obtained through pyrolysis of Co- and Fe-based metal–organic frameworks grown directly on the surface of polyvinylimidazolefunctionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The Fe/Co–CNTs-800 catalyst pyrolyzed at 800 8C exhibited high electrocatalytic activity for ORR, with only ~50 mV lesser activity than that of Pt/C at the half-wave potential, and for OER, with only ~70 mV lesser activity than that of RuO2 at a current density of 10 mA·cm-2 in a 0.1 M KOH solution. The potential difference between OER and ORR for Fe/Co–CNTs-800 (ΔEOER–ORR) was 0.905 V, which was significantly lower than that for noble-metal catalysts (20 wt% Pt/C (1.137 V) and RuO2 (1.341 V)). The preparation temperature and value of Fe/Co in the catalyst composite are crucial for achieving high electrocatalytic activity for both ORR and OER. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Therefore, it is critical to determine the appropriate sizes of RE sources and associated energy storage for efficient, economic and reliable operation of electric power system. In this study, two constraintbased iterative search algorithms are proposed for optimal sizing of the wind turbine (WT), solar photovoltaic (PV) and the battery energy storage system (BESS) in the grid-connected configuration of a microgrid. The first algorithm, named as sources sizing algorithm, determines the optimal sizes of RE sources while the second algorithm, called as battery sizing algorithm, determines the optimal capacity of BESS. These algorithms are mainly based upon two key essentials, i.e. maximum reliability and minimum cost. The proposed methodology aims to avoid over-And under-sizing by searching every possible solution in the given search space. Moreover, it considers the forced outage rates of PV, WT and utilisation factor of BESS which makes it more realistic.

However, the energy problem remains one of the core barriers preventing an increase in investment in this technology. In this paper, we propose a new technique to resolve the problems due to limited energy sources. Using a quaternary transceiver (in the architecture on a sensor node), instead of a binary one, which will use the amplitude/phase, modulator/demodulator units to increase the number of bits transmitted per symbol. The system will reduce the consumption of energy in the transmission phase due to the increased bits transmitted per symbol.

As the technology node scales, especially under 40-nm technology node, STT-MRAM cell design becomes a key issue to approach low power consumption, high access performance, and desirable reliability. The conventional 1T-1 magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) and 2T-2MTJ cell designs cannot address these challenges efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel 3T-3MTJ cell structure using the advanced perpendicular MTJ (p-MTJ) technology. It can store 2 bits with three MTJs. The differential sensing technique can be used to read out the most significant bit as fast as the 2T-2MTJ design. The sensing latency of 2 bits within the same cell is almost the same as the sensing latency of the 1T-1MTJ cell design. Therefore, the 3T-3MTJ cell can have the advantages of both 2T-2MTJ and 1T-1MTJ cells. Circuit-level simulations show that the proposed 3T-3MTJ cell structure can achieve a desirable tradeoff between storage density, access performance, and energy consumption compared to the prior 1T-1MTJ and 2T-2MTJ cell structures. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive cache design based on the 3T-3MTJ cell structure, which can work in different modes to satisfy various memory access demands from different applications. Architecture level simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed cache design. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Adaptive cache design; LLC; sensing circuit design; STT-MRAM","Cache memory; Computer architecture; Electric resistance; Energy utilization; Integrated circuit manufacture; Magnetic devices; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Mathematical models; Memory architecture; Microprocessor chips; MRAM devices; Reliability; Sensors; Tunnel junctions; Tunnels; Cache design; Circuit-level simulation; Low-power consumption; Magnetic tunnel junction; Magnetic tunneling; Most significant bit; Sensing circuits; STT-MRAM; Structural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040567935

Lithium-metal batteries including lithium–sulfur and lithium–oxygen cells have much higher theoretical energy density than lithium-ion batteries. Reckoned as the ideal anode, however, Li has many challenges when directly used, especially its tendency to form dendrite. Under bending conditions, the Li-dendrite growth can be further aggravated due to bending-induced local plastic deformation and Li-filaments pulverization. Here, the Li-metal anodes are made bending tolerant by integrating Li into bendable scaffolds such as reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) films. In the composites, the bending stress is largely dissipated by the scaffolds. The scaffolds have increased available surface for homogeneous Li plating and minimize volume fluctuation of Li electrodes during cycling. Significantly improved cycling performance under bending conditions is achieved. With the bending-tolerant r-GO/Li-metal anode, bendable lithium–sulfur and lithium–oxygen batteries with long cycling stability are realized. A bendable integrated solar cell–battery system charged by light with stable output and a series connected bendable battery pack with higher voltage is also demonstrated. It is anticipated that this bending-tolerant anode can be combined with further electrolytes and cathodes to develop new bendable energy systems. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, in a horizontal well, influenced by the friction caused by the deviated section, jarring effect is poor; on the other hand, the forcing point can be located in the horizontal section by a hydraulic booster and the friction can be reduced, but it is time-consuming and easy to break downhole string using a large-tonnage and constant pull force. A hydraulic booster - jar tool string has been developed for unfreezing operation in horizontal wells. The technical solution involves three elements: a two-stage parallel spring cylinder structure for increasing the energy storage capacity of spring accelerators; multiple groups of spring accelerators connected in series to increase the working stroke; a hydraulic booster intensifying jarring force. The integrated unfreezing tool string based on these three elements can effectively overcome the friction caused by a deviated borehole, and thus unfreeze a stuck string with the interaction of the hydraulic booster and the mechanical jar which form an alternatively dynamic load. Experimental results show that the jarring performance parameters of the hydraulic booster-jar unfreezing tool string for the horizontal wells are in accordance with original design requirements. Then field technical parameters were developed based on numerical simulation and experimental data. Field application shows that the hydraulic booster-jar unfreezing tool string is effective to free stuck downhole tools in a horizontal well, and it reduces hook load by 80% and lessens the requirement of workover equipment. This provides a new technology to unfreeze stuck downhole string in a horizontal well. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Deflected boreholes; Digital storage; Dynamic loads; Friction; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic tools; Tribology; Well workover; Energy storage capacity; Field application; Horizontal section; Hydraulic booster; Original design; Parallel springs; Performance parameters; Technical solutions; Horizontal wells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040717010

These assets can be best utilized with load demand forecasting and/or prediction, especially when considering limits on generator ramp rates, distribution lines, and energy storage capacity. Obtaining future load demand data and designing a controller to accommodate it can be challenging, but with potentially large payoff. However, this information is not useful in all cases. This paper develops a method to quantify the potential value of future information depending on the specific power system characteristics. This quantitative approach aids designers in deciding how and when to deploy future forecasting in controller design, and provides insight into the potential benefits of these more complex controllers. To quantify this trade off, two optimization-based control methods are developed. One uses only current information, while the other has an exact forecast of the future. As examples, the method is applied to a notional naval ship and drill platform service vessel with representative power and energy system architectures under indicative operational load demands. © 2018, Institute of Marine Engineering Science & Technology.

This principle is based on the fact that tree species with outstanding sprouting capacities are able to leaf after being felled and are physiologically active until they have enough water. The course of wood drying (the stems and branches) was examined in relation to their subsequent foliage creation and ongoing evapotranspiration, and how those factors related to other factors (temperature and precipitation). As for stems, the drying process proved to be more effective in samples with buds and less effective in samples without buds. As for branches, the samples with buds had a slightly higher weight in the long-term average, but during the sprouting season their drying was more efficient. These findings may help achieve more efficient handling of the timber from fastgrowing species in relation to their processing and storage. © 2018.","Energy coppices; Poplar; Wood drying/timber seasoning","Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Drying process; Fast-growing species; Higher weight; Populus maximowiczii; Populus nigra; Tree species; Wood drying; Drying; Buds; Drying; Forestry; Populus Maximowiczii; Populus Nigra; Samples; Stems; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090772607

The biorefinery concept is the centre of a bio-based economy, and promising largely waste-free use of biomass, efficient conversion routes, and pathways for the production of energy, biofuels and numerous value added natural products such as natural fine chemicals, polymers, fuels etc. An integrated biorefinery will play an important role in a future bio-economy providing its economic feasibility and socio-environmental sustainability. Multi-product/service biomass processing systems, consisting of sequences including: feedstock handling and storage, pre-treatment (physical, chemical, biological), fractionation to main and co-products, product and co-product upgrading, product & co-product marketing, integrated material /energy /economic flows. Biorefineries are one of the pillars of sustainability as long as they preserve the bioremediation of degraded land and poor crop production i.e. exploitation of coastal wastes. Furthermore, the biorefineries' processing tends to be a zero waste process through the holistic use of renewable resources following the green chemistry principles. Moreover, the biorefineries show a multi-level (industrial and social) profitability producing high value added products, creating employment, supporting by national and European funds. In the frames of biorefining, nowadays there is a worldwide resurgence of interest in the exploitation of marine derived biomass, in the frame of the overall return to the natural resources. This trend is based firstly on the fossil fuel depletion and secondly on the increasing public awareness of the environmental and health hazards related to chemical product. Modified biomass can be widely used for pollution cleaning (as in the case of oil spills) under the frames of biorefinery and sustainable circular bioeconomy. © 2019, Avestia Publishing.","Adsorption; Bioeconomy; Biomass; Biorefinery; Lignocellulosic; Modification; Pollution; Sustainable",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082680714

The first portion of the section will focus on the market theory of how prosumers and consumers seek additional choice for energy production (i.e., what they do with the solar energy they produce) and consumption (i.e., the location and origin of their energy). Enabling a peer-to-peer energy market that values locally produced energy through the use of blockchain transactions, the TAG platform breaks down the initial barriers to greater choice and results in the creation of a real-time, location-based value of energy. TAG also enables peer-to-peer transactions of “energy attributes.” Within a locality such as a neighborhood, prosumers and consumers can transact in efficiency, demand response, and device transactions-leasing short-term use of a neighbor’s energy storage system, for example. The benefits of these peer-to-peer energy markets have driven the rise of community microgrids, which are more renewable, resilient, and self-healing than traditional utility grid infrastructure. The Brooklyn Microgrid and other community Microgrids will be highlighted as real-world examples of how LO3 Energy’s TAG can be applied in a real-world setting. Information will be provided on the history of the projects, the market conditions that fostered the development of community microgrids, and the issues the project team has encountered throughout the process. The chapter will close with a discussion on the future of community microgrids. This will include a deeper dive into the value of system Exergy, the productivity of each unit of energy, and how each transaction across a utility network should be influenced by the distance-and therefore amount of infrastructure needed-between production and consumption. Reducing the overhead costs normally associated with energy production (loss of efficacy through distance, cost of infrastructure, etc.), equates to a more efficient and ultimately, higher valued transaction and distribution system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As a part of a stock rehabilitation research effort, we conducted a live-food enrichment experiment examining the influence of dietary essential fatty acids (EFAs) on growth, survival, lipid storage, and stress resistance of red king crab larvae. Artemia nauplii are a convenient live-food but are naturally low in EFAs. We fed red king crab larvae Artemia that were enriched with four different fatty acid (FA) treatments: 1) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), 2) DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), 3) DHA and arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6), and 4) oleic acid (OA, 18:1n-9). The OA treatment represented a monounsaturated FA (MUFA) control, with similar total lipid but no polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Percentages of EFAs in crabs were different among all dietary treatments during the fourth zoea (Z4), glaucothoe (G), and first juvenile crab (C1) stages. Larval weights did not vary among dietary groups from Z1 to Z4, and C1 stages, whereas G-stage crabs were heavier in the DHA and EPA treatment. Survival did not vary across treatments but visual condition indices (size and number of lipid droplets) at the G stage were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in crabs from both the DHA and EPA and DHA and AA treatments, compared to those in either the DHA or the OA treatment. Total FAs (μg mg-1) during the G stage were also significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) in individuals fed the OA diet. The performance of G-stage crabs in the OA control treatment was reduced, as they recovered more slowly from a salinity stress test than individuals in the EFA groups. Biochemical and visual method of assessing lipid storage agree and confirm that elevated dietary EFAs resulted in increased growth, energy storage, and stress resistance, but not increased survival during early ontogeny. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

In this work, nickel-cobalt-molybdenum metal oxide (NCMO) nanosheets with hierarchical, porous structures were directly developed on nickel foam (NF) through a hydrothermal method and ensuing annealing treatment. Electrochemical tests in three-electrode configurations revealed that the as-prepared NCMO nanosheets possessed high specific capacitance (1366 F g-1 at the current density of 2 A g-1), good rate capability (71.3% at the current density of 40 A g-1), as well as excellent cycling stability (89.75% retention after 5000 cycles). Additionally, a hybrid supercapacitor was assembled and achieved an energy density of 46.2 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 713Wkg-1. Based on the systematic analysis of microstructure, morphology, and element compositions, the excellent electrochemical performance of the NCMO nanosheets could be attributed to the mesoporous feature, desirable compositions, excellent mechanical and electrical contacts, and fast ion/electron transportation rates.

At present, SMOC undertakes various missions as follows, Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) and Quantum Experiments at Space Scale (QUESS) are in the phase of in-orbit operation, while the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT), launched on June 2017, is in commissioning phase. All of them are parts of the CAS’s Space Science Strategic Priority Programs. The payload of DAMPE is composed of four sub-detectors. HXMT is Chinese first astronomical satellite. It will perform a broad band (1-250 keV) all-sky survey, in which a large number of massive black holes and other high energy objects will be detected. The payloads onboard HXMT include the High Energy X-ray Telescope, the Medium Energy X-ray Telescope, the Low Energy X-ray Telescope, as well as a Space Environment Monitor. The task of data transmission’s planning and scheduling is solved via multiplexing of time period. This kind of strategy is easy and robust which can guarantee the accuracy of data transmission task’s planning and execution while the staff of mission operation can easily master related skills. The frequency of the next seven-day data transmission station resource allocation is once a week for DAMPE, while the plan for the next day is determined daily for QUESS. To solve this problem, we noticed that the time of satellite’s passing territory is due to periodicity of satellite orbits. According to this, we could construct ground station multiplexing model and the scheduling model. Next, the permutation and combination of the station receiving time window would be calculated using the dynamic programming strategy. And the confliction of the ground station resources in receiving multi-satellites and multi-missions is overall considered and conclude the selective multiplexing schema list of data transmission resource. Then, considering the satellite’s data storage capacity and data transmission capacity, the model and the best evaluation technique is used to evaluate the multi-transmission solution on the arrangement of the ground station resources. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

These multi-physics subsystems often have opportunities for performing an energy storage role during their operation cycle. The kinetic energy stored in the rotating mass of a generator set or the electrical energy stored in a railgun pulse forming network are but two examples of energy storage aboard warships. Treating each subsystem as a disconnected entity reduces the potential for exploiting their inherent interactions and results in over-designed shipboard systems with excessive weight and volume. Exergy-the amount of energy available for performing useful work-provides a path for exploiting multi-physics energy flows. Utilizing the Second Law of Thermodynamics, by modeling and minimizing exergy destruction, a recent study, showed that exergy control increased the overall efficiency by 18% over traditional optimization techniques when applied to a terrestrial HVAC application. In this paper a notional, multi-physics ship power system is developed that explicitly captures the exergy flows. Particular attention is given to exergy destruction phenomena. Simulation of the system illustrates operational characteristics with greatest impact on exergy destruction highlighting areas for applying optimal, exergy-based control schemes. This approach will allow ship designers to minimize the size and weight of installed power generation, energy storage and thermal management systems, enabling the affordable implementation of advanced weapons and sensors. © 2018, Institute of Marine Engineering Science & Technology.

Among known polymers, poly(vinylidene fluoride-ter-trifluoroethylene-ter-chlorofluoroethylene) P(VDF-TrFECFE) is one of the promising materials for energy storage capacitor applications because of its high dielectric constant. Nevertheless, it suffers from high dielectric loss especially at the high electric field, which suppresses its breakdown strength and energy storage density. Herein, sandwiched structure dielectric films were fabricated by employing polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as the outer layer and P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) as the central layer. By modulating the thickness of the central layer, an enhanced discharged energy density of 7.03 J/cm3 is achieved at a high electric field of 480 MV/m, which is 132% more than that of P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) at its maximum electric field 300 MV/m. Meanwhile, this sandwiched structure film also retains a high discharge efficiency of 78% at 480 MV/m, which is never been seen in polyvinylidene fluoride-based polymers.

Deposits of SC are located in central industrial regions, the coal has high fuel indexes and can soon definitely get its share in blended fuels which will meet the standards of Ukraine and will be qualified for use at modern Thermal power plant (TPPs). In order to determine the rational ways of involving salty coal in the burning processes, the world practices widely use the detailed studies of the impact of natural mineral substances on the processes of slagging, sticking and corrosion in case of the burning of such coal. Purpose. To determine the composition of natural water-soluble minerals in coal which cause a number of burning problems using non-destructive methods, a comparative analysis of the composition of mineral phases in SC from various deposits in Ukraine, to assess their slagging ability, and overview the prospects of utilizing flushing water generated during coal desalting. Methodology. Applying the technological regimes of desalting developed by the authors, water extracts of SC have been obtained, which are investigated using a non-destructive X-ray diffraction method of dry substances (device DRON 4M), the composition of mineral phases of SC extracts is studied with the MATCH! program. Total content of salts and their removal efficiency are estimated using the 4805 Conductivity TDS/Temp indicator/EZODO. findings. The composition and peculiarities of the mineral phases from extracts of salty coals of different domestic deposits are determined. The fouling factor of SCs of different deposits in Ukraine was calculated from the chemical composition of ash; a comparison was made with the data of world sources. It is shown that even with a close value of the sodium oxide content in the ashes, salty coals of different deposits differ significantly regarding the assortment (from 2 to 5 varieties are found) of native water-soluble minerals and their ratio. It is shown that in aqueous extracts from two samples of salty coals it is the sulfate is the prevailing mineral, not halite. Originality. For the first time, a comparative semi-quantitative analysis of the native mineral phases in dry water extracts of SC from three Ukrainian deposits was performed; data on the conditions for efficient coal desalting was summarized. The contamination factor for SC from various deposits in Ukraine is determined, comparison with world sources data is performed. Prospects for disposal (storage) of flushing waters generated during salty coal preparation for energy use are considered. Practical value. The detailed study of dry water extracts and obtained composition of mineral phases allowed predicting: 1) the formation of low fusible eutectics in the process of burning of domestic salt coals and the determination of special process conditions that prevent slagging; 2) the behavior of mixed fuels of SCs with coals marked with significant presence of refractory compounds; 3) the choice of such mineral impurities including industrial wastes that reduce the risk of slagging and corrosion when burning domestic salty coals. © Fateyev A.

Here, we demonstrate that the atomistic molecular dynamic simulations can be successfully used to design well-defined polymer systems as well as to examine their structural and dynamical properties. More specifically, we study the behaviour of graphene-based nanocomposites and nanostructured polymer materials. We provide a detailed analysis adapted to every system with a special focus on detecting the local heterogeneities in the material. Our carefully developed method allows us to shed light on the relation between the local structure and final properties of the desired material.

Its morphology was characterized via the scanning electron microscope (SEM), the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), N 2 adsorption analysis, and X-ray powder diffraction, respectively. The mesoporous nickel-based complex electrodes using substrate coating exhibited excellent energy storage properties through electrochemical testing. The high specific capacitance of 739.8 F g −1 was achieved at the current density of 1 A g −1 in a 6 M KOH solution. The good capacitance retention can retain 72.8% after 1000 cycles in a current density of 1 A g −1 . The energy storage mechanism of the nickel-based complex electrodes was also analyzed. Furthermore, the asymmetrical supercapacitors (ASCs) were fabricated using the zeolite capsule complex with Fe 3 O 4 as positive electrodes and the AC as negative electrodes, which performs high specific capacitance, outstanding energy density, superb power density, excellent cycle life, and small internal impedance.

In this paper, it is shown that Reed-Solomon (RS) code can be used to implement stream cipher, which is widely used for error corrections of data in transmission and storages. The proposed stream cipher combine the keys with the messages, and conceals the cipher within the erroneous RS code. Then at the receiving part the cipher can be checked out by RS decoding, leaving the information unchanged. There are several advantages with this scheme: First, compared with the usual stream cipher including two engines, only one engine is required, making the synchronization of the stream cipher and messages easily. In the situation, the stream cipher and the messages are held as a whole while the alignment of stream cipher is not needed. Thus the usual power consumptions for synchronization and key generation at the receiving part can be saved. Second, the stream cipher increases the security level by adding the difficulty of decoding a random linear RS code, which stores the key streams like public key cryptography. Since the RS encoding and decoding modules are already included in many computer systems or devices, the new scheme may be implemented by reconfiguration rather than extra hardware units. Compared with generalized RS code for code-based public-key cryptography like McEliece system, it uses systematic encoding instead of nonsystematic encoding, which decreases the power overhead. Unlike the encryption by public keys and decryption by private keys of McEliece system, it encrypts messages by private keys from stream cipher and decrypts texts by public keys implemented in the RS decoder. © 2018 Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems.All right reserved.","Public-key cryptography; Reed-Solomon code; Stream cipher",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061840850

The different industrial uses of lithium are discussed in this review along with a compilation of the locations of the main geological sources of lithium. An emphasis is placed on lithium's use in lithium ion batteries and their use in the electric vehicle industry. The electric vehicle market is driving new demand for lithium resources. The expected scale-up in this sector will put pressure on current lithium supplies. The European Union has a burgeoning demand for lithium and is the second largest consumer of lithium resources. Currently, only 1-2% of worldwide lithium is produced in the European Union (Portugal). There are several lithium mineralisations scattered across Europe, the majority of which are currently undergoing mining feasibility studies. The increasing cost of lithium is driving a new global mining boom and should see many of Europe's mineralisation's becoming economic.

Organisms characterized by a complex life cycle, undergoing an ontogenetic niche shift, can reduce predation risk on natal stages by metamorphosing earlier. Yet, this antipredatory response may incur numerous life-history-related costs. Interestingly, the consequence of larval predation risk on adult dispersal, a key trait dictating the persistence of spatially structured populations, is largely understudied. Here, we explored the effect of larval predation risk on the life-history and dispersal characteristics of female adults in the mosquito Culex pipiens. As predicted, mosquito larvae reared in the presence of a caged larvivorous-fish metamorphosed earlier, while also suffering from reduced survival. Despite this reduction in development time, the body size of emerging females was larger, implying that more resources were allocated to increase the growth rate, probably at the expense of reduced maintenance and storage. This shift in energy allocation translated into decreased pupa and adult survival. Remarkably, the respective dispersal distance of these larger bodied females was greater. We suggest that the increase in dispersal distance allows these females to cover larger areas, while searching for oviposition sites that are safer than their natal aquatic habitat. Exploring the effects of larval conditions on adult dispersal is central for understanding the distribution of organisms with a complex life cycle in spatially heterogeneous environments, and specifically for disease transmission by mosquitoes. © 2018 The Author(s).","Complex life cycle; Dispersal; Energy allocation; Life-history traits; Mosquitoes; Predation risk","aquatic environment; body size; disease transmission; dispersal; dispersion; female; growth rate; life cycle; life history trait; mosquito; predation risk; resource allocation; survival; Culex pipiens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059126603

However, their dispatch is not well investigated. This paper implements resilient routing and scheduling of MPSs via a two-stage framework. In the first stage, i.e., before the event, MPSs are pre-positioned in the DS to enable rapid pre-restoration, in order to enhance survivability of the electricity supply to critical loads. DS network is also proactively reconfigured into a less impacted or stressed state. A two-stage robust optimization model is constructed and solved by the column-and-constraint generation algorithm to derive first-stage decisions. In the second stage, i.e., after the event, MPSs are dynamically dispatched in the DS to coordinate with conventional restoration efforts, so as to enhance system recovery. A novel mixed-integer programming model that resolves different timescales of MPS dispatch and DS operation, coupling of road and power networks, etc., is formulated to optimize dynamic dispatch of MPSs. Case studies conducted on IEEE 33-node and 123-node test systems demonstrate the proposed method&#x2019;s effectiveness in routing and scheduling MPSs for DS resilience enhancement.

A more recent development is the ability to produce porous carbon materials with tuneable properties for electrochemical applications, which has enabled new research directions towards the production of suitable carbon materials for energy storage applications. Thus, this work explores the activation of carbon from polyaniline (PANI) using a less-corrosive potassium carbonate (K2CO3) salt, with different mass ratios of PANI and the activating agent (K2CO3 as compared to commonly used KOH). The obtained activated carbon exhibits a specific surface area (SSA) of up to ∼1700 m2 g−1 for a carbon derived PANI : K2CO3 ratio of 1 : 6. Moreover, the prepared samples were tested as electrode materials for supercapacitors with the results showing excellent electrical double layer capacitor behavior. Charge storage was still excellent for scan rates of up to 2000 mV s−1, and a capacitance retention of 70% at a very high specific current of 50 A g−1 was observed. Furthermore, the fabricated device can deliver an energy density of 25 W h kg−1 at a specific current of 0.625 A g−1 and a power density of 260 W kg−1 in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bistrifluorosulfonylimide (EMIM-TFSI) ionic liquid, with excellent rate capability after cycling for 16 000 cycles at 3.0 V with ∼98% efficiency.

These materials act as optical batteries that store and gradually release energy supplied during optical charging. As the energy is stored, or 'trapped', at specific defect sites in the host lattice, a clear understanding of the defects and trapping mechanisms in these materials is important for systematic improvement of their properties. Here, the thermoluminescence and afterglow properties of the near-infrared (NIR) emitting persistent phosphor LiGa5O8:Cr3+ (LGO:Cr) are studied. This phosphor is used as a model system for illustrating a more general approach to reliably derive trap depth distributions in persistent luminescent and storage materials. The combination of the Tstop-Tmax method with initial rise analysis is used to experimentally determine the presence of a broad distribution of trapping states. Computerized glow curve fitting is subsequently used to extract the relevant trapping parameters of the system in a rigorous, consistent manner, by fitting all the experimentally recorded data simultaneously. The resulting, single set of model parameters is able to describe all measured thermoluminescence and afterglow data and hence can be used to predict afterglow and storage properties of the phosphor under various conditions. The methods to analyze and describe the trap structure of the persistent phosphor LGO:Cr are straightforwardly applicable for other persistent and storage phosphors and result in a reliable determination of the relevant trapping parameters of a given material. © 2018 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058490445

The intelligent microgrid consists of several distributed generators (DGs), energy storage units, loads and intelligent control units. A distributed economic dispatch algorithm is proposed based on the leader-follower consensus and the average-consensus protocols. The average power mismatch of all buses of the whole microgrid is iteratively estimated by the average-consensus algorithm. After each iteration, the increment of power is adjusted by the energy router. By algebraic graph theory and limit theory, it is proved that if the network topology of the energy internet contains a spanning tree with the energy router as the root node, then the algorithm ensures that the incremental costs (ICs) of all distributed generators tend to the electricity price obtained by the energy router, the balance of energy supply and demand is asymptotically achieved for the whole microgrid system, and the economic dispatch is asymptotically optimal. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2018","Consensus Algorithm; Economic Dispatch; Energy Internet; Multi-Agent System","Distributed power generation; Economics; Electric energy storage; Graph algorithms; Intelligent agents; Iterative methods; Microgrids; Multi agent systems; Scheduling; Topology; Trees (mathematics); Average-consensus protocol; Consensus algorithms; Distributed generator (DGs); Economic Dispatch; Economic dispatch problems; Energy internet; Intelligent control unit; Leader-follower consensus; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058465680

It is necessary for NPPs to participate in the peak load regulation in valley load period. Equivalent peak load regulation (EPLR) of NPPs can be realized by taking advantage of flexible power units or energy storage equipment. In this paper, a two-stage dispatch strategy is proposed to realize EPLR of NPPs as well as to ensure the peak load regulation enthusiasm of power generation groups (PGGs) with flexible power equipment.

Additionally building designs need to solve a complex task combining energy and environmental requirements, as well as social and economic performance requirements in one architectural object. Therefore when constructing new generation buildings, there is a necessity to seek for new strategies for inspiration. In this respect nature plays a core role for such inspiration. However, the process whereby one can integrate nature-inspired processes in building applications faces problems via the technical evaluation of such strategies. This research proposes a multi-criteria analysis methodology combining Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods in order to select the best nature-inspired strategies for climate adaptive building shells. Based on the methodology, four nature strategies are analysed regarding seven thermodynamic criteria: heat loss in the thermal envelope, heat loss in air exchange, thermal inertia and solar heat gains, energy storage, energy production and changing surface characteristics. The proposed selection methodology allows architects and engineers to screen the most appropriate nature inspired strategy to be applied for energy efficiency in buildings taking into account a set of technical criteria.

However, superheater corrosion induced by large amounts of alkali chloride (KCl) and SO 2 released from MSW during combustion remains a major challenge. In this study, a novel kinetic model was developed to study the corrosion behavior of pure Fe-metal and the reaction pathways using chemkin-PRO and Gaussian 09. The model relies on detailed high-temperature interactions between gaseous potassium, O/H radicals, chlorine/sulfur species, and the Fe-metal. The rate coefficients for the surface reactions were estimated based on density functional theory computations using several Fe clusters that represented the Fe metal surface. The model was validated by the experimental results obtained from well-controlled simulated corrosion tests conducted in an electrically heated furnace at 500°C with each test lasted for 50hours. The exposure conditions consisted of 0-600mg KCl which was preheated and its gas was injected into the furnace, 0-1700ppm SO 2 , 20vol.% H 2 O, 8vol.% O 2 , and N 2 as the carrier gas. Comparison of the kinetic model and the experimental data showed there was a good agreement. The results revealed that increasing KCl concentration accelerated the corrosion rate of Fe with a parabolic rate law. The concentration of SO 2 &gt; 500ppm enhanced the rate of corrosion of Fe, concentrations between 250-500ppm reduced the corrosion rate, and the concentration &lt; 250ppm had less effects. The reaction series that replenished the Cl radicals and KSO 3 Cl promoted the high corrosion rates while reaction path that forms sulfate suppresses it.

Chinese government presented proposals of the electrical energy substitute of the fossil fuels to solve the problem. However, the wide applications of electric heating utilities expose the reliability of the electrical grids on the production and transmission side particularly in extreme cold days. In this paper, we studied heating loads and electric load behaviors of an air source heat pump of a case-study suburban residential building of Beijing, China in wintertime in 2016. Firstly, we choose three characteristic days for heating loads analysis, i.e. the coldest, the warmest, and the medium day. Secondly, heating loads of the case-study building were calculated by a building energy simulation program, which is based on a coupled weather data and the building energy transfer. Hourly heating loads of the case-study building in the three characteristic days were studied based on the weather analyses. Thirdly, the electric load behaviors of the air source heat pump used for room heating were investigated. The COP of the heat pump under different operating conditions was calculated. The peak loads and the electric load fluctuations of the heat pump in wintertime were analyzed. This work provided a valuable database on heating loads and electric loads for warm in suburban area in Beijing, so as to help to achieve the electric grid safety. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we used the theoretical generation performance standard (GPS) to evaluate the carbon inputs and outputs of the five major Chinese power groups. We predicted their 2017, 2020, and 2030 performances using a grey prediction model based on 2011-2016 data, and then applied the GPS model to calculate the target year distributions of carbon emissions, finally employing a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to evaluate the effectiveness of these allocations. The carbon trading evaluations and carbon emission reduction potentials of the five major power groups differed; governmental policy must distinguish among these groups. The DEA showed that China Datang Corporation (in 2017, 2020 and 2030), China Huadian Corporation (in 2017, 2020), China Guodian Corporation (in 2017, 2020) and State Power Investment (in 2017, 2020 and 2030) are invalid. Thus, there is much room for improvement in carbon emission efficiency. To ensure reductions in carbon emissions, it is essential to improve the coal consumption efficiencies. China Datang Corporation, China Huadian Corporation, China Guodian Corporation and State Power Investment should reduce coal consumption in 2020; while China Datang Corporation and State Power Investment should reduce coal consumption in 2030. To reduce carbon emissions via rational allocation of quotas, the government must impose higher standards on carbon- and energy-intensive industries; support clean energy by formulating preferential fiscal and tax policies; encourage the development of renewable energy technology; encourage enterprises to strengthen technical cooperation; seek breakthroughs in transition and energy emission reduction technology; and enhance the carbon emission efficiency of electric power enterprises.

As an effective carrier for coordinated conversion and coordinated and efficient operation among different energy quality and diversified energy varieties, the integrated energy system is gaining more and more attention and policy support. In this paper, according to the heating and power supply requirements of the park-type integrated energy system during the heating period, a mixed-integer model for optimal scheduling of the system is proposed. The model chooses two types of economic and environmental goals, and comprehensively considers the balance between supply and demand of the hourly load and the operational characteristics of each energy supply device. Especially, the model takes into account the water distribution rules of the heating supply system. Finally, a typical day is selected to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The result shows that, compared to its environmental operation, the system's economic operation has 18.7% of cost saving while has a 3.4% of more energy consumption. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, since the fluctuation characteristics and low energy density characteristics of wind power, energy storage might be inefficient when reducing the wind curtailment from a single wind farm and the regulation capability of energy storage system (ESS) may not be fully utilized. Based on theoretical analysis the externality effect of energy storage is revealed in this paper, the control strategy of energy storage externality for reducing wind curtailment from wind farm cluster is established. By simulating analysis, the feasibility of the energy storage externality is verified. Moreover, by comparing with the conventional ESS control method, the paper evaluates the efficiency of the control strategy. The simulation results prove it can expand the influence scope of ESS and reduce more wind curtailment from wind farm cluster, the utilization of ESS is also promoted significantly.

These reservoirs cover a surface of approximately 265.7 thousand km2 with the potential to host 4400 GW of floating photovoltaic (PV) power plants at 25% reservoir surface coverage and generate approximately 6270 TWh of electricity. This capacity can be extended to 5700 GW and about 8000 TWh of electricity if all reservoirs (hydropower and for other purposes) are covered at 25%, in both cases generating already more electricity than hydropower from reservoirs at about 2510 TWh. The flexibility of operation of hydro reservoir based power plants and their current connection to grids facilitates a ""virtual battery"" consisting of supplying the electricity demand with solar energy during peak irradiation hours, while balancing grids with hydropower during low/no irradiation times and providing a zero impact area for PV power plant deployment.

This model has good performance in solving the cross coupling problem. The simulation results indicate that the proposed optimization mathematical model has good dispatching performance on reducing coal consumption.

The results show that companies are most concerned about four policy attributes, policies at the national level, transition of CDM projects, compliance period and flexible mechanism. The ideal policy alternative should distribute directly the tradable units to companies, co-exist with the clean developing mechanism, have longer compliance period and allow companies to bank or borrow the tradable units. The sectors with lower competition level, advanced production technologies and lower energy intensity should be given to priority when taking part in the international market mechanism.

Meanwhile, the energy providers need to make informed decisions based on power consumption strategy of demand side to reduce overall operational cost. So how to generate demand side load data based on historical energy consumption data or customer attribute is a pressing issue. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to generate new power consumption data based on intrinsic property of load pattern learnt from demand side using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), which is based on two interconnected deep neural networks known as generator and discriminator. By using several representative labels from the responded surveys and the load data from demand side to train the models, the generator is able to generate realistic power consumption data by given labels which can be used for energy management and scheduling, the discriminator is capable of detecting abnormal power consumption and system error from the smart meter data.

Waste heat becomes becomes sparsely available and only at low temperatures. In addition, the battery requires a narrow temperature window. Within the Austrian flagship-project Tes4seT, a novel thermal management based on a compact thermal storage is developed for hybrid vehicles. A sorption closed thermal energy storage system is designed for this application, targeting at both high energy density and high power density. In a hybrid vehicle, waste heat from the combustion engine may be used to charge the thermal storage. These requirements and the corresponding temperature levels motivate a storage system design involving a fixed bed heat exchanger coated with SAPO-34. A thermal energy storage system is designed, assembled and investigated experimentally in a dedicated test rig.

Based on the measured meteorological data of Nanjing's daily average temperature and total electricity consumption in recent years, the method of degree days is used to estimate the demand for heating in winter and refrigeration in summer due to climate change. Moreover, we analyze the quantitative relationship between the degree days of heating/cooling and social electricity load requirements. The results reveal the heating degree days in winter increase first and then decrease, and the cooling degree days in summer decrease first and then increase during the period of 2011-2017. The air conditioning days in summer is most closely related to the total electricity consumption and the coefficient of correlation is above 0.7. While, the linear correlation between the number of air conditioning days and the total electricity consumption in the winter season is not significant. The correlation coefficient is only 0.2. It's obviously the change of degree days is closely related to the temperature change. As the typical representative place of the hot summer and cold winter regions, the average temperature of Nanjing continues to rise in recent years. This also confirms that more electricity is used at higher temperatures in summer due to refrigeration and air conditioning. Correspondingly, electricity consumption via space heating is decreased due to higher temperature in winner. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed that processing capacity, organic pollutant concentration, discharge standard and economic factors have major effects on energy efficiency.

So far, the viability and reliability of vehicle-to-grid(V2G) has become a very popular research topic. Previous studies mainly focused on the maximum potential of V2G capacity, which, however, is usually unrealistic to achieve. The potential capacity of V2G is relevant to the size of batteries and the penetration rates of electric vehicle. This article developed an agent-based model to estimate the real amount of electricity that vehicles can discharge to the grid. Three battery sizes under the penetration rate of 90% and the penetration rate from 10% to 90% were investigated. The results show that the increase of battery capacity led to an increase of V2G potential capacity from 1650.2 kW to 1868.5 kW and that increase from 10% to 90% in penetration rate could account for V2G potential capacity change from 162.8 kW to 1650.2 kW.

Simulations using an hourly resolved model define the roles of storage technologies in a least cost system configuration. The investigated technologies are batteries, pumped hydro storage, adiabatic compressed air energy storage, thermal energy storage, and power-to-gas technology. Modelling proceeds from 2015 to 2050 in five-year time steps, and considers current power plant capacities, their corresponding lifetimes, and current and projected electricity demand to determine an optimal mix of plants needed to achieve a 100% RE power system by 2050. This optimization is carried out with regards to the assumed costs and technological status of all technologies involved. The total power capacity required by 2050, shares of resources, and storage technologies are defined. Results indicate that the levelised cost of electricity falls from a current level of 69 €/MWh e to 51 €/MWh e in 2050 through the adoption of low cost RE power generation, improvements in efficiency, and expanded power interconnections. Additionally, flexibility of and stability in the power system are provided by increasing shares of energy storage solutions over time, in parallel with expected price decreases in these technologies. Total storage requirements include up to 3320 GWh e of batteries, 396 GWh e of pumped hydro storage, and 218,042 GWh gas of gas storage (8% for synthetic natural gas and 92% for biomethane) for the time period depending on the scenario. The cost share of levelised cost of storage in the total levelised cost of electricity increases from less than 2 €/MWh (2% of total) to 16 €/MWh (28% of total) over the same time. Outputs of power-to-gas begin in 2020 when renewable energy generation reaches 50% in the power system, increasing to a total of 44 TWh gas in 2050.

Energy security is an important situation in which the system can function optimally and sustainably, free from risks and threat. Part of the energy security consideration is the discussion about different energy system elements. And one of the most important elements of the RE system is storage. The aim of this work is to analyse energy storage technologies from an energy security perspective. Different storage technologies are studied. The portfolio of the technologies include: Pump Hydro Storage (PHS), Thermal Energy Storage (TES), batteries, Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES), and bulk storage for gas and liquid (biogas, H2, CH4, CO2, O2, liquefied gases, biodiesel, synthetic fuels, etc.) relevant for the energy transition. The results show clearly that not all storage technologies obtain the same level of energy security; TES is considered to have the highest level of security, and then the other storage technologies come in order from the highest to the lowest: batteries, gas/liquid storage, PHS, and the least secure energy storage technology is A-CAES. The conclusion is that all storage technologies show a positive relationship with energy security and all increase energy security, albeit at different levels. Therefore, it is recommended that manufacturers, energy system planners and policy makers adopt and improve storage technologies based on the need and the security of the system. © 2018 The Authors.

The research of battery life involves many disciplines. The aging process is affected by many factors, such as temperature, discharge depth, charge and discharge rate and operation condition. In this paper, the nonlinear capacity degradation of ternary Li-ion batteries is studied. By data-driven prediction methods, the RUL prediction model of ternary Li-ion batteries under coupling stress based on SVR is established by 6 sets of coupling stress experimental data, and through another set of coupled stress test verifies the correctness of the proposed model.By the model,the RUL can be estimated accurately,which can guarantee the safe operation of the locomotive and so on.

When the quadricyclane derivatives are catalyzed, they are converted back to the norbornadiene derivatives for next cycle. The storage and releasing cycle are eco-friendly without CO2 emission. The rest of solar energy, which cannot be used in the solar photochemical process, are exploited by solar thermochemical process, providing heat for methanol decomposition. It is demonstrated that solar photochemical efficiency increases firstly and then it decreases with the increase of cut-off wavelength, while the solar thermochemical efficiency declines with the cut-off wavelength rising.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is widely seen as a possibility to continue fossil power generation while contributing to CO 2 abatement. In future energy systems with high shares of fluctuating renewable energy generation, nuclear power will become increasingly important for power generation. The development of natural gas power is considered as one of effective ways to reduce emissions and socio-economic costs as well. As a measure to establish a climate-friendly energy system, a power system research on coordinated development of nuclear and natural gas power would be considered. Therefore, future electrical power scenarios aimed at environmental and economic effects for China would considered a full mix of energy options. Based on the LEAP tool, this paper establishes a bottom-up model (LEAP-China-Power) to simulate different electric power planning policy scenarios that could be enacted from 2012 to 2050. In addition to a baseline scenario, we design CCS scenario and nuclear and Natural Gas Combined Cycle(N&amp;N) scenario. The results indicate that N&amp;N scenario is superior to CCS scenario.

Simulations of the system transition from 2015 to 2050 were performed using an hourly resolved model that defines the roles of storage technologies in a least cost system configuration. Investigated technologies are batteries, pumped hydro storage, adiabatic compressed air energy storage, thermal energy storage, and power-to-gas. Modelling proceeds in five-year time steps, and considers current energy system assets and projected demands to determine the optimal technology mix needed to achieve 100% RE electricity by 2050. This optimization is carried out under the assumed cost and status of all technologies involved. Results indicate the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) falls from 60 €/MWhe to 45 €/MWhe over time through adoption of low cost RE power generation and from inter-regional grid interconnection. Additionally, power system flexibility and stability are provided by ample resources of storable bioenergy, hydropower, inter-regional power transmission, and increasing shares of energy storage, together with expected price decreases in storage technologies. Total storage requirements include 0-238 GWhe of batteries, 19 GWhe of pumped hydro storage, and 0-16,652 GWhgas of gas storage. The cost share of storage in total LCOE increases from under 1 €/MWh to up to 10 €/MWh over time. Outputs of power-to-gas begin in 2040 when RE generation approaches a share of 100% in the power system, and total no more than 2 GWhgas due to the relatively large roles of bioenergy and hydropower in the system, which preclude the need for high amounts of additional seasonal storage. A 100% RE system can be an economical and efficient solution for the Baltic Sea Region, one that is also compatible with climate change mitigation targets set out at COP21.

In order to minimize the imbalance between the active output of wind farm and the reference value, a power automatic control strategy for wind farm was proposed in the paper, which is considered the dispatching of safe operation of grid and the number of start and stop of wind turbines. The wind turbines in the wind farm were divided into three different categories according to the output characteristics and operation state of the wind turbines. By combining with the energy storage control of wind farm, the selection of power regulation turbines was carried out while considering the constraints such as the climbing rate and the power distribution value of the wind turbines. the proposed method effectiveness was verified with simulation example analysis, which could take full account of the individual information of wind turbines and make the output power adjustment of wind farm reach the optimization effect both in economy and safety.

As urban population increases, water resources must be drained from a larger watershed and delivered through longer pipelines. Additionally, the requirements of water purification techniques are being raised, and higher building height poses challenges to water distribution. All these factors have caused evident changes in the energy use in the water supply system. Estimation of the energy used in the water supply system is one of the bases for low-carbon city construction and assessments. This paper provides a method for assessing the energy use by a water system in an urban area and performs a case study for Beijing, China. This study investigated the urban water supply system of Beijing from 1979 to 2017 by collecting data of water sources, water treatment techniques, delivery pipelines, water pressure, and seepage rates. It estimated the energy use per cubic unit of water in the water supply system and plotted the trend through time. The results showed that the energy use per cubic unit of water supply in Beijing increased from 0.30 KWh to 0.65 KWh from 1979 to 2014. After the commissioning of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in 2014, the energy use per cubic unit water was altered structurally and remained steady, because the water transported by the project replaced groundwater and reduced the electricity requirement for pumping. The results demonstrate that the South-to-North Water Diversion Project significantly helps Beijing reduce carbon emissions. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The study focuses on the waste heat recovery and compression heat utilization. By adopting the round-trip efficiency as evaluating indicator, the performances of these systems are compared. The results indicate that the waste heat recovery is beneficial to improve system efficiency. The compression heat can replace the heat of combustion to preheat the compressed air before entering turbines. For advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES) system, it has better system efficiency and smaller capability.

This paper presents the method of support vector machines (SVM) to forecast building energy consumption in China. To improve the reliability of SVM in building energy consumption prediction, multiple parameters including weather data such as yearly mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity and global solar radiation and economic factors such as the ratio of urbanization, gross domestic product, household consumption level and total area of structure are taken as inputs. The performance of SVM with respect to two parameters, c and g, is explored using the k-fold cross validation with grid searching method based on radial-basis function kernel. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is checked by comparing the prediction model with statistic data taken from Chinese National Bureau of Statistics in 30 provinces (including autonomous regions and municipalities) of China using statistical error tests such as the mean square error (MSE) and the squared correlation coefficient (r 2 ). With the analysis based on statistical error tests, the results show that the SVM method can estimate the building energy consumption with good accuracy with MSE less than 1E-3 and r 2 more than 0.991.

The large available surface area of HRB makes rooftop attached PV technique a competent solution to utilize the local renewable energy. In the future, this can be expanded through façade installations. However, to which degree could PV generation support the HRB electricity consumption remains unclear. With more variations coming from renewable energy sources to the grid, peak-load electricity reduction will become critical. In this paper, the peak load shaving potential of rooftop attached PVs in HRB is estimated. Multi-agent system framework is employed to identify the building and occupant characteristics of HRB electricity consumption. A series of comparisons between demand and net demand profiles of HRB in a typical summer week are conducted. The results show that PV could effectively reduce the peak load during daytime, however, the maximum PV generation in the midday may cause new valleys in the net demand profiles. The results suggest that energy storage should be used to optimally match demand and supply in order to smoothen the net demand profiles. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, to prevent the sandy land from southward invading and to protect the city water security, it is of great importance to reasonably explore the groundwater in southern Horqin Sandy Land. Based on the data of groundwater level, precipitation, temperature, population, etc. from 1997 to 2016 in Kangping County, this paper focused on evolution characteristics analysis and genesis analysis of the groundwater level in Kangping County. The results show a significant decrease of groundwater level from 2014 to 2016, with a substantial increase of population in 2015. The PCA (Principal Component Analysis) ordination showed that the groundwater level in the south, middle and north of Kangping county was positively related to each other. The groundwater level had a significantly negative correlation with population and temperature, while a remarkably positive correlation with precipitation. It is calculated that the annual extraction of groundwater by thermal power generation in Kangping County releases about 18,740 t of CO2. As population increases, the groundwater level will continue to decrease, the carbon emissions will increase as well. It is suggested to reduce thermal power generation pattern by developing the abundant local wind and solar energy resources, thus achieving the low-carbon development in water shortage cities.

Nevertheless, the relatively low thermal conductivity of engineering available phase change materials (PCMs) greatly limits the energy efficiency of TES applications. To enhance the phase change process, open-cell metal foam with a porosity of 0.94 and pore density of 15 PPI (pore per inch) was employed to be inserted either in heat transfer fluid (HTF) or in phase change material (PCM). A two-dimensional axis-symmetric problem was numerically solved and was validated through comparing temperature history at selected points. Results demonstrated that the involvement of open-cell metal foam can effectively enhance the phase change heat transfer, greatly reducing the full melting time. By comparing the four cases (without metal foam, inserting metal foam into HTF, PCM and both domains), the case that both HTF and PCM domains were embedded with porous media can provide the best heat transfer enhancement, from which practical applications with thermal engineering may benefit.

The school building has a 33kWp photovoltaic system, the performance of which is compared to other PV systems in the Irish environment. Concurrently, a Zinc Bromine flow battery has been operated under various charge and discharge rate cycles and the overall energy performance of this system has been virtually matched to the output of the PV. The scenarios trialled include 'business as usual' modelling the economic impact of smart grid tariffs versus a flat rate tariff as currently operation with PV in situ; a 'peak shifting' scenario where the battery operation is linked solely to the smart grid tariff rates and ignores PV resource and a 'PV optimisation' scenario where the PV output is considered 'free' energy and as such has priority in storage.

There are plenty of researches focusing on the improvement of forecasting algorithm. However, these algorithms are confronted with the computational burden caused by the complex forecasting verification process, as the traditional accuracy verification process is based on the stable relative error between forecasting data and history data. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a weather concerning load forecasting method combining with factor analysis feedback, tendency analysis feedback and multivariate nonlinear regression analysis algorithms. The proposed method can reduce the computational burden in forecasting. Tendency analysis about load indexes is demonstrated, and the relationship between weather and load indexes are evaluated by factor analysis. The forecasting equations are calculated by multivariate nonlinear regression analysis algorithm. We apply the variable relative error between the forecasting data and history data as the accuracy verification principle in forecasting verification process. The variable relative error can be calculated by the variable accuracy feedback of tendency analysis and factor analysis. Based on the proposed method, a more effective and convenient accuracy verification process is designed. Case studies are conducted to verify the proposed method. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The thermodynamic performances of the system under the design and off-design conditions are investigated. The solar-biomass gasification is divided into two stages, i.e., pyrolysis and gasification in sequence. The mid-temperature solar energy (around 673 K) from parabolic trough collectors is utilized to drive biomass pyrolysis, and the high-temperature solar energy (around 1150 K) from heliostats with point-focus solar collection technology is used to drive the gasification. In the heating period, the gasified syngas as a solar fuel is directly fed into a gas turbine for generating electricity, then a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) is deployed to produce steams for heating. An energy storage module (i.e. gas tank) is introduced to offset heating at night. The primary energy efficiency of the system is 56.1%, while the rate of stored energy to the syngas based chemical energy is up to 35.66%. The energy storage module weakens the influence of time-varying solar irradiations on system performances, and the steady and efficient utilization of solar energy are achieved. In the non-heating period, the gasified syngas can be converted into hydrogen with the water-gas shift reaction. The above results indicate that the proposed system provides a promising complementary utilization approach of multiple energies (solar energy and biomass) in Northern China.

Most mobile devices consume considerable power in the standby mode, during which the capacitive DRAM cells' self-refresh power, which is used to preserve data integrity, accounts for a large part. To address this issue, strategies from both hardware and software perspectives have been proposed, and yet, the existing hardware methods usually have a high cost. Software strategies mainly focus on the operating system page allocation strategy to maximize resource idleness. The partial array self-refresh technique has been proposed to allow for some of the DRAM cells to retain the self-refresh state while shutting down the others. Using this technique, numerous studies extend the unused DRAM idle time by clustering the applications' data but do not discuss the impact of the address mapping mechanism on power consumption. However, this impact was proven to be essential in our previous study. In this paper, we attempt to investigate the impacts of different memory mapping schemes on different clustering strategies using a hierarchy-based memory management system (HBMM) and provide insights for selecting the optimal schemes. The experimental results on the Android platform demonstrate that the schemes and strategies are closely correlated, and memory idle time can be prolonged 125 times with their suitable combination. Conversely, the worst scheme may decrease memory idleness by 12% compared with the original system. Furthermore, our studies on a physical platform show that standby power consumption can be saved by 23% when using HBMM combined with the best clustering strategy. © 2013 IEEE.","DRAM; mapping scheme; operating system; self-refresh power","Cluster analysis; Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Green computing; Hardware; Internet of things; Mapping; Hardware and software; Internet of thing (IOT); Mapping scheme; Memory address mapping; Mobile computing devices; operating system; self-refresh power; Standby power consumption; Dynamic random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058077364

Among them, supercapacitors (SCs) have been widely studied due to their high specific capacitance and power density. However, most flexible SCs often use traditional carbon materials and transition metal oxides as electrode materials. In this paper, we used an easy and low-cost way to fabricate a flexible supercapacitor based on a new type of two-dimensional material, transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides (MXenes). By taking full advantage of the hydrophilicity and metal conductivity of MXene nanosheets, an extremely simple “dipping and drying” method was used to achieve conductive textile electrodes with a specific capacitance of 182.70 F g−1, which is higher than reported for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and active carbon. To further improve the capacitive performance of the MXene-based electrode and avoid the poor oxygen oxidation of MXene, polypyrrole (PPy) was electrochemically deposited on the surface of MXene textiles, thus producing a PPy-MXene coated textile electrode with a specific capacitance of 343.20 F g−1. In addition, a symmetrical solid-state supercapacitor based on MXene-PPy textiles was assembled, which achieved an energy density of 1.30 mW h g−1 (power density = 41.1 mW g−1).

In fact, these devices could be deployed into the system by decoupling energy production from consumption mainly by storing the extra produced energy from RES during the day for eventual usage at night. However, for standalone systems, computing the optimum size of energy production systems and storage devices is required for continuous electricity supply. In this paper, a micro-grid system is modeled, sized, and experimented according to a given consumption profile using a deployed prototype at our EEBLab. © 2018 The Authors.

This system is designed to be maintained at rest until called, thus avoiding idling costs. It utilizes a hydraulic drive train which transmits very high torque directly to the shaft of a synchronous generator, thus enabling rapid acceleration of the rotor. When an under-frequency event occurs, the generator must be accelerated from rest and synchronized to the grid. Here, we show that this is achieved by a ballistic synchronization approach which computes and follows an acceleration trajectory which simultaneously synchronizes both phase and frequency. A two-stage strategy is employed which switches from the ballistic acceleration trajectory to a grid-following mode once the synchronization conditions have been met. Computer simulations indicate that this approach enables very rapid synchronization of a model system to the grid in <1.5 s. We then demonstrate this approach in hardware by implementing the developed control system upon a 100-kW-rated ss-CAES prototype. The dynamic characteristics of the hardware prototype are experimentally determined to obtain and optimize the key control parameters. These values are then used to demonstrate the start-up and synchronization from the rest of the 100 kW generator to a 50 Hz signal in <4 s. Our results prove the feasibility of utilizing distributed standalone synchronous generation units for frequency support in small islanded power grids. © 2013 IEEE.","acceleration control; control systems; Energy storage; generators; hydraulic systems; power generation","Acceleration; Acceleration control; Ballistics; Compressed air energy storage; Computer hardware; Control systems; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Gas generators; Hardware; Hydraulic drives; Hydraulic equipment; Power generation; Synchronization; Synchronous generators; Trajectories; Dynamic characteristics; Generation units; Hardware prototype; Hydraulic energy storage; Hydraulic system; Model system; Prototypes; Under frequencies; Computer control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057415761

Each microgrid includes multiple renewable power suppliers (RPSs), which directly compete with each other to be the sole supplier of the node. The operator needs to specify the energy storage level for each RPS along the backhaul and the wireless service price for the end users. Then, the RPSs will determine their individual energy prices. The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game between the leader (the wireless operator) and multiple followers (RPSs). We will identify the RPSs' unique equilibrium pricing scheme as well as the operator's optimal energy storage and wireless service price decisions. Our analysis also provides the important observation that direct competition between RPSs on the same backhaul node will induce the operator to store more energy and can thus improve the revenues of both the operator and the RPSs. Furthermore, we consider that RPSs along the backhaul may form coalitions to better coordinate their pricing decisions when they sell energy to the wireless operator. Such a study leads to a hybrid two-level game whose the first level is similar to the Stackelberg game for the non-cooperative scenario. We will show that a coalition formation depends crucially on how the wireless traffic will be affected by the energy price reduction due to the coalition formation. In a nutshell, the proposed techniques provide insights for operating a green cellular backhaul by using the distribute energy sources in a decentralized market setting. Finally, simulation results are presented to compare the solutions of the competitive model with those of the cooperative model. We show that forming coalitions between RPSs benefits both the RPSs and the operator. © 2018 IEEE.","cellular backhaul; decentralized system; game theory; Green communications; network economics; renewable energy allocation; smart grids","Costs; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Game theory; Renewable energy resources; Wireless telecommunication systems; cellular backhaul; Decentralized system; Games; Green communications; Green products; Network economics; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Resource management; Smart grid; Wireless communications; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057388571

Use of customers&#x2019; BESSs for DN support lead to a cost (disutility) to customers, since a part of the storage capacity is used for DN support instead of solely benefitting the customer. An optimization problem is formulated to perform a trade-off between the benefits to network operator and disutility to consumers. Control actions, i.e., charge and discharge trajectories of BESSs, are obtained by solving the optimization problem. Hardware in the loop (HIL) simulations of the proposed method, using a real-time digital simulator and a dSPACE controller board, are performed to assess its performance on a low voltage distribution network. HIL simulations show that in the presence of rooftop solar, the method is able to reduce voltage excursions while simultaneously reducing customers&#x2019; cost.

It can improve the performance of a battery bank by creating new batteries that allow for greater storage or by developing a management energy system.

As an electrode material for supercapacitors, the composite electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 550 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the potential range from −1.1 to 0 V, and excellent cycling stability of 89% retention after 2000 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance could be attributed to the abundant exposed active sites, producing high pseudocapacitance, to the two-dimensional nanosheet structure, facilitating electrolyte transport and to the strong attachment strength, improving cycle life. This environmentally-friendly design can provide an alternative to existing methods, resulting in the development of a two-dimensional carbon/metal oxide composite for energy storage devices. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon carbon composites; Electrolytes; Iron oxides; Magnetite; Nanosheets; Sodium alginate; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Supercapacitor; Component selection; Composite electrode; Electrochemical performance; Electrolyte transport; High specific capacitances; Sheet-like structure; Supercapacitor electrodes; Two dimensional nanosheets; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056843908

As the key equipment in the pumped hydro energy storage, it is significant and urgent to improve the performance and operation stability of the pump-turbine. In this study, the effect of runners with and without splitter blade on the performances and inner flow characteristics of a pump-turbine in pump mode was analyzed by the method of numerical calculation. The results suggest that larger tangential velocity at runner outlet and higher pressure at the trailing edge of pressure side in splitter blade runner scheme contribute to higher head.

The proposed model helps the investor evaluate two potential options: aggregating distributed batteries in electric vehicles (EVs) or using a dedicated energy storage system (ESS). For EV aggregations in AS markets, the targeted EV fleet size, which is a function of energy tariff charged by the EV aggregator, is a key planning consideration. In the case of ESS, the physical size is the main planning consideration. Using the proposed model, the two options for maximizing the investor's long-term payoffs are analyzed and compared by assuming the same initial investment cost for both options. Accordingly, the investor's daily bidding strategy in AS markets is optimized for each case. The net present worth is used as the basis for comparing the two investment options, and sensitivity analyses are carried out to study the impact of planning and operation variables on the feasibility of the two options. Simulation results consider both options and discuss the results for providing AS to electricity markets. © 2013 IEEE.","electricity market; energy storage systems; EV aggregators; Power system planning; V2G","Charging (batteries); Commerce; Electric automobiles; Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Investments; Optimization; Planning; Power markets; Sensitivity analysis; Solar cells; Vehicle-to-grid; Ancillary service; Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy storage systems; EV aggregators; Investment Options; Operation variables; Power system planning; Electric power system planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056527484

A coordinated control of PHEVs, PVs, and ESS will support frequency control in a microgrid. However, the size of the ESS depends on the surplus power of PV. The lower the surplus power is, the smaller the size of ESS. Furthermore, the number of available PHEVs vary with the cumulative number of the participating PHEVs. This variation of the number of PHEVs may reduce the PHEVs' control effect in the microgrid. This paper proposes a coordinated control of PHEVs, PVs, and ESSs for frequency control in the microgrid using a centralized model predictive control (CMPC) considering the variation of PHEV numbers. The objectives of the coordinated control are: 1) to suppress the system frequency fluctuation and 2) to minimize the surplus power of PV and, therefore, reduce the size of ESS. Simulation studies indicate that the coordinated control of PHEVs, PVs, and ESSs by the proposed CMPC is superior to that of the proportional integral derivative control and the distributed MPC in terms of minimizing the frequency fluctuation, the PV surplus power, and the ESS size. © 2013 IEEE.","electric vehicle; energy storage; Frequency control; microgrid; model predictive control; photovoltaic","Electric frequency control; Electric inverters; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Gas generators; Model predictive control; Power generation; Predictive control systems; Proportional control systems; Two term control systems; Energy storage systems; Fluctuations; Frequency fluctuation; Frequency regulations; Micro grid; Photovoltaic; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Proportional integral derivative control; Plug-in hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056523582

By removing CO2, biogas can be upgraded to vehicle fuel. Chemical absorption is one of the widely used upgrading technologies, which advantages include high purity and low loss of biomethane. However, chemical absorption usually suffers from the high consumption of thermal energy, which is required by the regeneration of the solvent. Aiming at achieving a more sustainable and efficient biomethane production, this work proposed a novel system, which integrate concentrating photovoltaic/thermal hybrid (C-PV/T) in the upgrading of biogas. Due to the ability to produce electricity and heat simultaneously and efficiently, C-PV/T can provide the demands of both the electricity and heat. By doing dynamic simulation of the energy production of C-PV/T, the technical feasibility of such a system is analyzed. Based on the design to meet the heat demand of solvent regeneration, without energy storage, the produced heat can cover 17% of the heat demand of the solvent regeneration, but 51.1% of the electricity demand; meanwhile, 140.3 MWh excess electricity can be sold for one year. © 2018 The Authors.

To facilitate the application of ice-on-coil storage plates in the latent heat cold storage system and improve the performance, this study developed a detailed three-dimensional CFD model in ANSYS to investigate the ice storage process of the ice-on-coil storage plate with different refrigerant inlet temperatures. The results showed that a lower refrigerant inlet temperature contributes to a higher heat exchange efficiency, a bigger ice thickness in the same period of time, and a shorter time required for ice storage.

Ordinary titanium surfaces are hydrophobic. Recently, 2 different methods of storing titanium in saline solution or treating it with ultraviolet (UV) light were introduced to generate surface hydrophilicity. This study compared biological and physicochemical properties of 2 different hydrophilic titanium surfaces created by these methods. Materials: Acid-etched control, saline-stored, and UV-treated titanium surfaces were assessed by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The attachment, spreading behaviors, mineralization, and gene expression of osteoblasts were examined. Results: Similar microroughness was found on control and UV-treated surfaces, whereas foreign deposits were observed on saline-stored surfaces. Control and UV-treated surfaces consisted of Ti, O, and C, whereas saline-stored surfaces showed Na and Cl in addition to these 3 elements. Atomic percentage of surface carbon was higher in order of control, saline-stored, and UV-treated surfaces. Osteoblasts cultured on saline-stored surfaces showed higher levels of calcium deposition and collagen I expression than control. Osteoblasts on UV-treated surfaces showed significantly increased levels for all parameters related to cell attachment, cell spreading, the expression of adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins, mineralization, and gene expression compared with control, outperforming saline-stored surfaces for most parameters. Conclusion: Despite similar hydrophilicity, saline-stored and UV light-treated surfaces showed substantially different biological effects on osseointegration, associated with different surface chemistry and morphology.

Further development of metro rolling stock equipped with regenerative braking systems with regard to increase in its energy efficiency due to introduction of an on-board energy storage units of capacitance type with account of changes in daily operational condition. Methodology. Three approaches for determination of parameters of on-board capacitive energy storage are suggested based on the results of experimental research studies, and also using the statistical methods of data processing, analysis and probability theory methods. The suggested approaches include successive implementation of the following combined stages: a choice of operation area and a model of metro rolling stock, determination of normal daily operational environment, experimental research on energy power processes during different daily operation of rolling stock, mass-data processing, histograming and determination of on-board capacitive energy storage parameters using the suggested criteria. findings. Energy power processes were registered under normal daily operational conditions of rolling stock equipped with regenerative braking systems on Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska line of PU “Kyiv Metro”. Instantaneous and average energy power and an amount of electric power for each regenerative braking process of a train were measured. According to the results of mass-data processing, probabilistic characteristics are built in the form of histograms of the density distribution of average power and regenerative energy amount within three suggested approaches. Major technical parameters of on-board capacitive storage, i. e. nominal and maximal power, operational and total energy capacity are determined with the aid of the above-mentioned approaches for specified operational conditions of the metro train. Originality. For the first time approaches for determination of parameters of on-board capacitive energy storage for metro train according to the analysis of distribution density of average power and amount of regenerated electricity are proposed.

In this paper, a MoS2/Fe3O4/rGO (0.1 wt%) composite was synthesized by an environmentally-friendly and facile strategy, and showed high potential for recyclability. The nanocomposite exhibited high photocatalytic activity in the presence of H2O2 and rGO (reduced graphene oxide) under visible-light irradiation. Notably, when 3 mg of MoS2/Fe3O4/rGO (0.1 wt%) was added to rhodamine B (RhB, 30 mg L−1) solution, the degradation rate was almost 100% within 40 min at neutral pH under visible-light irradiation. This rate was four times more rapid than that of MoS2 and double that of MoS2/Fe3O4. The results indicate that rGO plays an important role in photocatalysis by suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and enhancing the absorption capability of visible-light and organic dyes. Finally, the photocatalytic and stability mechanisms of MoS2/Fe3O4/rGO (0.1 wt%) are proposed. This work further helps our understanding of the photo-Fenton mechanism. Furthermore, the synthesis of this composite has potential for application in energy storage devices. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Composite films; Degradation; Graphene; Image enhancement; Iron compounds; Irradiation; Layered semiconductors; Light; Molybdenum compounds; Photocatalysis; Photocatalysts; Photodegradation; Wastewater treatment; Absorption capability; Catalyst performance; Degradation rate; High photocatalytic activities; Photogenerated electrons; Reduced graphene oxides; Stability mechanisms; Visible-light irradiation; Sulfur compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056312167

Therefore, there is the need for some forms of thermal storage. The objective of this study is to develop a hybrid mixture of a thermal storage material, which can be employed in medium-temperature-concentrated solar power plants. A concrete-graphite mixture sensible thermal storage material for applications up to 400°C for use with solar collectors was evaluated. Comparisons were made to determine the charging and discharging characteristics, thermal storage capabilities as well as costs between concrete only and a mixture of concrete and graphite. A mixture of expanded graphite and concrete was prepared and tested. The hybrid material exhibited fast charging and slow discharging for the same volume of thermal storage. The hybrid material showed an improved thermal storage capacity in a ratio of 1.625:1 to concrete and thus reduces the space requirements. Also, results from the study revealed that when the costs of space requirements and the costs of using a hybrid material are compared, the hybrid material is expensive and only desirable in cases where there are space limitations. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Remote, data-scarce river systems are under increased hydropower development pressure to meet rising energy demands. The upstream-downstream river continuum, which serves as a conduit for resource exchange across ecosystems, is at risk, potentially endangering the people, environments, and economies that rely on river resources. The Marañón River, one of the final free-flowing headwater connections between the Andes and the Amazon, is the subject of myriad large-scale hydropower proposals. Due to challenging access, environmental data are scarce in the upper Marañón, limiting our ability to do system-wide river basin planning. We capture key processes and transitions in the context of hydropower development. Two hydrologic regimes control the Marañón dry-season flow: in the higher-elevation upper reaches, a substantial baseflow is fed by groundwater recharged from wet season rains, in contrast to the lower reaches where the mainstem discharge is controlled by rain-fed tributaries that receive rain from lowland Amazon moisture systems. Sustainability of the upper corridor's dry-season baseflow appears to be more highly connected to the massive natural storage capacity of extensive wetlands in the puna (alpine grasslands) than with cryospheric water inputs.

Ascorbic acid (AA), benzoic acid (BA), sodium hydrogen sulfite (SHS), BA+ AA and SHS+ AA were identified as effective to keep lotus seeds fresh with the order of SHS+ AA > BA+ AA > AA > SHS > BA in terms of general performance on not-browning degree, microorganism contamination status, sensory evaluation, and the protection of polyphenols against being oxidized. The polyphenols determined by HPLC and HPLC-MS in lotus seeds were mainly gallic, chlorogenic, gentisic, caffeic, cinnamic, p-coumaric, ferulic, rosmarinic, and salicylic acids. Chlorogenic, gentisic, and caffeic acids were the main phenolic acids correlated with oxidative browning. SHS+ AA was found on inhibiting chlorogenic acid oxidized (p < 0.05) as well as SHS or AA did. BA+ AA also had protective effect on all these three phenolics. The increment of gallic, caffeic, chlorogenic, and p-coumaric acids at the beginning of storage, which was from the hydrolyzation of glycosides promoted by BA, had accordance with the deteriorate sensory of lotus seeds and led to worse anti-browning effect. Gallic acid was found to be relevant to the degree of microorganism contamination. The stronger antibacterial capacity antistaling agents had, the later regeneration of gallic acid appeared. In conclusion, the selected antistaling agents had different preservation effectiveness, which would synchronously indicate alteration of relevant phenolic acids profiles of lotus seed during storage. © 2018 Sun-nie Chen, Ru-peng Xie, Jing Li, Ya-wei Fan, Xiao-ru Liu, Bing Zhang and Zeyuan Deng.

In the case of memory shape polymers a supplementary issue is related to their bio-compatibility such as they can be rejected by the organism even their properties are fitting the requirements. Present study started from the hypothesis that mixing the epoxy resin with other polymers some valuable materials could be obtained especially for energy storage. The epoxy resins possess extraordinary properties (relatively to other thermoset polymers) but they also show an excellent stability that generates problems when this type of materials should be neutralized. Epoxy resins also show low water or other liquids absorption due to their low porosity and they cannot be used for energy storage applications when mobility of charge carriers is ensured by liquid phase. A polymer with high porosity used for membrane formation is the polysulfone and, in this regard, tests were performed to analyse the ways to mix an epoxy resin with polysulfone. The idea had generated a study regarding the properties of such a mixture together with the condition that had to be reached to successfully get the mixture.

First, an HESS parameter match method is developed under different driving cycles with optimization objectives of cost and weight. Second, three-level wavelet transform (WT) algorithm is employed to isolate the different frequency components of power demand. The low-frequency components with less transients and sharps in power demand are provided by extending the battery lifetime, while an ultracapacitor satisfies the high-frequency components for its nice features of high specific power. Finally, fuzzy logic control is used to manage power flows between various components for guaranteeing the HESS performance.

In this paper, a type of HESS containing DC-DC converter module, battery pack, and the ultra-capacitor is analyzed. Then, a novel online optimization-based nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) power allocation strategy for the HESS is proposed. By introducing the vehicle velocity, control-oriented engine model, and the electro-mechanical transmission plant model, the electric power demand of the vehicle in the future can be predicted.

The simulation and bench test results show the advantages of the HESS that is able to enhance the overall instantaneous power and prevent the battery from overload. Meanwhile, compared with the results of single battery storage system and the HESS with logic threshold control method, the proposed NMPC-based power allocation strategy can lower the peak power of the battery in the HESS, reduce the average charge and discharge power of the battery pack, and decrease the change in frequency and amplitude of the electric power.

The paper formulates a tri-level optimization problem to model interactions between the operator and the attacker. The upper-level problem represents normal operational actions to hedge against potential attacks and minimize operating costs. Then, the middle-level problem determines the attack strategy, including both attack time and lines to be attacked, to maximize impacts to the grid.

However, too many power supply devices and passive components of compensation networks will make individual-transmitter-type DWPT systems under intense cost pressure for a long charging lane. Besides, circuit parameters of different transmitters will be different due to unignored component errors. Therefore, in this paper, a cost-reducing multiplexing LCC module (MLM) is proposed, and the effects of passive component errors are considered. An MLM makes unenergized transmitter work as a part of LCC compensation network resulting in no additional inductor. Simultaneously, one power inverter is shared by two transmitters in an MLM and 50% of inverters can be reduced. A novel distribution method and matched controlling storage of MLMs are proposed so that any two adjacent transmitters can be controlled independently and simultaneously. Due to passive component errors, unwanted reactive load will be placed on the inverter, and different transmitters will have different output power even in the same coupling and loading condition. A voltage adjustment method and a redistribution of passive components for MLMs are proposed to solve these problems. At last, a 6-kW-level laboratory scale prototype has been constructed and tested. © 2013 IEEE.","Component errors; dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT); individual transmitters; LCC compensation network","Couplings; Electric inverters; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Energy transfer; Errors; Inductance; Inductive power transmission; Receivers (containers); Circuit parameter; Coils; Compensation network; Loading condition; Power supply; Power supply devices; Voltage adjustments; Wireless power transfer; Transmitters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055034106

Considering the different features of heat and power sector, heating units should have different dispatch intervals from power units in each dispatch stage. Therefore, a method considering the extra operation and maintenance costs of frequent adjustment, the operation modes of district heating network (DHN), and the heat storage capacity of buildings is developed to determine the optimal dispatch interval of each unit. The thermal inertia of heat sector is also integrated into the dispatch model to improve wind power consumption.

In recent decades, as the scale of the graph analytics problem has become larger and larger, it has raised many interests to accelerate graph traversing on GPU. However, due to the irregular memory access pattern of BFS, a great number of the memory divergent accesses harm the efficiency of GPU dramatically. Data prefetching can fetch useful data into the on-chip memory in advance to reduce the latency of accessing the off-chip memory. However, traditional prefetching techniques on GPU cannot deal with irregular memory accesses efficiently. By analyzing BFS algorithms for GPU, we find an opportunity to design an efficient prefetching mechanism by using the explicit information of the graph data structure. In this paper, we propose DSAP, a data structure-aware prefetcher on GPU that generates prefetching requests based on the well-defined data structure access pattern of BFS. Also, we introduce an adaptive fine-grain prefetching management to adjust the status of the prefetching granularity dynamically to balance the cache resource contention and data prefetching based on the utilization of the prefetched data. We implement DSAP on a GPGPU-sim simulator and evaluate six data sets from three different kinds of applications. DSAP can achieve a geometrical mean IPC improvement of 28%, up to 48.4%, compared with that of GPU with no prefetching technique, while in contrast, a stride-based global history buffer prefetching mechanism makes no effects on improving BFS performance for these data sets. Also, we use the GPUWattch to estimate the power consumption, and the power increases 8.3% in average and up to 11.8%, but the total energy cost drops 15.1% in average. © 2013 IEEE.","Accelerator architectures; breadth first search; data structure aware; GPGPU computing; irregular memory access; prefetching mechanism","Acceleration; Buffer storage; Computer graphics; Data structures; Graphics processing unit; History; Image coding; Memory architecture; Memory management units; Program processors; Accelerator architectures; Breadth-first search; GPGPU computing; Memory access; Memory management; Prefetching; Structure-aware; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055018433

Several works have reported air-conditioning systems that use solar energy coupled to geothermal renewable energy as a thermal source. In this study, an Absorption Air-Conditioning System (AACS) used sodium hydroxide-water (NaOH-H2O) instead of lithium bromide-water to reduce the cost. Low enthalpy geothermal heat was derived from two shallow wells, 50 and 55 m deep. These wells are of interest due to the thermal recovery (temperature vs. time) of 56.2◦C that was possible at the maximum depth, which can be used for the first stage of the process. These wells were coupled with solar energy as a geothermal energy application for direct uses such as air-conditioning systems. We studied the performance of an absorption cooling system operating with a NaOH-H2O mixture and using a parabolic trough plant coupled with a low enthalpy geothermal heat system as a hybrid heat source, as an alternative process that can help reduce operating costs and carbon dioxide emissions. The numerical heat transfer results showed the maximum convective heat transfer coefficient, as function of fluid velocity, and maximum temperature for a depth higher than 40 m. The results showed that the highest temperatures occur at low fluid velocities of less than or equal to 5.0 m/s. Under these conditions, reaching temperatures between 51.0 and 56.2◦C in the well was possible, which is required of the geothermal energy for the solar energy process. A water stream was used as the working fluid in the parabolic trough collector field. During the evaluation stage, the average experimental storage tank temperature achieved by the parabolic trough plant was 93.8◦C on October 23 and 92.9◦C on October 25, 2017. The numerical simulation used to evaluate the performance of the absorption cycle used a generator temperature of 90◦C, a condenser and absorber temperature at 35◦C, and an evaporator temperature of 10◦C. The Coefficient of Performance was calculated as 0.71 under design conditions. © 2018 by the authors.","Air-conditioning absorption; COP; Energy recovery; NaOH-H2O; Parabolic trough collector; Shallow geothermal source","Absorption cooling; Air conditioning; Carbon dioxide; Cooling systems; Cost reduction; Enthalpy; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Geothermal heating; Global warming; Heat convection; Heat transfer coefficients; Lithium bromide; Operating costs; Sodium hydroxide; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Thermal oil recovery; Water absorption; Carbon dioxide emissions; Coefficient of Performance; Convective heat transfer Coefficient; Energy recovery; Geothermal sources; Numerical heat transfer; Parabolic trough collectors; Storage tank temperature; Geothermal energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054957187

In this research work, we demonstrate a laser scribed super capacitor based on polyimide (PI) substrate for the storage of electrical energy. PI substrate of thickness 200μm and area 1cm × 1cm was reduced by a laser engraver with a 450 nm wavelength in the form of stackable supercapacitor electrodes. Although, PI itself exhibits non-conductive behavior; however, by laser irradiation we change the surface properties of PI and reduce its resistance. The chemical property of irradiated PI was characterized with XRD where the carbon peak was observed at 2θ = 25.44, which confirms the reduction of PI material in to a graphene-like substance. The electrical conductivity was analyzed with a probe station and observed to be 1.6mS. Two conductive regions were assembled into a capacitor device by sandwiching a PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte in between.

The results showed that the overall properties of the bilayer film were better than those of monolayer films, including storage stability. Coatings could significantly (p < 0.05) reduce quality deterioration of SDEs such as water loss, oil exudation, and gritty. The bilayer coating was more effective in inhibiting the increase of egg yolk pH and total bacterial counts than monolayer coatings. After storage for 60 days, water content of bilayer coated SEDs was 19.7% higher than that of the control SDEs, oil exudation was 38% higher, and gritty texture was 27.9% higher. Moreover, bilayer coating could prolong the shelf life of SDEs to more than 60 days at 25°C and 50% relative humidity according to the results of total bacterial count experiment, while the shelf life of control SDEs was less than 45 days.

The formation mechanism and growth stage of PPy on carbon surfaces is investigated and it was discovered that PPy layer thickness, corresponding to nucleation time of the polymer, as the dynamic factor, can influence the pseudocapacitive properties of the obtained composites. The carbon layer acts as both a network to increase the electric conductivity and a buffer agent to reduce volume expansion of Co3O4 during ion insertion/extraction to achieve higher capacitance and better cyclic stability.

To take the full advantage of renewable EH technology, we proposed an energy sustainable paradigm to address energy self-reliance, eco-sustainability, and minimize the networks energy cost while meeting the quality of service requirements. This paper investigates the techno-economic feasibility of integrated renewable energy powered off-grid cellular base stations (BSs) taking into the account of stochastic behavior of RE generation and traffic intensity for remote areas in Bangladesh. Thereafter, a hybrid energy cooperation framework is formulated to optimally determine the quantities of RE exchanged among BSs via physically installed power cables. Under the proposed framework, each BS is equipped with on-site solar module/wind turbine coupled with an independent storage device, whereas collocated BSs are inter-connected through resistive lines. Extensive simulation is carried out for evaluating optimal system architecture, energy yield analysis, and cost assessment in the context of downlink long-term evolution cellular networks varying different system parameters.

New non-volatile memory (NVM) has emerged as a promising candidate to replace SRAM in SPM, due to its significant benefits, such as low-power consumption and high performance. In particular, several representative NVMs, such as PCM, ReRAM, and STT-RAM can build multiple-level cells (MLC) to achieve even higher density. Nevertheless, this triggers off higher energy overhead and longer access latency compared with its single-level cell (SLC) counterpart. To address this issue, this paper first proposes a specific SPM with morphable NVM, in which the memory cell can be dynamically programmed to the MLC mode or SLC mode. Considering the benefits of high-density MLC and low-energy SLC, a simple and novel optimization technique, named theory of thermal expansion and contraction, is presented to minimize the energy consumption and access latency in embedded systems. The basic idea is to dynamically adjust the size configure of SLC/MLC in SPM according to the different workloads of program and allocate the optimal storage medium for each data. Therefore, an integer linear programming formulation is first built to produce an optimal SLC/MLC SPM partition and data allocation. In addition, a corresponding approximation algorithm is proposed to achieve near-optimal results in polynomial time. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed technique can effectively improve the system performance and reduce the energy consumption. © 2013 IEEE.","Data allocation; embedded systems; morphable NVM; scratchpad memory","Approximation algorithms; Electric resistance; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Information management; Linear programming; Memory architecture; Nonvolatile storage; Phase change materials; Phase change memory; Polynomial approximation; Static random access storage; Data allocation; morpable NVM; Non-volatile memory; Random access memory; Resource management; Scratch pad memory; Cache memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054418560

This transformation is a more complex hybrid system, with dispatchable and non-dispatchable resources, and requires novel planning and design tools to ensure the security of supply in the future. This paper presents a methodology that jointly optimizes the capacities and locations of dispatchable and non-dispatchable distributed generating units and battery energy storage system employed in a stand-alone MG serving conventional residential and electric vehicle charging load. The complex dual optimization problem is solved innovatively in two sequential steps. In the first step, the capacities of solar photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, battery energy storage system, and diesel generator are determined without actually considering the system design itself. While in the second step, a novel and simple methodology is developed which determines the sub-optimal capacities of distributed generation units along with their actual locations in the distribution system. To determine the optimal locations of distributed generation units, we defined a novel factor, losses-voltage-factor (LVF), which ensures reduced losses and better voltage quality. The proposed methodology gives a robust design that not only results in reduced losses and better voltage quality but also have higher reliability. The proposed technique is very practical, which can easily be applied for the planning and design of the practical active distribution networks. © 2013 IEEE.","Battery energy storage; Distributed generation; Electrical vehicle; Power system planning; Renewable energy sources","Battery storage; Complex networks; Distributed power generation; Energy storage; Environmental technology; Gas generators; Hybrid systems; Location; Optimization; Planning; Reliability; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Wind turbines; Battery energy storage; Battery energy storage system (BESS); Battery energy storage systems; Distributed generation units; Electrical vehicles; Power system planning; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy technologies; Electric power system planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054384232

However, using these units for resilience is insufficient to justify their installation economically and, therefore, these units are often installed in locations where they yield the greatest economic value during normal operations. Motivated by the recent progress in mobile ES technologies, i.e. ES units can be moved using public transportation routes, this paper proposes to use this spatial flexibility to bridge the gap between the economically optimal locations during normal operations and the locations where extra back-up capacity is necessary during disasters. We propose a two-stage optimization model that optimizes investments in mobile ES units in the first stage and can re-route the installed mobile ES units in the second stage to form dynamic microgrids (MGs) and to avoid the expected load shedding caused by disasters.

Since many mineral processing plants are located in desert regions with high solar radiation levels, companies are looking at solar energy, as a renewable energy source, to supply their energy needs. This work describes two examples of Solar Energy Systems (SES) integration into mineral processing plants. They provide an overview of the current challenges and deliver some lights about opportunities for further developments. The first example describes a hybridization strategy; i.e. a combination of different energy resources, to meet the energy demand of a large water pumping station. The second example illustrates an application where a load shifting strategies is designed to match the cyclic behavior of the energy sources. The main conclusion of this work, is that given the characteristics of solar energy systems and the operation of current mineral processing plants, optimization and control are key enabling techniques to make an efficient use of this renewable energy source. Further work is underway to look at the development of case study for a Chilean mineral processing plants. The application of this approach to other areas such as comminution circuits will be also explored. © 2018","demand side management; energy storage; mineral processing; real-time optimization","Demand side management; Electric utilities; Energy management; Energy storage; Inventory control; Natural resources; Solar energy; Comminution circuits; Inventory management; Mineral processing; Mineral processing plants; Optimization and control; Real-time optimization; Renewable energy source; Water pumping stations; Minerals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054362336

It contains multiple resonant components, which leads to various resonant frequencies.

Besides, a non-ideal isolated transformer is considered, as the parasitic leakage inductor is often ignored for the multi-port resonant converter. A systematic design procedure is proposed to reduce the coupling power between two input ports. It turns out to be instructive for the decoupled power flow management of the multi-element resonant converters.

Carbon/carbonaceous foams (CFs), as important materials widely applied in both military and civil use, are usually made from nonrenewable materials at high temperature (usually over 1000 °C) and high pressure (at MPa magnitude). Although some biomass raw materials have been used, there is still a fascinating issue waiting to be discussed. That is, what kind of biomass would be suitable for making CFs, or what the biggest challenge might be if these raw materials are used. Herein, a CF with advanced compressibility was made from starch with a simple and energy efficient strategy. The product can be made at much lower temperature (below 500 °C) and pressure (∼190 Pa) than conventional strategies. The understanding of the conversion mechanism provides inspiration for the conversion of other biomass into value-added carbonaceous materials. Due to the presence of reactive groups on the surface of the as-prepared CF, the product can be further modified or used as a substrate to prepare composites for catalysis, phase change energy storage, sensors, water purification, and so on.

LbL deposition offers a scalable, inexpensive method to tune the ion transport properties of nanoporous membranes by sequentially dip coating layers of cationic polyethyleneimine and anionic poly(acrylic acid) onto polycarbonate membranes. The cationic and anionic polymers are self-assembled through electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions and are chemically crosslinked to both change the charge distribution and improve the intermolecular integrity of the deposited films. Both the thickness of the deposited coating and the use of chemical cross-linking agents influence charge transport properties significantly. Increased polyelectrolyte thickness increases the selectivity for cationic transport through the membranes while adding polyelectrolyte films decreases the ionic conductivity compared to an uncoated membrane. Once the nanopores are filled, no additional decrease in conductivity is observed with increasing film thickness and, upon cross-linking, a portion of the lost conductivity is recovered. The cross-linking agent also influences the ionic selectivity of the resulting polyelectrolyte membranes. Increased selectivity for cationic transport occurs when using glutaraldehyde as the cross-linking agent, as expected due to the selective cross-linking of primary amines that decreases the net positive charge. Together, these results inform deposition of chemically robust, highly conductive, ion-selective membranes onto inexpensive porous supports for applications ranging from energy storage to water purification. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.",,"Amines; Crosslinking; Deposition; Energy gap; Hydrogen bonds; Ionic conductivity; Ions; Plastic coatings; Polyelectrolytes; Polyethylenes; Transport properties; Chemical cross-linking; Hydrogen bonding interactions; Ion-transport properties; Layer by layer deposition; Polycarbonate membranes; Polyelectrolyte films; Polyelectrolyte layers; Polyelectrolyte membranes; Ion selective membranes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054153536

Although there is still a big potential for further energy efficiency improvements it is time to move further and start preparing the whole energy system for the challenge of oversupply from intermittent renewable energy sources, particularly in the power sector. In 2015 the maximum one-hour power oversupply from wind turbines alone in Denmark happened the 26th of June, peaking at around 900 MW and the oversupply over a 15-hour period was 10 GWh. Known solutions to make use of oversupply in the power sector are power export, energy storage and halting the power generation. The power export needs to rely on sufficient capacity at local interconnectors, power demand in the importing country and there is an economic gain in the export. Energy storages can range from storing of power in batteries, pumped hydro, synthetic fuels to fuel displacing at other energy sectors. The last option is stopping the turbines, which should be avoided. The optimum energy storage would have large capacity, fast charging, high recovery efficiency and low cost. Scoring high on all criteria's can be difficult when focusing on a single energy sector. By widening the perspective and start taking advantages of synergies between the energy sectors there is a possibility to score high on all three criteria's. In this paper the potential of utilizing synergies between the power and heat sectors will be explored by considering the projections for the Danish energy system in 2025. The result of the analysis shows the optimum energy storage of renewable power is achieved through fuel displacement in the heating sector in combination with utility sized heat pumps, electric boilers and large thermal storages. © 2018 The Authors.

Renewable heat sources by their nature are highly fluctuating and require thermal storage and sophisticated control strategies to be utilized efficiently. Static modelling and simulation tools are incapable of capturing the dynamic effects and necessary control strategies that come with such complex systems. The work in this paper will outline how Dymola, a Modelica based simulation tool is capable of handling such complexity. The first section will outline an automated workflow to translate CAD drawings into functioning Dymola models. The next sections will upgrade a small heating network model to a future system with the addition of a large thermal storage tank, solar collectors and prosumers. The last section will demonstrate a concept to achieve lower network operating temperatures by simulating the network with a branch supplied by the return pipeline.

The life cycle of natural gas includes pre-production, extraction, gathering, processing, transmission, storage, distribution - these steps produce significant CO2 and CH4 emissions. Co-firing biomass and natural gas is a step to decrease the rate of fossil fuel use but biomass size reduction for co-firing is an energy intensive process. Using data from published researches on energy consumption for woody biomass size reduction possible GHG emissions in the production of 0.5 mm and 0.1 mm woody biomass particles were calculated to investigate if fossil fuel use in the process of woody biomass fuel preparation for co-firing with natural gas results in overall GHG emission savings. Latvia's grid electricity fixed CO2 emission factor was used in the calculations determining GHG emissions from electricity use. Results show that GHG emissions from woody biomass preparation in both chosen sizes are smaller than GHG emissions from the amount of natural gas that woody biomass particles would substitute however knowing the actual CO2 emissions from electricity would give more accurate results. Results also show that in accordance with Rittinger's law achieving smaller sizes require increasing energy. © 2018 The Authors.

Nowadays it is very urgent to find a suitable method to stabilize polymeric nitrogen at ambient conditions. Herein, we present a new hybrid structure where polymeric nitrogen sheets are sandwiched between graphene sheets in the form of a three-dimensional crystal. According to ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations and phonon spectrum calculations, it is demonstrated that polymeric nitrogen sheets are stable at ambient pressure and temperature. The hybrid material has a higher nitrogen content (the weight ratio of nitrogen is up to 53.84%), and the corresponding energy density is 5.2 kJ g−1. The hybrid material (A7@graphene system) has a satisfactory energy density, detonation velocity and detonation pressure. Importantly, the hybrid material can be preserved up to 450 K, and above this temperature, the polymeric nitrogen sheets break up into polymeric nitrogen chains or nitrogen gases and release tremendous energy. Further calculations reveal that small charge transfer between the polymeric nitrogen sheets and graphene sheets creates a weak electrostatic attraction compared with other hybrid materials, which is just good for the stabilization of the polymeric nitrogen sheets at ambient conditions, and favors energy release in a gentle way. The proposed confinement hybrid material which has a high energy density and a gentle energy release temperature, provides a highly promising method for the capture and application of polymeric nitrogen in a controllable way. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Calculations; Charge transfer; Crystal structure; Detonation; Graphene; Hybrid materials; Molecular dynamics; Nitrogen; Phonons; Ab initio molecular dynamics; Detonation pressure; Detonation velocity; Electrostatic attractions; Energy storage systems; High energy densities; High energy density materials; Three-dimensional crystals; Polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052943300

A unified switching model is established for both charging and discharging processes of EESSs. EESSs are assumed to share a common communication network. Dependent on the communication between EESSs, three distributed energy dispatch algorithms are proposed based on consensus control approach, graph theory and Lyapunov method. Without considering constraints, the first algorithm is designed to determine the charging/discharging power reference of every EESS as the sum of a nominal power value and an SoC-based correction term, where the nominal term and the correction term respectively decrease the supply-demand and the SoC imbalances. By applying a dynamic saturation function to the first algorithm, a second one is constructed satisfying the charging/discharging mode switching constraint and the power limit constraint. On the basis of the second algorithm, a third one is obtained by additionally taking into account the SoC limit. Lyapunov stability analysis shows that the third algorithm not only asymptotically realizes the energy dispatch objective but also satisfies the power and SoC constraints, provided that the communication graph is undirected and connected. Effectiveness of the third algorithm is demonstrated by simulation results. © 2018","consensus control; distributed control; energy dispatch; Energy storage systems","Distributed parameter control systems; Energy storage; Graph algorithms; Graph theory; Lyapunov methods; Charging/discharging; Consensus control; Distributed control; Electrical energy storage systems; energy dispatch; Energy storage systems; Lyapunov stability analysis; Supply-demand balances; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052638110

The design of MEA is made with an aim to reduce the CO2 emission, noise pollution, increased comfort level for the passengers, and so on. In this paper, a detailed study of the evolution of the MEA along with the load profile for electrical load is presented. Based on the requirements of the electrical load, a high-energy-density lithium-ion 'Li iron phosphate' battery is selected, designed, and modeled. The modeling is based on the modified Shepherd curve-fitting model with the addition of the voltage polarization term to have a lower complexity and more proximity with the real battery profile. The phase shifted high power bidirectional dc-dc (PSHPBD) converter is used in the battery energy storage system (BESS) as a battery charger. The modeled Li-ion battery is integrated to the 270-Vdc MEA power distribution bus using the optimal harmonic number-based harmonic model of the PSHPBD converter. Since BESS has to provide the transient loads, the fast dynamic response is required for the PSHPBD converter working as the charger in the BESS. A predicted peak current-based fast response control technique is proposed in this paper for the integration of the BESS with an MEA power system architecture. The proposed control structure provides a maximum limit on the coupled inductor current to the predicted peak current value as well as it gives fast transient response desired in the MEA system. © 2018 IEEE.","battery energy storage system; DC-DC converter; harmonic model; Li-ion battery; More electric aircraft; peak predicted current control; Shepherd model","Aircraft; Battery storage; Charging (batteries); Computer architecture; Curve fitting; DC-DC converters; Electric inverters; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Harmonic analysis; Ions; Iron compounds; Lithium compounds; Noise pollution; Transient analysis; Battery energy storage system (BESS); Battery energy storage systems; Fast dynamic response; Fast transient response; Harmonic model; High energy densities; More electric aircraft; Power system architectures; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052242503

As EDL plays a decisive role in the interfacial physical and chemical characteristics, a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of the EDL structure and its change dynamics is important for a wide range of fields, ranging from electrochemistry, energy storage and semiconductor materials to biotechnology. In this paper, we proposed a proof of concept method for temporal- and spatial-resolved mapping of the EDL structure and its change dynamics. A potential was applied on the interface and the potential induced ion re-arrangement process was monitored by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging in real time. NaCl experiments were repeated six times and the coefficient of variation of the results was 5.17%, confirming the potential-induced SPR response. Experiments with different potential excitations, ion concentrations and species were performed and results indicated that the electron density change and ion re-arrangement contributed comparably to the potential induced SPR response. Additionally, the lateral distribution of the EDL formed at the interface between NaCl solutions and an Au film coated with arrays of 11-MUA spots was mapped. This method is temporally and spatially resolved, and thus has the potential to be a promising tool for EDL studies at heterogeneous interfaces. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Electrolytes; Ions; Mapping; Plasmons; Semiconductor materials; Sodium chloride; Coefficient of variation; Electrical double layers; Heterogeneous interfaces; Lateral distributions; Physical and chemical characteristics; Specific distribution; Surface plasmon resonance imaging; Temporal and spatial; Surface plasmon resonance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052073778

However, converting organic waste into fire bricks could be a useful step towards alternative energy sources. In the present study, fire bricks were prepared using organic waste i.e., cardboard, rice husk, saw dust, cow dung and newspapers. Firstly, the brick manufacturing materials were soaked in water in various ratios and converted into paste with mortar and pestle to make bricks. Secondly, the fire bricks were analyzed for gas emissions, burning time period, flue gas temperature and net efficiency. The results reveal that gas emissions were below the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS). Moreover, the results were also compared with a commonly used fuel wood (Vachellia karroo) to calculate the statistical variations for various parameters. Thus, the net efficiency range of fire bricks was from 39.7 to 58.9%, significantly higher than that of the fuel wood. The flue gas temperature varied from 230 to 430 °C. Therefore, the bricks were found to have high heat intensity, to be easy to use, and to have needed small space for their storage. Additionally, fire bricks are cost-effective compared to fuel wood. It is concluded that high quality and durable fire bricks can be made while using a combination of rice husk and newspapers (RHNP), rice husk and cardboard (RHCB), sawdust and cardboard (SDCB), cow dung and cardboard (CDCB), cow dung and newspapers (CDNP), sawdust and cow dung (SDCD) in a ratio of 2:3. It is due to all these benefits, that fire bricks were considered eco-friendlier in efficiency than fuel wood. © 2018, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Alternative energy; Biomass recycling; Fire bricks; Fuel wood; Waste management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052070779

Additionally, upcoming technologies such as electric vehicles, battery storage systems and energy management systems lead to a change from consumer households to prosumers with a significant different residual load profile. For optimizing the profile of future prosumers, especially the forecast for PV generation is crucial. Whilst traditional weather forecasts are based on a few hundred metering locations in the case of Austria, more than 55000 PV systems are currently connected to the Austrian Power grid. Due to the low areal coverage of common metering locations, weather forecasts do not take local phenomena like shadows from clouds into account. An approach using generation data from neighbouring PV systems together with machine learning methods provides a promising alternative for individual location based intra-hour forecasts. This paper describes the requirements and methods of such a concept and concludes with a first proof of concept. Copyright © 2018 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Power to gas offers a promising pathway for energy storage in existing natural gas infrastructure, if valid regulations are met. To improve interaction between energy supply and storage, a flexible power to gas process is necessary. An innovative multibed methanation concept, based on ceramic honeycomb catalysts combined with polyimide membrane gas upgrading, is presented in this study. Cordierite monoliths are coated with g-Al2O3 and catalytically active nickel, and used in a two-stage methanation process at different operation conditions (p = 6-14 bar, GHSV = 3000-6000 h-1). To fulfill the requirements of the Austrian natural gas network, the product gas must achieve a CH4 content of -96 vol %. Hence, CH4 rich gas from methanation is fed to the subsequent gas upgrading unit, to separate remaining H2 and CO2. In the present study, two different membrane modules were investigated. The results of methanation and gas separation clearly indicate the high potential of the presented process. At preferred operation conditions, target concentration of 96 vol % CH4 can be achieved. © 2018 by the authors.

These thermal machines commonly employ uncovered flat plate solar collectors, and given this, the convection phenomenon is taken into account as well as the effect of the diffuse and reflected solar radiation in addition to the normal beam radiation absorbed by the tilted surface of the collectors. The heat pump cycle is modelled through a first law of thermodynamics approach in order to compute the heat yielded through condensation and the minimum heat required by the volume of water in the thermal storage unit. Consequently, the thermal capacity of the heat pump, the ratio at which the system yields heat to a given load of water, is calculated and discussed. The results of the model proposed are compared with the experimental data provided by three research papers with experiments conducted in different geographic coordinates and test rigs operating during diverse atmospheric conditions. A maximum relative error of 20% was obtained and furthermore, a statistical analysis of the data was conducted having found that there is no significant statistical difference between the analytical and experimental data samples within the 95% confidence interval. Finally, based on the thermal capacity, the performance of the heat pump is evaluated and a multi-objective optimization technique is implemented to obtain the best possible combination of factors to further enhance the performance of the heat pump. © 2018 by the authors.

The microgrids have energy storage units, responsive loads, controllable distributed generation units, and renewable energy resources. They can buy energy from the utility company when the power generation in themselves cannot satisfy the load demand, and sell extra power generation to the utility company. The goal is to optimize the operation schedule of microgrids to minimize the microgrids' payments and the utility company's operation cost. A parallel distributed optimization algorithm based on games theory is developed to solve the optimization problem, in which microgrids only need to send their aggregated purchasing/selling energy to the utility company, thus avoid infringing its privacy.

Solar irradiation is high in summer, in early autumn, and in spring, but during that same time, the heat demand of dwellings is low. This article describes a solution for storing solar heat energy in summertime as well as the calculations of the heat energy balance of such a storage system. The solar heat energy is stored in a thermally insulated water tank and used in the heating period. The heat is also stored in the ground if necessary, using the ground loop of the heat pump if the water tank's temperature rises above a certain threshold. The stored heat energy is used directly for heating if the heat carrier temperature inside the tank is sufficient. If the temperature is too low for direct heating, then the heat pump can be used to extract the stored energy. The calculations are based on the solar irradiation measurements and heating demand data of a sample dwelling. The seasonal storing of solar heat energy can increase the solar heat energy usage and decrease the heat pump working time.

The planning performance of a micro-grid not only affects its security, reliability and economy, but also has a profound influence on the stable operation of large-scale electric power networks with the increasing penetration of micro-grids. Hence, studies related to micro-grid planning program evaluation are of great significance. This paper established a novel multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model combining the best-worst method (BWM), the entropy weighting approach, and grey cumulative prospect theory for optimum selection of micro-grid planning programs. Firstly, an evaluation index system containing 18 sub-criteria was built from the perspectives of economy, electricity supply reliability and environmental protection. Secondly, the weights of sub-criteria were calculated integrating the subjective weights judged by the BWM and the objective weights computed by the entropy weighting method. Then, the cumulative prospect theory (CPT) combined with grey theory was employed to select the optimal micro-grid planning program. The empirical result indicates that the program with 100 kWp photovoltaic power generation unit, 200 kW wind power generation unit and 600 kWh NaS battery energy storage system is the optimal micro-grid planning program. To verify the robustness of obtained result, a sensitivity analysis related to values change of parameters under different risk preferences was conducted, and the result indicates that the selected optimal micro-grid planning program will not be influenced by various risk preferences of decision makers (DMs) and investors. The novel MCDM proposed in this paper is applicable and feasible in the micro-grid planning programs evaluation and selection. © 2018 by the authors.

These uncertainties have to be eliminated by means of upward or downward regulations of conventional generators and charging/ discharging services of energy storage devices. Based on the analysis of the influence of wind power uncertainties on the day-ahead electricity market, this article proposes a robust clearing model for the day-ahead electricity market considering the wind power penetration, which can help to complete the dispatch of power system. Compared with the traditional models, the proposed model is a multi-objective model, which considers both the lowest operating cost and the least wind power curtailment of power system. Moreover, the obtained dual multipliers - corresponding to the power balance constraints reflect the marginal cost of the power production in a certain period, that is, the locational marginal price (LMP), which can be used as the clearing prices. This robust market clearing model takes into consideration the economic and reliability of the system operation and accommodates as much renewable energy as possible. The simulation of three wind power producers was implemented on the IEEE 30-bus test system, which verified the rationality of the proposed approaches. © 2018 by the authors.

However, poor reversibility of electrochemical reactions at the cathode significantly affects the electrochemical properties of nonaqueous Li-O2 batteries, and low charge-discharge efficiency also results in short cycle-life. In this work, functional air cathodes containing mesoporous tungsten carbide nanoparticles for improving the reversibility of positive reactions in Li-O2 cells are designed. Mesoporous tungsten carbides are synthesized with mesoporous carbon nitride as the reactive template and carbon source. And mesoporous tungsten carbides in cathode materials display better electrochemical performance in Li-O2 cells in comparison with mesoporous carbon nitride and hard carbon. Tungsten carbide-1 (WC-1) with larger specific surface area promotes reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2 at the cathode and lower charge overpotential (about 0.93 V) at 100 mA g-1, which allows the Li-O2 cell to run up to 100 cycles. In addition, synergistic interaction between WC-1 and LiI could further decrease the charging overpotentials of Li-O2 cells and improve the charge-discharge performances of the Li-O2 cells.

Due to the lack of enough rotating machines, PV fluctuation might give rise to unacceptable frequency excursions in the microgrid. The VSG entails controlling the voltage-source inverter (VSI) to emulate a virtual inertial and a virtual damping via power injection from/to the ESS. The effect of the VSG on the frequency is investigated. The virtual inertia decreases the maximum frequency deviation (MFD) and the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), but in exchange for raising the virtual inertia, the system is more oscillating. Meanwhile, raising the virtual damping brings reductions in the amplitude of the oscillations of frequency. However, the dynamic frequency support provided by them is lagging behind. In this regard, an improved VSG based on the differential feedforward of the diesel generator set (DGS) output current is proposed to further mitigate the MFD and the RoCoF.

Deep-water conditions were established in the basin and this accommodated a thick succession of variously coarse-grained, conglomeratic and argillaceous sediments. The conglomerates typically display the well-rounded clast material of variable igneous, volcanic, sedimentary and carbonate origin and alternate between being clast-supported and matrix-supported with interbedded sandstone beds. The rounded clasts suggest significant reworking and long-term storage of sediments in the source area before transport into the deeper part of the basin. The basal surface of conglomerates always shows an erosive contact with underlying shales or coarsening-upward sandstone successions. The basal surfaces probably represent sedimentary fairways, where several conglomerate units separated by erosional contacts are stacked on top of each other. The conglomerate successions likely result from episodic release of large quantities of sediments. Between each burst of release, sediments accumulated in alluvial fans, fan deltas and fluvial delta systems along the basin shoreline and carbonate reefs established on the outer shelf. Laterally accreting channel sandstone beds were probably important in setting up sedimentary fairways for the succeeding conglomerates. In the inferred deepest part of the basin, smaller channellised features and thin-bedded turbidites seem to dominate. Channel features and hummocky cross-stratification in shelf to upper slope sandstone beds are alternatively interpreted to result from unidirectional flows and constitute an integral part of the turbidite system. By including all the observed facies within the turbidite system we invoke a depositional model which does not require a eustacy-driven sequence-stratigraphic model for explanation. We rather suggest a tectonic model involving an elevated source area, either volcanic or continental, where erosional products are stored and reworked in the alluvial accommodation zone. These sediments are built up to a threshold level and flushed to the sea by a sudden availability of large amounts of water. The actual cause of this sudden availability of water remains uncertain, but the consequent mixture of water and sediments resulted in a super-concentrated high-energy density current. © the authors.","Back arc basin; Catastrophic floods; Conglomerates; Ordovician; Turbidites","backarc basin; Caledonian orogeny; catastrophic event; conglomerate; density current; deposition; flooding; Ordovician; reworking; sediment transport; succession; turbidite; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051064548

Most important, when the current density increased from 100 to 1000 mA g-1, the capacity retention was about 63% in LIBs and 54% in SIBs. This work may shed light on the engineering of efficient electrodes for multifunctional flexible energy storage device applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anodes; Energy storage; Lithium-ion batteries; Metal ions; Nanowires; Nickel compounds; Anode material; Capacity retention; Cycle stability; Electroactive sites; High reversible capacities; Nanowire arrays; Novel surfaces; Storage performance; Sodium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050954722

However, the performance of Li–S batteries is still far from theoretical prediction because of the inherent insulation of sulfur, shuttling of soluble polysulfides, swelling of cathode volume and the formation of lithium dendrites. Significant efforts have been made to trap polysulfides via physical strategies using carbon based materials, but the interactions between polysulfides and carbon are so weak that the device performance is limited. Chemical strategies provide the relatively complemented routes for improving the batteries’ electrochemical properties by introducing strong interactions between functional groups and lithium polysulfides. Therefore, this review mainly discusses the recent advances in chemical absorption for improving the performance of Li–S batteries by introducing functional groups (oxygen, nitrogen, and boron, etc.) and chemical additives (metal, polymers, etc.) to the carbon structures, and how these foreign guests immobilize the dissolved polysulfides. © 2017 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Additives; Chemical reaction; Functional groups; Lithium polysulfides; Lithium–sulfur batteries",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050771257

One of the most promising fields of smart textiles is in energy storage devices. Recently, many research efforts focus on supercapacitor as an energy storage device that can overlap the gap between conventional batteries and traditional capacitors. Activated carbon fiber (ACF) is one of the important candidate for this application. Different groups of non-woven polyester fabrics were prepared with and without adding the activated carbons. The effect of structure of the samples on the permittivity, dielectric loss as well as the ac-conductivity is investigated and interpreted. The mechanism of the storage of the charge carriers is given by two different capacities. The first one is the capacity of the electric double layer at the interface between the electrode and the dielectric material. The second is the capacity due to the redox or what is called pseudo capacity. In this work, the broadband dielectric spectrometer, BDS, is employed to study the effect of frequency in the range of 1mHz – 10 MHz and sometimes temperature (20 – 60 oC). The non-woven samples prepared with ACF showed the best results among the prepared nonwoven samples without activated carbon fibers and even nonwoven samples with carbon granules. This is due to the good electrical conductivity of activated carbon fiber used in the nonwoven samples. © 2017 National Information and Documentation Centre (NIDOC).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049921448

The solar cells assembled in this work were sensitized with N719 ruthenium dye and insinuated with spiro-OMeTAD as a solid hole transport layer (HTL). Evidently, significant enhancement in cell efficiency was accomplished with Sn2+ ions-substituted ZnO photoelectrodes by maintaining the weight ratio of SnO at 5%. The overall power conversion efficiency was improved from 3.0% for the cell with pure ZnO to 4.3% for the cell with 5% SnO substitution. The improvement in the cell efficiency with Sn2+-substituted ZnO photoelectrodes is attributed to the considerably large surface area of the nanopowders for dye adsorption, efficient charge separation and the suppression of charge recombination provided by SnO. Furthermore, the energy distinction between the conduction band edges of SnO and ZnO implied a type II band alignment. Moreover, the durability as well as the stability of 15 assembled cells were studied to show the outstanding long-term stability of the devices made of Sn2+ ion substituted ZnO, and the PCE of each cell remained stable and ∼96% of its primary value was retained for up to 100 h.

It is well known that this source has very fluctuating and unpredictable characteristics so it is impossible to predict its value for a given moment. This poses many problems for energy system managers in stabilizing electricity production, especially for sites not connected to the electricity grid. The Flywheel energy storage system (FESS) is one of the technologies developed for the storage of wind energy. The flywheel accumulators associated with wind generators are electromechanical storage systems, enabling the storage of energy in kinetic form inside a flywheel, in particular when the wind speed increases. In addition, the accumulators allow the restoration of electrical energy to the grid during the reduction of the wind speed. In this work, we chose a material with a low density and the highest breaking strength possible. We also chose a hollow cylinder as an appropriate geometric shape in order to increase the energy capacity of the FESS and its efficiency. In order to model our structure, first we used the MATLAB software to obtain the expected results. Then we made a comparison between three flywheels of inertia technologies: flywheel of inertia in high-strength carbon fiber (R), in Kevlar and in high-performance glass (R) to check their deformation capacity. Finally, we retained the least deformed and most efficient material to use for our storage machine. © 2018 The Authors.

In order to obtain glossy workpiece surface by EDM, it is necessary to control the electrical discharge energy per pulse to be small appropriately. However, with the conventional pulse generator, the attainment of pulse control is very difficult, especially in the case of machining to the work surface which has large scale of area, because of gap storage capacitance between the electrode and the work surface, even if not so much power supply. With this capacity coupling method, a pulse generator is coupled with a tool electrode by a feeding capacitance, and the electrical discharge energy per pulse can be reduced by decreasing the feeding capacitance. In addition, the influence of the working gap capacitance between tool electrode and work piece can be eliminated, thus the discharge energy can be reduced to realize glossy surface. In this study, the charge and the discharge characteristics of the working gap with this method were investigated when the work surface has large scale of area. It was confirmed that the discharge energy per pulse can be reduced to small enough and the glossy surface was obtained. © 2018 The Authors.

Convectional refrigeration systems use ChloroFluoro Carbons (CFCs) and Hydro-Chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) as heat carrier fluids. The use of such fluids has over the years raised some very serious environmental concerns which has resulted in extensive research into development of novel refrigeration technologies. Thermoelectric Refrigeration (TER) has emerged as a promising refrigeration technology as it comes with far more distinctive advantages over conventional refrigeration systems. The research and development work carried out by different researchers on TER is thoroughly reviewed in this research. Having looked on these refrigeration systems Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC) refrigeration was used in the design of a 20 litre portable automobile refrigerator. In this design a Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) waste heat recovery system was designed to meet all the TEC refrigerator power requirements. Thus an internal combustion engine TEG system designed includes a stainless steel exhaust gas heat exchanger having an interior portion defined by a stainless steel wall and an exterior surface of the stainless steel wall distal to the interior portion. The exhaust gas heat exchanger receives a pressurized exhaust gas stream from the internal combustion engine and extracts thermal energy from the exhaust gas stream. The TEG modules converts thermal energy directly into electrical energy for TEC refrigerator consumption as well as storage for later use. Thus in this design a percentage of exhaust heat that could have otherwise be rejected into the environment is used in the generation of DC power to meet the TEC electrical power requirements making this system an independent system altogether thereby reducing the number of mechanical loads on the vehicle itself. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One important example is the use of robots within storage facilities attending to the mundane tasks of product movement, placement and retrieval at both large and small warehouse facilities. Of particular interest is the downtime of the robot when undergoing a recharge cycle. The time consumed during charging varies according to the battery type and this time may be categorized as being both non-productive and inconvenient especially to small storage facilities, where a minimal amount of robots have been purchased to perform the tasks. Therefore, there is a need for total autonomy of the ISHs and the proposed solution is wireless power transfer (WPT) that can render the charging of mobile robots autonomous by removing the requirement for downtime for charging. In this research, a complete WPT charging system has been developed for dynamic recharging of mobile robotic platforms. The system includes primary power conversion, magnetic coupling methodology, transmitter and receiver overview and describes a new low-cost coreless transmitter technology, which is easily installed and more suitable for the smaller business owner, yet also capable of operation in bulk storage locations.

Biomass is a renewable source of energy that has an important contribution in reducing the use of conventional fuels and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. In this context, an increasing attention is given to the production and use of environmentally friendly biofuels: pellets and briquettes, biogas, biodiesel and bioethanol. Pelleting and briquetting processes have been used for many years to produce densified biomass for fuel applications. Densified biomass fuels such as pellets are preferred as they provide better economic viability for transport, storage and handling. The aim of this review is to examine the main factors that influence the durability of the pellets, (such as: biomass characteristics, moisture content, size reduction, and also the pelleting conditions, including the use of binders, feedstock mixes and operating temperature), because the durability is considered a measure of the quality of the pellets. Pellet durability can also be affected by the storage conditions. The mechanical durability of pellets is the measure of the resistance of densified fuels towards shocks or abrasion in consequence of transport and handling processes. In the paper there are analyzed all the parameters mentioned above for the pellets produced from different types of biomass (cereal residues, wood chips and energy crops), highlighting the influence of each on the process and their sustainability. © 2018 Latvia University of Agriculture.

Foods popular in Latvia are rye bread Kursu and potatoes Vineta. The significant part of this food was diverted to waste due to non-standard, surplus production, bad storage conditions, shelf life limitations and wastes accruing during food consumption by consumers. Food wastes, when disposed in landfills, will degrade easy in aerobic conditions releasing harmful gases, including gaseous nitrogen compounds and carbon dioxide. Also, food wastes disposal in landfills are limited now and expected to be avoided in future according to the respective EU Directive on disposal of easy degradable wastes. Damaged bread and potatoes peels may be utilised in the biogas production process. There is an interest to investigate the effect of usage of additives, e.g. catalyst Metaferm, to enhance the methane production during the anaerobic fermentation process. In previous studies, the addition of catalyst Metaferm caused the improvement of methane extraction from substrates with difficultly biodegradable corn silage and dried grains. Therefore, this study continues to examine the effect of the additive Metaferm on more easily fermentable biomass. To find the methane volume obtainable from bread Kursu and potato Vineta wastes, a study was conducted in 16 bioreactors at the temperature of 38 ºC. The specific methane volume 0.459 l·g-1 DOM or 0.515 l·g-1 DOM were obtained from rye bread Kursu or potatoes Vineta respectively, after 30 days anaerobic digestion (AD) process. The addition of Metaferm increases the methane yield by 5.4 % or 2.3 % from rye bread or potato wastes, respectively. Investigation results show that both food wastes can be utilised in biogas plants for energy production successfully. © 2018 Latvia University of Agriculture.

We apply this scheme to enable simultaneous feeder head active power and voltage magnitude reference tracking, as well as feeder voltage regulation.

However, transmission capacity expansion can significantly reduce or eliminate this source of revenue. Investment decisions by merchant storage operators must, therefore, account for the consequences of potential investments in transmission capacity by central planners. This paper presents a tri-level model to co-optimize merchant electrochemical storage siting and sizing with centralized transmission expansion planning. The upper level takes the merchant storage owner’s perspective and aims to maximize the lifetime profits of the storage, while ensuring a given rate of return on investments. The middle level optimizes centralized decisions about transmission expansion. The lower level simulates market clearing. The proposed model is recast as a bi-level equivalent, which is solved using the column-and-constraint generation technique.

The traditional grid-connected inverter control strategy does not take into account the problem of inertia which is short and fast to cause the frequency change. The virtual synchronous generator control strategy is adopted to simulate the synchronous generator characteristics, which enhanced the inertia and damp of the system. For the micro-grid of wind power grid-connected, the storage battery is arranged on the AC side of the permanent magnet direct-drive wind turbine, and the model of the virtual synchronous generator is established. Thus the grid-connected performance of large-scale wind farm is improved. Here, the effect of moment of inertia in the virtual synchronous generator and the grid-connected regulation of virtual synchronous generator are verified by using PSCAD/EMTDC. The simulation results show that the grid-connected inverter controlled by the virtual synchronous generator is approximately equivalent to the synchronous generator in external characteristic. The grid-connected inverter based virtual synchronous generator control has a beneficial to adjust frequency and voltage, and can enhance the standby inertia of new energy and grid power generation. © 2018 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.","Energy storage; Frequency and voltage regulation; Grid-connected wind power; Inverter; Virtual synchronous generator",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048694849

Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) has attracted increasing attention due to its theoretically high specific capacitance, however, the development of Cu2O-based electrodes with superior capacitive performance is still challenging. We herein report a simple and effective ionic-liquid-assisted sputtering approach to synthesizing the Cu2O nanoparticles/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Cu2O/MWCNTs) nanocomposite for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors. The Cu2O/MWCNTs nanocomposite delivers a high specific capacitance of 357 F g-1, good rate capability and excellent capacitance retention of about 89% after 20000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g-1. The high performance is attributed to the uniform dispersion of small-sized Cu2O nanoparticles on conductive MWCNTs, which offers plenty of redox active sites and thus improve the electron transfer efficiency. Oxygen vacancies are further introduced into Cu2O by the NaBH4 treatment, providing the oxygen-deficient Cu2O/MWCNTs (r-Cu2O/MWCNTs) nanocomposite with significantly improved specific capacitance (790 F g-1) and cycling stability (∼93% after 20 000 cycles). The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor based on the r-Cu2O/MWCNTs//activated carbon (AC) structure achieves a high energy density of 64.2 W h kg-1 at 825.3 W kg-1, and long cycling life.

The LiBH4-20 wt% Fe3O4@rGO composite begins to release hydrogen at 74 °C, which is 250 °C lower than for ball-milled pure LiBH4. Moreover, the composite can release 3.36 wt% hydrogen at 400 °C within 1000 s, which is 2.52 times as high as that of pure LiBH4. Importantly, it can uptake 5.74 wt% hydrogen at 400 °C under 5 MPa H2, and its hydrogen absorption capacity still reaches 3.73 wt% after 5 de/rehydrogenation cycles.

The experiments were conducted in a quiescent condition in a fixed volume crystallizer at 8 MPa and 4°C. The results showed that almost all studied THF and SDS concentrations enhanced the methane hydrate formation kinetics and methane consumption compared to that without the promoters, except 1 mol% THF. Although, with 1 mol% THF, there were no hydrates formed for 48 hours, the addition of just 1 mM SDS surprisingly promoted the hydrate formation with a significant increased in the kinetics.

A key factor of such devices is high-performance electrode materials. In this work, nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene aerogels (N/S-GA) were synthesized using graphene oxide as the precursor and 2-mercapto-1-methylimidazole as both the reducing agent and the N/S doping agent. The pore size distribution of the as-prepared N/S-GA was measured and the N/S-GA possesses a hierarchical porous structure. As an electrode material of supercapacitors, the N/S-GA could provide a suitable structure for charge accommodation and a short distance for ion transport. When 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Emim]BF4) ionic liquid was used as the electrolyte, the specific capacitance of the N/S-GA electrode material reached 212 F g-1 and 162 F g-1 at the current densities of 1 A g-1 and 10 A g-1, respectively. And the energy density and average power density of the N/S-GA based supercapacitor could reach 117 W h kg-1 and 1.0 kW kg-1 at 1 A g-1, 82 W h kg-1 and 9.5 kW kg-1 at 10 A g-1, respectively.

The structural diversity of organic redox compounds helps in tuning the electrochemical properties as compared to the case of their inorganic counterparts. However, the structural diversity makes the design and identification of redox-active organic materials difficult because it is challenging to achieve appropriate redox potential, solubility and stability together, which are the major concerns regarding the practical applicability of these materials to RFBs. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and application of viologen molecules as anolyte materials for organic RFBs that are compatible with Li-ion electrolytes. Structural screening assisted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggests that the (CH2)5CH3-substituted viologen molecule exhibits reduction potential as low as 2.74 V vs. Li/Li+, good structural stability due to effective charge delocalization within the two pyridinium rings, and a solubility of up to 1.3 M in carbonate-based electrolytes. When paired with a 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine-iron complex catholyte, the cell shows a high discharge voltage of 1.3-1.5 V with coulombic efficiency &gt; 98% and energy efficiency &gt; 84%. Both the anolyte and catholyte materials are built from earth-abundant elements and can be produced with high yields; thus, they may represent a promising choice for sustainable electrical energy storage.

The concept is developed on the basis of the creation of parallel-connected synchronous symmetric non-phase semiconductor structures with a reduced accumulation of energy in the output circuits. This approach allows the creation of converters which realize without the use of energy-intensive filters both low level of output voltage ripples and nonoscillatory pulse current change at low multiplicity and a non-current pause during the impulse decrease of the load resistance. Using the structural-analytical transformation and simulation modeling, it was justified that the variety of structural schemes of such multiphase converters can be reduced to an equivalent single-phase scheme that greatly simplifies their modeling, analysis and design of necessary feedback devices, as well as the determination of stability regions and the required dynamics of the entire system. © 2018, Institute of Electrodynamics, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.","Current; Gas discharge installation; Non-phase semiconductor structures; Nonstationary regimes; Pulse; Semiconductor converter; Stabilization; Symmetry; Voltage","Crystal symmetry; Electric currents; Electric potential; Electrodynamics; Electronics engineering; Stabilization; Gas discharge; Multiphase converters; Nonstationary; Output voltage ripple; Parallel-connected; Pulse; Semiconductor structure; Stability regions; Power converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047195823

Currently over 90% of the world's rare earth elements (REEs) are produced in China, leading many other countries to classify REES as critical materials. Recycling is one of the approaches to address the supply risks. Unfortunately, to date, the recycling rate of REPMs has been very low and no industrial scale recovery of REPMs from end of life products exists. As a result, REEs end up either in the landfill or in the smelting slag while other more ""common"" metals are recycled. One explanation for why REPMs have not been retrieved from used products is that it can be time consuming and expensive if the labor cost is high. This paper reports the development of a semi-automatic system for profitably recovering REPMs from hard disk drives to maximize REEs resource efficiency. © 2018 The Authors.

However, using multiple energy sources and providing multiple energy services can lead to complicated studies which require advanced optimization techniques for determining optimal solutions. Furthermore, several parameters can influence the design and performance of a polygeneration system. In this study, the effects of heat load, renewable generation and storage units on the optimal design and performance of a polygeneration system for a hypothetical hospital located in northern Italy are investigated. The polygeneration system shows higher performance compared to the reference system, which is based on the separate generation of heat and power. It reduces fuel consumption by 14-32%, CO2 emissions by 10-29% and annualized total cost by 7-19%, for various studied scenarios. The avoided fuel and electricity purchase of the polygeneration system has a positive impact on the economy. This, together with the environmental and energetic benefits if the renewable generation and use of storage devices, indicate the viability and competitiveness of the system. © 2018 by the authors.

Based on the technology of combined heat and power (CHP), this paper develops a novel operation mechanism with community micro turbine and shared energy storage system (ESS) for energy management of prosumers. In the proposed framework, micro-grid operator (MGO) equipped with micro turbine and ESS provides energy selling business and ESS leasing business for prosumers. Prosumers can make energy trading with public grid and MGO, and ESS will be shared among prosumers when they pay for the rent to MGO. Based on such framework, we adopt a cooperative game for prosumers to determine optimal energy trading strategies from MGO and public grid for the next day. Concretely, a cooperative game model is formulated to search the optimal strategies aiming at minimizing the daily cost of coalition, and then a bilateral Shapley value (BSV) is proposed to solve the allocation problem of coalition's cost among prosumers. To verify the effectiveness of proposed energy management framework, a practical example is conducted with a community energy network containing MGO and 10 residential buildings. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is able to provide financial benefits to all prosumers, while providing peak load leveling for the grid. © 2018 by the authors.

Based on the simulation experiments at various temperatures, the desorption activation energy of methanol and its adsorption enthalpy is calculated and is 53.7 and -86.2 kJ mol-1 K-1, respectively.

To eliminate the contact resistance of the film, we provide a new strategy to fuse the fiber junctions by introducing MoO2 in the fibers, which replaces the C-C interface by a more active C-MoO2-C interface at the fiber junction to promote mass transfer. MoO2 reacts with C matrix to generate Mo2C and form self-fused junctions during the carbonization process. Due to much lower charge transfer and sodium diffusion resistance, the C-Mo2C fiber film with self-fused junctions shows much better cyclability with capacity retention of 90% after 2000 cycles at a constant current density of 1 A g-1. Moreover, the Mo2C particles provide many electrochemically active sites, leading to additional improvement in sodium storage.

The physicochemical properties of MCs are investigated by Raman spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. Results show that MCs derived from moxa floss of different storage years by two facile approaches possess different morphologies: MCs by hydrothermal carbonization (denoted as MC-1, MC-2 and MC-3) exhibit porous nanosheet structures, the highest specific surface area is about 1788.6 m2 g-1, and the largest total pore volumes is around 0.8170 cm3 g-1, while MCs by direct pyrolysis (denoted as MC-4, MC-5 and MC-6) have basically blocky and rod-like morphologies, the highest specific surface area is about 1628.0 m2 g-1, and the largest total pore volume is around 0.7058 cm3 g-1. However, despite the different morphologies, all MCs possess a similar hierarchical porous structure, numerous heteroatom groups and good electrical conductivity. Therefore, these low-cost, biomass-derived porous carbons with promising capacitive performance are used for supercapacitors application with high performance, for example, the as-assembled supercapacitor based on MC-5 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 288.3 F g-1 at 0.25 A g-1, an excellent rate performance of 243.5 F g-1 even at 30 A g-1 with 84.5% capacitance retention of its initial specific capacitance, and an outstanding long-term cycling stability with 98.7% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Furthermore, the maximum energy density for these supercapacitors with an aqueous electrolyte in a two-electrode system is about 10.0 W h kg-1 at a power density of 70.3 W kg-1. Therefore, this work opens up a whole new field for the applications of moxa floss and this novel concept of moxa floss use is an extremely promising strategy for developing high-performance carbons with porous structures and heteroatom-doping from renewable sources. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Capacitance; Carbonization; Electrolytes; Field emission microscopes; Gas adsorption; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Morphology; Porosity; Porous materials; Potassium hydroxide; Pyrolysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Specific surface area; Temperature; Thermochemistry; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Capacitive performance; Electrical conductivity; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Hierarchical porous structures; High specific capacitances; Hydrothermal carbonization; Nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms; Physicochemical property; Supercapacitor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046844187

It was found that, at mole ratios of the PVA- to SA repeat units of 20/1 to 80/1, the DN gels likely evolved a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) morphology of rigid alginate networks dispersed in while interlocking with ductile PVA network to accomplish DN synergy that gave their high strength and toughness, where the high alginate rigidity originated probably from its dense cross-link induced syneresis and dispersion along crosslink-defective voids to result in little internal stress concentration. Tentatively mechanistically, as the 20/1-80/1 DN gels were stretched steadily, their mechanical response was gradually differentiated into distinct synergistic states: the sparsely hydrogen-bonded PVA served as a ductile matrix to bear small fractions of the established stresses at its large elongations; whereas the densely ionically (i.e. Ca2+) cross-linked alginate functioned as a rigid skeleton to sustain the remaining larger stresses upon its smaller local strains.

The Ala-Gln supplementation is a potential treatment for muscle-related diseases and injuries. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the polyphenic effects of Ala-Gln supplementation remain elusive. Here, we performed NMR-based metabolomic profiling to analyze the effects of Ala-Gln, and the free alanine (Ala) and glutamine (Gln) supplementations on the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 injured by glucose and glutamine deprivation. All the three supplementations can promote the differentiation ability of the injured C2C12 cells, while only Ala-Gln supplementation can facilitate the proliferation of the injured cells. Ala-Gln supplementation can partially restore the metabolic profile of C2C12 myoblasts disturbed by glucose and glutamine deprivation, and exhibits more significant effects than Ala and Gln supplementations. Our results suggest that Ala-Gln supplementation can promote MyoD1 protein synthesis, upregulate the muscle ATP-storage phosphocreatine (PCr), maintain TCA cycle anaplerosis, enhance the antioxidant capacity through promoting GSH biosynthesis, and stabilize lipid membranes by suppressing glycerophospholipids metabolism.

In addition, taking a public building in Lhasa as the object, the heating conditions, contribution rate of solar energy, and overall energy-saving capability provided by the heating system are analyzed under different PCM storage tanks and different terminal forms. The results show that an SHS with a PCM tank provides a 34% increase in energy saving capability compared to an ordinary water tank heating system. It is suggested that the design selection parameters of the PCM storage tank should specify a daily heat storage capacity that satisfies 70~80% of the entire heating season.

Three measurement techniques are evaluated: ultrasonic liquid penetration measurement (ULP), contact angle measurement (CA) and scanning absorptiometry (SA). With each of these techniques liquid penetration as well as surface wetting can be measured. A quantitative comparison between the methods is carried out. For our studies we are using model liquids with tuneable surface tension, viscosity and surface energy which are the governing parameters for pore flow according to the Lucas-Washburn equation. Scanning absorptiometry turns out to be an adequate tool for direct measurement for liquid penetration. Ultrasonic liquid penetration showed a stable correlation (R2 = 0.70) to SA and thus also gives a suitable indication on the liquid penetration behaviour. Absorption of individual microliter drops measured in the CA instrument showed different results than the other two measurements. For characterisation of the wetting behaviour the measurement techniques gave substantially different results. We thus conclude that ULP and SA do not capture the wetting behaviour of liquids on paper in the same way as conventional contact angle measurement, it is unclear if their results are meaningful. Finally we are proposing two parameters indicating a combination of liquid penetration and wetting, the slope of the contact angle over time d/dt and a contact angle calculated from SA. These two parameters are moderately correlated, supporting the idea that they are indeed capturing a combination of liquid penetration and wetting. While our investigations are restricted to paper, we believe that the methods investigated here are generally applicable to study liquid absorption in thin porous media like microfluidic paper based analytical devices, thin porous storage media, membranes and the like. Our findings are highlighting the importance to have a match in timescale (time for penetration and wetting) and size scale (liquid amount supplied) between the testing method and the actual use case of the material, when analyzing wetting and penetration on porous materials. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Analytic equipment; Angle measurement; Characterization; Contact angle; Light absorption; Liquids; Materials testing; Porous materials; Testing; Ultrasonics; Direct absorption; Direct measurement; Governing parameters; Liquid penetration; Lucas-Washburn equation; Measurement techniques; Paper-based analytical devices; Quantitative comparison; Wetting; Contact Angle; Light Absorption; Liquids; Materials Testing; Porous Materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045193032

Microalgae potentially offer great opportunities for resolving this challenge. Abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) are involved in regulating many physiological properties and have been widely used in higher plants. To test if phytohormones have an impact on accumulating lipid for microalgae, ABA, JA and SA were used to induce two Chlorella strains in the present study. The results showed 1.0 mg/L ABA, 10 mg/L SA, and 0.5 mg/L JA, led strain C. vulgaris ZF strain to produce a 45%, 42% and 49% lipid content that was 1.8-, 1.7- and 2.0-fold that of controls, respectively. For FACHB 31 (number 31 of the Freshwater Algae Culture Collection at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sci-ences), the addition of 1.0 mg/L ABA, 10 mg/L SA, and 0.5 mg/L, JA produced 33%, 30% and 38% lipid content, which was 1.8-, 1.6- and 2.1-fold that of controls, respectively. As for lipid productivity, 1.0 mg/L ABA increased the lipid productivity of C. vulgaris ZF strain and FACHB-31 by 123% and 44%; 10 mg/L SA enhanced lipid productivity by 100% and 33%; the best elicitor, 0.5 mg/L JA, augmented lipid productivity by 127% and 75% compared to that of controls, respectively.

In this paper, we focus on improving energy efficiency of such processing core by integrating an associative memory where function responses are prestored. Associative memories can search and recall function responses for a subset of input values therefore avoiding the actual function execution on the processing core that leads to energy saving. We propose a novel low-energy Resistive Multi-stage Associative Memory (ReMAM) architecture to significantly reduce energy of a search operation by employing selective row activation and in-advance precharging techniques. ReMAM splits the search operations in a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to a number of shorter searches in consecutive stages. Then, it selectively activates TCAM rows at each stage based on the hits of previous stages, thus enabling energy savings. The proposed in-advance precharging technique mitigates the delay of the sequential TCAM search and limits the number of precharges to two low-cost steps. ReMAM further implements approximation on the selective TCAM blocks to reduce the search energy that relaxes the function output in a fine-grained granularity with very low impact on accuracy of the results. Its multi-stage search operation makes ReMAM applicable to many applications such as search engines, sorting, image coding, pattern recognition, query processing, and machine learning. In this work, we show an application of proposed ReMAM on AMD Southern Island GPUs. Our experimental evaluation shows that ReMAM reduces on average GPGPU energy consumption by 35 percent in the exact mode, and 58 percent in approximate mode with average relative error lower than 10 percent. These energy savings are 1.8× and 1.5 × higher than state-of-the-art associative memories used in GPGPUs in exact and approximate modes. © 2015 IEEE.","approximate computing; Associative memory; GPUs; non-volatile memory; resistive memory; ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Associative processing; Associative storage; Computer graphics; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Graphics processing unit; Image coding; Learning systems; Logic gates; Memory architecture; Pattern recognition; Program processors; Search engines; Approximate computing; Associative memory; GPUs; Non-volatile memory; Resistive memory; Ternary content addressable memory; Ternary content adressable memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044520895

This performance bottleneck is especially acute for embedded image or video applications, that use 2-D FIR processing extensively, because real-time processing and low power consumption are their paramount design objectives. Fortunately, most of such perception-based embedded applications possess so-called 'inherent fault tolerance', meaning slight computing accuracy degradation has a little negative effect on their quality of results, but has significant implication to their throughput, hardware implementation cost, and energy efficiency. This paper develops a novel stochastic-based 2-D FIR filtering architecture that exploits the well-known probabilistic convolution theorem to achieve both low hardware cost and high energy efficiency while achieving very high throughput and computing robustness. Our ASIC synthesis results show that stochastic-based architecture achieves L outputs per cycle with 97 and 81 percent less area-delay-product (ADP), and 77 and 67 percent less power consumption compared with the conventional structure and recently published state-of-the-art architecture, respectively, when the 2-D FIR filter size is 4 × 4, the input block size is L=4, and the image size is 512 × 512. © 2015 IEEE.","Discrete 2-D FIR filtering; probabilistic computing; VLSI architecture","Bandpass filters; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Fault tolerance; Green computing; Hardware; Image processing; Impulse response; Memory architecture; Passive filters; Stochastic systems; Throughput; Conventional structures; FIR filtering; Hardware implementations; High energy efficiency; Low-power consumption; Performance bottlenecks; Probabilistic computing; VLSI architectures; FIR filters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044508354

The immersion experiments were carried out and the corrosion rates were measured using the weight-loss method. Surface morphology of the copper specimen was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The compositions of the corrosive residues were analyzed using an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). It was found that the corrosion rate of copper in an emulsion linearly increases and the kinetics relationship could be deduced as D1 = 2.66 × 10-3t11.68 at room temperature (25 °C). After 1488 h of immersion time, the corrosion products on the copper surface were determined to be Cu2O, CuO, Cu(OH)2, CuCO3 and Cu2(OH)2CuCO3, which also changed the appearance of the emulsion. During adsorption, copper is more likely to coordinate with hydroxide, carboxylate or ester anions to generate copper compounds. The surfactants were consumed and the efficiency of emulsification characteristics was lost and finally, the O/W emulsion separated into two layers, which might hint the significance of introducing an inhibitor to protect the copper surfaces. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carboxylation; Copper; Copper oxides; Corrosion; Emulsification; Emulsions; Metal working; Scanning electron microscopy; Spectrometers; Chemical corrosion; Corrosion products; Emulsification characteristics; Energy dispersive spectrometers; Oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion; Oil-in-water emulsions; Weight loss method; X ray photoelectron spectrometers; Corrosion rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044067520

An increase of 19.47% was observed from 2003 to 2016. The increase in demand would result in an increase in production of waste material from the power plant namely, coal ash. Furthermore, the disposal of these waste materials can be an issue because it can cause a shortage in storage facilities. To address this, there is a need to study on the possibility of reusing these waste materials. A probable use of the waste material is by using it as a construction material for road embankments. In the Philippines some of these structures are constructed on areas exposed to seawater in order to address traffic congestion. This study proposes to use coal ash as the material for road embankment. Triaxial test under consolidated drained condition was performed considering the exposure to seawater. Three conditions were implemented namely, no exposure, immediate exposure and prolonged exposure. Based on the results, 100% fly ash had the highest strength. The hyperbolic model was employed to simulate the material's stress-strain response. The hyperbolic model was chosen since it has the capability of predicting the load-displacement behavior of the waste material under monotonic loading. The Hyperbolic model prediction shows that the material can still handle higher stresses. With this, the ash mixtures tested has a potential to be used as a construction material for a road embankment. © Int.

After harvest, flowers dry and shrink rapidly and become darker. Extending the shelf life of borage will make it more appealing for commercialization and it will enable borage growers to expand their market. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the effect of three post-harvest technologies. Material and methods: Freeze-drying, hot air convective drying and alginate edible coating were applied to borage petals, and the visual appearance, water activity (aw) and weight loss was evaluated. Results: Hot air-dried samples had an unsatisfactory visual appearance. Freeze dried flowers were less shrunken and dried while showing the lowest aw (0.25 ±0.01). Alginate coated flowers had a good visual appearance, like fresh flowers, which was maintained during refrigerated storage (for 5 days), four days longer than those which were uncoated. Nevertheless, the flowers became fragile and it was difficult to handle them without causing damage. Conclusion: Freeze drying may be applied to produce dried borage flowers for infusions, while alginate coating is a promising treatment to increase shelf-life subject to further development. © Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Przyrodniczego w Poznaniu.","Alginate edible coating; Borage; Drying; Quality; storage","Alginate; Drying; Energy storage; Food additives; Harvesting; Image quality; Low temperature drying; Visualization; Borage; Convective drying; Edible coating; Post-harvest technologies; Post-harvest treatments; Refrigerated storages; Visual appearance; Water activity; Coatings; alginic acid; food additive; glucuronic acid; hexuronic acid; Borago; chemistry; color; desiccation; flower; food handling; food preservation; food quality; freeze drying; Alginates; Borago; Color; Desiccation; Flowers; Food Additives; Food Handling; Food Preservation; Food Quality; Freeze Drying; Glucuronic Acid; Hexuronic Acids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042863772

A piezoelectric damping composite could broaden the damping temperature range and enhance the damping loss factor simultaneously by introducing a dissipation route of mechanical to electrical to heat energy. In this paper, a novel piezo-damping polyurethane-based graphene foam (PGF)/PZT/PDMS composite (PGPP) was facilely fabricated using a one-step vacuum-assisted filling method. Using three-dimensional graphene foam as a conductive phase, and due to its three-dimensional network structure, the PGPP composite can reach the percolation threshold with a dramatically reduced amount of RGO sheets. The effects of PZT content and frequency on the damping properties of the PGPP composites were investigated, and the results show that the storage modulus, loss modulus and loss factor of the PGPPs are all greatly enhanced compared to those of the PDMS matrix. Due to their flexibility, the PGPP composites can be used as good surface coating damping materials over a wide temperature range at different frequencies. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.",,"Accident prevention; Ceramic matrix composites; Damping; Fabrication; Graphene; Polyurethanes; Solvents; Damping loss factor; Different frequency; Noise and vibration; Percolation thresholds; Piezoelectric damping; Three dimensional network structure; Three-dimensional graphene; Wide temperature ranges; Foams",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042787467

Firstly we examine the effect of the interfacial chemical coupling on the non-linear behavior, such as the change of the storage moduli, the loss moduli and the loss factor as a function of the strain amplitude. Besides the reinforcing effect contributed by the interfacial chemical interaction, a much smaller loss factor is also observed attributed to less molecular friction and dissipation. Meanwhile, the effects of temperature, frequency, and the interfacial physical interaction between NPs and polymers on the viscoelastic properties are also probed. To uncover the structural and dynamic effect of the interfacial chemical coupling, we calculate the radial distribution function of polymer chains around NPs, the content of the polymer beads in the first layer of the interfacial region under quiescent and dynamic conditions, the incoherent intermediate dynamic structure factor of the polymer beads, which are chemically or physically tethered to the NPs, and all the polymer beads of the system, the quantitative comparison of the mean relaxation time for different interfacial chemical coupling, and the mean-square displacement of the polymer chains. Lastly we analyze the change of the interfacial energy such as the physical and chemical energies during oscillatory shear. Through these analyses, we conclude that with the increase of the interfacial chemical coupling, the change extent of the interfacial physical interaction versus the periodic strain decreases, attributed to a much smaller adsorption-desorption reversible process. This can rationalize the much weaker non-linear behavior or the ""Payne effect"". Based on these results, we anticipate that a better molecular-level understanding is provided on the effect of the interfacial coupling on the viscoelastic properties of PNCs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.",,"Chemical analysis; Distribution functions; Dynamics; Molecular dynamics; Nanocomposites; Polymers; Viscoelasticity; Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations; Dynamic structure factors; Effects of temperature; Mean square displacement; Molecular dynamics simulations; Quantitative comparison; Radial distribution functions; Viscoelastic properties; Shear flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042774538

Electricity consumption in Ukraine is estimated at 120 billion kWh. The main consumers are the population, metallurgy, public utilities and transport (30, 25.13 and 6 percent, respectively). Changes in volumes of consumption can occur due to increased melting of electric steel and the production of electric vehicles. The global trend in generation is the increase in the share of decentralized energy from renewable sources, fuel cells and improved gas engines. A technological breakthrough in the use and transport of electricity is associated with the development of means of accumulation. In recent years, the cost of batteries has decreased and their power has increased. This will lead to their wide application in the utility sphere and energy systems. There will be no need to build peak capacities and pumped storage stations. There are risks in meeting the country's needs for hydrocarbon fuels.

We further improved the mass ratio of the liquefying process and investigated the effects of the high temperature carbonization process at 1000, 1500 and 2000 °C, and comprehensively characterized the morphology, structural properties, and specific surface area of walnut shell-derived CNFs; and their electrochemical performance was also investigated as electrode materials in Li-ion batteries.

A proactive energy management, according to the optimal energy utilization in a look-ahead period with weather prediction, is presented and tested in this research. A multi-input-multi-output linear model of the energy balance of solar greenhouses based on on-line identification system can simulate greenhouse behavior and allow for predictive control. The good time allocation of available solar energy can be achieved by intelligent use of controls, such as store/retrieve fans and ventilation windows, i.e. solar energy to warm up the air or to be stored in the storage elements (wall, soil, etc.) or to be exhausted to outside. The proactive energy management can select an optimal trajectory of air temperature for the forecasted weather period to minimize plants’ thermal ‘cost’ defined by an ‘expert’ in terms of set-points for the specific crop. The selection of temperature trajectory is formulated as a generalized traveling salesman problem (GTSP) with precedence constraints and is solved by a genetic algorithm (GA) in this research. The simulation study showed good potential for energy saving and timely allocation to prevent excessive crop stress. The active control elements in addition to predefining and applying, within energy constraints, optimal climate in the greenhouse, it also reduces the energy deficit, i.e. the working hours of the ‘heater’ in the sustained freezing weather, as well as the ventilation hours, that is, more energy harvest in the warm days. This intelligent solar greenhouse management system is being migrated to the web for serving a ‘customer base’ in the Internet Plus era. The capacity, of the concrete ground CAUA system (CAUA is an abbreviations from both China Agricultural University and Agricultural University of Athens), to implement web ‘updates’ of criteria, open weather data and models, on which control actions are based, is what makes use of Cloud Data for closing the loop of an effective Internet of Things (IoT) system, based on MACQU (MAnagement and Control for QUality) technological platform. © 2018, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

To increase their function on the textile application, in this work, bifunctional microcapsules having both thermal energy storage and antibacterial properties were fabricated. Chitosan was used as surfactant of poly(methyl methacrylate-divinyl benzene) microcapsule encapsulated octadecane (OD) prepared by microsuspension iodine transfer polymerization. The nonspherical with dent microcapsules were prepared in acidic condition without any free polymethyl methacrylate particles nucleated by emulsion polymerization. Due to amino groups in chitosan chains were protonated in which presented positive charge, the microcapsules stabilized with such molecules were then obtained without any coalescence. In addition, percent yield of microcapsules decreased with chitosan concentration in the aqueous medium. It may be due to the high viscosity of the aqueous medium where the monomer droplets are unable to maintain the shape in the early stage of the polymerization. For thermal properties, the latent heats of the encapsulated octadecane (234 J/g-OD) were closed to those (233 J/g-OD) of bulk octadecane. For antibacterial property, 2 millimetres over control sample of the resulting inhibition zones of both S. aureus and E. coli were observed.

However, they are plagued by rapid capacity decay, low coulombic efficiency, a severe shuttle effect and low sulfur loading in cathodes. To address these problems, effective carriers are highly demanded to encapsulate sulfur in order to extend the cycle life. Herein, we introduced a doped-PEDOT:PSS-coated MIL-101/S multi-core–shell structured composite. The unique structure of MIL-101, large specific area and conductive shell ensure high dispersion of sulfur in the composite and minimize the loss of polysulfides to the electrolyte. The doped-PEDOT:PSS-coated sulfur electrodes exhibited an increase in initial capacity and an improvement in rate characteristics. After 192 cycles at the current density of 0.1C, a doped-PEDOT:PSS-coated MIL-101/S electrode maintained a capacity of 606.62 mA h g1, while the MIL-101/S@PEDOT:PSS electrode delivered a capacity of 456.69 mA h g1. The EIS measurement revealed that the surface modification with the conducting polymer provided a lower resistance to the sulfur electrode, which resulted in better electrochemical behaviors in Li–S battery applications. Test results indicate that the MIL-101/S@doped-PEDOT:PSS is a promising host material for the sulfur cathode in the lithium–sulfur battery applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.",,"Cathodes; Electric batteries; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Lithium; Lithium batteries; Plastic coatings; Secondary batteries; Sulfur; Surface treatment; Battery applications; Coulombic efficiency; EIS measurements; Electrochemical behaviors; Energy storage systems; High dispersion; Shell structure; Sulfur electrode; Conducting polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041341962

Several studies have shown that obesity is associated with increased levels of NPY in the hypothalamus. We hypothesized that the release of NPY has coordinated and integrated effects on energy metabolism in different tissues, such as adipocyte tissue, resulting in increased energy storage and decreased energy expenditure. Whether NPY has role in the molecular mechanism of human adipocyte tissue remains unclear. We established the model of human adipose derived stem cells (hADSCs) from human adipose tissue and differentiated it into adipocytes in the presence of NPY at different concentrations (10–15–10–6 mmol/L). We then assessed hADSCs proliferation and differentiation by quantifying lipid accumulation and examining the expression levels of related adipocyte markers after differentiation. Furthermore, the specific markers of white adipocyte tissue (WAT) in hADSCs were also analyzed. The results showed that low doses of NPY stimulated hADSCs proliferation (p &lt; 0.05), while high doses of NPY inhibited hADSCs proliferation (p &lt; 0.05). NPY significantly promoted lipid accumulation and increased the size of lipid droplets during human adipogenic differentiation; the levels of adipocyte markers PPAR-γ and C/EBPα were also increased. At the same time, NPY also increased the levels of WAT markers Cidec and RIP140 after adipocyte differentiation. The results suggested high dose NPY inhibits the proliferation of hADSCs while promotes adipocyte differentiation and increases the expression of WAT markers. This may be the reason why increased levels of NPY can lead to a rise in body weight. © The Japan Endocrine Society.","Adipocyte differentiation; Human adipose-derived stem cells; Neuropeptide Y; White adipose tissue","CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; cell marker; Cidec protein; fat droplet; neuropeptide Y; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; receptor interacting protein 140; unclassified drug; biological marker; CCAAT enhancer binding protein; CEBPA protein, human; CIDEC protein, human; fat droplet; neuropeptide Y; neuropeptide Y receptor; neuropeptide Y2 receptor; neuropeptide Y5 receptor; nuclear protein; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; protein; receptor interacting protein 140; signal transducing adaptor protein; adipocyte; adipose derived stem cell; adipose tissue; Article; cell differentiation; cell isolation; cell proliferation; controlled study; human; human cell; lipid storage; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; stem cell culture; Western blotting; white adipose tissue; abdominal fat; adipogenesis; adult; adult stem cell; agonists; cell culture; elective surgery; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; lipid metabolism; metabolism; obesity; osmolarity; pathology; surgery; Abdominal Fat; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Adipogenesis; Adult; Adult Stem Cells; Biomarkers; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Elective Surgical Procedures; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Humans; Lipid Droplets; Lipid Metabolism; Neuropeptide Y; Nuclear Proteins; Osmolar Concentration; Overweight; PPAR gamma; Proteins; Receptors, Neuropeptide Y",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041337284

However, flying robots at similar scales have not yet demonstrated these characteristics autonomously. Recent advances in mesoscale manufacturing, novel actuation, control, and custom integrated circuit (IC) design have enabled the design of insect-scale flapping wing micro air vehicles (MAVs). However, there remain numerous constraints to component technologies-for example, scalable high-energy density power storage-that limit their functionality. This paper highlights the recent developments in the design of small-scale flapping wing MAVs, specifically discussing the various power and actuation technologies selected at various vehicle scales as well as the control architecture and avionics onboard the vehicle.

It provides a wide range of services, such as improved lighting; energy for small industries, schools, computer and communication service centers, clinics, and entertainment centers; and operations of a range of domestic and light industrial appliances. Nigeria has many dams built for irrigation and water supply, but these may still have the potential for other uses. One such dam is the Doma dam in north central Nigeria. The dam has a live storage of 30 Mm3 and a yearly average inflow of 114 Mm3. This study is a hydrological investigation concerning the possibility of using the dam for power generation. An artificial neural network model, as automated in ALYUDA Forecaster XL, was used to extend the available streamflow record at the dam site. Thereafter, a reservoir yield-capacity analysis was carried out by maximizing the unknown releases subject to storage capacity constraints. The sequent peak algorithm was used to establish the real storage needed to meet the primary demands, including ecological releases and evaporation losses. The results showed that the maximum monthly yield from the reservoir is 6.56 Mm3, while the storage required to satisfy the dam's primary functions is 12.07 Mm3. This means that there is 16.93 Mm3 of monthly excess stored water, or 6.53 m3/s, which can be used for other purposes, such as electricity generation. Considering 50%, 75%, and 100% usage of the excess stored water with a head of 20 m, the power potentials were found to be 0.51 MW, 0.77 MW, and 1.03 MW, respectively. It is expected that providing 2×500 kW Kaplan turbines to operate for 12 hours a day will deliver between 2.0 and 4.0 GWh of energy yearly to the immediate communities in the Doma local government area. © IJTech 2018.","Dam; Hydropower potential; Primary demand; Reservoir yield; Sequent peak",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041129039

To optimize HESS combinations, related indices such as annual cost, fluctuation smoothing ability as well as safety and environmental impact have to be evaluated. The multi-attribute utility method investigated in this paper is aimed to draw an overall conclusion for HESS allocation optimization in microgrid. Building on multi-attribute utility theory, this method has significant advantages in solving the incommensurability and contradiction among multiple attributes. Instead of determining the weights of various attributes subjectively, when adopting the multi-attribute utility method, the characteristics of attributes and the relation among them can be investigated objectively.

We evaluated the utility of the novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist CORT125281 for its potential to overcome adiposity, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia and compared this head-to-head with the classic GR antagonist RU486 (mifepristone). We show that, although RU486 displays cross-reactivity to the progesterone and androgen receptor, CORT125281 selectively inhibits GR transcriptional activity. In a mouse model for diet-induced obesity, rhythmicity of circulating corticosterone levels was disturbed. CORT125281 restored this disturbed rhythmicity, in contrast to RU486, which further inhibited endogenous corticosterone levels and suppressed adrenal weight. Both CORT125281 and RU486 reduced body weight gain and fat mass. In addition, CORT125281, but not RU486, lowered plasma levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids and strongly stimulated triglyceride-derived fatty acid uptake by brown adipose tissue depots. In combination with reduced lipid content in brown adipocytes, this indicates that CORT125281 enhances metabolic activity of brown adipose tissue depots. CORT125281 was also found to increase liver lipid accumulation. Taken together, CORT125281 displayed a wide range of beneficial metabolic activities that are in part distinct from RU486, but clinical utility may be limited due to liver lipid accumulation. This warrants further evaluation of GR antagonists or selective modulators that are not accompanied by liver lipid accumulation while preserving their beneficial metabolic activities.

In this paper, PSU start-up strategies have been studied and a new integrated start-up method has been proposed for the purpose of achieving swift and smooth start-up. A two-phase closed-loop startup strategy, composed of switching Proportion Integration (PI) and Proportion Integration Differentiation (PID) controller is designed, and an integrated optimization scheme is proposed for a synchronous optimization of the parameters in the strategy. To enhance the optimization performance, a novel meta-heuristic called Artificial Sheep Algorithm (ASA) is proposed and applied to solve the optimization task after a sufficient verification with seven popular meta-heuristic algorithms and 13 typical benchmark functions. Simulation model has been built for a China's PSU and comparative experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed integrated method. Results show that the start-up performance could be significantly improved on both indices on overshoot and start-up, and up to 34%-time consumption has been reduced under different working condition. The significant improvements on start-up of PSU is interesting and meaning for further application on real unit. © 2018 by the authors.","Artificial sheep algorithm; Meta-heuristic; Parameter optimization; Pumped storage unit; Start-up strategy","Benchmarking; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Comparative experiments; Integrated optimization; Meta heuristic algorithm; Metaheuristic; Parameter optimization; Proportion integration differentiations; Pumped-storage units; Start-up strategy; Heuristic algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040308606

During the past decade, significant progress in the production of biopolymers based on different cellulosic forms has been achieved. This review highlights the most recent advances and developments in the three main routes for the production of cellulose-based biopolymers, and discusses their scope and applications. The use of cellulose fibers, nanocellulose, and cellulose derivatives as fillers or matrices in biocomposite materials is an efficient biosustainable alternative for the production of high-quality polymer composites and functional polymeric materials. The use of cellulose-derived monomers (glucose and other platform chemicals) in the synthesis of sustainable biopolymers and functional polymeric materials not only provides viable replacements for most petroleum-based polymers but also enables the development of novel polymers and functional polymeric materials. The present review describes the current status of biopolymers based on various forms of cellulose and the scope of their importance and applications. Challenges, promising research trends, and methods for dealing with challenges in exploitation of the promising properties of different forms of cellulose, which are vital for the future of the global polymeric industry, are discussed.

In this study, the temperature distribution was determined using this same absorber to consider the solar conditions of Meknes city (Morocco) during two different chosen days from cold and hot seasons in the city at 12 pm, when the maximum direct normal irradiance (DNI) was reached. The plant considered was adapted from a commercial solar plant in Ait Baha, Morocco. Materials and Methods: Simulation tools were used to carry out this study, indeed, design and simulation of the linear fresnel system for the trapezoidal cavity absorber were done by Tonatiuh. Mathematica 9 program was generated for post processing binary files obtained from Tonatiuh and finally, temperature distribution was simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2a. Results: The proposed plant reached considerable and satisfying values, especially for the day when the DNI was high, thus a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant in Meknes city will be beneficial. It was found that temperature was low in January in comparison with that in July, but it could increase if considering the receiver during the entire duration of sunshine; Indeed, it could attain a high value of up to 650°C on 15 July at 12 pm and reach a low value of 180°C on 30 January, 2016 at the same fixed time.

Battery as a storage medium can take advantage of the price arbitrage between peak and off-peak period under favourable conditions. To investigate the impact of different pricing regimes, summer rate was implemented, and the results were compared with that of winter rate on yearly basis. At base case conditions, neither a prevailing summer nor winter pricing tariff favours the use of battery energy storage. A 0.4656 R/kWh price differential between peak and off-peak period for a summer pricing regime was not sufficient for the battery energy storage system to break even. Implementing a year-round winter pricing regime with a price differential of 2.1171 R/kWh between peak and off-peak period requires a minimum of 866 battery cycle life to break even. Probabilistic analysis using Monte Carlo simulation indicated that to make battery energy storage system attractive, at least 110% increase in the peak price of electricity for summer is needed. The study concluded that the price differential among the different time-of-use tariff regimes impact on the extent of profitability of using battery energy storage. © 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Battery; Cost of electricity; Monte Carlo simulation; Time of use","Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Secondary batteries; Battery; Battery energy storage; Battery energy storage systems; Cost of electricity; Probabilistic analysis; Techno-Economic analysis; Time of use; Time-of-use tariffs; Costs; cost analysis; economic analysis; electronic equipment; energy storage; energy use; Monte Carlo analysis; price determination; residential energy; simulation; smart grid; timescale; electricity; energy budget; methodology; probability; profitability; tariff structure; technical efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039995377

Although multiple devices can be controlled to achieve these objectives during smart grid operation, many proposed algorithms are based on ideal scenarios where the complex distribution system is assumed to be fully observable or measurable. As this condition obstructs many advanced applications, it is necessary to implement novel alternatives that provide support and validation in the field. In this paper, we show that embedded simulation is capable of providing accurate results of the system real-Time condition. The designed platform exploits the technological development of mobile devices, a specific purpose solver, and concurrent processing to embed the power systems simulation into small, flexible, and affordable devices. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy and timeliness of the proposed real-Time simulation based on the IEEE 37 bus test feeder emulation and other large-scale scenarios such as the IEEE 8500 node test feeder.

We use density functional theory calculations to study systematically the effect of the size of Cu clusters on the binding strengths of reactants and reaction intermediates as well as the activation barriers for the elementary reaction steps underlying CO2 hydrogenation. All the elementary reaction barriers exhibit linear scaling relationships with CO and O adsorption energies. Used in microkinetics simulations, we predict that medium-sized Cu19 clusters exhibit the highest CO2 hydrogenation activity which can be ascribed to a moderate CO2 coverage and a low CO2 dissociation barrier. The nanoscale effect is evident from the strong variation of CO and O adsorption energies for clusters with 55 or less Cu atoms. The reactivity of larger clusters and nanoparticles is predicted to depend on surface atoms with low coordination number. Optimum activity is correlated with the bond strength of reaction intermediates determined by the d-band center location of the Cu clusters and the extended surfaces. The presented size-activity relations provide useful insight for the design of better Cu catalysts with maximum mass-specific reactivity for CO2 hydrogenation performance. © 2017 The Authors","CO2 reduction; Copper; DFT calculations; Size effect; Structure sensitivity","Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Copper; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Hydrogenation; Methanol; Nanoparticles; Reaction intermediates; Adsorption energies; CO2 reduction; DFT calculation; Dissociation barrier; Renewable energy storages; Size effects; Specific reactivity; Structure sensitivity; Silicon compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034756585

Twenty-four mid-lactation multiparous Holstein cows were used in a split-plot Latin square design. Cows were allocated to a main plot receiving either a basal diet with soyhulls (SH, n = 12) or a basal diet with whole cottonseed (CS, n = 12) that was fed throughout the experiment. Within each plot a 4 × 4 Latin square arrangement of treatments was used in 4 consecutive 21-d periods. Treatments were (1) control (CON; no supplemental fat), (2) high C16:0 supplement [PA; fatty acid (FA) supplement blend provided ∼80% C16:0], (3) C16:0 and C18:0 supplement (PA+SA; FA supplement blend provided ∼40% C16:0 + ∼40% C18:0), and (4) C16:0 and cis-9 C18:1 supplement (PA+OA; FA supplement blend provided ∼45% C16:0 + ∼35% cis-9 C18:1). Interactions between basal diets and FA treatments were observed for dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield. Among the SH diets, PA and PA+SA increased DMI compared with CON and PA+OA treatments, whereas in the CS diets PA+OA decreased DMI compared with CON. The PA, PA+SA, and PA+OA treatments increased milk yield compared with CON in the SH diets. The CS diets increased milk fat yield compared with the SH diets due to the greater yield of de novo and preformed milk FA. The PA treatment increased milk fat yield compared with CON, PA+SA, and PA+OA due to the greater yield of mixed-source (16-carbon) milk FA. The PA treatment increased 3.5% fat-corrected milk compared with CON and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA and PA+OA. The CS diets increased body weight (BW) change compared with the SH diets. Additionally, PA+OA tended to increase BW change compared with CON and PA and increased it in comparison with PA+SA. The PA and PA+OA treatments increased dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibility compared with PA+SA and tended to increase them compared with CON. The PA+SA treatment reduced 16-carbon, 18-carbon, and total FA digestibility compared with the other treatments. The CS diets increased energy partitioning toward body reserves compared with the SH diets. The PA treatment increased energy partitioning toward milk compared with CON and PA+OA and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA. In contrast, PA+OA increased energy partitioned to body reserves compared with PA and PA+SA and tended to increase it compared with CON. In conclusion, milk yield responses to different combinations of FA were affected by the addition of whole cottonseed in the diet. Among the combinations of C16:0, C18:0, and cis-9 C18:1 evaluated, fat supplements with more C16:0 increased energy output in milk, whereas fat supplements with more cis-9 C18:1 increased energy storage in BW. The combination of C16:0 and C18:0 reduced nutrient digestibility, which most likely explains the lower performance observed compared with other treatments. © 2018 American Dairy Science Association","dairy cow; dietary fatty acid; digestibility; nutrient partitioning","cotton seed oil; oleic acid; palmitic acid; stearic acid; stearic acid derivative; analysis; animal; animal food; animal husbandry; bovine; comparative study; diet; dietary fiber; dietary supplement; digestion; female; lactation; metabolism; milk; physiology; veterinary; Animal Feed; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Cattle; Cottonseed Oil; Diet; Dietary Fiber; Dietary Supplements; Digestion; Female; Lactation; Milk; Oleic Acids; Palmitic Acid; Stearic Acids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034418052

Spores germinate upon sensing specific molecules, such as nutrients. Germination is regulated by specialized mechanisms or structural features of the spore that limit contact with germinants and enzymes that regulate germination. Importantly, germination renders spores more susceptible to inactivating processes such as heat, desiccation, and ultraviolet radiation, to which they are normally refractory. Thus, germination can be intentionally induced through a process called germination-induction and subsequent treatment of these germinated spores with common disinfectants or gentle heat will inactivate them. However, while the principle of germination-induction has been shown effective in the laboratory, this strategy has not yet been fully implemented in real-word scenarios. Here, we briefly review the mechanisms of bacterial spore germination and discuss the evolution of germination-induction as a decontamination strategy. Finally, we examine progress towards implementing germination-induction in three contexts: biodefense, hospital settings and food manufacture. Significance and Impact: This article reviews implementation of germination-induction as part of a decontamination strategy for the cleanup of bacterial spores. To our knowledge this is the first time that germination-induction studies have been reviewed in this context. This article will provide a resource which summarizes the mechanisms of germination in Clostridia and Bacillus species, challenges and successes in germination-induction, and potential areas where this strategy may be implemented.

These systems must constantly monitor patients' physiological signals and provide highly accurate, and quick processing and delivery of the vast amount of data within a limited power and area footprint. These personalized biomedical applications require sampling and processing multiple streams of physiological signals with a varying number of channels and sampling rates. The processing typically consists of feature extraction, data fusion, and classification stages that require a large number of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning (ML) kernels. In response to these requirements, in this paper, a tiny, energyefficient, and domain-specific manycore accelerator referred to as power-efficient nanoclusters (PENC) is proposed to map and execute the kernels of these applications. Simulation results show that the PENC is able to reduce energy consumption by up to 80% and 25% for DSP and ML kernels, respectively, when optimally parallelized. In addition, we fully implemented three compute-intensive personalized biomedical applications, namely, multichannel seizure detection, multiphysiological stress detection, and standalone tongue drive system (sTDS), to evaluate the proposed manycore performance relative to commodity embedded CPU, graphical processing unit (GPU), and fieldprogrammable gate array (FPGA)-based implementations. For these three case studies, the energy consumption and the performance of the proposed PENC manycore, when acting as an accelerator along with an Intel Atom processor as a host, are compared with the existing commercial off-The-shelf generalpurpose, customizable, and programmable embedded platforms, including Intel Atom, Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, and NVIDIA TK1 advanced RISC machine -A15 and K1 GPU system on a chip. For these applications, the PENC manycore is able to significantly improve throughput and energy efficiency by up to 1872× and 276×, respectively. For the most computational intensive application of seizure detection, the PENC manycore is able to achieve a throughput of 15.22 giga-operations-per-second (GOPs), which is a 14× improvement in throughput over custom FPGA solution. For stress detection, the PENC achieves a throughput of 21.36 GOPs and an energy efficiency of 4.23 GOP/J, which is 14.87× and 2.28× better over FPGA implementation, respec-Tively. For the sTDS application, the PENC improves a throughput by 5.45× and an energy efficiency by 2.37× over FPGA implementation. 1063-8210 © 2017 IEEE.","Low-power manycore accelerator; Personalized biomedical applications; Seizure detection; Stress detection; Tongue drive system (tds)","Biomedical signal processing; Cost effectiveness; Data fusion; Digital signal processing; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Graphics processing unit; Learning systems; Medical applications; Monitoring; Patient monitoring; Physiology; Signal processing; Stresses; System-on-chip; Throughput; Biomedical applications; Drive systems; Many-core accelerators; Seizure detection; Stress detection; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031814807

Airborne psychrotrophic bacteria and fungi can cause adverse effects on food quality and consumers’ health safety. The present study aimed to present a facile and cost-effective approach to remove airborne microbes from indoor air by employing silver (Ag) and zinc oxide (ZnO) to decorate fibrous air filters. A water-based anti-germ solution containing Ag/ZnO nanoparticles was first prepared using high-speed homogenization. Second, a commercially available washable non-woven air filter (thickness 50 mm) was coated by aerosol generated from the mixture using spray coating process. This facile method successfully led to homogeneous coating of active nanomaterials on the filter's surface as unveiled by scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). On laboratory scale, the Ag/ZnO air filter was shown to exhibit antibacterial effectiveness against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli under contact mode following an antibacterial standard method (AATCC 147-2011). Finally, the Ag/ZnO filter was assembled into a commercial air filtration system (670 × 820 × 1420 mm) containing two UVA light lamps (365 nm). The Ag/ZnO air-filtration unit was placed in a 45-m3 cold storage room (4–5 °C) for evaluation of airborne psychrotrophic microbial reduction efficiency. The developed Ag/ZnO air filter reduced the airborne psychrotrophic germs concentrations by ∼50% and its efficiency increased to ∼70% when combined with UVA illumination. Based on these results, a simple and low-cost ZnO/Ag air filter was successfully introduced as an effective strategy for removal of psychrotrophic microbes from indoor air. © 2017 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air filtration; Nanoparticles; Psychrotrophic microorganisms; Silver; Zinc oxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028810468

This happens mainly when wind generation exceeds load minus theminimum stable operating point of generation units. At first, the role of generation mix on the curtailed wind energy is analyzed. Then, demand response (DR) applications are modeled to quantify additional reductions in the curtailed wind energy. The uniqueness of this approach is that the impact of the DR rebound effect on the system load shape can be directly reflected. This allows scheduling of DR such that the rebound period (higher demand) aligns itself with high wind output period. This minimizes the need for curtailment. Next, the issue of charging/discharging different large-scale energy storage technologies (e.g., compressed air energy storage, pumped hydro energy storage, and batteries) is addressed. This allows their impact on wind curtailment to be analyzed in detail. Finally, various combinations of energy storage and DR options are considered for investigating their impacts on further reducing wind curtailments.

Fluid-mechanical simulations reveal that the significantly higher mobility of CO2, compared to water, at the temperature/pressure conditions of interest makes CO2 an attractive heat exchange fluid. We show numerically that, compared to conventional water-based and engineered geothermal systems, the proposed approach provides up to factors of 2.9 and 5.0, respectively, higher geothermal heat energy extraction rates.
